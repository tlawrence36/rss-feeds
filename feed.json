      "Hitmaking record producer Richard Perry has died at 82",
      "Richard Perry, a hitmaking record producer with a flair for both standards and contemporary sounds whose many successes included Carly Simon\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain,\u201d Rod Stewart\u2019s \u201cThe Great American Songbook\u201d series and a Ringo Starr album featuring all four Beatles, died Tuesday. He was 82.",
      "Perry, a recipient of a Grammys Trustee Award in 2015, died at a Los Angeles hospital after suffering cardiac arrest, friend Daphna Kastner said.",
      "\u201cHe maximized his time here,\u201d said Kastner, who called him a \u201cfather friend\u201d and said he was godfather to her son. \u201cHe was generous, fun, sweet and made the world a better place. The world is a little less sweeter without him here. But it's a little bit sweeter in heaven.\u201d",
      "Perry was a onetime drummer, oboist and doo-wop singer who proved at home with a wide variety of musical styles, the rare producer to have No. 1 hits on the pop, R&B, dance and country charts. He was on hand for Harry Nilsson\u2019s \u201cWithout You\u201d and The Pointer Sisters' \u201cI\u2019m So Excited,\u201d Tiny Tim\u2019s novelty smash \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d and the Willie Nelson-Julio Iglesias lounge standard \u201cTo All the Girls I\u2019ve Loved Before.\u201d Perry was widely known as a \u201cmusician\u2019s producer,\u201d treating artists like peers rather than vehicles for his own tastes. Singers turned to him whether trying to update their sound (Barbra Streisand), set back the clock (Stewart), revive their career (Fats Domino) or fulfill early promise (Leo Sayer).",
      "\u201cRichard had a knack for matching the right song to the right artist,\u201d Streisand wrote in her 2023 memoir, \u201cMy Name is Barbra.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s life was a story, in part, of famous friends and the right places. He was backstage for 1950s performances by Little Richard and Chuck Berry, sat in the third row at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival during Otis Redding\u2019s memorable set and attended a recording session for the Rolling Stones\u2019 classic \u201cLet It Bleed\u201d album. A given week might find him dining one night with Paul and Linda McCartney, and Mick and Bianca Jagger the next. He dated Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Fonda among others and was briefly married to the actor Rebecca Broussard.",
      "In Stewart's autobiography, \u201cRod,\u201d he would remember Perry's home in West Hollywood as \u201cthe scene of much late-night skulduggery through the 1970s and beyond, and a place you knew you could always fall into at the end of an evening for a full-blown knees-up with drink and music and dancing.\u201d",
      "In the '70s, Perry helped facilitate a near-Beatles reunion.",
      "He had produced a track on Starr\u2019s first solo album, \u201cSentimental Journey,\u201d and grown closer to him through Nilsson and other mutual friends. \u201cRingo,\u201d released in 1973, would prove the drummer was a commercial force in his own right \u2014 with some well-placed names stopping by. The album, featuring contributions from Nilsson, Billy Preston, Steve Cropper, Martha Reeves and all five members of The Band, reached No. 2 on Billboard and sold more than 1 million copies. Hit singles included the chart toppers \u201cPhotograph,\u201d co-written by Starr and George Harrison, and a remake of the 1950s favorite \u201cYou\u2019re Sixteen.\u201d",
      "But for Perry and others, the most memorable track was a non-hit, custom made. John Lennon\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest\u201d was a mock-anthem for the self-effacing drummer that brought three Beatles into the studio just three years after the band\u2019s breakup. Starr was on drums and sang lead, Lennon was on keyboards and backing vocals and longtime Beatles friend Klaus Voormann played bass. They were still working on the song when Harrison\u2019s assistant phoned, asking if the guitarist could join them. Harrison arrived soon after.",
      "\u201cAs I looked around the room, I realized that I was at the very epicenter of the spiritual and musical quest I had dreamed of for so many years,\u201d Perry wrote in his 2021 memoir, \u201cCloud Nine.\u201d \u201cBy the end of each session, a small group of friends had gathered, standing silently along the back wall, just thrilled to be there.\u201d",
      "McCartney was not in town for \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest,\u201d but he did help write and arrange the ballad \u201cSix O\u2019Clock,\u201d featuring the ex-Beatle and Linda McCartney on backing vocals.",
      "Perry had helped make pop history the year before as producer of \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain,\u201d which he would call the nearest he came to a perfect record. Simon\u2019s scathing ballad about an unnamed lover, with Voormann\u2019s bass runs kicking off the song and Jagger joining on the chorus, hit No. 1 in 1972 and began a long-term debate over Simon\u2019s intended target. Perry\u2019s answer would echo Simon\u2019s own belated response.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take this opportunity to give my insider\u2019s scoop,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cThe person that the song is based on is really a composite of several men that Carly dated in the \u201960s and early \u201970s, but primarily, it\u2019s about my good friend, Warren Beatty.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s post-1970s work included such hit singles as The Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cNeutron Dance\u201d and DeBarge\u2019s \u201cRhythm of the Night,\u201d along with albums by Simon, Ray Charles and Art Garfunkel. He had his greatest success with Stewart\u2019s million-selling \u201cThe Great American Songbook\u201d albums, a project made possible by the rock star\u2019s writer\u2019s block and troubled private life. In the early 2000s, Stewart\u2019s marriage to Rachel Hunter had ended and Perry was among those consoling him. With Stewart struggling to come up with original songs, he and Perry agreed that an album of standards might work, including \u201cThe Very Thought of You,\u201d \u201cAngel Eyes\u201d and \u201cWhere or When.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were at a back table in our favorite restaurant as we exchanged ideas and wrote them down on a napkin,\u201d Perry wrote in his memoir. Stewart softly sang the options. \u201cAs I sat there and listened to him sing, it was clear that we both sensed we were on to something,\u201d Perry added.",
      "Perry was a New York City native born into a musical family; his parents, Mark and Sylvia Perry, co-founded Peripole Music, a pioneering manufacturer of instruments for young people. With his family\u2019s help and encouragement, he learned to play drums and oboe and helped form a doo-wop group, the Escorts, that released a handful of singles. A music and theater major at the University of Michigan, he initially dreamed of acting on Broadway. Instead, he made the \u201clife-changing\u201d decision in the mid-1960s to form a production company with a recent acquaintance, Gary Katz, who would go on to work with Steely Dan among others.",
      "By the end of the decade, Perry was an industry star, working on Captain Beefheart\u2019s acclaimed cult album, \u201cSafe As Milk\u201d and the debut recording of Tiny Tim and Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cElla,\u201d featuring the jazz great's interpretations of songs by the Beatles, Smokey Robinson and Randy Newman. In the early 1970s, he would oversee Streisand\u2019s million-selling \u201cStoney End\u201d album, on which the singer turned from the show tunes that made her famous and covered a range of pop and rock music, from the title track, a Laura Nyro composition, to Gordon Lightfoot\u2019s \u201cIf You Could Read My Mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked Richard from the moment we met. He was tall and lanky, with a mop of dark, curly hair and a big smile, which his big heart,\u201d Streisand wrote in her memoir. \u201cAt our first meeting, he arrived laden with songs, and we listened to them together. Whatever hesitation I may have felt about our collaboration soon vanished and I thought, \u2018This could be fun, and musically liberating.\u2019\u201d",

      "The conclusion of a criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer may clear the way for a related civil lawsuit by relatives of the deceased woman and efforts to depose the actor under oath",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The conclusion of a criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer clears the way for a related civil lawsuit by relatives of the deceased woman and efforts to depose the actor under oath, attorneys for plaintiffs in the civil suit said Tuesday.",
      "At a news conference in Los Angeles, victims\u2019 rights attorney Gloria Allred said that the parents and younger sister of deceased cinematographer Halyna Hutchins were disappointed that prosecutors won't appeal the dismissal of an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin. The criminal charge against Baldwin was dismissed halfway through trial in July on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during a rehearsal in the movie \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Baldwin, the lead actor and coproducer, was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when it discharged, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the revolver fired.",
      "Allred said Hutchins' relatives are determined to pursue damages and compensation from Baldwin and \u201cRust\u201d producers in New Mexico civil court, and want Baldwin to answer questions under oath in the proceedings. Hutchins' widower and son previously reached a separate legal settlement.",
      "\u201cWith the withdrawal that was made public yesterday, we are now able to proceed with our civil case,\u201d Allred said. \u201cClearly, the rights of Alec Baldwin were protected, but the due process rights of the victims \u2014 Halyna Hutchins and her parents and her sister \u2014 were violated.\u201d",
      "Allred said she's ready to prove that Hutchins had a close relationship with her parents and sister \u2014 a prerequisite for seeking civil damages.",
      "In November court filings in the civil lawsuit, Baldwin denied allegations that he was negligent or at fault in the shooting of Hutchins and sought to suspend the case. Attorneys for Baldwin could not immediately be reached Tuesday.",
      "Allred read a statement from Hutchins' sister, Svetlana Zemko, that said, \u201cMr. Baldwin must be held accountable.\u201d",
      "In April, a judge sentenced movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed to the maximum of 1 1/2 years at a state penitentiary on an involuntary manslaughter conviction in Hutchins\u2019 death.",
      "Allred condemned New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez for declining to appeal the dismissal of the criminal charge against Baldwin, calling him \u201cthe Grinch who stole Christmas\" at the Christmas Eve news conference.",
      "Torrez spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez defended the decision in an email, citing \u201csignificant procedural irregularities\u201d identified by the judge in the criminal case.",
      "\"Attorney General Torrez will not prolong the grief and anguish of Ms. Hutchins' family in the vain attempt to salvage the compromised criminal case against Mr. Baldwin,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThere are other victims\u2019 families in Santa Fe County and across New Mexico who are awaiting justice, and our energy needs to be devoted to supporting those cases on appeal.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 10:34:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Angel Blue, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera&rsquo;s first new production of Verdi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Aida&rdquo; in 36 years",
    "story": [
      "Angel Blue, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s first new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 36 years",
      "If she has the voice of an angel, and the face of an angel, she must be an Angel.",
      "Angel Blue, that is.",
      "The American soprano, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s first new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 36 years. Blue, now 40, debuted at the Met in 2017 as Mimi in Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boheme\u201d and has become a fixture at the house, starring in two opening nights and this fall portraying the lead character in Osvaldo Golijov\u2019s \u201cAinadamar.\u201d",
      "But \u201cAida\u201d is something else. The title role of the enslaved Ethiopian princess torn between love for an Egyptian warrior and loyalty to her country represents the pinnacle of Verdi\u2019s mature vocal style. It demands power, flexibility and the ability to spin out long phrases, while conveying the dramatic intensity of the character\u2019s emotional turmoil.",
      "It also comes weighted with history, especially for a Black soprano at the Met, where Leontyne Price embodied the role from her first performance in 1961 until her retirement in 1985.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the next Leontyne Price, but I\u2019ve definitely looked at her my whole life as an example of someone to model myself after,\u201d Blue said in an interview after a day of rehearsal.",
      "\u201cSometimes in opera there\u2019s an intimidation factor because of those who come before us,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when it\u2019s somebody who I look up to, I feel like, OK it\u2019s my turn. Thank you so much, it\u2019s because of you I\u2019m here.\u201d",
      "Blue\u2019s turn comes on New Year\u2019s Eve, when Michael Mayer\u2019s production opens before a sold-out house with a cast that includes tenor Piotr Beczala as her lover, Radames, mezzo Judit Kutasi as her rival, Amneris, and baritone Quinn Kelsey as her father, Amonasro. Met music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin conducts. The Jan. 25 matinee will be broadcast live in HD to movie theaters worldwide.",
      "Blue was less than a year old when Price made her Met farewell, so she never got to hear her live in opera. But her father, a classically trained gospel singer and pastor, loved her recordings and \u2014 according to family lore \u2014 pronounced shortly after Blue was born that she would be \u201cthe next Leontyne Price.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy beautiful dad, he was just enamored of her,\u201d Blue said. \u201cIt was like a thought that came into his heart when I took my first breath.\u201d",
      "Growing up as one of five children in Southern California, Blue sang in church, studied voice and piano in high school, then entered several beauty pageants and used her prize money to help pay for her musical studies. She had been bitten by the opera bug at age 4 when her father took her to see a concert performance of Puccini\u2019s \u201cTurandot\u201d while the family was visiting relatives in Cleveland.",
      "Though she had sung \u201cAida\u201d once in concert in Detroit, her only previous staged performances came last year at London\u2019s Royal Opera House. The critics were impressed, though some felt she was still mastering the role.",
      "\u201cSometimes Blue\u2019s tone frays under pressure,\u201d wrote Neil Fisher in The Times. But he added that she is \u201ca heartfelt, affecting Aida \u2026 riding high in ensembles. This gutsy Aida will grow in authority.\u201d",
      "Mark Elder, who conducted Blue in London, recalled that \u201cwhen she came to me, she wasn\u2019t very experienced in the part, and I was incredibly impressed with how she would quietly go on with studying it and thinking about it and taking on board some of the ideas that I gave her.",
      "\u201cTo express everything the music demands of her is by far the hardest thing that she\u2019s probably ever had to do,\u201d Elder said. \u201cBy the time she did the first performance with me it was clear she was very suited to the role. She will sing it for years to come.\u201d",
      "Mayer said that during the Met rehearsals he was struck by how naturally Blue was able to capture the character\u2019s inner conflicts as she is torn between love for her Egyptian captor and duty to her homeland and her father.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about working with Angel is that she is utterly sympathetic,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cShe does the thing that great actors do: She has the thought, and we see it. She\u2019s not doing any histrionic indicating of feelings, she\u2019s trusting that Verdi knew what he was doing in terms of how the music is telling its own story.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a gentle soul, but then she opens up and you hear this magnificent voice,\u201d Mayer said.",
      "Opening night of the Met production will be a poignant occasion for Blue because New Year\u2019s Eve marks the 18th anniversary of her father\u2019s death. Her mother and brother will be in the audience cheering her on, and the rest of her family will come to a later performance. She\u2019s determined not to disappoint them.",
      "\u201cI feel like a boxer at the side of the ring, and I have these gloves on that say \u2018AIDA,\u2019\u201d Blue said. \u201cPeople are giving me water, patting me down and saying, \u2018Angel, you\u2019ve got this. You can do it!\u2019\u2019\u201d"

      "Of all the movie protagonists you might have seen this year, none is quite like Marianne Jean-Baptiste\u2019s Pansy in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths.\u201d",
      "Pansy, a middle-aged woman in contemporary London, is foul-tempered from beginning to end. She spends her days in evident pain that she unleashes upon all those around her, including her husband Curtley (David Webber), her 20-something son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) and most anyone else she encounters. Her venom might fall on a supermarket cashier or a furniture-shopping couple who dare to put their feet up on an ottoman. Heaven help the man who wants her parking spot.",
      "For everyone, Pansy is a test. She tests the patience and empathy of her family, just as she does the viewer. She\u2019s not an antihero, she\u2019s anti-everything.",
      "\u201cThe world is full of Pansys. People live with other people\u2019s conditions,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cOften I\u2019ve met people who have just been enraged, because you didn\u2019t see them in the car park pulling into the space. You go: It can\u2019t just be about me. How did you get that angry about something so stupid? You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through or how they got there.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard Truths,\u201d which will open nationwide in theaters Jan. 10, never supplies any answers. Instead, it unfolds as a cantankerous character study, led by Jean-Baptiste\u2019s compellingly prickly Pansy.",
      "The performance has earned Jean-Baptiste her best reviews since her last film with Leigh: \u201cSecrets & Lies,\u201d nearly 30 years ago. For that film, Jean-Baptiste became the first Black British actress nominated for an Academy Award. Her performance in \u201cHard Truths\u201d has been just as celebrated, earning best actress from both the New York Film Critics Circle and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Three decades later, Jean-Baptiste could be heading back to the Oscars.",
      "\u201cYou sit down with Marianne a hundred years later from \u2018Secrets and Lies,\u2019 in which she played a very intelligent young woman, and Marianne has now moved on in life,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cWe love each other because she\u2019s very, very funny. So sitting down with her ability to be real and profound but also grotesque, that, alone, points me in the direction of possibility.\u201d",
      "Making a film with Leigh, the 81-year-old humanist master of \u201cNaked,\u201d \u201cVera Drake\u201d and \u201cMr. Turner,\u201d isn\u2019t a typical process. There\u2019s no script to begin with, just an invitation.",
      "\u201cIt was the usual: Let\u2019s do a film,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cDon\u2019t know anything, but let\u2019s do it.\u201d",
      "Leigh pulls his characters and storyline out of months of rehearsal. In the case of \u201cHard Truths,\u201d they rehearsed for three months \u2014 somewhat short for Leigh (it was six months for \u201cSecrets & Lies\u201d), but extremely lengthy for today\u2019s movie industry.",
      "\u201cNormally you get on set it\u2019s like, \u2018Uh, this is Ralph. He\u2019ll be playing your husband. You\u2019ll stand over there,\u2019\u201d says Jean-Baptiste.",
      "In Leigh\u2019s manner of rehearsal, they begin with a character\u2019s first memory, and then flesh out their life all the way up until the time period of the film. But there are parallel histories for other characters that require constantly going back through and recontextualizing. Meanwhile, costume designers and production designers await clarity on what kind of clothes and homes they should craft.",
      "\u201cAll the decisions about the character that you can make, the actor makes them,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cAny of the decisions that God makes for somebody\u2019s life, he makes them. So it\u2019s like: She wants this job, so she applies. A letter arrives in the mail: Unfortunately you did not get it.\u201d",
      "Jean-Baptiste was a recent drama school graduate, classically trained and oriented toward theater, when she co-starred in 1996\u2019s \u201cSecrets & Lies.\u201d It was her breakthrough. A few years after that film, she moved to Los Angeles, where she\u2019s been since, acting in a wide variety of projects including the TV series \u201cWithout a Trace,\u201d \u201cBlindspot\u201d and \u201cHomecoming.\u201d Asked if her collaboration with Leigh had changed from \u201cSecrets & Lies,\u201d Jean-Baptiste said much was the same.",
      "\u201cObviously we\u2019re a lot older,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cI think we just slipped right back into it. He was gentler.\u201d",
      "Part of what makes Jean-Baptiste\u2019s performance as Pansy so uncanny is how unlike Pansy she is. Jean-Baptiste is charismatic, laughs frequently and enjoys throwing herself into uncertain circumstances (like \u201cHard Truths\u201d). Asked if she has anything in common with Pansy, she replies, with a laugh, \u201cI hope not.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have a sense of humor she doesn\u2019t, although she\u2019s really funny,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI think I recognize that part of myself to the extent that I\u2019m like: That\u2019s not how I want to live. That\u2019s not how I want to be.\u201d",
      "But in Pansy, Jean-Baptiste recognized people she knows, and the kind of character that seldom makes it onto movie screens. \u201cA difficult Black woman, you don\u2019t see that,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever have.\u201d",
      "In \u201cHard Truths,\u201d the root of Pansy's depression is uncertain, but a sense of festering wounds from the past is palpable. When she speaks to a doctor, she sums it up: \u201cThe heart of the matter is me head.\u201d Later, when asked why she can\u2019t enjoy life, she replies, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jean-Baptiste, in mapping out Pansy\u2019s history, has some theories about what\u2019s made her this way.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 John Mulaney's second trip to Broadway took little convincing. He didn't even need to look at the script before signing on.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, well, send it to me. I\u2019ll read it.\u2019 And they sent it to me. I didn\u2019t read it. I just agreed immediately,\u201d the actor-comedian says.",
      "What Mulaney signed up for was \u201cAll In: Comedy About Love,\u201d a stage adaptation of his friend Simon Rich's short stories that's charming Broadway audiences this winter with a starry cast.",
      "Joining Mulaney \u2014 who made his Broadway debut in 2016 with \u201cOh, Hello\u201d \u2014 is Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry, Richard Kind and Fred Armisen. They'll eventually be replaced by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jimmy Fallon, Aidy Bryant, Nick Kroll, Tim Meadows, Chloe Fineman, Andrew Rannells, David Cross, Annaleigh Ashford and Hank Azaria.",
      "\u201cAll In\u201d opens with the surreal story of a guy who walks into a bar that has a 12-inch piano player and then goes on to feature personal ads from dogs \u2014 \u201cFull disclosure: I'm neutered but no complaints yet,\u201d reads one \u2014 a love triangle involving The Elephant Man, an aging talent agent confronting Death and a history report from the 2070s.",
      "\u201cThese are such meticulously, beautifully written pieces,\u201d says Mulaney, who befriended Rich when both worked at \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d \u201cBecause they so naturally lend themselves to performing, it\u2019s very fun to take it off the page.\u201d",
      "Director Alex Timbers first approached Rich, the son of noted critic Frank Rich, with the idea of transferring some of his short stories to the stage.",
      "\u201cOur first reading was 4 1/2 hours long so it took some process of elimination, but we eventually found a batch of stories that we felt were not just thematically linked, but would lend themselves to powerful performances by talented actors,\u201d says Rich.",
      "Once they found the right stories, attention went to presenting them: How many actors should there be? How much of a production should the 90-minute play be? Should there be costumes and sets?",
      "They landed on minimalism and four actors, which offered both a chance to showcase each's versatility and make the play more intimate. The show is enlivened by original illustrations from New Yorker cartoonist Emily Flake and the band The Bengsons playing love songs from The Magnetic Fields' catalog.",
      "\u201cWhat was going to serve the material best was the purest communication of it to the audience,\u201d says Mulaney. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to use a drug thing, but mainlining the material versus taking it in a dissolvable.\u201d",
      "Two of the stories \u2014 a pair of passive-aggressive pirates who abandon their rough ways to raise a young stowaway and a noir detective tale told by babies \u2014 features children and child-rearing, something both Rich and Mulaney can now relate to.",
      "\u201cIt all is greatly enhanced by my own life,\u201d says Mulaney, the \u201ctouring, stand-up comedian, \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019-writing, complete night owl, Dracula-like creature who now has two kids and lives in the California suburbs.\u201d",
      "The original four cast members will give way to four more but Rich and Mulaney think the structure is sound and can take changes. It helps that each performer sits in chairs for the entire show and has a script in their lap should they need it.",
      "\u201cSo many people can find a way into these stories that I am sure anyone coming in to do any of these pieces will be able to bring themselves to it and rise to the occasion of how good the writing is,\u201d says Mulaney.",
      "The replacements won't slip into the exact performer's spot just vacated \u2014 Rich says they'll scramble the parts up. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me to imagine how not just new individual performances will change things, but new pairings as well,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many of the stories live in the scene work between two cast members and that\u2019s another thrilling thing for me to imagine is those shifting dynamics.\u201d",
      "The audience at the Hudson Theatre during one recent performance was notably younger than for most Broadway shows and Mulaney and Rich hope they can do some theatrical recruitment with \u201cAll In.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we are finding that there are some first-time theatergoers or new theater goers that are coming and we\u2019re thrilled by that,\u201d says Rich. \u201cWe hope that comedy fans will enjoy this experience and that it\u2019ll help convert them into theater fans and maybe they\u2019ll see this show and want to check out more.\u201d"

      "Stepping onto the set of \u201cSquid Game\u201d season two, Lee Jong-jae felt like he had never left.",
      "\u201cIncluding promotion, I'd been living with Gi-hun for about two years,\" said Lee in a recent interview. \u201cI really felt like I was him,\" he said in a recent interview.",
      "\u201cSquid Game\u201d follows an underground competition in Korea that recruits people in debt to participate in childlike games for money. Once the games begin, the contestants realize there are deadly consequences.",
      "The show was a global hit when it was released in 2021, becoming Netflix's most-watched series. It also won numerous accolades including Primetime Emmy Awards for acting for Lee Jung-jae and directing for Hwang Dong-hyuk. Lee's career catapulted, taking him to the Cannes Film Festival and giving him his first English-language role in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d series \u201cThe Acolyte\u201d for Disney+.",
      "Lee says when Netflix ordered a second season of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d he questioned the timeline because it took Hwang years to work on the first one. \"I wondered, \u2018How many years will it take him to write season two,\u2019\" said Lee. Hwang, in turn, surprised everyone \u2014 including himself \u2014 by taking just six months to write season two and a third and final season. \u201cI'm not sure I'll ever be able to write something that fast again,\u201d he said.",
      "Creating new characters and their individual stories came easily. The biggest, challenge, Hwang said, was deciding what should happen with Gi-hun. Lee says when he read the scripts he thought Hwang \u201creally is a genius.\u201d",
      "It's rare for even successful TV shows in Korea to have more than one season so it was a big swing, even for the new cast.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a Korean phrase, \u2018there\u2019s not a sequel that does better than its prequel,\u2019 said actor Yang Dong-geong, whose character debuts in season two. \"I've been careful because we aren't really sure what the reaction will be.\u201d The outlook is positive. Season two has already been nominated in the best drama series category at the upcoming Golden Globe Awards.",
      "The opportunity to work on a project with worldwide appeal is a dream come true for a performer. Lee Byung-hun, who reprises his villain role from season one, has appeared in big budget English-language films like \u201cG.I. Joe: The Rise of the Cobra\u201d with Channing Tatum and Dennis Quaid and \u201cRed 2\u201d with Bruce Willis. It's \u201cSquid Game\u201d that he credits for taking his career to another level.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been an actor for over three decades and ... maybe most people outside of Korea have never seen anything that I\u2019ve been in. If anyone through \u2018Squid Game\u2019 wishes to see more of me or becomes more curious about my previous works, as an actor, nothing would be more rewarding or bring me greater joy.\"",
      "The audition process moved slowly. Jo Yu-ri recalls waiting two months between the first and second-round. When she finally got the part Jo says, \u201cI actually remember crying.\u201d The actors were asked to not speak publicly about their casting to wait for Netflix to make an announcement. \u201cThere were a couple of close friends that popped champagne for me when they found out,\" said Yang.",
      "Netflix's \u201cSquid Game\u201d universe is also growing. A second season of a reality competition show based on the series has been ordered and an English version is in development. Season three of the original has also completed filming and is in post-production.",
      "Season two is not without controversy. The new episodes feature a transgender character played by Park Sung-hoon. Hwang says he understands why hiring a trans actor would have been ideal, but that the casting is a reflection of how the LGBTQ community and gender identity is viewed in Korea.",
      "\u201cTo be honest with you, in Korea, when it comes to the LGBTQ and gender minority community and culture compared to the Western worlds, it\u2019s not as widely socially accepted yet. Unfortunately, a lot of the groups are marginalized and neglected from society, which is heartbreaking,\" said Hwang.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a very large pool of actors that allow for authentic casting when it comes to transgender characters. We did our research. We tried to find someone who we thought could be the best fit. However, we weren\u2019t able to.\u201d Hwang also went on to say that Park's talent and approach to the character ended up making him \u201cthe perfect fit.\u201d",

The special alt-cast, the first animated presentation of an NBA game, will be shown on ESPN2 and also stream on Disney+ and ESPN+.",
      "Madison Square Garden is a staple of the NBA's Christmas schedule. Now it merges with a bigger home of the holidays, because the \u201cDunk the Halls\u201d game will be staged at Disney, on a court set up right smack in the middle of where countless families have posed for vacation photos.",
      "Why that location?",
      "Because it was Mickey Mouse\u2019s Christmas wish.",

      "The story \u2014 this is Disney, after all \u2014 begins with Mickey penning a letter to Santa Claus, asking if he and his pals can host a basketball game. They'll not only get to watch one with NBA players, but some of them will even get to play. Goofy and Donald Duck will sub in for a couple Knicks players, while Mickey and Minnie Mouse will come on to play for the Spurs.",
      "\u201cIt looks to me like Goofy and Jalen Brunson have a really good pick-and-roll at the elite level,\u201d said Phil Orlins, an ESPN vice president of production.",
      "Walt Disney World hosted real NBA games in 2020, when the league set up there to complete its season that had been suspended by the COVID-19 pandemic. Those games were played at the ESPN Wide World of Sports.",
      "The setting for the Christmas game will be Main Street USA, at the entrance of the Magic Kingdom. Viewers will recognize Cinderella\u2019s castle behind one baseline and the train station at the other end, and perhaps some shops they have visited in between.",

      "Wembanyama, the 7-foot-3 phenom from France who was last season's NBA Rookie of the Year, looks huge even among most NBA players. The creators of the alternate telecast had to design how he'd look not only among his teammates and rivals, but among mice, ducks and chipmunks.",
      "\u201cLike, Victor Wembanyama, seeing him in person is insane. It\u2019s like seeing an alien descend on a basketball court, and I think we kind of captured that in his animated character,\u201d said Drew Carter, who will again handle play-by-play duties, as he had in the previous animated telecasts, and will get an assist from sideline reporter Daisy Duck.",
      "Wembanyama's presence is one reason the Spurs-Knicks matchup, the leadoff to the NBA's five-game Christmas slate, was the obvious choice to do the animated telecast. The noon EST start means it will begin in the early evening in France and should draw well there. Also, it comes after ABC televises the \u201cDisney Parks Magical Christmas Day Parade\u201d for the previous two hours, providing more time to hype the broadcast.",
      "Recognizing that some viewers who then switch over to the animated game may be Disney experts but NBA novices, there will be 10 educational explainers to help with basketball lingo and rules.",
      "Beyond Sports' visualization technology and Sony\u2019s Hawk-Eye tracking allow the animated players to make the same movements and plays made moments earlier by the real ones at MSG. Carter and analyst Monica McNutt will be animated in the style of the telecast, donning VR headsets to experience the game from Main Street, USA.",
      "Other animated faces recognizable to some viewers include NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who will judge a halftime dunk contest among Mickey and his friends, and Santa himself, who will operate ESPN\u2019s \u201cSkyCam\u201d during the game.",
      "The players are curious how the production \u2014 and themselves \u2014 will look.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be so crazy to see the game animated,\u201d Spurs veteran Chris Paul said. \u201cI think what\u2019s dope about it is it will give kids another opportunity to watch a game and to see us, basically, as characters.\u201d",

      "\u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d debuted with $62 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates. With strong reviews (86% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and a high score from audiences (an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore), \u201cSonic 3\u201d is well positioned to be the top choice in cinemas during the busiest moviegoing period of the year.",
      "It was telling of some wider trends that \u201cSonic 3\u201d \u2014 made for $122 million \u2014 bested one of Disney\u2019s top properties. Videogame adaptations, once among the most derided movie genres, have emerged as one of the most dependable box office forces in recent years. The two previous \u201cSonic\u201d movies together grossed more $700 million worldwide and the third installment appears likely to do better than both of them. A fourth \u201cSonic\u201d movie is already in development.",
      "\u201cMufasa,\u201d however, was humbled in its opening weekend, coming in notably shy of expectations with $35 million in domestic ticket sales. The photorealistic \u201cLion King\u201d prequel even opened wider than \u201cSonic 3,\u201d launching on 4,100 theaters and gobbling up most IMAX screens, compared with 3,761 locations for \u201cSonic 3.\u201d",
      "Yet \u201cSonic 3\u201d nearly doubled the haul for \u201cMufasa,\u201d which cost more than $200 million to make. Disney could look to $87.2 million in international sales to help make up the difference. The third \u201cSonic\u201d will rollout in most overseas markets in the coming weeks.",
      "In director Jeff Fowler\u2019s \u201cSonic 3,\u201d Ben Schwartz returns as the voice of the hedgehog, alongside Tails the Fox (Colleen O\u2019Shaughnessey), Knuckles the Echidna (Idris Elba) and Jim Carrey in scene-stealing dual roles as Dr. Robotnik and his grandfather.",

It follows Jon Favreau\u2019s 2019 photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d remake, which made $1.66 billion globally despite mixed reviews. \u201cMufasa\u201d didn\u2019t come close to that film\u2019s huge $191 million opening weekend.",
      "Many of Disney\u2019s live-action adaptations \u2013 including \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and \u201cJungle Book\u201d \u2013 have been big hits. Others, such as \u201cDumbo,\u201d \u201cMulan\u201d and \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d have been less well received. More are on the way, including a new \u201cSnow White\u201d in March, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d in May, and plans for \u201cMoana\u201d and \u201cTangled\u201d to get the same live-action treatment.",
      "Despite \u201cMufasa's\u201d muted opening, Disney is still celebrating its strongest annual performance in years. The studio has accounted for more than $5 billion in ticket sales worldwide, including the year\u2019s top two hits: \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine.\u201d The animated \u201cMoana 2\u201d is poised to round out the top three films of the year. In four weeks of release, it has collected $790.2 million globally, including $13.1 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters over this weekend.",
      "Though Christmas often sees some of the biggest releases of the year, November movies released around Thanksgiving really drove the box office this year. That includes \u201cMoana 2\u201d and Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cWicked,\u201d which managed third place in its fifth weekend.",

According to Comscore, the gap has narrowed to 4.4% behind last year's results. While that\u2019s still significantly less than pre-pandemic years, it\u2019s enough to flip the script on what once looked like a rough year for the movies.",

      "NEW YORK -- Amy Allen might not yet be a household name, but her work lives in your brain rent-free. And it's grabbed the attention of the Grammys.",
      "The 32-year-old songwriter has composed enduring hits with Halsey (\u201cWithout Me\u201d), Selena Gomez (\u201cBack to You\u201d) and Tate McRae (\u201cGreedy\u201d). Her contributions to Harry Styles' \u201cHarry's House\u201d earned her a Grammy for album of the year in 2023. Other credits include songs from Olivia Rodrigo, Charli XCX, Ros\u00e9, Rene\u00e9 Rapp, Shawn Mendes, Leon Bridges and Justin Timberlake.",
      "2024, however, was the year Allen's work became inescapable \u2014 thanks in large part to her collaboration with another rising star. Allen co-wrote all 12 tracks of Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s bubbly \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d including \u201cEspresso,\u201d an instant song of the summer that propelled Carpenter to a new stratosphere of stardom, and \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d the follow-up single that proved that her winking, quotable pop had staying power. (Everyone's favorite lyric? \u201cHeartbreak is one thing, my ego\u2019s another / I beg you, don\u2019t embarrass me,\u201d followed by a rhyming profanity rasped with a smirk.)",
      "This fall, Allen's work sent her to No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 Songwriters chart for seven weeks \u2014 an impressive feat, considering her competition includes artists like Carpenter herself and Kendrick Lamar.",
      "\u201cOnce the songs are out of my hands, I just try to let them go to the world,\u201d Allen told The Associated Press. It helps that the world has, in turn, embraced them.",
      "When nominations for the 67th Grammy Awards were announced, Allen was in the midst of a writing session in London. The news came in a text from her manager: She was nominated four times, including her second nomination in the songwriter of the year, non-classical, category that has only existed for three years. If she wins, she will become the first woman to take home that trophy. \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d is up for album of the year and \u201cPlease Please Please\u201d for song of the year.",
      "Her fourth nod is in the song written for visual media category, for \u201cBetter Place,\u201d a collaboration with NSYNC for \u201cTrolls: Band Together.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople really gravitate toward her energy, as well as obviously her talent. That just goes without saying,\u201d said Julia Michaels, another hit songwriter, artist and collaborator on \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d of Allen.",
      "\u201cShe just always brings a happy, optimistic attitude, that like, \u2018anything is possible today,\u2019\u201d added Julian Bunetta, who also co-wrote and produced songs on Carpenter's album. \u201cThe ease of that makes conversation come natural, which makes people open up and share details about their life.\u201d",
      "Allen's path to professional songwriting wasn't necessarily linear. Growing up in Maine, she joined a bluegrass band, a rock band and played music at Irish pubs throughout her teens. It wasn\u2019t until her early 20s, when she transferred to Berklee College of Music after two years in nursing school at Boston College, that she realized being both a songwriter for others and a performing artist was a career option.",
      "\u201cI had to really dig to realize, like, Carole King writes for other people, but she\u2019s also an artist. And then it was later on, way later on, when I came across writers like Julia that were doing it professionally,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI knew that it was like in my blood since I was really little, that it made me feel more connected to myself and the world around me in so many ways, more than anything else I ever experienced.\u201d",
      "\u201cEspresso\u201d came together in a Paris studio. Allen, Bunetta, Carpenter and their co-writer Steph Jones \u201cwere kids having fun and laughing and playing,\u201d Bunetta said, explaining that joyful energy produced the track's cheery sound and nonsensical zingers (\u201cthat's that me espresso\u201d).",
      "Allen believes \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d found success through its quirky, playful pop \u2014 because listeners want unpredictability, narrative songs with personality and perspective.",
      "\u201cThe general public is so much smarter than a lot of songwriters and a lot of people in the entertainment industry, give them credit for,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThe artists that are winning are the ones that are willing to put everything out there, to say something so direct and so honest to them and so authentic that it\u2019s almost impossible for the public to turn away.\u201d",
      "In October, she was out of the studio and on the road, opening for collaborator Jack Antonoff\u2019s band Bleachers on a slate of dates across Europe, Los Angeles and New York. She performed songs from \u201cAmy Allen,\u201d her self-titled debut album released in September \u2014 a collection of acoustic guitar melodies and percussion-led singer-songwriter pop.",
      "Touring those songs came with a realization. \u201cI love writing for other artists and with other artists, and I will do that for a very long time,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also so important for me to go back to how I fell in love with music, which was writing songs on my bed, writing little poems in my bedroom.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhether she wants to be the biggest artist in the world or she wants to make whatever kind of music she makes, I have no doubt that she is capable of doing it,\u201d said Michaels, who launched her own pop career in 2017 with her multi-platinum song \u201cIssues.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always going to go after both,\u201d Allen said.",

      "\u201cHappiness Bastards\u201d is a 10-track romping tour of rock, from the Southern boogie of \u201cRats and Clowns\u201d to the stuttering stomp of \u201cCross Your Fingers\u201d and the airy cool of \u201cWilted Rose.\u201d There's blues harmonica, some glam rock, '70s harmonies and fun AC/DC-like riffs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funky and it\u2019s rockin' and it\u2019s kind of a little bit salty here and there. But ultimately, I think it\u2019s very interesting,\u201d says Chris Robinson. \u201cIt\u2019s just integrated with everything that we\u2019ve done and where we\u2019re going.\u201d",
      "The band last released a studio album in 2009, and the volatile Robinson brothers needed a decade apart before they regrouped in 2019. In 2022, they released an EP with covers of David Bowie, the Rolling Stones, the Temptations, T. Rex, Little Feat and Rod Stewart. Now they're in the same Grammy category as the Stones.",
      "Critics have welcomed the brothers back, with Paste magazine calling the new album \u201ca respectable collection of bluesy rockers that showcase the brothers\u2019 strengths\u201d and Rolling Stone describing it as \u201cfun, energetic and, unmistakably not-crusty.\u201d",
      "Some cynics thought the reunion was simply a cash grab, an attempt to monetize fans of the band yearning for the '90s and a good-time rock concert. The strong album and Grammy love refutes that argument.",
      "\u201cWell, we did it and we\u2019ve been successful. And all these years later we wrote these new songs and, boom, here we are,\u201d says Chris Robinson. \u201cThe validation of that is really unique to us.\u201d",
      "The way the brothers come up with a song hadn't changed over the years. During the pandemic, Rich started sending a flood of ideas to his brother to see what clicked with him.",
      "Chris wrote the lyrics for \u201cRats and Clowns\u201d in 20 minutes after Rich \u2014 inspired by AC/DC \u2014 sent him a killer riff. \u201cRich just handed me a hanging curveball. \u2018I can hit this,\u2019 you know what I mean?\u201d says Chris. \u201cI have to emphasize how much fun we\u2019re having in this band.\u201d",
      "One difference this time was the addition of an outside producer. The Robinson brothers had produced all The Black Crowes albums after their second and wanted a new element.",

      "That happened with producer Jay Joyce, who has worked with artists like Cage the Elephant, Lainey Wilson and Eric Church. Joyce pushed them and was able to negotiate the sibling rivalry, what some call the U.S. equivalent to Oasis.",
      "\u201cOur story connects with people because if you have siblings, you understand the dynamic of that \u2014 how amazing it is and how difficult it can be,\u201d says Chris Robinson.",

      "Associated Press Film Writers Jake Coyle and Lindsey Bahr have you covered with the best Christmas films for every mood.",
      "\u201cGrand Budapest Hotel\u201d: Truthfully, there\u2019s nothing outside of a little snow to make Wes Anderson\u2019s 2014 delight a Christmas movie. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another movie that better resembles the experience of opening a present than \u201cGrand Budapest Hotel.\u201d Unwrap Anderson\u2019s intricate designs and the movie\u2019s Russian doll-like narratives, and smile. (Available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cMetropolitan\u201d (1990): Who among us hasn\u2019t dreamt of doing debutante season in New York? Maybe don\u2019t answer that, but Whit Stillman\u2019s \u201cMetropolitan,\u201d about a few privileged youths on the Upper East Side, is the ideal film to turn on when you\u2019re craving something that feels like an elegant evening on the town but doesn't require breaking out the white tie and ball gowns. (Streaming on Criterion, MAX, Hulu and Prime Video) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cA Muppets Christmas Carol\u201d (1992): It\u2019s one thing to do Dickens with, you know, other humans. But Michael Caine gives an Oscar-worthy performance as Ebenezer Scrooge while sharing the screen with the likes of Beaker and Dr. Bunsen Honeydew. To be fair, though, Gonzo the Great and Rizzo the Rat are also really good in this. (Streaming on Disney+) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg\u201d (1964): Jacques Demy\u2019s technicolor musical isn\u2019t exclusively set at Christmas, but its final tearjerker scene at that snowy gas station is enough for me. The whole candy-colored experience, from Catherine Deneuve\u2019s whimsical bows to Michel Legrand\u2019s sweeping, melancholy score just feels right around the holidays. (Streaming on The Criterion Channel) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang\u201d: Yuletide traditions don\u2019t normally include a motormouth Robert Downey Jr., but Shane Black\u2019s 2005 neo-noir black comedy is worth revisiting perennially whether or not it technically qualifies as a Christmas movie. In \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d about a thief-turned-actor in Los Angeles, Christmas is more of a decorative ornament set ironically against all the deliciously unwholesome seediness. (Available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cThe Holiday\u201d (2006): Ok, so the cozy English cottage isn\u2019t real, but what is? The premise? The romances? Cameron Diaz\u2019s sprint through snowy fields and country roads in stilettos? Mr. Napkin Head? (Actually, maybe Mr. Napkin Head). The thing is it doesn\u2019t really matter, does it? Nancy Meyers\u2019 romantic fantasy is never trying to be anything other than a delightful movie, a little too earnest, a little too glossy and an unabashed ode to the classic movies Meyers loves right down to Eli Wallach teaching a new generation about the \u201cmeet cute.\u201d (Streaming on Hulu and Prime Video) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d: I\u2019ll take any excuse to rewatch Sydney Pollack\u2019s 1975 spy thriller with Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway. But, like in \u201cKiss Kiss Bang Bang,\u201d the Christmas backdrop isn\u2019t accidental. If the holidays are the ultimate time of togetherness, \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d questions what that means in a post-Watergate world. (Streaming on Paramount+) \u2014 Coyle",

It\u2019s sweet, funny and adventurous and not even a little bit scary (unless you fear flying sleighs and botched recipes). (Streaming on Netflix) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d: Robert Benton\u2019s 1994 Richard Russo adaptation, with Paul Newman, spans Thanksgiving through New Year\u2019s Eve. And while that covers Christmas, the richness of \u201cNobody\u2019s Fool\u201d exceeds its vaguely holiday setting. It\u2019s a movie more about daily smalltown struggles and long-term regrets, yet its warmth could match that any of any more traditional Christmas movie, and then some. That\u2019s much owed to Newman, but there are countless great performances here, including Jessica Tandy (in her final film), a never better Bruce Willis and a young Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a sniveling police officer. It makes me happy just thinking about it. (Streaming on Kanopy, available for digital rental) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cCarol\u201d (2015): Even if Rooney Mara didn\u2019t catch Cate Blanchett\u2019s eye while wearing a Santa hat behind the counter of a Manhattan department store, Todd Haynes\u2019 \u201cCarol\u201d would still be one of the loveliest, most achingly tender Christmas movies around. Romance, heartbreak, plaids and martinis, \u201cCarol\u201d is truly flung out of space. (Streaming on Netflix, Paramount+ and MUBI) \u2014Bahr",
      "\u201cChristmas in Connecticut\u201d (1945): You don\u2019t have to watch it on TCM but it\u2019s certainly a fitting place to catch this 1945 screwball classic, with Barbara Stanwyck. She plays a popular homemaking column writer whose false persona as a family woman with a Connecticut farm is challenged when her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) comes for Christmas dinner. As a rule, it\u2019s good to watch everything with Greenstreet. But the central conceit of \u201cChristmas in Connecticut\u201d \u2013 that the perfect Christmas is a lie, and isn\u2019t that fun \u2013 has proved remarkably durable. (Streaming on WatchTCM) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cLittle Women\u201d (1994 and 2019): Gillian Armstrong\u2019s \u201cLittle Women\u201d just feels like Christmas. Maybe part of that is because it came out around the holidays 30 years ago or that its DVD cover leans into it. But then you remember Beth\u2019s piano, the girls stomping through the snow with their Christmas feast, the caroling, the return of their father, the fireplaces and nightcaps and it makes sense. Those wanting all of this with a side of dancing Chalamet, Greta Gerwig\u2019s version is there for the taking too. (1994 version available for digital rental; 2019 streaming on Hulu) \u2014 Bahr",
      "\u201cThe Shop Around the Corner\u201d (1940): You can make a strong case for that other Jimmy Stewart Christmas movie. But in the knock-down, drag-out battle for the Christmas movie title, there\u2019s no greater delight than Ernst Lubitsch\u2019s timeless love story. One of the most charming movies ever made, partly because it doesn't shy away from real darkness, too. It also makes for a very effective drinking game if you sip something every time someone says \u201cMr. Matuschek.\u201d (Streaming on WatchTCM and Max) \u2014 Coyle",
      "\u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d (1947): It\u2019s not even a remotely out of the box choice, but George Seaton\u2019s \u201cMiracle on 34th Street\u201d endures as the platonic ideal of a Christmas movie. It\u2019s strikingly modern for something that came out 77 years ago with Maureen O\u2019Hara\u2019s single working mom, Natalie Wood\u2019s prematurely cynical New York kid and the litigious and capitalistic culture and yet it\u2019s all full of hope and holiday spirit (and a healthy amount of glossy capitalism), taking us from the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade through Christmas Day.

      "Background music is no longer an afterthought at many airports",
      "SEATAC, Washington -- Background music is no longer an afterthought at many airports, which are hiring local musicians and carefully curating playlists to help lighten travelers\u2019 moods.",
      "London\u2019s Heathrow Airport built a stage to showcase emerging British performers for the first time this summer. The program was so successful the airport hopes to bring it back in 2025. Nashville International Airport has five stages that host more than 800 performances per year, from country musicians to jazz combos. In the Dominican Republic, Punta Cana International Airport greets passengers with live merengue music.",
      "Tiffany Idiart and her two nieces were delighted to hear musicians during a recent layover at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.",
      "\u201cI like it. There\u2019s a lot of people here and they can all hear it,\u201d said Grace Idiart, 9. \u201cIf their flight got delayed or something like that, they could have had a hard day. And so the music could have made them feel better.\u201d",
      "Airports are also carefully curating their recorded playlists. Detroit Metro Airport plays Motown hits in a tunnel connecting its terminals. Austin-Bergstrom International Airport in Texas has a playlist of local artists compiled by an area radio station. Singapore\u2019s Changi Airport commissioned a special piano accompaniment for its giant digital waterfall.",
      "Music isn\u2019t a new phenomenon in airport terminals. Brian Eno\u2019s \u201cMusic for Airports,\u201d an album released in 1978, helped define the ambient music genre. It\u2019s minimalist and designed to calm.",
      "But Barry McPhillips, the head of international creative for Mood Media, which provides music for airports and other public spaces, said technology is enabling background music to be less generic and more tailored to specific places or times of day.",
      "Mood Media \u2013 formerly known as Muzak \u2013 develops playlists to appeal to business travelers or families depending on who\u2019s in the airport at any given time. It might program calmer music in the security line but something more energizing in the duty-free store.",
      "\u201cWe see it as a soundscape,\u201d McPhillips said. \u201cWe design for all of these moments.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a science to Mood Music\u2019s decisions on volume, tempo, even whether to play a song in a major key versus a minor one, he added.",
      "\u201cHow do we want to affect their mood at that moment?\u201d McPhillips said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just like, \u2018Here\u2019s a load of songs.\u2019 It\u2019s a load of songs for that 10-minute segment, and then we move to the next 10 minutes.\u201d",
      "At the same time, many airports are going low-tech, hiring local musicians to serenade travelers and give them a sense of the place they\u2019re passing through.",
      "Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare and Midway airports have more than 100 live performances each year. Phoenix\u2019s Sky Harbor International Airport began a live music program five years ago and now has two stages featuring local artists.",
      "Tami Kuiken, the manager of airport music in Seattle, said the Seattle-Tacoma airport launched its live music program about a decade ago after a city commissioner heard live music at the airport in Austin, Texas.",
      "\u201cThe idea was like, \u2019Man, why doesn\u2019t Seattle have music? We\u2019re a music city too,\u201d Kuiken said.",
      "At first, the airport created a playlist featuring emerging artists along with famous ones like Pearl Jam. Then it decided to try live musicians for a 12-week trial. It was so successful that the airport now features live musicians daily and is building new performance spaces.",
      "\u201cPeople\u2019s anxiety levels are very high when they\u2019re traveling,\u201d Kuiken said. \u201cThe feedback that we started getting was that once they got through the checkpoint and they were greeted with music, all of a sudden their anxiety and stress levels dropped.\u201d",
      "The programs also benefit musicians, who get paid to perform and gain wider exposure. When Colorado Springs Airport announced a live music program in March, more than 150 musicians applied. It now hosts two two-hour performances each week.",
      "David James, a singer and guitarist who plays at Seattle\u2019s airport about once a week, said waking up in time for a daytime gig took some adjustment. But he\u2019s gained new fans from all over the world.",
      "\u201cI get really sweet responses from people all the time, saying, \u2018That was so soothing to be able to just sit and listen to music in between flights,\u2019\u201d James said. \u201cSo it feels like it\u2019s especially therapeutic for people.\u201d",
      "Country stars like Blake Shelton and Keith Urban have come through Nashville's airport and interacted with local musicians, said Stacey Nickens, the airport's vice president of corporate communications and marketing. Shelton even gave one his guitar.",
      "Otto Stuparitz, a musicologist and lecturer at the University of Amsterdam who has studied airport music, said airports should think carefully about their selections. Music that\u2019s meant to be actively listened to \u2013 like live music or catchy pop songs \u2013 can be very distracting in an already chaotic environment, he said. He has noticed some airports \u2013 especially in Europe -- turning off piped melodies altogether.",
      "But McPhillips said big spaces like airports can feel cold and unwelcoming without background music.",
      "\u201cA well-crafted audio strategy is one that people aren\u2019t particularly cognizant of,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just know they\u2019re having a good time and that it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d",

      "Now caretaker of his dad's work, Sean Ono Lennon is on a remarkable run",
      "NEW YORK -- Only recently given stewardship over his late father's work, Sean Ono Lennon is on a remarkable run.",
      "The only child of John Lennon and Yoko Ono won an Academy Award this year for a short film based on his parents' 1971 song \"Happy Christmas (War is Over\")\" and, a few months later, was nominated for his first-ever Grammy, for producing a box set on the album \u201cMind Games,\u201d originally released in 1973.",
      "\u201cIt feels overwhelming and surreal,\u201d said Lennon, who also recently shared a Webby Award with his mother for Ono's interactive art project \u201cWish Tree.\u201d",
      "For Lennon, who was 5 when the former Beatle was murdered in 1980, the work is a way to connect with his father. It's more than a preservation mission: On \u201cMind Games,\u201d he takes artistic license, pulling apart the recordings of John Lennon's music to create something entirely new.",
      "Lennon was inspired, in part, by another Beatle offspring, Dhani Harrison, who helped repackage his own father's \u201cAll Things Must Pass.\u201d Dhani Harrison is also behind this fall's reissue of his dad's \u201cLiving in the Material World,\u201d but that experience is nothing like what Lennon did with \u201cMind Games.\u201d",
      "Besides the music, the innovative box is modeled after one of his mother's art pieces and filled with art reproductions, hidden music, video, messages and puzzles, some only visible through an ultraviolet light that is included \u2014 \u201cmind games,\u201d remember? The deluxe box retails for $1,350, but there are less expensive options.",
      "Lennon, 49, knew his father was a musician before he died; the boy tagged along to the studio for some \u201cDouble Fantasy\u201d sessions. But truly understanding his impact came later, like when he'd hear fans singing his father's music outside their New York apartment on the Oct. 9 birthday they shared. \u201cIt was pretty clear to me that wasn't happening with my friends,\u201d he said.",
      "His father's music played constantly around the house, and learning to play those songs launched his own journey to become a musician.",
      "\u201cI think I would have rebelled more against my dad's \u2014 and my mom's \u2014 music if I had grown up with my dad in the house and I had been angry at him or rebelled against him,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cBecause he wasn't around, I've always really cherished the music as sort of a living part of him.\u201d",
      "He inherited the job of keeping his father's music alive for new generations when his mom, now 91, retired.",
      "In liner notes for \u201cMind Games,\u201d Lennon explains that \u201cthe only meaningful way that I can show my love to him\u201d is to work hard on his music and keep it in the culture's consciousness. That's poignant, and maybe a little sad. Does Lennon really have to prove to anyone that he loves his father?",
      "\u201cWhat else can I do in this Earth to express my love and reverence for my father than to do an incredibly meticulous job of taking care of his music?\u201d he said. \u201cI can't actually think of anything else, other than taking care of my mother, which I try to do as well.\u201d",
      "That reverence for his elders came from his mother, he believes. When his Japanese grandparents came over to the U.S. \u201cit was like the president was visiting,\u201d he recalled.",
      "Only after he began the \u201cMind Games\u201d project did Lennon learn that the album wasn't particularly well-regarded when it was released. He found an interview where even John Lennon considered it a transition from a period of political activism to being a musician again. The title song was its only hit.",
      "That attitude lingers, judging by an online site called \u201cBrutally Honest Rock Album Reviews.\u201d In an unsigned review, the author said the \u201cMind Games\u201d reissue defines overkill. \u201cYou can now own and forever cherish six different versions of songs that were unmemorable at best and a complete waste of time at worst.\u201d",
      "That only motivated Lennon to work harder, and led to a bold artistic decision. Part of the reason the album didn't really connect was because it wasn't promoted well or supported by concerts, he said. But he also described the original album mix as thin and not doing justice to the music.",
      "Using the original recordings, he constructed new versions of the songs, sometimes emphasizing different instruments. He sought a warmer, more direct sound reminiscent of Lennon's \u201cPlastic Ono Band\u201d album \u2014 most visibly on \u201cAisumasen (I'm Sorry),\u201d one of a handful of compositions reflecting marital turmoil that presaged Lennon's notorious \u201clost weekend\u201d separation from Ono.",
      "Different versions of the title cut also show Sean's approach. There's the original \u201cMind Games,\u201d with a distinctive chiming sound that drives the melody. That's stripped away in a new mix where a reggae guitar lick becomes audible. An organ-dominated instrumental sounds like a church hymn. There are other outtakes, some with alternate lyrics and one with a snippet of \u201cMake Love, Not War,\u201d a song fragment dating back to the Beatles that the author repurposed.",
      "He didn't have a trove of unheard material to mine, other than Lennon's demo of \u201cI'm the Greatest,\u201d a song he gave to Beatle mate Ringo Starr.",
      "In some of the new versions, Sean goes beyond remixing or revealing outtakes to imposing his own artistic vision over his father's.",
      "\u201cThere are some people who feel that it's taking liberties, and I guess it technically is,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cThe way I look at it is, if I'm going to do the best job I can, the only way I can do that is to follow my heart and make it sound the best that it can sound. If that means maybe turning down an instrument a lot in a certain section because I don't think it's helping, then I'm going to do that.\u201d",
      "For anyone who wants the original versions, they're readily available.",
      "\u201cIt's very forensic work,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not worried about what someone else is going to think. I'm just in there trying to do good by my dad, and I really feel that I know how to do good by him, because I know his music better than I know anybody else's music.\u201d",
      "As a musician, he relates to moments where his father expresses vulnerability, like an interview where John described \u201cIntuition\u201d as a good song where he didn't nail the lyrics. The \u201cGet Back\u201d film of recording sessions for the \u201cLet it Be\u201d album showed the Beatles as humans who didn't hand songs down from Mount Olympus.",
      "Next on the docket is a film resurrection of the \u201cOne to One\u201d concerts involving his father and a reissue of the \u201cWalls and Bridges\u201d album. Sean, who lives and works in New York and is involved in a longtime relationship with musician and model Kemp Muhl, released his own album, \u201cAsterisms,\u201d this year.",
      "Told he sounded like his father when singing forcefully, Lennon practically whispered lyrics on his early albums. He hated the way he sounded, but didn't want to deal with the comparisons. He doesn't hold back anymore. \u201cNow I'm too old to care,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI didn't get into music because I had some great talent or something,\u201d he said. \u201cI got into it because my dad was this famous musician and playing his songs and learning his music made me feel closer to him.\u201d",

      "President Joe Biden has signed the annual defense authorization bill into law despite his objections to language banning transgender health care for military children",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Monday signed into law a defense bill that authorizes significant pay raises for junior enlisted service members, aims to counter China's growing power and boosts overall military spending to $895 billion despite his objections to language stripping coverage of transgender medical treatments for children in military families.",
      "Biden said his administration strongly opposes the provision because it targets a group based on gender identity and \"interferes with parents\u2019 roles to determine the best care for their children.\u201d He said it also undermines the all-volunteer military's ability to recruit and retain talent.",
      "\u201cNo service member should have to decide between their family\u2019s health care access and their call to serve our nation,\u201d the president said in a statement.",
      "The Senate forwarded the bill to Biden after passing it last week by a vote of 85-14. In the House, a majority of Democrats voted against the bill after House Speaker Mike Johnson insisted on adding the provision to ban transgender medical care for children. The legislation easily passed by a vote of 281-140.",
      "Biden also objected to other language in the bill prohibiting the use of money earmarked to transfer detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to some foreign countries and into the United States. He urged Congress to lift those restrictions.",
      "The annual defense authorization bill, which directs Pentagon policy, provides a 14.5% pay raise for junior enlisted service members and a 4.5% increase for others.",
      "The legislation also directs resources towards a more confrontational approach to China, including establishing a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine. It also invests in new military technologies, including artificial intelligence, and bolsters the U.S. production of ammunition.",
      "The U.S. has also moved in recent years to ban the military from purchasing Chinese products, and the defense bill extended that with prohibitions on Chinese goods from garlic in military commissaries to drone technology.",
      "The legislation still must be backed up with a spending package.",

    "story": [
      "The battles over abortion in the U.S. are increasingly focusing on the pills that are now the most common way pregnancies are ended",
      "Opponents of abortion are increasingly focusing on restricting access to pills, which are the most common way to end a pregnancy in the U.S.",
      "This month, the Texas attorney general's office filed a lawsuit against a New York doctor, saying she violated Texas law by prescribing abortion pills to a patient there via telemedicine. The suit represents the first lawsuit of its kind and could lead to a legal test for the New York law designed to protect providers there who prescribe the drugs to patients in states with abortion bans.",
      "Anti-abortion officials are taking other steps, too, through legislation and lawsuits.",
      "Abortion rights advocates are also concerned that President-elect Donald Trump's administration could take action to restrict access if it chose to.",
      "By the time the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to ban abortion, over half of all abortions were obtained using medication, usually a combination of the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol.",
      "The drugs are different than Plan B and other emergency contraceptives that are usually taken within three days after possible conception, weeks before women know they're pregnant. Studies have found they're generally safe and result in completed abortions more than 97% of the time, which is less effective than procedural abortions.",
      "By last year, nearly two-thirds of abortions were from medications, according to a tally by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access.",
      "Much of the growth has been through abortion pills prescribed via telehealth and mailed to patients. A survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning found that by the first half of 2024, such prescriptions accounted for about one-tenth of abortions in the U.S.",
      "That number has risen rapidly since 2023 when some Democratic-controlled states started adopting laws that seek to protect medical providers in their borders who prescribe abortion pills via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cTelehealth for abortion has been a huge success,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the Center of Health and Community and the University of California San Francisco. \u201cIt has helped people in an incredible way.\u201d",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton rolled out a new strategy in the fight over pills this month when he sued Dr. Maggie Carpenter, who is based in New York, alleging she prescribed and sent pills to a Texas woman.",
      "New York is one of at least eight states with a law intended to protect medical providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states with bans.",
      "If Texas prevails upon a judge to block Carpenter from prescribing in the state, it's unclear what would happen next. New York's shield law would bar it from being enforced in New York, said David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University\u2019s Thomas R. Kline School of Law.",
      "Cohen said he expects any ruling would not have a major chilling effect on other doctors who prescribe out-of-state patients. \u201cThey certainly seem undeterred by legal risk,\u201d he said.",
      "And, he said, like illegal drugs, they'll continue to be available if there's a demand for them. Cohen said Paxton \u201cis going to plug one hole if he succeeds. There's no way he plugs them all.\u201d",
      "Pill prescribing has already withstood one key effort to block it. The U.S. Supreme Court this year ruled that a group of anti-abortion physicians and organizations that represent them lacked the legal standing to force the undoing of federal approvals for mifepristone.",
      "The state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri responded in October with a legal filing contending that they can make such an argument. Instead of focusing on the drug\u2019s initial approval in 2000, they\u2019re looking at later changes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that allow its use for the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and telemedicine prescriptions.",
      "There hasn't yet been a ruling on their case. When there is, it will likely be appealed to a higher court.",
      "This year, Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Some doctors said in a legal challenge that the change could cause delays in administering them in emergencies, such as when a woman is hemorrhaging after giving birth.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Avengo, director of the New Orleans Health Department, said that in the first few months of enforcement, she did not hear of any cases where the drugs could not be accessed in time.",
      "Additional states are considering ways to restrict abortion pills in their 2025 legislative sessions.",
      "In Tennessee, a Republican state lawmaker has proposed creating a $5 million civil liability against those who deliver or help access abortion pills with the intent of helping someone end a pregnancy.",
      "Rep. Gino Bulso said he filed the bill after learning that abortion pills were being sent to Tennessee despite state law prohibiting such actions. \u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d he said.",
      "A proposal in Missouri would make it a crime to deliver mifepristone or other drugs with the intent of causing an abortion. In November, the state's voters adopted a constitutional amendment to allow abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which is somewhere past 21 weeks into a pregnancy, though there's no fixed timeframe.",
      "Trump's administration also could take action on the pill policy.",
      "One approach that abortion rights advocates have warned about \u2014 and which some abortion opponents have suggested \u2014 includes enforcing an 1873 law against pills that bans mailing medications or instruments used in abortion. President Joe Biden's administration has declined to do so.",
      "The FDA could also change its approvals of the drugs, even without being forced to do so by a court ruling.",

      "A judge has ruled that Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban is unenforceable under a new constitutional amendment",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- A judge ruled Friday that Missouri\u2019s near-total abortion ban is unenforceable under a new constitutional amendment, though Planned Parenthood said the decision is still not sufficient for it to resume providing abortions in the state.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Jerri Zhang said the abortion ban \u201cis directly at odds\u201d with a constitutional amendment creating a right to abortion that won voter approval in the November election. The judge also blocked the state from enforcing numerous other abortion restrictions, including a 72-hour waiting period and an informed consent law that required patients to be given certain state-mandated information before receiving an abortion.",
      "But the judge declined to block several other contested abortion laws, including one requiring abortion facilities to be licensed by the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Planned Parenthood said most of its facilities cannot comply with some of the licensing requirements, including \u201cmedically irrelevant\u201d size requirements for hallways, rooms and doors.",
      "\u201cWhile Planned Parenthood stands ready to start providing abortions in Missouri again as soon as the Court permits, the abortion restrictions remaining in effect \u2014 including Missouri\u2019s medically unnecessary and discriminatory clinic licensing requirement \u2013 make this impossible,\u201d Planned Parenthood said in a statement Friday night.",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in the 2024 general election to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. The Missouri amendment did not specifically override any laws. Instead, advocates had to ask a court to knock down specific laws that they believe are now unconstitutional.",
      "Zhang\u2019s injunction is preliminary, but it signals that the judge is likely to ultimately find the abortion ban unconstitutional as the lawsuit plays out.",
      "Missouri had been among the first states to implement a prohibition on most abortions after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in June 2022 overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade precedent establishing a nationwide right to abortion.",
      "Attorney General Andrew Bailey's office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Friday. Bailey, a Republican and abortion opponent, previously issued an opinion agreeing that most abortions would be legal when the amendment took effect.",
      "But Bailey\u2019s office is still fighting for a ban on most abortions after viability, along with a number of regulations that Planned Parenthood argues made it nearly impossible to offer abortions in the state even before abortion was almost completely banned in 2022.",
      "Zhang declined to block several contested Missouri abortion laws, including the licensure law, another limiting only physicians to performing abortions and still another requiring in-person appointments before abortions.",
      "Among the laws blocked by Friday's order was one prohibiting abortions solely because of a diagnosis indicating Down Syndrome. Also blocked was a telemedicine ban that requires a physician to be physically present in the room while a patient takes an abortion-causing medication. And the judge barred enforcement of another law requiring physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at certain types of hospitals located within 30 miles (48 kilometers) or 15 minutes of where an abortion is performed.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability, with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy."

      "A Texas man facing execution did not appear at the state Capitol after two failed attempts by lawmakers to issue a subpoena for his testimony",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A second attempt by Texas lawmakers to bring a man on death row to the state Capitol over doubts that he killed his 2-year-old daughter failed again Friday, dimming the likelihood of Robert Roberson testifying publicly after a last-minute subpoena halted his execution.",
      "Roberson, who had been scheduled to be die by lethal injection in October, would be the first person in the U.S. to be executed over a conviction tied to shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that medical experts have questioned.",
      "The latest unsuccessful effort to have Roberson testify comes after Texas' attorney general asked a court to block a second legislative subpoena issued by lawmakers, who are running out of time until the Legislature reconvenes in January and the subpoena expires.",
      "\u201cWe have been attempting to fight accommodation since October, and they have never responded to anything meaningfully because they don\u2019t want to have Robert here,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Joe Moody, one of the lawmakers who led the effort to halt Roberson\u2019s execution.",
      "Roberson, 58, was convicted of killing his daughter in 2003. Prosecutors argued that he violently shook his daughter back and forth, causing severe head trauma in what's called shaken baby syndrome.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers, civil rights advocates and medical experts have expressed doubts over the shaken baby diagnosis used to convict Roberson and say his daughter likely died from symptoms of severe pneumonia.",
      "The state's Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, has staunchly defended Roberson\u2019s conviction and said the science around shaken baby syndrome has not changed enough to absolve his guilt.",
      "In the court order, Paxton\u2019s office said that \u201cit is not the role of the Legislature to adjudicate offenses\u201d and that lawmakers overstepped their power when they halted his execution.",
      "The Texas House Committee on Criminal Jurisprudence issued their first subpoena for Roberson to testify one day before his scheduled execution \u2014 an unprecedent legal maneuver that successfully staved off his execution.",
      "A new execution date has not been set.",
      "Texas has a \u201cjunk science law\u201d that allows people wrongfully convicted on dubious science to have their sentences overturned. The House committee said they wanted Roberson to testify about this law and how they believe it has not worked as intended for his case. Criminal justice advocates say the state's highest criminal court has deliberately misinterpreted the law.",
      "The Texas Supreme Court ruled in November that although the subpoena was valid, it cannot be used to circumvent a scheduled execution.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Fentanyl fueled a record number of homeless deaths last year in Oregon's Multnomah County, home to Portland, according to an annual county report released Friday that officials described as showing the peak of the fentanyl crisis in the area.",
      "The report found that 456 homeless people died in the county in 2023 \u2014 the highest number on record and a 45% jump compared to 2022. Last year's deaths included 282 from unintentional drug overdose \u2014 more than double the previous year \u2014 with fentanyl contributing to 89% of those fatalities.",
      "The increase in fentanyl-related deaths among homeless people mirrors national trends, the county said in a news release, and reflects the spread of the substance in recent years from the East Coast across the Western U.S. In 2017, fentanyl was recorded as contributing to the death of one homeless person in the county; by 2023, that number had reached 251.",
      "\u201cThe devastating toll fentanyl is taking on our community is starkly apparent in this report and it is heartbreaking,\u201d Multnomah County Chair Jessica Vega Pederson said in the news release. \u201cThis is a moment for our community to grieve alongside more than 450 families who lost loved ones in 2023 and to continue providing and fighting for more behavioral health, supportive housing and other resources to respond.\u201d",
      "Methamphetamine also contributed to 81% of 2023 homeless overdose deaths.",
      "Multnomah County Health Officer Richard Bruno said the report \u201chits close to the heart,\u201d as many of the people who died were patients that he cared for in clinic. But he added that he remained optimistic about the future, following a local and state emergency declaration to address the fentanyl crisis.",
      "\u201cAs we are seeing fentanyl overdose deaths decreasing in 2024, we are hopeful that future reports will hold much lower numbers,\u201d he said in the news release.",
      "Fourteen deaths were due to homicide, and 26 deaths were attributed to suicide. Twenty-two deaths were transportation-related, with the report noting that homeless people last year were 58 times more likely to die from a transportation-related injury compared to the county's general population.",
      "There were no deaths due to heat and one due to cold exposure, according to the report.",
      "The average age at death was 46 years, roughly 30 years younger than the national life expectancy at birth."

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted sharp increases in several measures, including lab tests and emergency room visits.",
      "\u201cIt's been increasing at a pretty steady pace now for the past several weeks. So yeah, we are certainly in flu season now,\u201d said the CDC's Alicia Budd.",
      "Thirteen states reported high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week, about double from the week before. One is Tennessee, where a sickness spike is hitting the Nashville area, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University.",
      "\u201cFlu has been increasing, but just this last week has exploded,\u201d Schaffner said. He noted that in a local clinic that serves as an indicator of illness trends, as many as a quarter of the patients have flu symptoms.",
      "Louisiana is another early hot spot.",
      "\u201cJust this week is really that turning point where people are out because of the flu,\" said Dr. Catherine O\u2019Neal, an infectious diseases doctor at the largest private hospital in the state, Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge. \"You hear parents saying, \u2018I can\u2019t come to work because of the flu\u2019 and \u2018Where can I get a flu test?\u2019\u201d",
      "Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly.",
      "The most recent CDC data show COVID-19 hospitalizations have been declining since summer. COVID-19 activity is moderate nationally, but high in the Midwest, according to CDC wastewater data.",
      "RSV hospitalizations started rising before flu did and now show signs of possibly leveling off, but they remain a little more common than admissions for flu. Overall, RSV activity is low nationally, but high in the South, the wastewater data show.",
      "The CDC called the start of flu season based on several indicators, include lab results for patients in hospitals and doctor's offices, and the percentage of emergency department visits that had a discharge diagnosis of flu.",
      "No flu strain seems to be dominant, and it's too early in the season to know how good a match the flu vaccine will be, Budd said.",
      "Last winter's flu season was considered \u201cmoderate\u201d overall, but it was long \u2014 21 weeks \u2014 and the CDC estimated there were 28,000 flu-related deaths. It was unusually dangerous for children, with 205 pediatric deaths reported. That was the highest number ever reported for a conventional flu season.",
      "The long season was likely a factor, Budd said. Another factor was a lack of flu vaccinations. Among the children who died who were old enough for flu vaccinations \u2014 and for whom their vaccination status was known \u2014 80% were not fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.",
      "Vaccination rates for children are even lower this year. As of Dec. 7, about 41% of adults had received a flu vaccination, similar to the rate at the same point last year. The percentage is the same for kids, but for them that\u2019s a drop from a year ago, when 44% were vaccinated against the flu, according to CDC data.",
      "Vaccination rates are lower still against COVID-19, with about 21% of adults and 11% of children up to date.",
      "Flu experts suggest everyone get vaccinated, especially as people prepare to attend holiday gatherings where respiratory viruses can spread widely.",
      "\u201cAll those gatherings that are so heartwarming and fun and joyous are also an opportunity for this virus to spread person to person,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cIt's not too late to get vaccinated.\u201d",

      "Both drugs are part of the GLP-1 class that has shown unprecedented results for helping people shed weight by decreasing appetite and boosting feelings of fullness. Wegovy and Ozempic \u2014 competing drugs from Novo Nordisk \u2014 remain on the FDA\u2019s shortage list.",

      "It\u2019s an update of the agency\u2019s definition originally devised 30 years ago. The move is aimed at helping Americans navigate food labels at the grocery store and make choices that are aligned with federal dietary guidelines \u2014 in hopes of reducing rates of diet-related chronic disease, the FDA said.",
      "Under the rule, products that claim to be \u201chealthy\u201d must contain a certain amount of food from one or more food groups such as fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy and protein. And for the first time, the rule sets certain limits for added sugars. Foods must also limit sodium and saturated fat at levels that depend on the type of product, the FDA said.",

      "Tests showed that the strain that caused the person's illness is one found in wild birds, but not in cattle. Last month, health officials in Canada reported that a teen in British Columbia was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu, also with the virus strain found in wild birds.",
      "Previous infections in the U.S. have been almost all in farmworkers with direct exposure to infected dairy cattle or poultry. In two cases \u2014 and adult in Missouri and a child in California \u2014 health officials have not determined how they caught it.",
      "It's possible that as more people become infected, more severe illnesses will occur, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "Worldwide, nearly 1,000 cases of illnesses caused by H5N1 have been reported since 2003, and more than half of people infected have died, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "\u201cI assume that every H5N1 virus has the potential to be very severe and deadly,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "People who have contact with dairy cows or commercial poultry or with backyard birds are at higher risk and should use precautions including respiratory and eye protection and gloves, CDC and other experts said.",
      "\u201cIf birds are beginning to appear ill or die, they should very careful about how they handle those animals,\u201d said Michael Osterholm, a public health disease expert at the University of Minnesota.",
      "The CDC has paid for flu shots to protect farmworkers against seasonal flu \u2014 and against the risk that the workers could become infected with two flu types at the same time, potentially allowing the bird flu virus to mutate and become more dangerous. The government also said that farmworkers who come in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered antiviral drugs even if they show no symptoms.",
      "In addition to direct contact with farm animals and wild birds, the H5N1 virus can be spread in raw milk. Pasteurized milk is safe to drink, because the heat treatment kills the virus, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "But high levels of the virus have been found in unpasteurized milk. And raw milk sold in stores in California was recalled in recent weeks after the virus was detected at farms and in the products.",
      "In Los Angeles, county officials reported that two indoor cats that were fed the recalled raw milk died from bird flu infections. Officials were investigating additional reports of sick cats.",
      "Health officials urge people to avoid drinking raw milk, which can spread a host of germs in addition to bird flu.",
      "The U.S. Agriculture Department has stepped up testing of raw milk across the country to help detect and contain the outbreak. A federal order issued this month requires testing, which began this week in 13 states.",

      "In addition, participants had less positive attitudes toward patients as measured by Provider Attitudes Toward Sickle Cell Patients Scale (PASS) scores after hearing biased handoffs (mean scores 22.9 vs 25.2, P<0.001), they reported in JAMA Network Open.",
      "",
      "\"People are getting it right more often when they hear the neutral [version],\" Wesevich told MedPage Today. \"It's pretty compelling that there's some sort of distraction or cognitive effect of having to neutralize out the biased phrases.\"",
      "",
      "In an invited commentary, Somnath Saha, MD, MPH, and Mary Catherine Beach, MD, MPH, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, called the effect of biased language on information recall \"intriguing.\"",
      "",
      "\"At first glance, it seems that this effect might be a matter of simple distraction,\" they wrote. \"The human brain has finite capacity for retaining information, and the addition of clinically uninformative details might have crowded out information that was clinically important.\"",
      "",
      "The findings suggest that \"by engendering more negative attitudes toward the patient,\" they added, \"stigmatizing language may lessen the clinician's investment in the patient's well-being and thereby reduce the clinician's motivation to retain the information needed to provide optimal care for the patient.\"",
      "",
      "Wesevich and colleagues surveyed 169 residents and medical students (56% female, mean age 28.6), each of whom heard three recorded handoffs, which were a combination of neutral and biased. The biased handoffs were one of three types  --  stereotype, blame, or doubt  --  and they all came from a previous study by Wesevich's group.",
      "",
      "That study involved recording residents doing handoffs, and it found that biased phrases were more common in notes about patients who were Black or obese. While they changed small details to protect patient identity, the biased handoffs are largely true to the words used in the recorded handoffs in the earlier study, Wesevich told MedPage Today.",
      "",
      "An example of a biased handoff with blame was about an adult patient with diabetes who \"cut her dose in half 2 months ago because she was having some falls and thought she was getting hypoglycemic but never actually checked her blood glucose.\" The neutral version of that handoff was rephrased to describe someone who \"cut her dose in half after experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms.\"",
      "",
      "After residents listened to three handoffs, the researchers followed up with three items: a multiple-choice clinical information recall question; an adapted version of the PASS scale to assess attitudes towards patients; and three open-ended \"key takeaway\" responses.",
      "",
      "Overall, Wesevich and colleagues found that those who heard biased handoffs had less accurate clinical information recall compared with those who heard neutral ones, but the difference wasn't statistically significant.",
      "",
      "They also found that those who reported bias as a key takeaway of the handoff had lower clinical information recall accuracy than those who did not (85% vs 93%; OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26-0.85, P=0.01).",
      "",
      "In addition, participants had lower empathy scores as measured by PASS item 2 when hearing biased handoffs compared with neutral ones (3.1 vs 3.3, P<0.001), and more positive attitudes toward patients were associated with higher clinical information recall accuracy (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22).",
      "",
      "Wesevich and colleagues concluded that biased handoffs can \"adversely impact the quality of care for Black patients\" as they impeded the accurate transfer of key clinical information and diminished empathy, \"potentially endangering patients and worsening health disparities.\"",
      "",
      "\"If you're trying to add context to who someone is ... and you choose negative phrases, you wield a lot of power about how that person is viewed,\" Wesevich said, adding that it would be helpful for physicians to have trainings or monitoring or \"accept the recommendations by multiple national organizations to standardize the handoff process.\"",
      "",
      "\"It's okay to recognize that we have biases and stereotypes,\" he added. \"If clinicians can accept that they're human beings that have things to work on, and by taking some of these measures, we can try to reduce the impact of implicit biases on the care of patients  --  that level of honesty and introspection will go a long way.\"",
      "",
      "The study was limited because the handoffs were simulated, and thus could be different in clinical settings. Also, the findings may not be generalizable outside of residents and medical students.",

      "His King's Speech, which will be broadcast in the afternoon on Christmas Day, was recorded at Fitzrovia Chapel in London, which was part of the now-demolished Middlesex Hospital where his first wife, Diana, opened London\u2019s first dedicated ward for those with AIDS. The building is richly decorated in a Gothic Revival style featuring more than 500 stars in a gold leaf ceiling.",
      "\u201cI assume that this space, being one of calm reflection, but also thinking about health, about care, about the medical profession, would make it a pretty apt choice,\u201d said Carla Whalen, chair of the Fitzrovia Chapel Foundation\u2019s board of trustees.",
      "The broadcast is watched by millions of people in the United Kingdom and across the Commonwealth.",
      "In keeping with the King\u2019s desire to go into the community, he tasked the team organizing the broadcast with finding a site away from the royal estate. It's a rare occasion when the monarch's Christmas message is not recorded from one of the royal residences, notably Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. The last time his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, recorded her message outside the royal estate was in 2006.",
      "The criteria were clear: the building had to have health connections, a strong community presence and a place of solace and reflection for those with faith or none.",
      "This is the king\u2019s third Christmas speech since he ascended the throne after the queen died in September 2022. It is the first since he was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February.",

      "In a voiceover for the broadcast of her annual Christmas carol service at Westminster Abbey, which was recorded this month but broadcast on Tuesday evening, Kate reflected on the love and support that she has received.",
      "\u201cThe Christmas story encourages us to consider the experiences and feelings of others,\" she said. \u201cIt also reflects our own vulnerabilities and reminds us of the importance of giving and receiving empathy, as well as just how much we need each other in spite of our differences.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Camilla has had a lingering chest infection in recent weeks and hasn\u2019t been able to attend certain events, including last month\u2019s remembrance service for fallen service personnel.",
      "The royal family, including Prince William and Kate and their three children, will be spending Christmas Day at the Sandringham Estate in eastern England.",
      "Charles' brother Prince Andrew is not expected to be there, according to U.K. media, in a bid to spare the royal family from further embarrassment following the revelation that a suspected Chinese spy with business ties to the Duke of York was barred from the U.K. because of concerns he poses a threat to national security.",

      "The riots, which caused an international outcry and accusations of deliberate anti-Semitic attacks, left 5 people in hospital and 20 others with minor injuries. More than 60 suspects were detained.",
      "The court on Tuesday sentenced one man to 6 month in prison, another to 2 1/2 months, two to 1 month in jail and one to 100 hours of community service.",
      "A series of violent incidents took place between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli soccer fans around the soccer match.",
      "Some of the violence was condemned as anti-Semitic, with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offering to evacuate Maccabi supporters. The violence, which garnered headlines world-wide, damaged Amsterdam\u2019s reputation as a beacon of tolerance and haven for persecuted religions, including Jews.",
      "\u201cIt seems that the violence arose from strong pro-Palestine sentiments and dissatisfaction with the situation in Gaza, and related anger against the Israelis present,\u201d the prosecutors\u2019 office said in a statement at the conclusion of hearings two weeks ago.",
      "The five defendants, aged between 19 and 32, were accused of public violence, theft and assault.",
      "The Nov. 8 game was allowed to go ahead after The Netherlands\u2019 counter-terror watchdog found there was no \u201cconcrete threat\u201d to Israeli fans, and the match wasn\u2019t considered a high risk. Even so, Amsterdam authorities banned a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the Johan Cruyff Arena.",
      "According to an investigation, the day before the game the authorities reported several incidents, including Israeli fans tearing a Palestinian from an Amsterdam building and attacking a cab. In response, taxi drivers sought to mobilize online, centering on a casino where some 400 Israeli fans were gathered. Police were mobilized to avoid a major confrontation.",
      "Six more suspects will have their trials on a later date, including three minors. Under Dutch rules, proceedings for juveniles are held behind closed doors. Police are continuing to investigate the violence and have released images of several suspects they hope to identify.",

      "The United States and the United Kingdom have expressed deep concern over the recent handing down of convictions by Pakistani military courts to 25 civilian supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan over last year's riots",
      "ISLAMABAD -- The United States and the United Kingdom have expressed deep concern over the recent handing down of convictions by Pakistani military courts to 25 civilian supporters of former Prime Minister Imran Khan over their alleged involvement in riots last year.",
      "The convictions had previously also been criticized by the European Union and domestic human rights activists.",
      "\u201cThe United States is deeply concerned that Pakistani civilians have been sentenced by a military tribunal for their involvement in protests on May 9, 2023. These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,\u201d according to a statement released by State Department on Monday.",
      "It asked Pakistan to respect the right to a fair trial and due process.",
      "In London, the Foreign Office said that \u201cwhile the U.K. respects Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty over its own legal proceedings, trying civilians in military courts lacks transparency, independent scrutiny and undermines the right to a fair trial. We call on the Government of Pakistan to uphold its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\u201d",
      "The statements were referring to the violence that erupted after Khan\u2019s arrest in Islamabad in May 2023. The former premier was ousted through a no-confidence vote in the parliament in 2022, and he was convicted of corruption and sentenced in August 2023. Since then, Khan has been behind bars. Khan\u2019s popular opposition party is in talks with the government to secure his release.",
      "The 25 supporters on Monday received prison terms ranging from two years to 10 years, which the army in a statement warned acted as a \u201cstark reminder\u201d for people to never take the law into their own hands.",
      "Khan's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI, has rejected the convictions of civilians, demanding they should be tried in the normal courts if they were involved in the riots.",
      "There was no response from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government to the criticism from the U.S. and the U.K., but state-run Pakistan Television on Tuesday showed people welcoming the convictions, saying the punishments were given to people who attacked military installations.",
      "Earlier this month, Khan and dozens of others were indicted by a civilian court on charges of inciting people on May 9, 2023, when demonstrators attacked the military\u2019s headquarters in Rawalpindi, stormed an air base in Mianwali in the eastern Punjab province and torched a building housing state-run Radio Pakistan in the northwest."

      "A former finance minister, Eke won the secret ballot by 16-8 votes, defeating the only other candidate, Trade Minister Viliame Latu, was nominated by the current government. They both addressed parliament for about 20 minutes before the results were announced on Tuesday afternoon.",
      "The tourism-dependent Tonga has struggled to rebound from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, growing threats from climate change and a catastrophic 2022 volcanic eruption and tsunami, which battered beachfront resorts, homes and businesses around the country's 171 islands.",

      "The resignation of Eke's predecessor Siaosi Sovaleni capped a period of fraught relations between his government and Tonga\u2019s king.

      "Old liberation movements in Southern Africa suffered serious electoral declines this year as millions of people made their voices heard in elections",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- In Southern Africa, where democracy remains relatively stable, elections held in 2024 saw long-governing liberation parties struggling to survive.",
      "Across Africa, power struggles involving military governments, coup attempts and armed conflict are common, but the southern region has largely been more stable and elections in some countries brought joy and hopes of a better future.",
      "Not so much though for some long-governing parties. The decades-old goodwill of liberating their countries from colonial rule appears to be giving way to frustration over economic problems and limited opportunities for young people in the region.",
      "As voters become younger, and without personal memories of colonialism, which ended before they were born, liberation struggle-era parties in Southern Africa lost power or were given a wake-up call in 2024.",
      "For many young voters, performance of the government matters more than historic liberation struggle era credentials that these parties have relied on to stay in power for decades, resulting in \u201cthe shifting political tectonic plates we are seeing,\u201d said Nic Cheeseman, a political scientist and professor at the University of Birmingham in England.",
      "\u201cGenerational change is an important factor in the shifting political tectonic plates we are seeing. People want jobs and dignity \u2014 you can\u2019t eat memories,\u201d said Cheeseman, who researches African politics.",
      "Botswana, a tiny nation of about 2.5 million people with a history of democratic stability, provided the biggest shock as the economy suffered from a global downturn in demand for mined diamonds, and levels of youth unemployment rose.",
      "Opposition supporters dressed in blue and white took to the streets to celebrate, while then President Mokgweetsi Masisi conceded defeat even before the vote count was over following an election held in late October. The opposition landslide marked the end of the 58 years in power of the Botswana Democratic Party, which had governed the country since independence from the United Kingdom in 1966.",
      "Months earlier, South African voters turned against the African National Congress, the party led by anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela in the 1990s. In May, the ANC lost its majority, forcing it to share power with the opposition.",
      "The result put South Africa on an uncharted political path for the first time since the end of apartheid three decades ago. The ANC has been gradually losing support since the 2009 national election, also ceding political control of major cities because of widespread discontent over corruption, service delivery failures and economic struggles. However, its drop from 57.5% of support to 40% in May was its biggest loss yet.",
      "In Namibia, the candidate of the long-governing South West Africa People\u2019s Organization, or SWAPO \u2014 72-year-old Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah \u2014 made history by becoming the country\u2019s first female president.",
      "However, SWAPO won 51 seats in the parliamentary vote, only just passing the 49 it needed to keep its majority and narrowly avoiding becoming another liberation struggle party to be rejected in Southern Africa this year. This marked SWAPO\u2019s worst parliamentary result since Namibia gained independence from South Africa\u2019s apartheid government in 1990, signaling a potential shift in the country\u2019s political landscape.",
      "Many liberation governments have reason to be worried even though the consistency of democratic processes could be lauded, said Nicole Beardsworth, politics researcher and lecturer at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.",
      "\u201cWhat we see in Southern Africa is a relative stability in terms of democratic standards, where citizens seem to believe that their votes matter and that they count. So this does present a concern for ruling parties,\u201d Beardsworth said.",
      "In Mozambique, results that extended the governing Frelimo party's nearly half-century in power following an election in October ignited protests that resulted in the death of at least 100 people, according to Amnesty International.",
      "Exiled opposition leader Venancio Mondlane, capitalizing on growing youth discontent in the country of 34 million people, has challenged the election outcome in court. Also, he has continued calling for protests that range from street marches to road and border blockades and the banging of pots.",
      "A similar situation occurred in January in the Indian Ocean island nation of Comoros, where news of incumbent President Azali Assoumani winning a fourth term triggered violent unrest that left one person dead and scores others injured.",
      "Cheeseman, the political researcher, said that protests, including in countries where democracy is thwarted, reflect \u201cgrowing signs \u2014 from protests to online dissent \u2014 that public opinion is already turning.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven citizens who have lost faith in democracy want responsive and accountable government, and to have their voices heard,\u201d he said.",
      "Elections swept away ruling parties in several countries elsewhere in the region and across the economically troubled continent of more than 1.4 billion people and home to the world\u2019s youngest population.",
      "The Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, one of Africa\u2019s most stable democracies, saw an opposition coalition grab all contested parliamentary seats, driving out the government led by Pravind Jugnauth, who was replaced by former Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam.",

And hopes for change continue running high in a country where more than 60% of the population is under age 25 and 90% work in informal jobs, after Faye\u2019s PASTEF party won 130 of 165 seats.",
      "Former President John Dramani Mahama returned to power in Ghana, as voters vented their anger over the policies of outgoing President Nana Akufo-Addo in early December. The 65-year-old Mahama\u2019s National Democratic Congress also won the majority in parliament.",

      "The opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, wants independent investigators, and gave Han until Tuesday to approve bills appointing them.",
      "Impeaching Han would further deepen political chaos and worries by neighboring countries. Han, the country\u2019s No. 2 official, has taken over the president's powers since Yoon\u2019s impeachment. If he\u2019s impeached too, the finance minister is next in line.",
      "The Democratic Party has slammed Han for vetoing several opposition-sponsored bills, including a controversial agriculture bill. It also urged Han to quickly appoint justices to vacant seats on the Constitutional Court, which is reviewing Yoon\u2019s impeachment and will determine whether to dismiss or reinstate him.",

      "South Korean prosecutors and other officials are separately probing whether Yoon committed rebellion and abuse of power, but he\u2019s ignored requests by investigative agencies to appear for questioning and allow searches of his office.",
      "Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several other senior military commanders have already been arrested over the deployment of troops and police officers to the National Assembly, which prompted a dramatic standoff that ended when lawmakers managed to enter the chamber and voted unanimously to overrule Yoon's decree.",
      "The governing People Power Party said that the opposition's impeachment threats are interfering with Han\u2019s \u201clegitimate exercise of authority.\" Floor leader Kweon Seong-dong, a Yoon loyalist, said the Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cpolitics of intimidation have reached their peak.\u201d",

      "A short while later, Fabio Ochoa was again a free man.",
      "Ochoa arrived in Bogota on a deportation flight on Monday afternoon, wearing a modest grey sweatshirt and carrying his personal belongings in a plastic bag. After stepping out of the plane, Ochoa was met by immigration officials in bullet proof vests. There were no police on site to detain him.",

      "American Airlines briefly grounded flights nationwide due to a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive and winter weather threatened more potential problems for those planning to fly or drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- American Airlines briefly grounded flights nationwide Tuesday because of a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive and winter weather threatened more potential problems for those planning to fly or drive.",
      "Government regulators cleared American flights to get airborne about an hour after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered a national ground stop for the airline. The order, which prevented planes from taking off, was issued at the airline's request after it experienced trouble with its flight operating system, or FOS. The airline blamed technology from one of its vendors.",
      "As a result, flights were delayed across American\u2019s major hubs, with only 37% of the airline's 3,901 domestic and international flights leaving on time, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. Nineteen flights were canceled.",
      "Dennis Tajer, a spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association, a union representing American Airlines pilots, said the airline told pilots at 7 a.m. Eastern that there was an outage affecting the FOS system. It handles different types of airline operations, including dispatch, flight planning, passenger boarding, as well as an airplane's weight and balance data, he said.",
      "Some components of FOS have gone down in the past, but a systemwide outage is rare, Tajer said.",
      "Hours after the ground stop was lifted, Tajer said the union had not heard about any \u201cchaos out there beyond just the normal heavy travel day.\u201d He said officials were watching for any cascading effects, such as staffing problems.",
      "On social media, however, customers expressed frustrations about delays that caused them or their family members to miss connecting flights. One person asked if American planned to hold flights for passengers to make connections, while others complained about the lack of assistance they said they received from the airline or gate agents.",
      "Cirium noted that the vast majority of flights were departing within two hours of their scheduled departure time. A similar percentage \u2014 36% \u2014 were arriving at their destinations as scheduled.",
      "Dallas-Fort Worth, New York\u2019s Kennedy Airport and Charlotte, North Carolina, saw the greatest number of delays, Cirium said. Washington, Chicago and Miami experienced considerably fewer delays.",
      "Meanwhile, the flight-tracking site FlightAware reported that 4,058 flights entering or leaving the U.S., or serving domestic destinations, were delayed, with 76 flights canceled. The site had not posted any American Airlines flights on Tuesday morning, but showed in the afternoon that 961 American flights were delayed.",
      "Amid the travel problems, significant rain and snow were expected in the Pacific Northwest at least into Christmas Day. Showers and thunderstorms were developing in the South. Freezing rain was reported in the Mid-Atlantic region near Baltimore and Washington, and snow fell in New York.",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \u201cinterline agreements\u201d that let them put stranded customers on another carrier\u2019s flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That\u2019s because finding a last-minute flight on another airline tends to be expensive.",
      "An American spokesperson said Tuesday was not a peak travel day for the airline \u2014 with about 2,000 fewer flights than the busiest days \u2014 so the airline had somewhat of a buffer to manage the delays.",
      "The groundings happened as millions of travelers were expected to fly over the next 10 days. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers through Jan. 2.",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Thursday, Friday and Sunday.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations more disruptive than during slower periods. Even with just a brief outage, the cancellations have a cascading effect that can take days to clear up.",
      "About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.",
      "\u201cAirline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,\u201d AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.04 a gallon, down from $3.13 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation\u2019s highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper leaves his job next week after eight years",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is leaving his job after eight years in which the southern Democrat picked his moments against a Republican-dominated legislature, winning big on Medicaid expansion and clean energy while falling short in fights over private-school vouchers and abortion rights.",
      "Cooper, who steered the state through the coronavirus pandemic, Hurricanes Helene and Florence and an early flashpoint in the culture wars over access to public restrooms, was barred from seeking a third consecutive term. He is wrapping up 24 consecutive years in statewide office \u2014 the first 16 as attorney general.",
      "In a December interview with The Associated Press at the executive mansion, Cooper reflected on his gubernatorial terms with an emphasis on the positive \u2014 an easier undertaking compared with many Democrats around the country in the aftermath of this year's election.",
      "\"To be able to wake up every morning and get to lead the state that you love has been humbling, challenging and fulfilling. I have really valued every day,\u201d said Cooper, who will be succeeded by state Attorney General Josh Stein, a fellow Democrat, in early January.",
      "Faced with veto-proof majorities for almost half of his time as governor, Cooper was unable to stop many GOP initiatives, including deep income tax cuts, taxpayer-funded vouchers to help public school students attend private schools and new restrictions on abortion.",
      "But Cooper, one of several Democratic governors seen as potential contenders for federal office, managed last year to persuade GOP legislative leaders to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 something he had sought since getting sworn in as governor in 2017. Now 600,000 low-income adults are enrolled in the program a year ahead of expectations.",
      "\u201cThis is a generational investment in people\u2019s health,\u201d Cooper said during a farewell address last week in Nash County, where he grew up and launched his first gubernatorial campaign in 2015. Another bipartisan agreement was reached in 2021 on a milestone energy bill that ordered sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.",
      "Cooper takes credit for conditions that led to big corporate expansions that he says have contributed to hundreds of thousands of new jobs being created during the past eight years, including those in the clean energy sector. But he also gives his rare praise to Republican lawmakers for all working together on offering economic incentives that have lured companies such as Apple, Toyota and Boom Supersonic to build in the state.",
      "Still, Republicans contend Cooper receives too much acclaim for the state\u2019s broad economic success and has pushed for reckless state spending at every turn. Half of his record 100-plus vetoes were overridden.",
      "\u201cThere has not been a governor who has had less of his agenda enacted and North Carolina has succeeded in spite of his leadership failures,\" state GOP spokesperson Matt Mercer said.",
      "Regardless, Cooper\u2019s perceived accomplishments in a swing state raised his national profile during this year\u2019s presidential campaign, making him as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris until he said it \"just wasn\u2019t the right time\" for him and for North Carolina. Now Cooper, 67, will have to decide whether trying to unseat U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican, in 2026 is in the cards after holding what he calls the \u201cbest job I have ever had.\u201d",
      "While North Carolina Democrats have won eight of past nine gubernatorial elections, they haven\u2019t won a U.S. Senate race since 2008.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to run for public office again, you must have your heart and soul in it, you must have the fire in the belly,\u201d Cooper told the AP.",
      "With that in mind, he said he planned to take a couple of months to clear his head before deciding what\u2019s next: \u201cI\u2019m going to think about how I can best contribute to the things that I care about.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s little wonder why many North Carolina Democrats want Cooper to remain on the political stage. He has never lost a race for state office, from the legislature in the mid-1980s and including a 10,000-vote win over then-GOP Gov. Pat McCrory in 2016.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s done really from my perspective is he\u2019s kept the progressive flame alive in North Carolina in a difficult time,\u201d said Gary Pearce, a longtime Democratic political consultant who worked with four-term Gov. Jim Hunt. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody else could have done it as well as he did.\u201d",
      "Cooper took on Republicans even before he was sworn in.",
      "As governor-elect he began a series of lawsuits challenging legislation approved weeks before he took office that shifted executive branch powers to the legislature. The legal results were mixed, and even now litigation over his appointment powers remains in court. This month, Republican lawmakers enacted more changes that would weaken Stein's gubernatorial authority. Two lawsuits related to that law have been filed so far.",
      "In his first three months in office, Cooper worked with lawmakers to partially repeal the 2016 \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which had required transgender people to use public bathrooms aligned with the gender on their birth certificate. The law had lost the state business, including canceled sporting events and job expansions, and \u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s reputation was in tatters,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Eight years later, \u201cwe built a North Carolina that is healthier, better educated, with more money in people\u2019s pockets, and we stand ready to welcome prosperity with open arms for generations to come,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Republicans cite several shortcomings in Cooper's administration. They include spending overruns at the state Department of Transportation; continued delays to rebuild or renovate homes for eastern North Carolina residents after Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018; and executive orders that helped extend restrictions on businesses and school instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful dealing with the governor fiscally,\u201d Republican state Sen. Warren Daniel said. \u201cI just think he\u2019s not very good at managing government.\u201d",
      "Cooper has defended his actions, particularly his pandemic leadership, saying North Carolina came out better than many other states.",
      "Even in policy defeats, Cooper secured the admiration of supporters. The Democratic governor used lots of political capital in 2023 trying unsuccessfully to block a law that changed the state\u2019s ban on most abortions from after 20 weeks of pregnancy to 12 weeks. Republicans overrode his veto.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s simply no governor who\u2019s ever fought as hard or as publicly as Gov. Cooper has to protect access to abortion,\u201d said Paige Johnson with Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Plenty of North Carolinians see that differently. Cooper\u2019s opposition to the abortion bill reflects an administration that \u201chas been consistently hostile to policies that serve the best interests of North Carolina families,\u201d said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition.",
      "Cooper said he has confidence that Stein, who succeeded him as attorney general, will \u201ccontinue a lot of the progress that we have made.\u201d Cooper hired Stein two decades ago, while attorney general, to be his consumer protection chief.",
      "Otherwise, Cooper knows that he\u2019ll miss \u201chaving the opportunity every single day to do something to make a real difference.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what you can do in this job,\u201d he added. \"And whatever I decide to do, that\u2019s going to be hard to replicate.\""

    "summary": "A powerful government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel",
    "story": [
      "A powerful government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel",
      "WASHINGTON -- A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving the decision to President Joe Biden, who opposes the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March. He has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "Both Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is giving up Nippon Steel's potential investments in the mills and upgrades that might help preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "Under the terms of the proposed $14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steelmakers in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\u201d",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \u201cblock this deal from happening.\u201d He proposed reviving U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \u201cthrough a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\u201d",
      "The steelworkers union questions if Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\u201cOur union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it\u2019s up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\u201d David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\u201d",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \u201cis the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\u201d",
      "Nippon Steel said Tuesday that it had been informed by CFIUS that it had referred the case to Biden, and urged him to \u201creflect on the great lengths that we have gone to to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U. S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that our transaction should and will be approved if it is fairly evaluated on its merits,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "A growing number of conservatives have publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and officials in areas near its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America\u2019s manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement to protect national security.",
      "Congress significantly expanded the committee's powers through the 2018 Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",
      "In September, Biden issued an executive order broadening the factors the committee should consider when reviewing deals \u2014 such as how they impact the U.S. supply chain or if they put Americans\u2019 personal data at risk.",
      "Nippon Steel has factories in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world\u2019s top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

      "A five-day strike by Starbucks baristas had closed at least 59 stores as of Monday afternoon, according to the union organizing the workers",
      "A five-day strike by Starbucks baristas had closed 59 stores as of Monday afternoon, according to the union organizing the workers.",
      "The strike, which began Friday in Los Angeles, Chicago and Starbucks' hometown of Seattle, spread Monday to stores in Boston, Dallas and Portland, Ore. Workers in New York, Denver, Pittsburgh and other cities had also joined the strike over the weekend.",
      "Workers are protesting a lack of progress in contract negotiation with the company. Starbucks Workers United, which began the unionization effort in 2021, said Starbucks has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year.",
      "The union also wants the company to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. Since 2021, baristas at 535 company-owned U.S. Starbucks stores have voted to join the union.",
      "The strike comes at one of the busiest times of the year for Starbucks. But the company said Monday it has had \u201cno significant impact\u201d to its store operations. Starbucks has around 10,000 company-operated stores in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe respect our partners\u2019 right to engage in lawful strike activity, and we appreciate the thousands of partners across the country who are continuing to support each other and deliver the Starbucks experience for our customers,\" the company said Monday in a statement.",
      "The two side have been bargaining since the spring but appear to have reached an impasse over economic issues. Starbucks said it has committed to an annual pay increase of 1.5% or more for unionized workers. If the company gave a lower increase to non-union workers in any given year, it still would give union workers a 1.5% increase.",
      "Starbucks said its U.S. baristas make an average of $18 per hour. With benefits \u2014 including health care, free college tuition and paid family leave \u2014 Starbucks\u2019 pay package is worth an average of $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week, the company said.",
      "Workers say they deserve more, and note that Starbucks' new Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol, who started in September, could make more than $100 million in his first year on the job."

      "FLINT, Mich. -- The president of a chemical company has been charged in connection with the unauthorized discharge of oil that left a miles-long dark, oily sheen on the Flint River in Michigan more than two years ago.",
      "Rajinder Singh Minhas, 60, of Rochester, Michigan, was arrested and arraigned last week on charges of falsely altering a public record, substantial endangerment to the public, discharge of injurious substance to waters of the state, false statements and omissions regarding air pollution control and other charges, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said Monday.",
      "Minhas also served as director and treasurer of Flint-based Lockhart Chemical which manufactures coatings, metalworking additives, hydraulic fluids and lubricants.",
      "Critical maintenance and upgrades at the facility allegedly were mismanaged and neglected, Nessel said in a release.",
      "About 15,000 gallons of an oil-chemical mixture was released June 15, 2022. The spill came from a storm sewer that discharges into the river, a spokesperson for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy said at the time.",
      "The state later required the company to immediately stop using defective wastewater and stormwater conveyance systems and to make other changes. Lockhart has since filed for bankruptcy.",
      "Officials said Flint\u2019s drinking water was not threatened. Flint used the river for drinking water in 2014-15 before lead contamination caused the city to return to Lake Huron water provided by a regional supplier.",
      "Minhas has been released on a personal bond and is due back in court Jan. 2 for a probable cause conference, according to court records.",
      "The Associated Press attempted Monday to reach Lockhart Chemical for comment but the telephone number listed for the company was disconnected. A voicemail seeking comment was left Monday afternoon for Minhas' attorney."

      "Government safety regulators are closing an investigation into two previous recalls of the Ford Focus after determining that Ford Motor Co. has satisfied its concerns",
      "Government safety regulators said Monday they have closed an investigation into two previous recalls of the Ford Focus after determining that Ford Motor Co. has satisfied its concerns.",
      "In 2018, Ford recalled around 1.5 million Ford Focus sedans from the 2012-2018 model years because they could lose power. The issue was a malfunctioning canister purge valve and software that didn\u2019t adequately detect when it was stuck open. If the valve was stuck open, excessive vacuum could build up in the fuel management system and deform the fuel tank.",
      "Five crashes and two injuries were reported related to the issue, but no fatalities.",
      "Ford fixed the software in that recall and updated the software again in a separate 2019 recall. But in 2023, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation into those previous recalls after receiving 98 consumer complaints alleging that their Ford Focus sedans still lost power.",
      "This fall, Ford began offering a customer satisfaction program that will replace the canister purge valve in the affected vehicles. Ford said the valve may not function properly, which can cause the vehicle to hesitate or stall at low speeds.",
      "NHTSA said Ford\u2019s latest program resolves its concerns so it\u2019s closing its investigation into the previous recalls.",

    "story": [
      "A biologist hid 350 audio monitors across Costa Rica\u2019s tropical rainforests to spy on endangered spider monkeys in order to help protect them",
      "PUERTO JIM\u00c9NEZ, Costa Rica -- The endangered Geoffrey\u2019s spider monkeys that dangle high in the rainforest canopy are elusive and hard for scientists to track.",
      "So biologist Jenna Lawson hid 350 audio monitors in trees across Costa Rica's lush Osa Peninsula to spy on them.",
      "The devices recorded the sounds of the forest and surrounding countryside for a week, collecting so much data that Lawson could have spent years listening to it all.",
      "Instead, she fed it into artificial intelligence systems trained to instantly recognize spider monkey calls and detect where the animals traveled. One of the world\u2019s largest acoustic wildlife studies when Lawson began the project in 2021, it revealed troubling findings about the health of a treasured wildlife refuge.",
      "More of this AI-assisted wildlife surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d as some 28% of all plant and animal species are now at risk of extinction, according to a paper published in the academic journal Science this summer. Researchers from Dutch and Danish universities showed that machine-learning techniques can \u201chandle huge amounts of data and uncover sound patterns, allowing for faster, cheaper, and better ecological studies\u201d that can aid in biodiversity conservation. But many technical challenges remain.",
      "Tech giant Microsoft's philanthropic AI for Good Lab announced this month it is hoping to answer some of those technical challenges with a new kind of hardware and computing system for eavesdropping on the planet's wildest places.",
      "\u201cThose remote places are also the most important places on the Earth from a biodiversity perspective,\u201d said Microsoft's chief data scientist, Juan Lavista Ferres, in an interview last week by video call from Colombia, where a research team was preparing to test the new approach.",
      "Powered by the sun and energy-efficient AI computer chips, the devices can run for years rather than weeks without human intervention. And they can regularly transmit their data online via low-Earth orbit satellites. It's called Sparrow, short for Solar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation Watch.",
      "Pablo Arbelaez, director of an AI-focused research center at the University of the Andes, said a first Sparrow test will happen in a jungle preserve along Colombia's largest river, the Magdalena. Eventually, the researchers hope to get a better idea of how deforestation \u2014 and efforts to reverse it \u2014 is affecting the population behavior of jaguars, blue-beaked paujil birds, spider monkeys and other endangered species.",
      "Another project closer to Microsoft headquarters will monitor forests in Washington state's Cascade Mountains. By late 2025, Lavista Ferres plans to have devices on all continents, from remote corners of the Amazon rainforest to gorilla habitats of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That will then be \u201copen-sourced\u201d to make it accessible to a wide body of researchers in real time, but with measures to obscure sensitive location data.",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is these devices to ever be used for poachers to understand where the animals are,\u201d Lavista Ferres said.",
      "It was a concern about encroachments on Costa Rican spider monkey habitat that led Lawson, then at Imperial College London, to undertake her ambitious bio-acoustic study three years ago. She persuaded landowners to let her place recording devices on their properties outside Corcovado National Park, a jewel of Costa Rica's decades-long efforts to preserve biodiversity by encouraging wildlife tourism.",
      "\u201cShe basically realized the spider monkey is in a really critical situation,\u201d said local environmentalist and bug scientist Jim C\u00f3rdoba-Alfaro. On a follow-up visit last year, he and Lawson trekked across a private reserve with an Associated Press reporter to observe the monkeys and check on the audio monitors.",
      "Compared to the charismatic capuchin monkey and the notoriously loud howler monkey -- both commonly seen or heard throughout Costa Rica \u2014 spider monkeys are far more wary of humans and the changes they bring.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re the most sensitive of the primates that we have here,\u201d said Lawson. \u201cThe spider monkey would be the first animal to leave when there\u2019s signs of trouble. They would be the last animal to come back once forests are restored because they need mature secondary and primary forest to be able to survive.\u201d",
      "The Royal Society of London in March 2023 published Lawson's findings of what the audio monitors revealed: the spider monkeys weren't going anywhere near paved roads or the plantations harvesting palm oil and teak wood that bisect the region's protected national parks. That meant government-designated wildlife corridors meant to extend their range through and beyond the Osa Peninsula were not working as well as designed. She came back to present those conclusions to local officials.",
      "After hours of searching, a troop of spider monkeys appeared \u2014 peering down at the humans who found them. Within moments, they were on their way again \u2014 extending their lanky arms and prehensile tails to grasp at trees and propel themselves across the canopy with spidery acrobatics.",
      "Unattended acoustic detection of animal sounds is valuable not just in rainforests but in a wide variety of ecosystems, according to the Science paper published earlier this year. For example, it could help sailors avoid colliding their ships with large baleen whales heard to be passing through a shipping channel.",
      "Lavista Ferres said there are still numerous challenges to overcome, from humidity that can fray jungle monitors to elephants in African savannas unintentionally knocking them off a tree.",
      "Lawson said using the audio monitors to capture the spider monkey's distinctive whinny enables biologists to study a larger area at lower cost, but also provides a truer account of how the monkeys behave without scientists following them around.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re reducing our influence on their behavior,\u201d she said. \u201dAnd also \u2014 they don\u2019t want us here.\"",

    "summary": "In Nigeria, the first part of a $1 billion project to clean up Ogoniland in the Niger Delta, where there have been thousands of oil spills, was a &ldquo;total failure.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "In Nigeria, the first part of a $1 billion project to clean up Ogoniland in the Niger Delta, where there have been thousands of oil spills, was a \u201ctotal failure.\u201d",
      "As it passed above the Niger Delta in 2021, a satellite took an image. It showed acres of land, scraped bare. The site, outside the city of Port Harcourt, was on a cleanup list kept by the United Nations Environment Programme, supposed to be restored to green farmland as the Delta was before thousands of oil spills turned it into a byword for pollution. Instead the land was left a sandy \u201cmoonscape\u201d unusable for farming, according to U.N. documents.",
      "That failed cleanup was not an exception, records obtained by The Associated Press show. Previously unreported investigations, emails, letters to Nigerian ministers and minutes from meetings make clear that senior U.N. officials were increasingly concerned that the Nigerian agency in charge of cleaning up crude oil spills has been a \u201ctotal failure.\u201d",
      "The agency, known as Hyprep, selected cleanup contractors who had no relevant experience, according to a U.N. review. It sent soil samples to laboratories that didn't have the equipment for tests they claimed to perform. Auditors were physically blocked from making sure work had been completed.",
      "A former Nigerian minister of the environment told the AP that the majority of cleanup companies are owned by politicians, and minutes show similar views were shared by U.N. officials.",
      "It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way.",
      "There have been thousands of crude oil spills in the tidal mangroves and farmlands of the Niger Delta since oil drilling and production began in the 1950s. Reports and studies document what is widely known here: People often wash, drink, fish and cook in contaminated water.",
      "Spills still occur frequently. The Ogboinbiri community in Bayelsa state suffered its fourth spill in three months in November, harming farm fields, streams and the fish people rely on.",
      "\u201cWe bought the land in 2023; we have not harvested anything from the farmland; both the profit, our interest, everything is gone,\u201d said Timipre Bridget, a farmer in the community. \u201cNo way to survive with our children again.\u201d",
      "Many of the spills are caused by lawbreakers illegally tapping into pipelines to siphon off crude oil they process into gasoline in makeshift refineries.",
      "After a major U.N. survey of spills more than a decade ago, oil companies agreed to create a $1 billion cleanup fund for the worst affected area, Ogoniland, and Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, contributed $300 million. The Nigerian government handled the funds and the U.N. was relegated to an advisory role.",
      "To oversee the work, the government created the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project, or Hyprep. It first addressed sites that were supposed to be easy to clean, like the one outside Port Harcourt. Then it would move on to complex ones, where oil had sunk more deeply into the ground.",
      "But a confidential investigation by U.N. scientists last year found the site outside Port Harcourt was left with a \u201ccomplete absence of topsoil\u201d and almost seven times more petroleum in the subsoil than Nigerian health limits.",
      "The company that performed that work has since had its contract revoked, Nenibarini Zabbey, the current director of Hyprep, who took over last year, told the AP.",
      "The head of operations when the contract was awarded, Philip Shekwolo, called allegations in the U.N. documents \u201cbaseless, mischievous and cheap blackmail.\u201d",
      "Shekwolo, who used to head up oil spill remediation for Shell, said by email he knows more about tackling pollution than any U.N. expert and insists the cleanup has been successful.",
      "But the documents show U.N. officials raising the alarm about Hyprep with Nigerian officials since 2021, when Shekwolo was acting chief.",
      "A January 2022 U.N. review found that of 41 contractors allowed to clean up spill sites, 21 had no relevant experience. Not one was judged competent enough to handle more polluted sites.",
      "They include Nigerian construction companies and general merchants. The websites of two construction firms, for example, Jukok International and Ministaco Nigeria, make no mention of pollution cleanups.",
      "In the minutes of a meeting with U.N. officials and Shell, Hyprep\u2019s own chief of communications, Joseph Kpobari, is shown to have said bad cleanups happen because his agency hired incompetent companies. The U.N. delegation warned that despite their inadequate work, these companies were being rewarded with contracts for tougher sites.",
      "Zabbey denied in an email this admission took place. The cleanup of the simple sites was not a failure, he insisted, because 16 out of 20 had now been certified as clean by Nigerian regulators and many returned to communities. Hyprep always complied with guidelines when issuing contracts, Zabbey said, and their monitors were U.N.-trained.",
      "Two sources close to the cleanup efforts in the Delta, speaking anonymously for fear of loss of business or employment, said test results held up by Hyprep as proof of cleanup could not have been real because when officials visited the laboratories, they found they did not have the equipment to perform those tests.",
      "In a letter to its customers, one laboratory in the U.K. frequently used by Hyprep acknowledged its tests for most of 2022 were flawed and unreliable. The U.K. laboratory accreditation service confirmed the lab\u2019s authorization to carry out the tests was suspended twice.",
      "Zabbey defended the cleanup agency in a statement to the AP, saying it monitors contractors more closely now. Labs adhere to Nigerian and U.N. recommendations and are frequently checked, he said, and the U.N. could have trained local lab staff if it chose to.",
      "The U.N. cited another problem \u2014 contractors were allowed to assess pollution levels at their sites. No government agency was setting a baseline for what needed to be cleaned up at oil-damaged sites. This meant companies were monitoring their own progress, effectively handed a \u201cblank check,\u201d U.N. Senior Project Advisor Iyenemi Kakulu is recorded as having said in minutes of a meeting in June of last year between the U.N., Hyprep and Shell.",
      "The U.N. warned the Nigerian government in an assessment in 2021 that spending at the cleanup agency was not being tracked. Internal auditors were viewed as \u201cthe enemy\u201d and \u201cdemonized for doing their job.\u201d Shekwolo\u2019s predecessor as head of Hyprep blocked new financial controls and \u201cphysically prevented\u201d auditors from seeing if work had been performed properly before paying contractors, according to the U.N. assessment.",
      "Zabbey said this too, has changed since that assessment: The audit team is now valued, he said, and accounts are now audited annually, although he provided only one audit cover letter. In it, the accounting firm asked what steps had been taken to \u201ccorrect the identified weaknesses.\u201d",
      "Shekwolo referred the AP to the office of Nigeria\u2019s president, which did not respond to a request to show how funds are being spent. Environment Minister Iziaq Salako\u2019s office declined an interview.",
      "Sharon Ikeazor was born in Nigeria, educated in Britain, and spent decades as a lawyer before entering politics. In 2019, she was appointed environment minister of Nigeria. She was well aware of Hyprep\u2019s alleged failings and determined to address them.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any proper remediation being done,\u201d she told the AP in a phone interview. \u201cThe companies had no competence whatsoever.\u201d",
      "In February 2022, she received a letter from senior U.N. official Muralee Thummarukudy, with what experts say is unusually strong language in diplomacy. It warned of \u201csignificant opportunities for malpractice within the contract award process,\u201d in the Nigerian oil cleanup work. Ikeazor removed Shekwolo as acting chief of Hyprep the next month, explaining that she believed he was too close to the politicians.",
      "The \u201cmajority\u201d of cleanup companies were owned by politicians, she said. The few competent companies \u201cwouldn\u2019t get the big jobs.\u201d",
      "One of Shekwolo\u2019s roles, Ikeazor said, was to deem who was competent for contract awards. Ikeazor said Shekwolo\u2019s former employer Shell and the U.N. warned her about him, something Shekwolo says he was unaware of.",
      "When she hired a new chief of Hyprep was, she had him review every suspect contract awarded over the years and investigate the cleanup companies.",
      "\u201cThat sent shockwaves around the political class,\u201d said Ikeazor. \u201cThey all had interests.\"",
      "\"That was when the battle started,\u201d she said.",
      "It was a short battle, and she lost. She was replaced as environment minister and Shekwolo was rehired. He had been gone for two months.",
      "Shekwolo says the only politicians he was close to were the two environment ministers he served under. He was never given a reason for his removal, he said, and suggested Ikeazor simply didn\u2019t like him.",
      "Last year, the U.N. Environment Programme broke ties with the Nigerian oil spill agency, explaining its five-year consultancy was over. The last support ended in June.",
      "Ikeazor said the real reason U.N. pulled out was frustration over corruption. The two sources close to the project concurred the U.N. left because it couldn\u2019t continue to be associated with the Nigerian cleanup organization.",
      "Zabbey responded that he believes the U.N. merely changed its goals and moved on.",

It was a natural solution on an island already struggling with a housing crisis and where values like generosity and family are deeply rooted. But increasing a household's size overnight can be stressful, and expensive.",
      "The Akionas and families like them received support from a first-of-its-kind disaster-relief program. For one year, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement's Host Housing Support Program gave people who took in displaced loved ones stipends of $500 per person, up to $2,000, each month.",
      "Disaster responders and advocates say it\u2019s a powerful example of how to shape support around survivors' cultural values and preferences, while alleviating the demand for temporary housing and keeping families and communities intact.",
      "\u201cEvery single time we see a megafire we see mass displacement, and the most common displacement we see is that people then double and triple up with relatives and friends, sometimes for a few years even,\u201d said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the disaster-advocacy nonprofit After The Fire. \u201cBut what they never get is actual money to do it.\u201d",
      "Right after the fires, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, or CNHA, quickly learned how many displaced were bunking with friends and family \u2014 to avoid the hotels where 8,000 people were temporarily sheltered, because they couldn\u2019t find an affordable rental, or because they simply preferred it.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s very normal in Hawaii where you lean on your friends and family,\u201d said Kuhio Lewis, CEO of the 23-year-old Oahu nonprofit. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the fabric of Hawaii, it\u2019s this aloha spirit that\u2019s unique to us.\u201d",
      "CNHA recognized that these informal living arrangements would be essential to keeping families housed and decided to make them part of its overall disaster response. It launched a small pilot program in October 2023 that paid households $375 per person for six months. Both host and guest went through a vetting process, including interviews and an in-person home inspection.",
      "With donations from the Hawaii Community Foundation and the American Red Cross, CNHA increased the payment to $500 per person and extended the program to 12 months. The $2.5 million effort supported 672 displaced people staying in 253 households.",
      "The money helped the Akionas pay the new condo HOA fee and gas to commute back to Lahaina. It provided a cushion when Tamara\u2019s work managing a vacation rental slowed and Kawehi, 50, took on a second job valeting cars at a hotel only to fall and break his knee.",
      "Having their own stability made it possible for the Akionas to help Tamara's uncle Ron Sambrano, too.",
      "Sambrano, 60, watched the neighborhood burn that August night. For months after, he would pull his hat over his eyes whenever he had to ride through Lahaina.",
      "\u201cIt was a special place, in less than 24 hours, all that\u2019s wiped out,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s pretty traumatic.\u201d",
      "Living with his niece and nephew has been a comfort. \u201cThey\u2019re doing their best to help me out and just make things work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing. I could be on the street without them.\"",
      "While it\u2019s common for disaster survivors to get financial assistance to stay in hotel rooms or temporary rentals, paying hosts to take in loved ones hadn't been tried in the United States. Doing so can help the entire recovery, said Gray Thompson of After The Fire.",
      "\u201cIt has a lot of benefits people might not understand at first glance,\u201d she said. Placing people in already occupied homes can take pressure off a tight housing market as hundreds or thousands of households seek shelter. It can prevent kids from having to change schools, and puts money back into the local economy by helping families afford to shop for groceries and other needs.",
      "Perhaps most important, host programs can help keep families and communities intact. In the year after the fire, estimates say more than 1,500 Lahaina families left Maui due to a lack of housing and job options.",
      "\u201cWe need people to stay home in Hawaii,\u201d said Lewis. All of CNHA's housing initiatives since the fires \u2014 paying hosts, leasing rentals to families, covering rent, and even building temporary houses \u2014 are aimed at preventing further erosion of the community.",
      "Helping people stay with loved ones had unexpected upsides, too. Of the 6,000 households CNHA has helped since the fires, it found the ones in the host program moved through FEMA and Small Business Administration applications months more quickly than the others.",
      "\u201cThe greatest strength of the program was to allow the survivors time and the ability to heal comfortably, while pursuing the more challenging aspects of disaster recovery,\u201d said Skye Kolealani Razon-Olds, director of resiliency for CNHA's Maui programs.",
      "While the first-of-its-kind program ended in November, Maui isn't the only community still struggling with mass displacement. In North Carolina, 10,000 households were placed in hotel rooms after Hurricane Helene, and half are still there.",
      "When asked if the program could be replicated in other communities, an American Red Cross spokesperson said the group \u201cwill apply the successes and lessons learned for potential use in future responses.\u201d",
      "CNHA is entering its next phase, helping people rebuild and return to Lahaina. It partnered with Maui architects to offer free and reduced design plans and is giving almost 200 families grants of up to $15,000 to cover pre-building costs like permit fees, among other initiatives.",
      "The Akionas want to rebuild their home, eventually. They\u2019re waiting on a lot survey. Water hasn\u2019t been restored to their street. With building costs so expensive, they might wait until they can afford to build a house they want to grow old in.",
      "In the meantime, most of their 11-person household has moved to Wailuku or to Kihei, a 20-minute drive away. \u201cFor the most part we feel like we have our family unit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re as close as we can be now.\u201d",

      "Romanian lawmakers have voted narrowly in favor of a new pro-European coalition government led by incumbent Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanian lawmakers on Monday voted narrowly in favor of a new pro-European coalition government led by incumbent Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu.",
      "The move could usher in an end to a protracted political crisis in the European Union country following the annulment of a presidential election by a top court. Parliament approved the new administration in a 240-143 vote in Romania's 466-seat legislature.",
      "The new coalition is made up of the leftist Social Democratic Party, or PSD, the center-right National Liberal Party, PNL, the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party and national minorities. It caps a month-long period of turmoil in which far-right nationalists made significant gains in a Dec. 1 parliamentary election, a week after a first-round presidential race saw the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu emerge as the front-runner.",
      "\u201cIt will not be an easy mandate for the future government,\u201d Ciolacu, whose PSD party topped the polls in the parliamentary election, said in a statement Monday.",
      "\u201cWe are aware that we are in the midst of a deep political crisis,\" he said. \"It is also a crisis of trust, and this coalition aims to regain the trust of citizens, the trust of the people.\u201d",
      "Romani's 16 ministerial positions will be shared among the parties, which will hold a slim majority in the legislature. It's widely seen as a tactical partnership to shut out far-right nationalists whose voices found fertile ground amid high living costs and a sluggish economy.",
      "Ciolacu, who came third in the first-round presidential ballot despite polls indicating he would win the most votes, has served as prime minister since June 2023.",
      "After parliament\u2019s approval, President Klaus Iohannis swore in the new government and warned the new Cabinet that it's entering a \u201cdifficult new period\u201d in which \u201cfor many Romanians, there are major concerns.\u201d",
      "Romania was plunged into turmoil after Georgescu\u2019s surprise success in the presidential race, after allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference emerged. Days before the Dec. 8 runoff, the Constitutional Court made the unprecedented move to annul the presidential race.",
      "\u201cWe go through complicated times, but I think we all learned from mistakes of the past,\u201d Ciolacu said. \u201cI hope that together with my colleagues in the coalition, we\u2019ll find the best solutions to get past the challenges we have in front of us.\u201d",
      "Ciolacu said that the new government would aim to quickly organize the rerun of the presidential election in which the new coalition has agreed to put forward an agreed common pro-European candidate.",
      "Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, said that the new government made up of the same political parties will likely embrace \u201csoft populist\u201d rhetoric such as economic patriotism, anti-austerity, and a peace solution in neighboring Ukraine to counter the rise of far-right populism.",
      "\u201cThis will be a way to answer the concerns of many Romanians who voted for populists \u2026 but will not solve the fundamental problem of trust,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only decisive factor now will be who and how convincing the pro-European candidates will be against this popular revolt.\u201d",
      "George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, which came second in the parliamentary election, said that all lawmakers from his party on Monday would vote against the Ciolacu government.",

      "Japanese automakers Nissan and Honda have announced plans to work toward a merger that would catapult them to a top position in an industry in the midst of tectonic shifts as it transitions away from its reliance on fossil fuels",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan have announced plans to work toward a merger that would form the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales, as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses.",
      "Automakers in Japan have lagged behind their big rivals in electric vehicles and are trying to cut costs and make up for lost time as newcomers like China's BYD and EV market leader Tesla devour market share.",
      "Honda's president, Toshihiro Mibe, said Honda and Nissan will attempt to unify their operations under a joint holding company. Honda will lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company. They aim to have a formal merger agreement by June and to complete the deal and list the holding company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange by August 2026, he said.",
      "No dollar value was given and the formal talks are just starting, Mibe said.",
      "There are \u201cpoints that need to be studied and discussed,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly speaking, the possibility of this not being implemented is not zero.\u201d",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan\u2019s Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "News of a possible merger surfaced earlier this month, with unconfirmed reports saying Taiwan iPhone maker Foxconn was seeking to tie up with Nissan by buying shares from the Japan's company's other alliance partner, Renault SA of France.",
      "Nissan's CEO Makoto Uchida said Foxconn had not directly approach his company. He also acknowledged that Nissan's situation was \u201csevere.\u201d",
      "Even after a merger Toyota, which rolled out 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, would remain the leading Japanese automaker. If they join, the three smaller companies would make about 8 million vehicles. In 2023, Honda made 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.",
      "\u201cWe have come to the realization that in order for both parties to be leaders in this mobility transformation, it is necessary to make a more bold change than a collaboration in specific areas,\u201d Mibe said.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi earlier agreed to share components for electric vehicles like batteries and to jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to electrification.",
      "Nissan has struggled following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Speaking Monday to reporters in Tokyo via a video link, Ghosn derided the planned merger as a \u201cdesperate move.\u201d",
      "From Nissan, Honda could get truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn\u2019t have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybrid powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "But the company said in November that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing its global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "It recently reshuffled its management and Uchida, its chief executive, took a 50% pay cut while acknowledging responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate that if this integration comes to fruition, we will be able to deliver even greater value to a wider customer base,\u201d Uchida said.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan\u2019s credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan\u2019s share price also had fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. On Monday, its Tokyo-traded shares gained 1.6%. They jumped more than 20% after news of the possible merger broke last week.",
      "Honda's shares surged 3.8%. Honda's net profit slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as its sales suffered in China.",
      "The merger reflects an industry-wide trend toward consolidation.",
      "At a routine briefing Monday, Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said he would not comment on details of the automakers' plans, but said Japanese companies need to stay competitive in the fast changing market.",

      "The economic and technological rivalry between the U.S. and China has come to the drone market, where Chinese-made flying devices are a dominant player in America",
      "WASHINGTON -- Russell Hedrick, a North Carolina farmer, flies drones to spray fertilizers on his corn, soybean and wheat fields at a fraction of what it would cost him to use a conventional ground spreader.",
      "As a volunteer rescuer, Hedrick uses thermal drones to search for people trapped by mudslides and cargo drones to send water and baby formula to those who are stranded \u2014 something he did after Hurricane Helene.",
      "Now he is fretting that one day he will have to ground his drone fleet. Most commercial drones sold in the United States, including those used by Hedrick, are made in China. They have become a target of U.S. lawmakers, who see the dominance of Chinese drones not only as an espionage threat but as a commercial threat because they make it nearly impossible for American manufacturers to compete.",
      "It\u2019s another front in the U.S.-China economic and technological competition that\u2019s likely to intensify with the return to the White House in January of Republican Donald Trump, who has promised to get tough on China.",
      "Washington has already placed restrictions on Chinese telecommunications companies and imposed high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles as the U.S. competes with China in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and other areas.",
      "A defense bill that Congress passed on Dec. 18 includes a clause to stop two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review finds they pose \u201can unacceptable risk\u201d to American national security. Congress has banned federal agencies from acquiring Chinese drones, with some exceptions, and several states have barred publicly funded programs from using or procuring Chinese drones.",
      "A broader ban is worrisome for Americans for whom drones have become a part of their lives and work. It could disrupt wide-ranging operations, from law enforcement to mapping and filmmaking that drone operators say are viable because of the low cost and high performance of the Chinese drones. American-made drones just aren\u2019t comparable, they say.",
      "In Hickory, North Carolina, Hedrick began flying Chinese-made drones in 2019 to fertilize crops and monitor crop health. A drone spreader costs $35,000, while a conventional ground sprayer would set him back $250,000, he said.",
      "\u201cWith the drone efficiency, we are able to do things we were never able to do before: to apply fertilizer but use less, which is good for American consumers,\u201d Hedrick said.",
      "But it\u2019s precisely that reliance on Chinese drones that worries U.S. lawmakers.",
      "\u201cIt is strategically irresponsible to allow Communist China to be our drone factory,\u201d argued Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who has been tapped by Trump to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She led earlier House efforts to ban new Chinese drones.",
      "It was the role of drones in everyday life that drove Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to get Congress to restrict the purchase of Chinese drones by federal agencies. Those restrictions were included in a defense bill that Democratic President Joe Biden signed last year.",
      "Scott has compared Chinese drones to spy balloons that could \u201cgather data or carry harmful payloads\u201d across America, posing risks to military bases, critical infrastructure and natural resources.",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, an advocacy group for unmanned vehicles such as drones, opposes an immediate ban. Instead, his group has urged the government to support the U.S. drone-making industry through investment so it can catch up with its Chinese competitors in both capability and cost.",
      "He applauds Congress for addressing some of the issues in the 2025 defense budget, including promoting investment in autonomous technology and working to develop a secure supply chain for U.S. drone manufacturing.",
      "That vulnerability was clear earlier this year when Beijing sanctioned the U.S. drone maker Skydio, forcing it to ration its batteries sourced from China.",
      "\u201cThis is an attempt to eliminate the leading American drone company and deepen the world\u2019s dependence on Chinese drone suppliers,\u201d wrote Adam Bry, chief executive officer of Skydio.",
      "Citing security interests, China has restricted exports to the U.S. of drone parts, including motors, flight controllers and imaging equipment.",
      "John Goodson, CEO of Darkhive, a San Antonio-based drone maker, said a ban would not stop Chinese drone makers from selling their products elsewhere in the world but could hurt U.S. drone companies that rely on China for parts.",
      "For now, it remains unrealistic to ban Chinese drones when there are few comparable products, said Faine Greenwood, a drone enthusiast who writes extensively about drones. \u201cIf we ban the Chinese drones, we knock out many amazing things we do.\u201d",
      "The best-known Chinese drones are those by DJI Technology Co., a company founded in 2006 and based in the southern city of Shenzhen. It's named in the defense spending bill, along with another Chinese company, Autel Robotics.",
      "DJI has the lion's share of the global drone market and is the dominant player in the U.S. market. Its devices are known for their affordability and high performance. They are even used on the battlefield in Ukraine by both sides, even though DJI does not make military drones.",
      "DJI's drones have been used by first responders to locate disaster victims, mappers to survey roads and utility lines, mosquito control officers to reach swarms of larvae, and filmmakers to capture aerial footage. Police use them to help prevent crime and find missing people.",
      "Hedrick, the North Carolina farmer, mobilized drone search efforts as a volunteer after Helene hit. On the first night, he and his teammates located 150 stranded people. When they could not be immediately rescued, Hedrick said his team used DJI cargo drones to send in supplies.",
      "\u201cI am not going to say I won\u2019t love to have U.S. drones, but I don\u2019t see the American drones as anywhere close to the DJI drones in terms of reliability, ease of use, and just the user-friendly software,\u201d Hedrick said. \u201cThe U.S. drones are not as good as the DJI ones but cost twice as much.\u201d",
      "But as U.S.-China relations have soured, DJI drones have come under scrutiny. The U.S. government has put the company on several blacklists, saying it violates human rights by supplying drones to Chinese police to surveil members of the ethnic Uyghur minority, and alleging links to the Chinese military.",
      "DJI has denied wrongdoing and is suing the Pentagon over the designation that it is a Chinese military company. U.S. customs officials also have blocked some DJI shipments over concerns that the products might have been made with forced labor. DJI has called it \u201ca customs-related misunderstanding.\u201d",
      "As for the defense bill, DIJ said it contains no provision that would allow the company to defend itself. \u201cWe call on a relevant technical intelligence agency to undertake an audit of our products, and we ask for a fair right of reply to any findings,\u201d DJI said.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington said China opposes what it calls the politicization of trade.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government firmly supports Chinese companies in carrying out international trade and cooperation in drones for civilian use, and opposes certain countries\u2019 frequent illegal sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals on the grounds of so-called national security,\u201d Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman, said in a statement.",
      "Several states have already restricted the use of Chinese drones. In Tennessee, public agencies, including police and fire departments, are no longer allowed to purchase DJI drones.",
      "That caused a headache for Capt. Chris Lowe of the Kingsport Fire Department. After his department lost a DJI Mavic Pro drone, he was quoted $5,000 for a replacement from an approved list of drones, when another DJI Mavic Pro would cost $1,000 to $1,500.",
      "\u201cBasically it would be a DJI clone but doesn\u2019t have all the capabilities,\u201d Lowe said of the alternative. Without any state assistance, he said he would either forgo a new drone or tighten the belt in equipment maintenance elsewhere. He said the department has used drones to scope out wildfires, chemical leaks and disaster scenes and to search for missing people. \u201cIt's about life and death,\u201d he said.",
      "In Wimberley, Texas, Gene Robinson has used high-resolution drone images to analyze differences in vegetation to discover buried bodies. He said he helped police find a victim's buried arm, making prosecution possible. Robinson doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s a viable alternative to the DJI drone he uses.",
      "He said his project at Texas State University's Forensic Anthropology Center would be \u201cdeader than a doornail\u201d if there's a national ban on Chinese-made drones.",
      "At the Interior Department, the policy against foreign-made drones has hamstrung its drone operations, resulting in the \u201closs of opportunities to collect data on landscape, natural and cultural resources, wildlife and infrastructure,\" according to a September report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",
      "In Florida, law enforcement officers last year complained to the state senate that a ban on state-funded agencies operating Chinese-made drones left them with costlier aircraft that didn't perform as well. That prompted state lawmakers to appropriate $25 million to help government-run drone programs acquire compliant models.",
      "Christopher Todd, executive director of the not-for-profit group Airborne International Response Team, described the ban and the subsequent switch as \u201can absolute mess.\"",
      "\u201cLawmakers failed to understand that this issue is far more complicated than simply changing from one drone to another,\" he said. \u201cYou need to learn a new user interface with new shortcuts and new protocols, and then you need to change all of the software and accessories and re-examine all of your network configurations to accommodate the technology change.\"",
      "But the financial assistance as well as training programs, such as the one provided by his group, made the transition possible, he said.",
      "More than 90% of law enforcement agencies in Florida used DJI drones in 2022, and the share plummeted to about 14% after the ban, according to Todd's group.",
      "In Orange County, where Orlando is located, the sheriff's office said it spent nearly $580,000 to replace 18 noncompliant drones last year and received nearly $400,000 in reimbursements from the state.",
      "\u201cThe transition has gone well and has simultaneously increased our drone fleet with better capabilities and technology,\u201d the sheriff's office said.",

    "title": "Trump threatens to try to take back the Panama Canal. Panama's president balks at the suggestion",
    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 02:26:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump is suggesting that his new administration could try to regain control of the Panama Canal",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is suggesting that his new administration could try to regain control of the Panama Canal",
      "PHOENIX -- PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump suggested Sunday that his new administration could try to regain control of the Panama Canal that the United States \u201cfoolishly\u201d ceded to its Central American ally, contending that shippers are charged \u201cridiculous\u201d fees to pass through the vital transportation channel linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.",
      "Panama's conservative president Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, who was elected in May on a pro-business platform, roundly rejected that notion as an affront to his country's sovereignty.",
      "The Republican president-elect's comment came during his first major rally since winning the White House on Nov. 5. He also basked in his return to power as a large audience of conservatives cheered along. It was a display of party unity at odds with a just-concluded budget fight on Capitol Hill, where some GOP lawmakers openly defied their leader's demands.",
      "Addressing supporters at Turning Point USA\u2019s AmericaFest in Arizona, Trump pledged that his \u201cdream team Cabinet\u201d would deliver a booming economy, seal U.S. borders and quickly settle wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI can proudly proclaim that the Golden Age of America is upon us,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere\u2019s a spirit that we have now that we didn\u2019t have just a short while ago.\u201d",
      "His appearance capped a four-day pep rally that drew more than 20,000 activists and projected an image of Republican cohesion despite the past week's turbulence in Washington with Trump pulling strings from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as Congress worked to avoid a government shutdown heading into the holidays.",
      "House Republicans spiked a bipartisan deal after Trump and Elon Musk, his billionaire ally, expressed their opposition on social media. Budget hawks flouted Trump's demand that they raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, which would have spared some new rounds of the same fight after he takes office on Jan. 20, with Republicans holding narrow control of the House and Senate. The final agreement did not address the issue and there was no shutdown.",
      "Trump, in his remarks in Phoenix, did not mention the congressional drama, though he did reference Musk's growing power. To suggestions that \"President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon,\u201d Trump made clear, \u201cNo, no. That\u2019s not happening.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not gonna be president,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The president-elect opened the speech by saying that \"we want to try to bring everybody together. We\u2019re going to try. We\u2019re going to really give it a shot.\" Then he suggested Democrats have \u201clost their confidence\u201d and are \u201cbefuddled\u201d after the election but eventually will \u201dcome over to our side because we want to have them.\u201d",
      "Atop a list of grievances \u2014 some old, some new \u2014 was the Panama Canal.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re being ripped off at the Panama Canal,\u201d he said, bemoaning that his country \u201dfoolishly gave it away.\u201d",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter.",
      "The canal depends on reservoirs to operate its locks and was heavily affected by 2023 Central American droughts that forced it to substantially reduce the number of daily slots for crossing ships. With fewer ships using the canal each day, administrators also increased the fees that are charged all shippers for reserving a slot.",
      "With weather returning to normal in the later months of this year, transit on the canal has normalized. But price increases are still expected for next year.",
      "Mulino, Panama's president, has been described as a conservative populist who aligns with Trump on many issues. Panama is a strong U.S. ally and the canal is crucial for its economy, generating about one-fifth of that government\u2019s annual revenue.",
      "Still, Trump said, that, once his second term is underway, \"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to stand for it,\" Trump said. \"So to the officials of Panama, please be guided accordingly.\u201d",
      "He did not explain how that would be possible.",
      "Shortly after Trump's speech, Mulino released a video declaring that \u201cevery square meter of the canal belongs to Panama and will continue to belong\u201d to his country.",
      "Without mentioning Trump by name, Mulino addressed Trump's complaints over rising fees for ships crossing the canal, saying they are set by experts who take into account operational costs, and supply and demand factors.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are not set on a whim\u201d Mulino said. He noted that Panama has expanded the canal over the years to increase ship traffic \u201con its own initiative,\u201d and added that shipping fee increases help pay for improvements.",
      "\u201cPanamanians may have different views on many issues\u201d Mulino said. \u201cBut when it comes to our canal, and our sovereignty, we will all unite under our Panamanian flag.\u201d",
      "Trump then took to his social media site to offer in response, \u201cWe'll see about that!\" He also posted a picture of a U.S. flag planted in the canal zone under the phrase, \u201cWelcome to the United States Canal!\u201d",
      "The canal aside, Trump\u2019s appearance at Turning Point\u2019s annual gathering affirmed the growing influence the group and its founder, Charlie Kirk, have had in the conservative movement. Kirk\u2019s group hired thousands of field organizers across presidential battlegrounds, helping Trump make key gains among infrequent voters and other groups of people that have trended more Democratic in recent decades, including younger voters, Black men and Latino men.",
      "\u201dYou had Turning Point\u2019s grassroots armies,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my victory, it\u2019s your victory.\u201d",
      "Trump on Sunday also announced several new members of his incoming administration, most notably:",
      "-Stephen Miran, who worked at the Treasury Department in Trump's first term, to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, an executive branch agency charged with providing objective economic advice to the president.",
      "\u2014Callista Gingrich to be the U.S. ambassador to Switzerland. Gingrich was U.S. ambassador to the Holy See in Trump's first term. She is married to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",
      "Separately, Australian billionaire Anthony Pratt announced he was donating $1.1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund to complement the $14 million that he said he already had given to the Make America Great Again Inc. super political action committee \u2014 making him one of the president-elect\u2019s top donors.",
      "Pratt is chairman of Pratt Industries, which uses recycled paper and boxes as a raw material in a process that produces new cardboard.",

      "Party City announced that it's going to \u201cwind down\u201d its retail and wholesale operations as it prepares to shutter nearly 700 stores nationwide",
      "LOS ANGELES -- For nearly 40 years, customers flocked to Party City for Halloween costumes, favors for children's birthday parties and decorations for New Year's Eve celebrations. Now, the go-to shop for everything from cartoon-themed balloons to Super Bowl decor is closing stores.",
      "Party City announced Saturday that it would start a \u201cwind down\u201d of its retail and wholesale operations as it prepares to shutter nearly 700 stores nationwide. The company has also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in less than two years \u201cto maximize value for the benefit of the company\u2019s stakeholders.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe decision was made following exhaustive efforts by the company to find a path forward that would allow continued operations in an immensely challenging environment driven by inflationary pressures on costs and consumer spending, among other factors,\u201d Party City said in a statement.",
      "Party City also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2023. That move allowed for a restructuring that eliminated nearly $1 billion in debt. But \u201cmacroeconomic headwinds more recently proved too severe\u201d to overcome, the company said.",
      "The New Jersey-based retailer said it will keep more than 95% of its 12,000 employees to help with the process of shutting down.",
      "Party City has faced growing competition from Walmart and Target and increasingly from occasion-based pop-up stores such as Spirit Halloween, which announced in October that it would also open 10 Spirit Christmas stores. That pressure has intensified in an era of rising prices, including for helium used in party balloons, and slowing consumer demand.",
      "The competition has also hit other retailers: Last week, discount chain Big Lots said it would start going-out-of-business sales at its remaining locations after a sale of the company didn\u2019t materialize. Party City's website similarly shows going-out-of-business discounts of up to 50% on the shop's entire assortment goods."

      "The IRS said it's distributing about $2.4 billion to taxpayers who failed to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2021 tax returns. People who missed one of the COVID stimulus payments or had received less than the full amount were able to claim the credit. But the IRS on Friday said it discovered many eligible taxpayers hadn't done so.",
      "\u201cLooking at our internal data, we realized that one million taxpayers overlooked claiming this complex credit when they were actually eligible,\u201d IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement.",
      "Here's more about the unexpected cash this group of taxpayers will soon receive:",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Capitol buildings are almost always an imposing presence. The seat of government, they tend to be elegant and stately \u2014 and frequently capped by a dome.",
      "Visitors to Pennsylvania 's Capitol are drawn to its priceless artwork, polished marble and intricate carvings, but hidden behind the doors of some of its most ornate offices and chambers are another treasure: hundreds of antique clocks that were part of its original design.",
      "The 273 working clocks include many that are integrated into fireplace mantels and other building features.",
      "They are not low maintenance, requiring regular oiling and occasional mechanical overhauls.",

      "Among countless other fine touches, Huston designed at least 180 custom clock cases, including smaller so-called keystone clocks that are shaped to remind people of Pennsylvania's early and critical role in the formation of the United States, leaving it with the nickname of the Keystone State.",
      "\u201cThe clocks are just part of why the building's so unique and so intricate,\u201d said Capitol Preservation Committee historian Jason Wilson. \u201cThe mantels surrounding the clocks are all custom designed.\u201d",
      "Every so often the clocks, most of them built from mahogany or stained mahogany, are carefully removed from their spots around the Capitol and taken to a facility for cleaning, maintenance and repair. They seem to run better when kept wound.",
      "Huston, the architect, achieved his goal. The Capitol is a showpiece that draws thousands of visitors every year to where 253 state lawmakers convene to debate and pass legislation.",
      "While the buildings and the clocks are his lasting legacy, Huston was convicted of a conspiracy to defraud the state during the Capitol construction project and spent several months in another Pennsylvania landmark, Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.",

      "Anxiety about furloughs from a government shutdown this time could be a prelude, Soriano said.",
      "\u201cFederal employees that we represent in the American Federation of Government Employees are scared for the jobs, given the public discourse that we are all witnessing,\" Soriano said.",
      "Mac Johnson, a retired Transportation Security Administration employee who is now an executive vice president for the union's TSA Council, said TSA employees were on \u201cpins and needles\u201d Friday afternoon.",
      "Johnson said about half the TSA's workforce was on the job during the 2018 shutdown. While TSA employees would still work at the nation's airports during a shutdown, there's a chance they would not be paid until a government funding measure is approved.",
      "That's hard to bear when many employees live paycheck to paycheck.",
      "\u201cIt is a double whammy,\" Johnson said in a telephone interview from Charlotte, North Carolina. \"One, you\u2019re not getting paid, and I think it\u2019s going to affect the ability of any federal agency, not only TSA. You know, once upon a time, there was job security working for the federal government, but going through all of these shutdowns does not do a lot for the confidence of those potential candidates for future government employment.\u201d",
      "Zuagar said he's more confused about the budget debate this time around than in previous years.",
      "\u201cThe rhetoric is just all over the place,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s all these different factions of people.\u201d",
      "Government shutdowns not only are demoralizing to federal workers, Soriano said, but recovery takes a long time. For individuals, savings are depleted, spending is deferred and some things that once seemed necessary are suddenly out of reach.",
      "For government agencies, a lot has to be rebuilt.",
      "\u201cSo, it is not that the shutdown disappears, and everything goes back to normal,\u201d Soriano said. \u201cIt takes time and effort to put a shutdown into place. It takes even more time to address all the deficiencies created by a shutdown.\u201d",
      "Despite the anxiety, Zuagar says he's avoiding blaming anyone specifically for the turbulent negotiations. For now, he's trying to be optimistic that what he's hearing is mostly rhetoric, and support for funding federal employees and the services they provide will be there.",
      "Still, he said it's \u201cshocking\u201d to be blindsided by a crisis right before the holiday. He said he would receive his last paycheck until the impasse is resolved this weekend.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s your last paycheck before Christmas, so for some of us, for myself, you\u2019ve got to think: Do I spend it on Christmas gifts for my family, or do I hold some of that?\u201d Zuagar said. \"Because we\u2019ve also got to pay our bills in January. It will affect people in the sense of how they spend this weekend.\u201d",
      "That's the kind of thing he wishes lawmakers would remember as they negotiate.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s real people behind all this stuff, and our hope is that, you know, they think about that,\" Zuagar said.",

      "The Columbus, Ohio-based retailer, which sells furniture, home decor and other items, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early September and said private equity firm Nexus Capital Management LP had agreed to acquire \u201csubstantially all of the company\u2019s assets.\u201d But on Thursday the chain said it didn't anticipate completing the purchase agreement. It said it continues to work toward completing an alternative transaction with Nexus or another party.",
      "Big Lots said its goal would be to complete a sale by early January. According to the company's website, discounts of up to 50% were being offered on the entire assortment and it announced all stores were closing.",

      "Big Lots said it is continuing to serve customers in-store and online, and will provide updates as available.",
      "Big Lots has said that high inflation and interest rates have hurt its business as consumers have pulled back on their home and seasonal product purchases, two categories the chain depends on for a significant part of its revenue. The company has also struggled with increased competition from the likes of Walmart and warehouse clubs like Walmart's Sam's Clubs and Costco, which have all sharpened their pricing and merchandise.",
      "At the end of 2023, Big Lots operated nearly 1,400 stores in 48 states. A more recent store count wasn't immediately available."

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Former Philadelphia Eagles running back Wendell Smallwood Jr. has pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges after he was accused of submitting fraudulent tax returns and applications for hundreds of thousands of dollars in COVID-19 pandemic aid programs.",
      "The signed plea agreement was approved Friday by a federal judge in Delaware. Smallwood, of Mullica Hill, New Jersey, faces sentencing in May on the three fraud charges.",
      "Smallwood\u2019s lawyer, Mark Sheppard, told the Philadelphia Inquirer that Smallwood appeared in court Friday \u201cand forthrightly took full responsibility for his actions.

      "He also used what prosecutors said were defunct or recently registered businesses and provided false information about the scale of their operations, such as start dates, revenue amounts, expenses and number of employees. Some were under his name, while others were under other people's names.",
      "In one scheme, Smallwood used false information when he applied to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program for loans for three businesses under his name. The U.S. Small Business Administration approved loans of just over $46,000, prosecutors said.",
      "In a separate scheme, Smallwood submitted fraudulent applications in the names of at least 13 other people for the Paycheck Protection Program, prosecutors said. A bank disbursed loans of nearly $270,000, from which Smallwood received kickbacks in return for preparing and submitting the applications, prosecutors said.",
      "The Eagles drafted Smallwood out of West Virginia University in 2016. The Delaware native played three seasons for the Eagles before spending time over three more seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the team now known as the Washington Commanders."

      "Bates used his platform as an NFL player to spread his love of Jesus in\u202f a prime-time interview on NBC \u202fafter lifting the Lions to a win over the Texans with a 52-yard field goal as time expired.",
      "A month later, Bates told The Associated Press it is a duty to share his Christian faith.",

Recently, for example, Jake Retzlaff became the first Jewish quarterback to play for Brigham Young University, the Utah private school run by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has embraced his role as an ambassador of Judaism in football.",

      "The answer could be found on a white board in Paris.",
      "Golfers at the Olympics were asked to write their nicknames, countries, favorite Olympic sports and their goal in Paris. Most of the players said their goal was gold, or at least to win a medal.",
      "Scheffler wrote: Have fun.",
      "He shot 62 in the final round and won the gold medal. That was fun. In fact, from Kapalua in January to being voted PGA Tour player of the year in December, Scheffler used some form of the word \u201cfun\u201d 183 times in news conferences.",

      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t take holidays,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford them. We went around to junior golf tournaments in the summer. That was our holidays. And that was good.\u201d",

      "The season opener can be a good tone-setter, and it's not always measure by a scorecard.",
      "All the attention on money includes the caddies.",
      "Xander Schauffele and Austin Kaiser were teammates at San Diego State and close friends ever since. Kaiser was working in a warehouse when Schauffele asked if he would caddie for him. They got their PGA Tour card in 2017, the first win, and before long Schauffele was a mainstay among the top 10 in the world ranking.",
      "Kaiser wasn\u2019t doing too bad, either.",
      "The standard fee for many caddies is 10% for a win. With $20 million purses, it adds up. Schauffele was discussing this at Bay Hill when he looked over at Kaiser and told him, \u201cYou get paid too much.\u201d",

      "On her third hole, the par-3 12th at Lancaster, Korda after a long wait hit her 6-iron long into a bunker.

So did the one after that.",

      "Steve Stricker accepted the award. His daughter called the shots.",
      "Stricker easily won the Golf Writers Association of America award as the senior player of the year after a blockbuster 2023 season of six wins, three of them majors. It was a festive night at the awards dinner. The only question was whether Stricker would get emotional.",
      "It started when he approached the podium, partly because Gary Woodland got everyone emotional with heartfelt gratitude returning from brain surgery.",
      "Stricker rallied, his voice still a little unsteady, but the message was back on track.",
      "\u201cIf he looks at my mom he\u2019s going to lose it,\u201d his oldest daughter, Bobbi, whispered from her seat in the auditorium.",
      "Stricker spoke of his special year and said he wanted to thank his family. That\u2019s when he turned to look at them and it was over. He went seven full seconds before he could get out another word. Amid the tears, he laughed at himself.",

      "Thomas was 49th in the key putting statistic going into the third round. He was on the practice green with his father when he mentioned where he ranked and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe there\u2019s someone putting worse than me this week.\u201d",
      "Mike Thomas had to deliver the bad news \u2014 Hideki Matsuyama had withdrawn, and there were only 49 players left in the field.",

      "He called her two days later in New York \u2014 he says she stepped out of a board meeting to take his call \u2014 and they headed to Gleneagles in Scotland to go fishing.",
      "\u201cShe's very rich,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Listen, Susan, I don\u2019t need your money. I'm also rich. You don't need my money. But if you die before me, you can leave me a little.'\u201d",
      "Nelly Korda is celebrating part of Christmas a little early because younger brother Sebastian is headed Down Under for the Australian Open tennis tournament. And then she\u2019s off to the mountains for a little ... dog sledding?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very excited for that, something I\u2019ve never done,\u201d Korda said. \u201cI love the mountains, I love snow and so I\u2019m super excited for that to recharge my batteries. I skied as a kid, but I do not ski now. I\u2019m already fragile enough.\u201d",
      "The real recharging of batteries follows the start of the year.",
      "Korda found a recipe that worked during her epic season of seven victories that led to being LPGA player of the year. She played twice in Florida (winning the second event) at the start, sat out a month during the first Asia swing, returned and won her next four starts.",
      "She said she would skip the early Asia swing again and won\u2019t return until the West Coast.",
      "The Crypto.com Showdown had everything, except for a lot of people watching.",
      "The made-for-TV match at Shadow Creek brought PGA Tour stars Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy against LIV Golf stars Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka. It was under the lights at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas. It was billed as the PGA Tour vs. LIV, just what golf fans wanted.",
      "But according to Sports Business Journal, the 16-hole match (Scheffler and McIlroy won handily) drew only 625,000 viewers across two networks on TNT and TBS on a Tuesday night.",
      "Sports Business Journal said that put it as the second-lowest viewership for \u201cThe Match\u201d series.",
      "One of those viewers was Fred Couples, but not until the fifth hole.",
      "\u201cI did not know it was on,\u201d Couples said. He only realized it when his longtime caddie, Joe LaCava, sent him a text and \u201cI don't even need to say what the text about.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was pitch dark and freezing. Now, I don\u2019t know why they would do that, to play a match that big. ... But I thought it was fun,\u201d Couples said. \u201cI just ... we just didn't get the pitch dark. It was just weird.\u201d",
      "Still to be announced is what kind of rating the PNC Championship had during NFL Sunday.",
      "Ron Price had the unique distinction of working with three PGA Tour commissioners and even briefly serving as one himself. Price announced to the tour staff last week he is retiring at the end of the year.",
      "He leaves as the chief operating officer, having previously been the chief financial officer. He had a hand in most financial matters, whether it was the FedEx Cup bonus program or the new player equity plan.",
      "But he was unknown outside tour headquarters for the majority of his career, until he found himself under the brightest of spotlights.",
      "Price was co-commissioner for five weeks when Jay Monahan stepped away for health reasons after announcing the shock deal on June 6, 2023, with the Saudi-backers of LIV Golf. It was Price, along with board member Jimmy Dunne, who was summoned to Washington for a congressional hearing.",
      "Price worked at Ernst & Young when he was an advisor to former Commissioner Deane Beman. He served under Tim Finchem for 22 years and then Monahan when he took over in 2017.",
      "There\u2019s no better time than the holidays to release charity donations from various tournaments, and the Western Golf Association dropped a big one. The 125-year-old WGA, which runs the BMW Championship, said the tournament at Castle Pines in Colorado raised a record $10.2 million for the Evans Scholars Foundation.",
      "The BMW Championship has raised its profile since going back to its WGA roots and moving around outside its Chicago headquarters. Next year it returns to Caves Valley outside Baltimore.",
      "The Wells Fargo Championship in its final year as title sponsor raised $5.9 million for charity donations from the tournament and from previous net reserves. The tournament has raised more than $36 million dating to its inaugural year in 2003.",
      "The tournament has a new title sponsor in Truist starting in 2025 and will move to the Philadelphia Cricket Club for one year because Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina, is hosting the PGA Championship for the second time.",
      "The PNC Championship not only had a great finish, it had an even better start. The tournament announced Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank has extended its contract as title sponsor through 2032. ... The Epson Tour has announced a 20-tournament schedule for 2025 that includes three new tournaments and total prize money of $5 million. ... Fred Couples says he has been asked to introduce players on the first tee when the Skins Game returns next year on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Couples was known as \u201cMr. Skins\u201d during the event's peak years. Couples made nearly $4.5 million \u2014 back when $4.5 million meant something \u2014 in 11 appearances. ... The TMRW Golf League that starts next month is going worldwide before a shot has been struck into the monstrous screen in SoFi Center. It has agreements for Canal+ to show matches live in France and sub-Saharan Africa, while Disney+ has secured rights to show them exclusively in the five Nordic countries. Both deals are through 2026.",
      "Ten of the 20 professionals in the PNC Championship have been No. 1 in the world.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t try to compare my seasons. It\u2019s very easy to do that. I\u2019m super proud of myself and my entire team of what we accomplished this year and what we went through, but next year I always look at as a clean slate and I\u2019m hungry for more.\" \u2014 Nelly Korda.",

      "Oklahoma City leads the Western Conference and has a MVP candidate in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander",
      "Oklahoma City leads the Western Conference and has a MVP candidate in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Milwaukee has the NBA's leading scorer in Giannis Antetokounmpo. They were the teams that made their way to the NBA Cup final.",
      "By any measure, they're both very good teams.",
      "And neither will play on Christmas Day this year. Bah, humbug.",
      "In its defense, the NBA faces the same challenge every summer, figuring out which 10 teams will get the honor \u2014 and it is an honor \u2014 of playing on Christmas Day.",
      "The Knicks and Lakers almost always find their way onto the slate, which makes sense given the size of the New York and Los Angeles media markets. The teams coming off runs to the NBA Finals typically get a Christmas invite, so hello, Boston and Dallas. The rest is a mix of stars, ratings potential, storylines and, hopefully, good teams.",
      "Victor Wembanyama \u2014 the French star who already is a massive draw both in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 makes his Christmas debut when San Antonio goes to New York. Minnesota plays Dallas in a West finals rematch. Boston plays Philadelphia, a forever rivalry. The Lakers play Golden State, LeBron James vs. Stephen Curry. And Denver plays Phoenix in the nightcap. Nobody could have said those games were Christmas mistakes when the schedule came out.",
      "It's also a sign of the parity in the NBA right now \u2014 there are clearly more than 10 teams worthy of Christmas consideration. That said, the Thunder and Bucks certainly have the right to feel snubbed.",
      "\u201cWe should\u2019ve had a Christmas day game, I believe, but the NBA felt different,\u201d Bucks guard Khris Middleton said on media day, back in September. \u201cThat\u2019s how they feel. I said my opinion on it. And sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "The Thunder not getting picked is puzzling, especially after being the No. 1 seed in the West last season.",
      "This is the 17th consecutive season of the NBA having five games on Christmas Day. More often than not \u2014 75% of the time \u2014 the No. 1 seeds for the East and West playoffs have been picked for a Christmas game the following season. And entering this year, each of the previous 11 No. 1 seeds in the West playoffs wound up having a game on Dec. 25 that same year.",
      "But not the Thunder.",
      "\u201cDisappointed, for sure,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cI'd love to play on Christmas Day. And I think we're that caliber of team. The NBA makes their decisions. Can't slight them for it. Ball's in our court to prove to them why we deserve to be in that game.\u201d",
      "There have been reasons for some of the eight No. 1 seeds who got snubbed in that span to get snubbed. Some examples:",
      "\u2014 Cleveland was the East's No. 1 seed in 2010. LeBron James left Cleveland that summer and went to Miami, and the Cavaliers became a far-less-marketable team overnight so putting them on the Christmas schedule wouldn't have made much sense.",
      "\u2014 Indiana was the East's No. 1 seed in 2014. Paul George got hurt badly while playing for USA Basketball that summer and the Pacers weren't the same the following the season, which the schedule-makers probably realized could happen.",
      "\u2014 Toronto was the East's No. 1 seed in 2018. Toronto didn't make the Christmas list a few months later for the simple reason that the Raptors are from Canada, and Canadian viewers don't count in American television ratings. (The then-reigning NBA champion Raptors made the Christmas lineup in 2019.)",
      "None of those situations would apply to the Thunder.",
      "Oklahoma City is a small market, sure. Only Memphis and New Orleans are smaller among NBA cities in the U.S., according to Nielsen. It's easy to deduce that national ratings play a part in the decision of who plays on Christmas and who doesn't, but it's also clear that those who just want to see good ball on Dec. 25 probably would have tuned in for a Thunder game.",
      "\u201cThey make the schedule. We play it,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cOur players, I know, would have liked to play on Christmas because that's such a staple day in the NBA season. But we can't control that. All we can control is playing the schedule we're given, playing the hand we're dealt.\u201d",

    "summary": "Lindsey Vonn thinks her new titanium knee could be the start of a trend in ski racing",
    "story": [
      "Lindsey Vonn thinks her new titanium knee could be the start of a trend in ski racing",
      "ST. MORITZ, Switzerland -- When Lindsey Vonn last raced on the World Cup circuit nearly six years ago, the constant pain in her knee left her in tears and led to retirement.",
      "Flash forward to Vonn\u2019s comeback race on a titanium knee at age 40 last weekend, and the American skiing standout couldn\u2019t have felt more different.",
      "No more pain. No more swelling. No more tears.",
      "\u201cThe last few years of my career were so much different than they are right now. I\u2019m skiing without thinking about my knee, which I really haven\u2019t done since I first tore my ACL in 2013. So it\u2019s been a long time that I felt this good,\u201d Vonn said Saturday after placing 14th in a super-G in St. Moritz. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit older, but honestly I\u2019m a hell of a lot stronger than I once was.\u201d",
      "So much stronger that she\u2019s talking up her knee replacement surgery \u2014 the first of its kind in World Cup skiing \u2014 as a new frontier for the sport.",
      "In April, Vonn had a robot-assisted replacement performed by Martin Roche, a South Florida-based orthopedist specializing in complex knee disorders. Part of the bone in her right knee was cut off and replaced by two titanium pieces. A month later, she was planning her comeback.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot better than my non-existent cartilage,\u201d said Vonn, one of the most successful skiers of all time with 82 World Cup wins. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot of skiers already about it and I really think that it could be something that should be considered.",
      "\u201cI feel amazing. I mean, obviously not everyone responds the same way to surgeries. For some reason, I bounce back pretty well from surgery. But I think it\u2019s something to seriously consider for athletes that have a lot of knee problems.\u201d",
      "Andrea Panzeri, the Italian Winter Sports Federation\u2019s head physician and an orthopedist who has operated numerous times on Vonn\u2019s good friend and fellow downhiller, Sofia Goggia, said knee replacements are usually performed on patients older than 50.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely the first time in World Cup history that such a young athlete has raced with one,\" Panzeri told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not aware of any other elite-level athletes in other sports competing with one, either.\u201d",
      "Panzeri performs knee replacements. But he had never even thought about doing one on a World Cup skier \u2014 until he saw Vonn competing with one.",
      "\u201cPartial prosthetics, like the half-knee ones, are definitely the ones that offer the best performance and we\u2019re seeing that (with Vonn),\" Panzeri said. \u201cI don\u2019t think her decision is going to change pro sports. But it could provide more motivation for so-called \u2018normal\u2019 people to try a prosthetic.\"",
      "Three-time Grand Slam tennis champion Andy Murray played with an artificial hip at the end of his career. Vonn\u2019s former skiing teammate Julia Mancuso also redid her hip a few months after she retired in 2018 and maintains an active lifestyle.",
      "\u201cI, for sure, would have considered a comeback if I didn\u2019t have kids,\" Mancuso told The AP recently. \"So I can totally relate to Lindsey.\u201d",
      "But Panzeri said that \u201chips have different biomechanics than a knee and many more people are able to play sports with a hip prosthetic than a knee prosthetic.\"",
      "Elan Goldwaser, a sports medicine physician at Columbia University Medical Center who works with the U.S. Ski Team, has seen many athletes come to his clinic for knee replacements but not elite-level competitors.",
      "So, is Vonn\u2019s operation going to be a trend-setter in skiing?",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the go-to like in baseball with Tommy John surgery,\u201d Goldwaser said in St. Moritz. \u201cBut if it\u2019s necessary, it\u2019s a good procedure to do.\u201d",
      "Chris Knight, Vonn\u2019s personal coach, said they had questions over whether her titanium knee would hold up to the forces required to navigate downhill skiing turns at 80 mph (130 kph) as she hurls herself down steep mountains.",
      "\u201cThere was not a lot of research out there with high-level athletes and partial knee replacements,\" Knight said. \u201cIt is a new frontier. But so far everything\u2019s working really well... And I would not be surprised if other people do it because the results that Lindsey\u2019s had, with no pain and no swelling, have been unbelievable.",
      "\u201cGranted, she stayed in great shape the entire time she hasn\u2019t been racing. So, that probably helped. I mean, if you\u2019re sitting around as a non-active skier and not doing anything with your fitness, then maybe it wouldn\u2019t be as effective. But if you\u2019re an athlete who\u2019s got some knee problems, from what I\u2019m seeing, I wouldn\u2019t be saying no to them.\u201d",
      "Vonn\u2019s new knee also left an impression on U.S. Ski Team head coach Paul Kristofic.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely due for one myself,\u201d Kristofic said. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to her.\"",
      "Still, there are doubters.",
      "Four-time overall World Cup champion Pirmin Zurbriggen told Swiss tabloid Blick last week that \u201cthere is a risk that Vonn will tear her artificial knee to pieces.\u201d",
      "But Panzeri said the titanium does not rupture.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a small prosthetic that doesn\u2019t break.\u201d",
      "Vonn will race next in St. Anton, Austria, Jan. 11-12.",

The Valkyries, who have the No. 5 pick in the draft, also are expected to be active in free agency which begins next month.",

White has decided she has some unfinished business to complete in her second stint as Indiana\u2019s head coach.",

Then, they initially assessed Wembanyama with a technical foul for flopping. Maxey shot and made a free throw and the point went on the scoreboard, only for the officials to rescind the technical, remove the point and restart the game.",

      "\u201cHe got lots of reps prior to these practices, but he\u2019s getting much more now,\u201d Smart said. \u201cI do think ... when you get ready for an opponent like Notre Dame, you need time and we have time.\u201d",
      "The Fighting Irish advanced by beating Indiana 27-17 in the first round on Friday night. Smart said Stockton and Georgia can focus on Notre Dame.",
      "\u201cBut I think the biggest thing is just competition at practice,\u201d Smart said. \u201cYou know, the situations we put him in. All those things allow him to get better as a quarterback.\u201d",
      "Georgia announced on Dec. 9 that Beck and his family were considering treatment options for his elbow. Those options could include surgery, though Georgia has not released details about the injury.",
      "Two weeks later, no decision has been released by Beck or Georgia.",
      "\u201cThe only thing I can update is that they\u2019re still going through those deliberations in terms of the decision-making process time, all the kind of decisions they have to make as a family,\u201d Smart said.",
      "Beck suffered the injury to his throwing arm in the first half of the SEC championship game and made a dramatic return to the field for the handoff on the game-winning play in overtime. Stockton had to leave the field for one play after having his helmet knocked off.",
      "Even though he was able to take the snap and hand off to Trevor Etienne for the running back\u2019s decisive 4-yard touchdown run, Beck was unable to raise his right arm.",
      "Stockton completed 12 of 16 passes for 71 yards with one interception against Texas.",
      "Smart downplayed the suggestion Stockton could give the Bulldogs more options as a running quarterback.",
      "\u201cI think we are who we are in regards to that,\u201d Smart said. \u201cI mean, we played an entire season, offensively. You know, Gunner\u2019s a good athlete. I think Carson is a good athlete. So it\u2019s one of those deals that I don\u2019t know how much that changes things.\u201d",
      "Beck, a fifth-year senior, is 24-3 as a starter. He started all 26 games for the Bulldogs in 2023 and 2024. He passed for 3,941 yards with 24 touchdowns and only six interceptions in 2023 but had more difficulties with turnovers this season. Beck passed for 28 touchdowns with 12 interceptions this season and completed 7 of 13 passes for 56 yards before his injury in the SEC championship game.",

      "\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome Chris Koclanes as the new head coach of the Dallas Wings,\u201d said Curt Miller, executive vice president and general manager. \u201cThroughout our extensive search and interview process, Chris continued to rise to the top and check the boxes of our important pillars. He is a servant leader who places a high value on connection, collaboration, and a positive and consistent communication style with all those he coaches.\"",
      "Koclanes worked with Miller in Connecticut on his staff from 2016-22 and helped the Sun reach the WNBA Finals in 2019 and 2022. Miller was hired as the Wings' general manager last month.",
      "The Connecticut Sun defense shined under Koclanes, consistently finishing in the top three in the WNBA in opponent scoring average, opponent turnovers committed and opponent field goal and 3-point shooting percentages.",
      "\u201cChris is a fantastic teacher of the game and has an outstanding basketball IQ. He is committed to player development and has a forward thinking and innovative mind for the game,\" Miller said. \"He is a tireless worker with a foundation built through preparation.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued the NCAA to block the participation of transgender athletes in women\u2019s sports, arguing that it tricks and misleads fans",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has sued the NCAA to block the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports, arguing that it tricks and misleads fans.",
      "The lawsuit filed in state district court in Lubbock and announced Sunday, argues the NCAA violates the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act by promoting women's sports that may include a transgender athlete. The law is designed to protect consumers from being misled or tricked into buying products or services that are not as advertised, the lawsuit said.",
      "The Texas lawsuit is the latest attempt by conservative politicians to target transgender athletes and push the NCAA into banning them from competition. President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to stop trans athletes from competing.",
      "The lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop the NCAA from allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's sports in Texas, or in sports that involve Texas programs. Or it wants the court to require the NCAA to stop marketing events as \u201cwomen's\u201d sports if transgender athletes are allowed.",
      "In a statement, Paxton appeared to reference the recent controversy involving San Jose State women's volleyball, where several opponents forfeited matches this season on grounds the Spartans had a transgender player.",
      "A federal court last month refused to block the school from playing in the Mountain West Conference championship.",
      "\u201cWhen people watch a women\u2019s volleyball game, for example, they expect to see women playing against other women, not biological males pretending to be something they are not,\u201d Paxton said. \u201cRadical \u2018gender theory\u2019 has no place in college sports.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press is withholding the player\u2019s name because she has not publicly commented on her gender identity and through school officials has declined an interview request.",
      "Paxton accused the NCAA of \u201cintentionally and knowingly jeopardizing the safety and wellbeing of women\" and turning women's sports into \u201cco-ed competitions.\u201d",
      "The NCAA does not track data on transgender athletes among the 544,000 currently competing on 19,000 teams at various levels across the country. NCAA President Charlie Baker testified in Congress earlier this month that he was aware of fewer than 10 active NCAA athletes who identified as transgender.",
      "\u201cCollege sports are the premier stage for women\u2019s sports in America, and while the NCAA does not comment on pending litigation, the Association and its members will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women\u2019s sports and ensure fair competition in all NCAA championships,\u201d the NCAA said in a statement Monday.",
      "Brooke Slusser, the San Jose State volleyball co-captain who was among the group of players who sued the Mountain West Conference over her teammate's participation, praised the Texas lawsuit on social media.",
      "\u201cHey NCAA, just in case you haven\u2019t realized yet this fight will just keep getting harder for you until you make a change!,\u201d Slusser posted on X.",
      "The NCAA established a policy in 2010 that requires trans athletes who were assigned male at birth to complete at least one year of testosterone suppression therapy before being eligible to compete on a women\u2019s team.",
      "Trans athletes who were assigned female at birth and transitioned to male can compete on a men\u2019s team but if they have received testosterone treatment are ineligible to compete on a women\u2019s team.",
      "The athletes are required to meet their chosen sport\u2019s standard for documented testosterone levels at various points during a season.",
      "In 2022, the NCAA revised the policy in what the organization called an attempt to be aligned with national sports governing bodies. If a governing body does not have a trans athlete policy, then it scales up to the international federation that oversees the sport. If there is no international federation policy, previously established Olympic policy criteria would be followed.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan will attempt to merge and create the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan will attempt to merge and create the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses. Honda will initially lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company.",
      "Following is a quick look at what a combined Honda and Nissan would mean for the companies, and for the auto industry.",
      "The ascent of Chinese automakers is rattling the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Relatively inexpensive EVs from China's BYD, Great Wall and Nio are eating into the market shares of U.S. and Japanese car companies in China and elsewhere.",
      "Japanese automakers have lagged behind big rivals in EVs and are now trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they will share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers.",
      "Joining forces would help the smaller Japanese automakers add scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota itself has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Nissan has truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "\u201cNissan does have some product segments where Honda doesn\u2019t currently play,\u201d that a merger or partnership could help, said Sam Abuelsamid, a Detroit-area automotive industry analsyt.",
      "While Nissan's electric Leaf and Ariya haven't sold well in the U.S., they're solid vehicles, Fiorani said. \u201cThey haven't been resting on their laurels, and they have been developing this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have new products coming that could provide a good platform for Honda for its next generation.\u201d",
      "Nissan said last month that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. A report in the Japanese financial magazine Diamond said talks with Honda gained urgency after the Taiwan maker of iPhones Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, began exploring a possible acquisition of Nissan as part of its push into the EV sector.",
      "The company has struggled for years following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the leading Japanese automaker.",
      "All the global automakers are facing potential shocks if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to raise or impose tariffs on imports of foreign products, even from allies like Japan and neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Nissan is among the major car companies that have adjusted their supply chains to include vehicles assembled in Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say there is an \u201caffordability shift\u201d taking place across the industry, led by people who feel they cannot afford to pay nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle. In American, a vital market for companies like Nissan, Honda and Toyota, that's forcing automakers to consider lower pricing, which will eat further into industry profits.",

      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk\u2019s X, or wanting an alternative to Meta\u2019s Threads and its algorithms",
      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk's X, which they view as increasingly leaning too far to the right given its owner's support of President-elect Donald Trump, or wanting an alternative to Meta's Threads and its algorithms.",
      "The platform grew out of the company then known as Twitter, championed by its former CEO Jack Dorsey. Its decentralized approach to social networking was eventually intended to replace Twitter's core mechanic. That's unlikely now that the two companies have parted ways. But Bluesky's growth trajectory \u2014 with a user base that has more than doubled since October \u2014 could make it a serious competitor to other social platforms.",
      "But with growth comes growing pains. It's not just human users who've been flocking to Bluesky but also bots, including those designed to create partisan division or direct users to junk websites.",
      "The skyrocketing user base \u2014 now surpassing 25 million \u2014 is the biggest test yet for a relatively young platform that has branded itself as a social media alternative free of the problems plaguing its competitors. According to research firm Similarweb, Bluesky added 7.6 million monthly active app users on iOS and Android in November, an increase of 295.4% since October. It also saw 56.2 million desktop and mobile web visits, in the same period, up 189% from October.",
      "Besides the U.S. elections, Bluesky also got a boost when X was briefly banned in Brazil.",
      "\u201cThey got this spike in attention, they\u2019ve crossed the threshold where it is now worth it for people to flood the platform with spam,\u201d said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and a member of Issue One\u2019s Council for Responsible Social Media. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have the cash flow, they don\u2019t have the established team that a larger platform would, so they have to do it all very, very quickly.\u201d",
      "To manage growth for its tiny staff, Bluesky started as an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other distinctive features to attract new users, such as \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide lists of topically curated feeds. Meta recently announced that it is testing a similar feature.",
      "Compared to the bigger players like Meta's platforms or X, Bluesky has a \u201cquite different\u201d value system, said Claire Wardle, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in misinformation. This includes giving users more control over their experience.",
      "\u201cThe first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders,\u201d Bluesky said on its blog in March. \u201cOur online experience doesn\u2019t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.\u201d",
      "Because of this mindset, Bluesky has achieved a scrappy underdog status that has attracted users who've grown tired of the big players.",
      "\u201cPeople had this idea that it was going to be a different type of social network,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cBut the truth is, when you get lots of people in a place and there are eyeballs, it means that it\u2019s in other people\u2019s interests to use bots to create, you know, information that aligns with their perspective.\u201d",
      "Little data has emerged to help quantify the rise in impersonator accounts, artificial intelligence-fueled networks and other potentially harmful content on Bluesky. But in recent weeks, users have begun reporting large numbers of apparent AI bots following them, posting plagiarized articles or making seemingly automated divisive comments in replies.",
      "Lion Cassens, a Bluesky user and doctoral candidate in the Netherlands, found one such network by accident \u2014 a group of German-language accounts with similar bios and AI-generated profile pictures posting in replies to three German newspapers.",
      "\u201cI noticed some weird replies under a news post by the German newspaper \u2018Die Ziet,\u2019\u201d he said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cI have a lot of trust in the moderation mechanism on Bluesky, especially compared to Twitter since the layoffs and due to Musk\u2019s more radical stance on freedom of speech. But AI bots are a big challenge, as they will only improve. I hope social media can keep up with that.\u201d",
      "Cassens said the bots' messages have been relatively innocuous so far, but he was concerned about how they could be repurposed in the future to mislead.",
      "There are also signs that foreign disinformation narratives have made their way to Bluesky. The disinformation research group Alethea pointed to one low-traction post sharing a false claim about ABC News that had circulated on Russian Telegram channels.",
      "Copycat accounts are another challenge. In late November, Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, found that of the top 100 most followed named individuals on Bluesky, 44% had at least one duplicate account posing as them. Two weeks later, Mantzarlis said Bluesky had removed around two-thirds of the duplicate accounts he\u2019d initially detected \u2014 a sign the site was aware of the issue and attempting to address it.",
      "Bluesky posted earlier this month that it had quadrupled its moderation team to keep up with its growing user base. The company also announced it had introduced a new system to detect impersonation and was working to improve its Community Guidelines to provide more detail on what\u2019s allowed. Because of the way the site is built, users also have the option to subscribe to third-party \u201cLabelers\u201d that outsource content moderation by tagging accounts with warnings and context.",
      "The company didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.",
      "Even as its challenges aren\u2019t yet at the scale other platforms face, Bluesky is at a \u201ccrossroads,\u201d said Edward Perez, a board member at the nonpartisan nonprofit OSET Institute, who previously led Twitter\u2019s civic integrity team.",
      "\u201cWhether BlueSky likes it or not, it is being pulled into the real world,\u201d Perez said, noting that it needs to quickly prioritize threats and work to mitigate them if it hopes to continue to grow.",
      "That said, disinformation and bots won't be Bluesky's only challenges in the months and years to come. As a text-based social network, its entire premise is falling out of favor with younger generations. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that only 17% of American teenagers used X, for instance, down from 23% in 2022. For teens and young adults, TikTok, Instagram and other visual-focused platforms are the places to be.",
      "Political polarization is also going against Bluesky ever reaching the size of TikTok, Instagram or even X.",
      "\u201cBluesky is not trying to be all things to all people,\u201d Wardle said, adding that, likely, the days of a Facebook or Instagram emerging where they're \u201ctrying to keep everybody happy\u201d are over. Social platforms are increasingly splintered along political lines and when they aren't \u2014 see Meta's platforms \u2014 the companies behind them are actively working to de-emphasize political content and news.",

    "story": [
      "The whistleblower helped train artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT.",
      "Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI engineer and whistleblower who helped train the artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT and later said he believed those practices violated copyright law, has died, according to his parents and San Francisco officials. He was 26.",
      "Balaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before quitting in August. He was well-regarded by colleagues at the San Francisco company, where a co-founder this week called him one of OpenAI's strongest contributors who was essential to developing some of its products.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news and our hearts go out to Suchir\u2019s loved ones during this difficult time,\u201d said a statement from OpenAI.",
      "Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26 in what police said \u201cappeared to be a suicide. No evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation.\u201d The city's chief medical examiner's office confirmed the manner of death to be suicide.",
      "His parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy said they are still seeking answers, describing their son as a \u201chappy, smart and brave young man\u201d who loved to hike and recently returned from a trip with friends.",
      "Balaji grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and first arrived at the fledgling AI research lab for a 2018 summer internship while studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. He returned a few years later to work at OpenAI, where one of his first projects, called WebGPT, helped pave the way for ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cSuchir\u2019s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn\u2019t have succeeded without him,\u201d said OpenAI co-founder John Schulman in a social media post memorializing Balaji. Schulman, who recruited Balaji to his team, said what made him such an exceptional engineer and scientist was his attention to detail and ability to notice subtle bugs or logical errors.",
      "\u201cHe had a knack for finding simple solutions and writing elegant code that worked,\u201d Schulman wrote. \u201cHe\u2019d think through the details of things carefully and rigorously.\u201d",
      "Balaji later shifted to organizing the huge datasets of online writings and other media used to train GPT-4, the fourth generation of OpenAI's flagship large language model and a basis for the company's famous chatbot. It was that work that eventually caused Balaji to question the technology he helped build, especially after newspapers, novelists and others began suing OpenAI and other AI companies for copyright infringement.",
      "He first raised his concerns with The New York Times, which reported them in an October profile of Balaji.",
      "He later told The Associated Press he would \u201ctry to testify\u201d in the strongest copyright infringement cases and considered a lawsuit brought by The New York Times last year to be the \u201cmost serious.\u201d Times lawyers named him in a Nov. 18 court filing as someone who might have \u201cunique and relevant documents\u201d supporting allegations of OpenAI's willful copyright infringement.",
      "His records were also sought by lawyers in a separate case brought by book authors including the comedian Sarah Silverman, according to a court filing.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right to be training on people\u2019s data and then competing with them in the marketplace,\u201d Balaji told the AP in late October. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be able to do that. I don\u2019t think you are able to do that legally.\u201d",
      "He told the AP that he gradually grew more disillusioned with OpenAI, especially after the internal turmoil that led its board of directors to fire and then rehire CEO Sam Altman last year. Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations.",
      "But of the \u201cbag of issues\u201d he was concerned about, he said he was focusing on copyright as the one it was \u201cactually possible to do something about.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged that it was an unpopular opinion within the AI research community, which is accustomed to pulling data from the internet, but said \u201cthey will have to change and it\u2019s a matter of time.\u201d",
      "He had not been deposed and it\u2019s unclear to what extent his revelations will be admitted as evidence in any legal cases after his death. He also published a personal blog post with his opinions about the topic.",
      "Schulman, who resigned from OpenAI in August, said he and Balaji coincidentally left on the same day and celebrated with fellow colleagues that night with dinner and drinks at a San Francisco bar. Another of Balaji\u2019s mentors, co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, had left OpenAI several months earlier, which Balaji saw as another impetus to leave.",
      "Schulman said Balaji had told him earlier this year of his plans to leave OpenAI and that Balaji didn't think that better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence \u201cwas right around the corner, like the rest of the company seemed to believe.\u201d The younger engineer expressed interest in getting a doctorate and exploring \u201csome more off-the-beaten path ideas about how to build intelligence,\u201d Schulman said.",
      "Balaji's family said a memorial is being planned for later this month at the India Community Center in Milpitas, California, not far from his hometown of Cupertino.",

      "Adult perentie lizards can reach more than 8 feet (2.4 meters) in length and can weigh more than 40 pounds (18 kilograms), the zoo said. They have brown skin with cream or yellow markings. The carnivorous species eats turtle eggs, insects, birds, other reptiles, and small mammals and marsupials, and they swallow their prey whole.",

      "The lawsuits target the low-carbon fuel standard, which requires California to reduce the environmental impact of transportation fuels by incentivizing producers to cut emissions. The California Air Resources Board voted last month to increase the state\u2019s emission reduction targets, fund charging infrastructure for zero-emission vehicles, and phase out incentives for capturing methane emissions from dairy farms to turn into fuel.",
      "California, which often leads the nation on climate policy, plans to achieve so-called carbon neutrality by 2045, meaning the state will remove as many carbon emissions from the atmosphere as it emits. The state has passed policies in recent years to phase out the sale of new fossil-fuel powered cars, trucks, trains and lawn mowers.",
      "One of the lawsuits filed this week, by the nonprofit Communities for a Better Environment, accuses the board of failing to thoroughly analyze the climate impacts of burning biofuels derived from plants and animal waste. Another, filed by Food and Water Watch, Central Valley Defenders of Clean Air and Water, and the Animal Legal Defense Fund, focuses on the impact of pollution often impacting low-income and Latino communities from the capture of methane from cow manure to turn into fuel.",
      "\u201cPeople who live near refineries in California are harmed by the spiraling expansion of polluting biofuels,\u201d but CARB failed to analyze the resulting harm to these communities, said a statement by Katherine Ramos, a program director at Communities for a Better Environment.",

      "Amazon workers affiliated with the Teamsters union launched a strike at seven of the company's delivery hubs less than a week before Christmas.",
      "The Teamsters said the workers, who voted to authorize strikes in recent days, joined picket lines on Thursday after Amazon ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations.",
      "The company says it doesn't expect the strike to impact holiday shipments.",
      "Amazon has a couple hundred employees at each delivery station. The Teamsters mainly have focused on organizing delivery drivers, who work for contractors that handle package deliveries for the company. But Amazon has rebuffed demands to come to the negotiating table since it doesn't consider the drivers to be its employees.",
      "The International Brotherhood of Teamsters also says the union represents some Amazon warehouse workers.",
      "Here\u2019s what else you need to know:",
      "The strikes are taking place at three delivery hubs in Southern California, and one each in San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta, Georgia, and Skokie, Illinois, according to the union\u2019s announcement.",
      "The union hasn't said how many workers are participating in the strike, nor how long it will go on. Vinnie Perrone, the president of a local Teamsters union in metro New York, said Thursday that the walkout would continue \u201cas long as it takes.\u201d",
      "The union, which claims to represent 10,000 Amazon workers at 10 facilities, said workers in more locations were prepared to join the fight.",
      "Employees at a company air hub in California have authorized a strike. So have workers at an Amazon warehouse in New York, which unionized with the nascent Amazon Labor Union in 2022 and has since affiliated with the Teamsters.",
      "The Teamsters says its local unions are also putting up picket lines at other Amazon warehouses.

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 05:46:20 -0500",

    "story": [
      "New discoveries from several archaeological sites in North and South America suggest that ancient people first arrived in the New World much earlier than scientists once thought",
      "SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Sloths weren\u2019t always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge \u2014 up to 4 tons (3.6 metric tons) \u2014 and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier \u2014 perhaps far earlier \u2014 than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\u201cThere was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly \u2014 what\u2019s called \u2018Pleistocene overkill,\u2019\u201d said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \u201chumans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms \u2014 a bit like the plates of modern armadillos \u2014 that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there\u2019s a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\u201cWe believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\u201d she said. Three similar \u201cpendant\u201d fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table \u2014 those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old \u2014 more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco\u2019s research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \u201cfresh bones\u201d shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas \u2014 and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a big debate,\u201d Pacheco said.",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \u201cWhat I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\u201d she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America \u2014 giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time \u2014 with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% \u2014 many researchers surmised that humans\u2019 arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\u201cIt was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\u201d said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s Human Origins Program. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t really work so well anymore.\u201d",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods \u2014 including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques \u2014 coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\u201cAnything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\u201d said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \u201cBut really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\u201d",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\u201cWe found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\u201d in \u201cfresh bones\u201d \u2014 meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites \u2014 whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn\u2019t clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\u201cMonte Verde was a shock. You\u2019re here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \u201ccut marks\u201d on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it\u2019s hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\u201d said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \u201cWhy would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \u201cWe didn\u2019t set out to find the oldest anything \u2014 we\u2019ve really just followed the evidence where it leads,\u201d he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans\u2019 arrival in the Americas remains contested \u2014 and may never be known \u2014 it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn\u2019t immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \u201ca giant ground sloth going along on four feet\u201d when it encounters the footprints of a small human who\u2019s recently dashed by. The huge animal \u201cstops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

      "Suspected drone sightings in the eastern U.S. are continuing to captivate many, but the federal government's authority to track and disable any threatening unmanned aircraft is set to expire after Friday",
      "As suspected drone sightings over the eastern U.S. including New Jersey continue to captivate many, the federal government's authority to track and disable unmanned aircraft deemed threatening is set to expire after Friday and a temporary spending bill before Congress that would extend that power is now in question.",
      "Meanwhile, the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday temporarily banned drone flights in 22 areas of New Jersey where critical infrastructure is located. FAA officials said the flight restrictions were requested by federal security agencies and are effective through Jan. 17.",
      "Federal and local authorities have been investigating sightings of suspected drones, but officials say there has been nothing so far to suggest that any drones have posed a national security or public safety threat. In fact, authorities say, many of the drone sightings have actually been legal drones, manned aircraft, helicopters and even stars.",
      "Tucked into the bipartisan plan to prevent a government shutdown is a provision that would extend the authority of the departments of Homeland Security and Justice to track and disable unmanned aircraft deemed a credible threat from Dec. 20 until March 14.",
      "That authority is vital, homeland security officials and experts say, to detect and disable any threatening drones flying near military bases, the president's location, U.S. borders, prisons and mass gatherings such as New Year's Eve celebrations and the Super Bowl \u2014 and they were hopeful a reauthorization of those powers will be approved before Friday's expiration.",
      "But the temporary spending bill including the reauthorization fell into question Wednesday when President-elect Donald Trump abruptly rejected it and told Republicans to essentially renegotiate only days before the deadline when federal funding runs out. Congress continued working Thursday to pass a bill to avert a shutdown.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what a lapse in that authority would mean, including to drone detection systems the federal government has deployed to states, including New Jersey where numerous sightings have been reported, at the request of local officials. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's office referred questions about the detection systems to Homeland Security officials.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security on Thursday declined to comment on the expiration of the drone authorities. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, along with other Biden administration officials and both Republicans and Democrats in Congress, has repeatedly called for the reauthorization and expansion of the authority for \u201ccounter-unmanned aerial systems\u201d operations, or C-UAS.",
      "\u201cEnsuring that existing authorities do not lapse is vital to our mission, including protecting the president and vice president, patrolling certain designated areas along the Southwest Border, securing certain federal facilities and assets, and safeguarding the public,\u201d Mayorkas told the House Homeland Security Committee in November 2023. \u201cAny lapse in DHS\u2019s current C-UAS authority would entail serious risks for our homeland security, as DHS would have to cease or curtail existing C-UAS operations.\"",
      "Bills in the House and Senate that would extend and expand the federal government's drone powers remain pending. The bills also would allow state and local officials for the first time to track and disable threatening drones under a pilot program overseen by federal authorities.",
      "On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, was blocked from quickly advancing the Senate bill when Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, objected to its passage. Paul said it wasn\u2019t clear there is a threat from drones that warrants urgent action."

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll \u201cvigorously pursue\u201d capital punishment after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of most people on federal death row partly to stop Trump from pushing forward their executions",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump promised on Tuesday to \u201cvigorously pursue\u201d capital punishment after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of most people on federal death row partly to stop Trump from pushing forward their executions.",
      "Trump criticized Biden\u2019s decision on Monday to change the sentences of 37 of the 40 condemned people to life in prison without parole, arguing that it was senseless and insulted the families of their victims. Biden said converting their punishments to life imprisonment was consistent with the moratorium imposed on federal executions in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.",
      "\u201cJoe Biden just commuted the Death Sentence on 37 of the worst killers in our Country,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. \u201cWhen you hear the acts of each, you won\u2019t believe that he did this. Makes no sense. Relatives and friends are further devastated. They can\u2019t believe this is happening!\u201d",
      "Presidents historically have no involvement in dictating or recommending the punishments that federal prosecutors seek for defendants in criminal cases, though Trump has long sought more direct control over the Justice Department's operations. The president-elect wrote that he would direct the department to pursue the death penalty \u201cas soon as I am inaugurated,\u201d but was vague on what specific actions he may take and said they would be in cases of \u201cviolent rapists, murderers, and monsters.\u201d",
      "He highlighted the cases of two men who were on federal death row for slaying a woman and a girl, had admitted to killing more and had their sentences commuted by Biden.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump often called for expanding the federal death penalty \u2014 including for those who kill police officers, those convicted of drug and human trafficking, and migrants who kill U.S. citizens.",
      "\u201cTrump has been fairly consistent in wanting to sort of say that he thinks the death penalty is an important tool and he wants to use it,\u201d said Douglas Berman, an expert on sentencing at Ohio State University\u2019s law school. \u201cBut whether practically any of that can happen, either under existing law or other laws, is a heavy lift.\u201d",
      "Berman said Trump\u2019s statement at this point seems to be just a response to Biden\u2019s commutation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m inclined to think it\u2019s still in sort of more the rhetoric phase. Just, \u2018don\u2019t worry. The new sheriff is coming. I like the death penalty,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Most Americans have historically supported the death penalty for people convicted of murder, according to decades of annual polling by Gallup, but support has declined over the past few decades. About half of Americans were in favor in an October poll, while roughly 7 in 10 Americans backed capital punishment for murderers in 2007.",
      "Before Biden's commutation, there were 40 federal death row inmates compared with more than 2,000 who have been sentenced to death by states.",
      "\u201cThe reality is all of these crimes are typically handled by the states,\u201d Berman said.",
      "A question is whether the Trump administration would try to take over some state murder cases, such as those related to drug trafficking or smuggling. He could also attempt to take cases from states that have abolished the death penalty.",
      "Berman said Trump's statement, along with some recent actions by states, may present an effort to get the Supreme Court to reconsider a precedent that considers the death penalty disproportionate punishment for rape.",
      "\u201cThat would literally take decades to unfold. It\u2019s not something that is going to happen overnight,\u201d Berman said.",
      "Before one of Trump's rallies on Aug. 20, his prepared remarks released to the media said he would announce he would ask for the death penalty for child rapists and child traffickers. But Trump never delivered the line.",
      "One of the men Trump highlighted on Tuesday was ex-Marine Jorge Avila Torrez, who was sentenced to death for killing a sailor in Virginia and later pleaded guilty to the fatal stabbing of an 8-year-old and a 9-year-old girl in a suburban Chicago park several years before.",
      "The other man, Thomas Steven Sanders, was sentenced to death for the kidnapping and slaying of a 12-year-old girl in Louisiana, days after shooting the girl's mother in a wildlife park in Arizona. Court records show he admitted to both killings.",
      "Some families of victims expressed anger with Biden's decision, but the president had faced pressure from advocacy groups urging him to make it more difficult for Trump to increase the use of capital punishment for federal inmates. The ACLU and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops were some of the groups that applauded the decision.",
      "Biden left three federal inmates to face execution. They are Dylann Roof, who carried out the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history. _______",

    "title": "House Ethics report finds 'substantial evidence' Gaetz violated statutory rape law",
    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:39:06 -0500",
    "summary": "A House Ethics Committee report found \"substantial evidence\" that former Rep. Matt Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old in 2017 in violation of Florida's statutory rape law.",
    "story": [
      "Gaetz had sued the committee to stop the release of the report.",
      "The bipartisan House Ethics Committee on Monday released a scathing report concluding its yearslong investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, finding \"substantial evidence\" that he had sex with a 17-year-old in 2017 in violation of Florida's statutory rape law, and engaged in a broader pattern of paying women for sex.",
      "The report also detailed evidence of illegal drug use, acceptance of improper gifts, granting special favors to personal associates, and obstruction, after Gaetz refused to comply with subpoenas and withheld evidence from the committee.",
      "A woman testified to the committee that Gaetz had sex with her in 2017, when she was 17 and had just completed her junior year of high school, and Gaetz was in his first year in Congress. Identified only as \"Victim A\" in the report, the woman told investigators she received $400 in cash from the then-congressman that evening, \"which she understood to be payment for sex,\" according to the report.",
      "\"The Committee received credible testimony from Victim A herself, as well as multiple individuals corroborating the allegation,\" the report says. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "While many of the allegations in the committee's report have been previously reported, this is the first time the woman's direct testimony about Gaetz having sex with her when she was a minor has been made public, along with corroborating testimony from others.",
      "Investigators noted that while the former Florida congressman has \"suggested that the allegations against him have been manufactured\" and had called into question Victim A's credibility, \"the Committee found no reason to doubt the credibility of Victim A.\"",
      "The report details that between 2017-2020, records obtained by the committee show Gaetz paid nearly $100,000 dollars to 12 different women and to Joel Greenberg, his one-time close friend who in 2021 pleaded guilty to numerous crimes, including sex trafficking Victim A.",
      "While all the women who testified to the committee described their sexual encounters with Gaetz as consensual, according to the report, one woman raised concerns that drug use at the parties and events may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\" Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report alleges that Gaetz \"took advantage of the economic vulnerability of young women to lure them into sexual activity for which they received an average of a few hundred dollars after each encounter.\"",
      "\"Such behavior is not 'generosity to ex-girlfriends,' and it does not reflect creditably upon the House,\" the report reads, referencing the former congressman's previous statement dismissing the allegations as someone \"trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.\"",
      "\"Based on the above, the Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the report says.",
      "Following the release of the report, Gaetz shared on X what appears to be a message he received from President-elect Donald Trump, though it is unclear when the message was sent.",
      "\"I got a great note from President Trump!\" Gaetz wrote alongside a photograph showing what appears to be a brief message from Trump, saying, \"Matt very unfair!\"",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The Justice Department declined to charge him last year after a yearslong investigation into similar allegations.",
      "Last month, Trump tapped Gaetz to serve as attorney general in the incoming administration, and Gaetz resigned his congressional seat shortly after. Gaetz subsequently withdrew his name from consideration for AG, saying his confirmation process was \"unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\"",
      "The Ethics Committee was in the final stages of its probe into Gaetz when Trump tapped him for attorney general. The committee generally drops investigations of members if they leave office, but Gaetz's resignation prompted a fiery debate on Capitol Hill over whether the panel should release its report to allow the Senate to perform its role of vetting presidential nominations.",
      "Following indications last week that the committee would release its report, Gaetz took to X in a lengthy post, writing in part that when he was single he \"often sent funds to women\" he dated and that he \"never had sexual contact with someone under 18.\"",
      "\"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now,\" he posted. \"I've never been charged. I've never been sued. Instead, House Ethics will reportedly post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\"",
      "In its report, the committee concluded that it did not find substantial evidence that Gaetz violated federal sex trafficking laws, finding that while Gaetz \"did cause the transportation of women across state lines for purposes of commercial sex,\" investigators did not find evidence \"that any of those women were under 18 at the time of travel, nor did the Committee find sufficient evidence to conclude that the commercial sex acts were induced by force, fraud, or coercion.\"",
      "According to the report, the committee conducted over two dozen interviews, issued 29 subpoenas, reviewed nearly 14,000 documents, and requested information from multiple government agencies as part of its extensive investigation into the allegations.",
      "The committee received written testimony from Greenberg but, due to credibility concerns, investigators said they would \"not rely exclusively on information provided by Mr. Greenberg,\" according to the report.",
      "The committee also accused Gaetz of obstructing its investigation by ignoring subpoenas, withholding documents, and declining to answer questions about the allegations.",
      "\"Representative Gaetz continuously sought to deflect, deter, or mislead the Committee in order to prevent his actions from being exposed,\" the report reads. \"His actions undermine not only his claims that he had exculpatory information to provide, but also his claims that he intended to cooperate with the Committee in good faith. It is apparent that Representative Gaetz's assertions were nothing more than attempts to delay the Committee's investigation.\"",
      "The committee had been investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift, according to sources.",
      "Earlier this year, the committee released a statement that it would continue its probe but would no longer pursue allegations that Gaetz \"may have shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe or improper gratuity.\"",
      "According to the report, while several committee members did not support its release, a majority of its members voted in favor of its release on Dec. 10. In a statement at the conclusion of the report, House Ethics Chairman Michael Guest reiterated his stance against the release of the report on behalf of the dissenting members while acknowledging that he and other members do not dispute the report's findings.",
      "\"We believe and remain steadfast in the position that the House Committee on Ethics lost jurisdiction to release to the public any substantive work product regarding Mr. Gaetz after his resignation from the House on November 14, 2024,\" Guest wrote.",
      "Earlier Monday Gaetz filed a lawsuit against the Ethics Committee in an effort to stop the committee from releasing its report.",
      "\"This action challenges the Committee's unconstitutional and ultra vires attempt to exercise jurisdiction over a private citizen through the threatened release of an investigative report containing potentially defamatory allegations,\" the filing from Gaetz said.",
      "Gaetz in the filing asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to block the release of the report or any findings, which he says would cause \"damage to his reputation and professional standing\" that would be \"immediate and severe.\"",
      "\"The threatened release of information believed to be defamatory by a Congressional committee concerning matters of sexual propriety and other acts of alleged moral turpitude constitutes irreparable harm that cannot be adequately remedied through monetary damages,\" the filing stated.",
      "\"After Plaintiff's resignation from Congress, Defendants improperly continued to act on its investigation, and apparently voted to publicly release reports and/or investigative materials related to Plaintiff without proper notice or disclosure to Plaintiff,\" the complaint said.",
      "Following the report's release Monday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta gave Gaetz until 5 p.m. ET to show why the suit shouldn't be dismissed with prejudice for lack of jurisdiction, given \"this case appears to be moot in light of the House Ethics Committee's public disclosure of the report.\"",
      "In a subsequent filing, attorneys for Gaetz acknowledged that their lawsuit is now \"mooted\" following the release of the report -- a move they said has caused Gaetz \"irreversible and irreparable harm.\"",
      "The filing said the committee's decision to release the report was \"unprecedented and procedurally defective,\" and reiterated their claim that it was released without notifying him.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 07:54:02 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump is again floating his interest in U.S. ownership of Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "The president-elect called it an \"absolute necessity.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump is again floating his interest in U.S. ownership of Greenland, prompting the leader of the island territory to clarify that it is not for sale.",
      "Trump on Sunday, in announcing his selection of PayPal co-founder Ken Howery to serve as his ambassador to Denmark, wrote that American ownership of the island was an \"absolute necessity.\"",
      "\"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity. Ken will do a wonderful job in representing the interests of the United States,\" Trump wrote in a statement.",
      "Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede flatly rejected the idea, posting a statement on Facebook, that according to translation says: \"Greenland is ours We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our year-long struggle for freedom. However, we must continue to be open to cooperation and trade with the whole world, especially with our neighbours.\"",
      "Trump similarly expressed an interest in trying to purchase Greenland during his first administration.",
      "Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark, which has sovereignty over the self-governing island, at the time pushed back that the idea was \"absurd.\"",
      "Frederiksen was reelected in 2022. The Danish prime minister's office, in a statement to ABC News, said the \"Danish Government is looking forward to welcoming the new American ambassador. And the Government is looking forward to working with the new administration.\"",
      "\"In a complex security political situation as the one we currently experience, transatlantic cooperation is crucial,\" the office said. \"As far as statements about Greenland, the Prime Minister's Office has no comments other than reference to what was stated by the Premier of Greenland about Greenland not being for sale, but open for cooperation.\"",
      "The first Trump administration gave Greenland $12 million for economic development, part of which was to help develop energy and natural resources. The U.S. also opened a consulate in Greenland for the first time in decades during Trump's previous presidency.",
      "The U.S. also operates Pituffik Space Base, the Defense Department's northernmost base, on Greenland's coast.",
      "Greenland is rich in valuable minerals, including rare earth metals, precious metals, precious stones, coal, graphite, and uranium, but its geography and climate makes commercially viable mining challenging, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce's International Trade Association. Its rare earth resources would rank in the top five worldwide if developed, the ITA reported.",
      "Previous Trump administration officials pointed to Greenland, the world's largest island, as a key interest as China and Russia ramped up activity in the Arctic.",
      "Howery, who previously served as U.S. ambassador to Sweden during the first Trump administration, said he was \"humbled\" by Trump tapping him to be the top U.S. diplomat in Greenland.",
      "\"Representing our great nation abroad is a profound responsibility. I know first-hand the power of diplomacy to advance American interests and strengthen alliances, and I am grateful for the opportunity to return to Europe to promote the President's agenda,\" Howery said in a statement posted to social media.",
      "Howery's statement did not address Trump's suggestion that American ownership of Greenland was an \"absolute necessity.\"",
      "\"I look forward to working with the dedicated teams at U.S. Embassy Copenhagen and U.S. Consulate Nuuk in Greenland to deepen the bonds between our countries,\" Howery said."

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 19:03:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Congress members urged President Joe Biden to exonerate civil rights leader Marcus Garvey.",
    "story": [
      "J. Edgar Hoover allegedly targeted Garvey over a century ago.",
      "A group of 21 House Democrats signed a letter urging the president to exonerate former civil rights leader Marcus Garvey, according to a statement sent by the lawmakers to ABC News on Monday.",
      "Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke (D-NY) led the panel of lawmakers -- mostly from the Congressional Black Caucus -- to exonerate Garvey on the heels of President Joe Biden's commutation of 37 sentences from federal death row on Monday.",
      "Garvey, one of the earliest internationally-known Black civil rights leaders, was convicted of mail fraud in 1923 and was given a five-year sentence, according to a letter sent to Biden from the Congress members, obtained by ABC News. President Calvin Coolidge pardoned Garvey two years into his sentence. Garvey was immediately deported to his birth country of Jamaica.",
      "\"Exonerating Mr. Garvey would honor his work for the Black community, remove the shadow of an unjust conviction, and further this administration's promise to advance racial justice,\" the lawmakers said in the letter to the president. \"At a time when Black history faces the existential threat of erasure by radical state legislatures, a presidential pardon for Mr. Garvey would correct the historical record and restore the legacy of an American hero.\"",
      "Congress members have been trying for decades to clear Garvey's name, according to the congress members. Congressman John Conyers led hearings in 1987 for the House Judiciary Committee on Garvey's exoneration. Congressman Charles Rangel introduced resolutions, highlighting alleged injustices against the former civil rights leader in 2004.",
      "\"Exactly 101 years ago, Mr. Garvey was convicted of mail fraud in a case that was marred by prosecutorial and governmental misconduct,\" The congress members said in the letter. \"The evidence paints an abundantly clear narrative that the charges against Mr. Garvey were not only fabricated but also targeted to criminalize, discredit, and silence him as a civil rights leader.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately reply to ABC News' request for a response.",
      "Garvey, who was born in Jamaica in 1887, was a notable Pan-Africanist, believing that people of African descent around the world should be unified because of their alleged common interests.",
      "Garvey was the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) which was created to challenge racial inequality, according to the lawmakers. The organization championed self-determination and economic independence for Black people at a time when Jim Crow laws oppressed African Americans and colonization subjugated Africans on their own continent.",
      "Garvey also established the Black Star Line, one of the first Black-owned shipping companies in the Western Hemisphere, connecting Black businesses across the Americas, according to the lawmakers. The civil rights leader eventually wanted to route the vessels to Africa for a redemption program, according to the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. He wanted to establish a nation for those who were born into slavery or were the descendants of enslaved people, according to The Washington Post.",
      "Garvey also created the Negro World Newspaper which, at its peak, reached a circulation of 200,000 readers weekly, according to the congressmembers.",
      "Garvey shared the segregationist views of the Ku Klux Klan as he sought a separate state for those of the African diaspora, according to The Washington Post.",
      "\"I regard the Klan the Anglo Saxon clubs and white American societies as far as the Negro is concerned, as better friends of the race than all other groups of hypocritical whites put together,\" Garvey said according to The New York Times.",
      "Other Black civil rights activists were outraged. W. E. B. Du Bois said Garvey was the most dangerous enemy of the Negro race and was either \"a lunatic or a traitor,\" according to PBS. Du Bois also said Garvey \"suffered from serious defects of temperament and training.\"",
      "The newly formed Bureau of Investigation, later becoming the FBI, and the director of its intelligence division, a-young J. Edgar Hoover, brought mail fraud proceedings against Garvey in connection to the sale of Black Star Line shipping stock, according to The Washington Post. He was sentenced to five years in prison and served two years before his pardon and eventual deportation by Coolidge.",
      "The FBI declined ABC News' request for a comment.",
      "Garvey never returned to the U.S. again, according to the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.",
      "\"As we approach the conclusion of your administration, this moment provides a chance to leave an indelible mark on history,\" the lawmakers told Biden in their letter.",

    "story": [
      "Trump celebrates election results and looks ahead to delivering on promises.",
      "In his first rally-style speech since winning the 2024 election, President-elect Donald Trump raved about his election victory for nearly 10 minutes before transitioning to confidence that he would deliver on his administration's promises, as well as touting his Cabinet selections.",
      "Trump spoke at AmericaFest, a political festival for conservatives put on by Turning Point, the conservative organization run by Charlie Kirk that was instrumental in helping Trump garner support among younger voters through its get out the vote initiatives in battleground states.",
      "Trump's speech was essentially many of the proposals he has already released on his Truth Social social media platform, including his threats on tariffs and taking back the Panama Canal, as well as bragging about the amount of people that have reached out to him since his victory.",
      "He said his remarks were \u201cjust a small preview of the common sense revolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause that's what I call it, a common sense revolution that's coming soon to America, to a theater near you, right? But it's coming to you through your president, Donald J. Trump,\u201d he said.",
      "Throughout his 75-minute remarks, Trump made no mention of the recently passed government funding bill, which did not include his last-minute demand to raise the debt ceiling or eliminate it. After vocally opposing the original bill, Trump has yet to make any comments on the legislation that passed early Saturday.",
      "However, speakers ahead of Trump had something to say on the issue. Trump's allies called for Speaker Mike Johnson to lose his speakership role over working with Democrats, called for the Republican lawmakers who voted against the package to be primaried, along with threats to Republican senators who were on the fence about confirming some of Trump's Cabinet picks.",
      "\"Johnson's not up to the task. He's got to go, right? He's got to go. Should Johnson be speaker of the House?\" Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser who served time in jail for contempt of Congress, asked the crowd, which responded with a resounding \"No.\"",
      "\"We don't need partisanship now. We need hyperpartisanship now. The conversation is over. We have nothing else to discuss. It's only about the execution of President Trump's plan,\" he added.",
      "However, when Trump took the stage, he spent most of his time touting his transition efforts.",
      "\"We have accomplished so much in just 47 days since the election. But that's only the beginning of what we will achieve together as the 47th president of the United States of America,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump said his second administration would \"turn the page\" on what he called four failed years under the Biden administration.",
      "\"I campaigned on an agenda of delivering profound change to Washington, and last month, the American people voted for change like they've never voted before, and in overwhelming numbers, numbers that nobody saw coming. I saw them coming because I think we all saw coming,\" Trump said.",
      "As tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has become more vocal about the future of the country, including a series of tweets criticizing the government funding bill, many lawmakers and pundits have started quipping that Musk is actually running the country. Trump laughed about the idea on Sunday, calling it the new \"hoax\" from the media and saying he likes to have smart people around him.",

Isn't it nice to have smart people that we could rely on?\" Trump quipped, celebrating Musk's role with the newly created Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Trump applauded Musk for his campaign contributions in Pennsylvania, helping North Carolinians during hurricane relief by providing Starlink, and his endeavors with SpaceX.",
      "\"No he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,\" Trump repeated. \"I'm safe. You know why? He wasn't born in this country. Ha, Ha.\"",
      "Trump spent time praising several of his embattled Cabinet picks, including his defense secretary selection Pete Hegseth, saying he thinks he will do \"great\" in the role.",
      "\"Over the past few weeks, I've nominated an all star Cabinet of some of the most determined and brilliant individuals ever to step forward for public office, and we're getting great reviews I have to say, they're all doing well, but we're getting fantastic reviews on the people that we chose,\" Trump said.",
      "He again shared misinformation about vaccines being linked to a rise in autism and said Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, would be in charge of investigating it.",
      "\"Think of this, 25 years ago, autism, one in 10,000 children today is one in 36 children. Is something wrong? I think so,\" he said. \"And Robert and I and all, we're going to figure it out\u2026\"",
      "Trump provided a one-sentence remark on Tulsi Gabbard, his choice for director of national intelligence, mentioning her nomination without any additional commentary. He added that he thinks Kash Patel, his selection to lead the FBI, \"may be the greatest director of them all.\"",
      "While Trump was going through his Day 1 priorities, he highlighted Russian President Vladimir Putin's comments in which he said he is ready to speak with the president-elect.",
      "\"President Putin said that he wants to meet with me as soon as possible. So we have to wait for this. But we have to end that war. That war is a horrible...\" Trump said, appearing to allude to public comments Putin made on Thursday.",
      "Trump also reiterated his tariff threat against Canada, Mexico, and China if they don't \"step up and stop the illegal aliens and illegal drugs from pouring into our country.\"",
      "\"They can't treat us that way. They're not going to be treating us that way for long that, I can tell you, because we're not going to let them turn the United States into a dumping ground.\"",
      "Trump also doubled down on his threat to take back the Panama Canal, complaining about the fees being charged to the U.S. Navy and American businesses: \"This complete ripoff of our country will immediately stop. It's going to stop,\" he said.",
      "As Trump spent the last couple months of his campaign emphasizing anti-transgender rhetoric, he said he will sign executive orders on Day 1 to end child sexual mutilation, get transgender people out of the military, and keep \"men out of women's sports.\"",
      "\"Under the Trump administration, it will be the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders: male and female. Later, Trump railed against the \"woke,\" calling wokeness \"bull----.\"",
      "While emphasizing his tariff threat, Trump also once again talked about migrants by labeling them as violent criminals, going on to assert that he would designate Mexican drug cartels as terrorist organizations, which he attempted to implement during his first term but halted after Mexico's president at the time urged him not to.",
      "\"Every foreign gang member will be expelled, and I will immediately designate the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. We're going to do it immediately. And we'll unleash the full power of federal law enforcement.\"",
      "Trump also vowed that his immigration policies would include a robust campaign on the flow of fentanyl into America and its devastating effects.",
      "\u201cWe're going to show what these drugs are doing to you. Nobody's done that before, and we're going to do it.\u201d",
      "One of his Day 1 priorities, he said, will be a \"historic slate of executive orders to close our border to illegal aliens and stop the invasion of our country.\"",
      "\"And on that same day, we will begin the largest deportation operation in American history, larger even than that of President Dwight Eisenhower,\" he said, calling it \"Operation Aurora,\" after the Colorado city that he referred to often on the campaign trail where he said immigrant gangs had taken over apartment buildings.",

      "\"I've been warning people, like, 'You got to chill out,' you know? Like the constant, you know, freakout, it's not helpful,\" Fetterman said. \"Pack a lunch, pace yourself, because he hasn't even taken office yet.\"",
      "Asked by Karl what the single biggest factor was behind Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in November, Fetterman pointed to the \"undeniable\" and \"singular political talent\" of Trump.",
      "\"He had the energy and almost a sense of fearlessness to just say all those kinds of things,\" Fetterman said. \"You literally were shot in your head and had the presence of mind to respond, you know, 'Fight, fight, fight!' I mean, that's a political talent.\"",
      "Fetterman also said that the election was \"never about fascism\" to him. Harris said in an October town hall that she believed Trump was a fascist after Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly said that his old boss fit the definition of one. Fetterman said that was not a word he would use.",
      "\"Fascism, that's not a word that regular people, you know, use, you know?\" Fetterman said. \"I think people are going to decide who is the candidate that's going to protect and project, you know, my version of the American way of life, and that's what happened.\"",
      "Fetterman also pointed to Elon Musk's endorsement of Trump as another key factor in the election.",
      "\"It's rare to have a surrogate that has a lot of fanboys and is very compelling to a lot of the demographic that we are losing in my party and in Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman said about the billionaire businessman.",
      "Fetterman said Musk's endorsement \"really mattered\" and he believed it did \"move the needle.\"",
      "Fetterman was the first Democrat in the Senate to meet with Pete Hegseth, the controversial former Fox News anchor who Trump selected for defense secretary. Fetterman has not ruled out supporting him -- or any of Trump's other picks.",
      "\"My commitment, and I think I'm doing the job, is I'm going to sit down and have a conversation,\" Fetterman said. \"To me, it would be distressing if, if he is confirmed, if the Democrats are going to turn our back collectively to the leader of the defense. I mean, that's astonishing and that's dangerous.\"",
      "Along with Hegseth, Fetterman has met with Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, and Kash Patel, Trump's selection for FBI director.",
      "Patel's vow to take on Trump's political enemies has drawn scrutiny. Asked by Karl whether he thinks Patel will use the FBI to do so, Fetterman said while he wasn't able to go into detail due to the off-the-record nature of the meeting, \"That's never going to happen.\"",
      "\"So you see yourself inclined to be open to supporting these controversial nominees?\" Karl asked.",
      "\"Potentially,\" Fetterman replied. \"But nobody can accuse me of just saying I had a closed mind, or I just said no because Trump picked this person, or whatever.\"",
      "Fetterman has said he will vote to confirm Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He said he will also back Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio, for me, it's like, he's in the other party, obviously, but you know, there's a lot of, the Venn [diagram] is closer, there's a lot of overlap,\" Fetterman said. \"If I was, as a Democrat, looking to assemble a bipartisan cabinet, he'd be a solid choice.\"",
      "Asked what his message to Trump would be if the president-elect called him, Fetterman said he'd like to talk about opportunities where \"we could work together.\"",
      "\"I'd like to avoid the, you know, the cheap heat and some of the other stuff, but it's going to be a kooky ride, I'm sure,\" he said. \"And you know, I try to be a committed, steady voice for Pennsylvania and to remember that we have to find as many wins in the middle of incredibly divisive times.\"",

    "summary": "What will Joe Biden's legacy be as president?",
    "story": [
      "Trump's 2024 reelection could define Biden's legacy.",
      "Welcome to 538's politics chat. The transcript below has been lightly edited.",
      "nrakich (Nathaniel Rakich, senior editor and elections analyst): 'Tis the season for your favorite media outlets to publish \"year in review\" articles \u2014 the year's best movies, recipes, reality TV moments, etc. But we at 538 are thinking bigger. Instead of \"year in review,\" how about \"presidency in review\"?",
      "On Jan. 20, 2025 \u2014 28 days from today \u2014 President Joe Biden will leave office after just one term. That got us thinking ... What have been the biggest news stories of the last four years? What will Biden's presidency be remembered for, and will those memories be good or bad ones? So for the final 538 Slack chat of 2024, I've assembled an all-star panel of reporters and political scientists to discuss what Biden's legacy will be.",
      "Now, I want to acknowledge up front that this is a premature exercise: Ideally, you need distance \u2014 and a knowledge of how things played out after they left office \u2014 to properly assess a presidency, and historians are constantly reevaluating their perceptions of even long-dead presidents based on evolving sensibilities.",
      "But it's often said that journalism is the first draft of history, and someone needs to write that first draft! So, based on what we know today, if you guys had to pick one moment/episode/trend/accomplishment/failure from Biden's presidency that will go down in history, what would it be? Let's start with you, Geoffrey.",
      "geoffrey.skelley (Geoffrey Skelley, senior elections analyst): \"We finally beat Medicare.\" Thus began the end of Biden's reelection campaign in his infamously bad debate against President-elect Donald Trump on June 27, 2024. And because Trump went on to win this election, Biden's choice to seek reelection will undoubtedly be a chief focus of his presidency, even though we'll have to wait to see how other aspects of his presidency will be remembered.",
      "Biden decided to run again despite concerns about his age, and then his debate showing substantially reinforced the doubts many voters already had. Biden stepped aside for Vice President Kamala Harris in late July, becoming the first presumptive presidential nominee in the modern primary era to drop a reelection bid. This left his vice president about three months to campaign for the office, a race she narrowly lost.",
      "We don't know how Trump's second term will go, but considering how impactful it could be, it's hard not to focus on how Biden's choice to run again may have played into Trump's victory. It's difficult to say how things might've played out differently, of course \u2014 counterfactuals always are. But had Biden decided to bow out way back in late 2022, perhaps a different candidate who won a contested Democratic presidential primary would have defeated Trump.",
      "Monica Potts (Monica Potts, senior politics reporter): I agree, Geoffrey, and I thought you'd choose the debate. I do think it will be remembered as a turning point, and for causing an extremely rare event in the modern era: a nominee leaving the presidential race so late in the cycle and essentially anointing his vice president without a primary.",
      "nrakich: Yeah, we're elections people, so we might be biased. But I think the unprecedented and dramatic nature of Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election pretty much guarantees it will at least be mentioned in the history books.",
      "julia_azari (Julia Azari, professor of political science at Marquette University and 538 contributor): Sorry, got distracted by the end-of-year recipes.",
      "This definitely makes sense to me, but I also think that as we get further from the 2024 election, this may fade from memory. People don't exactly remember former President Lyndon B. Johnson's decision to drop out of the 1968 election as his main legacy, for example, but they do remember the broader circumstances: domestic unrest and the Vietnam War. It's hard to think of an example of an election that became a president's main legacy.",
      "nrakich: That's an interesting point, Julia. I feel like Johnson's withdrawal from the 1968 campaign is something that history will never forget ... but, to your point, I'm not sure it's really legacy-defining.",
      "What would be the equivalent of those broader circumstances for Biden? His age? I could see a big part of his legacy being a cautionary tale for Americans to elect anyone older than, say, 75.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: Unless he's running against someone about the same age, of course.",
      "julia_azari: Right \u2014 Trump is only a few years younger than Biden.",
      "nrakich: Well, but it could give primary voters pause about supporting someone that old in the future.",
      "Monica Potts: I do think it really solidified for voters and people active in the parties to shift to younger politicians.",
      "In addition to the debate, I was also going to choose Biden's decision to run again. I don't know if there was an exact moment when that happened. He'd been hinting at a reelection campaign for months before officially announcing his bid in April 2023. At the time, he pitched his candidacy as an attempt to hold democracy together and argued that Trump was an existential threat to the country. But many voters had buried the chaos of Trump's first term, the COVID-19 pandemic and the events of Jan. 6 deep in their memory vaults. They were much more concerned with what had happened during Biden's term: record-breaking inflation and the fact that he was rapidly aging in front of them.",
      "It really makes one wonder about all of the Democratic leaders who had epiphanies about Biden's age after the debate and put pressure on him to leave the race. Why didn't they have those earlier in the cycle? He'd been running for reelection for more than a year at that point. There had been plenty of grumbling about his aging, although in fairness much of it came from anonymous sources griping to the press, and some complaints had an ableist ring to them. But as you've written, Nathaniel, some Democrats reportedly had doubts about whether he should run again at an earlier stage, and those people could have intervened in time for a primary. Almost everything else Biden accomplished will be overshadowed by that, because of course his executive and legislative legacies can be undone by Trump.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: To me, the question is, how much was Biden's legacy tied up in defeating Trump in 2020, and how much of that is undone by what happened in 2024 to bring Trump back to power?",
      "Monica has nicely linked how the campaign situation could help erode any chance for Biden to have a positive legacy. His opponent is reentering office and will attempt to undo many of Biden's accomplishments, potentially reducing the chances that anyone says in a few years, \"Wow, that thing Biden did had a long-lasting impact.\"",
      "julia_azari: I definitely think that Biden's inability to hold off Trumpism in the long term will be a big part of his legacy, but I wonder how much the particulars of the 2024 election will become a lasting part of that story.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: I guess, to me, the debate and its aftermath are a microcosm of that, Julia. An easy thing to point to.",
      "nrakich: Yeah, but also, this is something we'll be able to assess a lot better in 2029, when we know how Trump's second term went. Will he do lasting damage to our democracy, as Biden and other Democrats believe he will? Or will he actually make America great again?",
      "geoffrey.skelley: Or which of those two extremes do we end up closer to \u2026",
      "nrakich: I guess neither outcome would reflect super well on Biden.",
      "Monica Potts: Right. I think the events of the 2024 campaign will be an easy thing to point to, but I also think that Julia's correct in that, down the road, there might be a broader view of what was going on this year, and it might be wrapped into a larger story about \"The COVID-19 Era,\" or something we haven't quite named yet.",
      "nrakich: Speaking of which ...",
      "Monica, I was going to go to you next, but you already said that you agree that Biden's decision to drop out was the headline of his presidency. But do you have a runner-up?",
      "Monica Potts: I think that some of Biden's accomplishments, like the Inflation Reduction Act or his efforts to forgive a record number of student loans, may very well leave a lasting impact. It's hard to tell exactly: Trump has already promised to reverse some of the components of the Inflation Reduction Act and pull back unspent money, and we may see that first with some of the tax credits that would have gone out to homeowners and car buyers for making environmentally conscious choices.",
      "But the Inflation Reduction Act also made efforts to boost manufacturing and infrastructure in the U.S., and some things, like lithium mining in Arkansas, can probably be traced to that policy. Likewise, individuals who had their loans forgiven will have a different memory of Biden's presidency, surely, and it may impact how they're able to retire or invest as they age. So we will see.",
      "julia_azari: I think this is a good point. Something I've thought about a lot since Biden's popularity dipped in 2021 is that, with the benefit of hindsight, he might start to look like Harry Truman or Dwight Eisenhower \u2014 presidents who weren't considered terribly flashy in their own time (Eisenhower was popular but considered a lightweight by Serious Government Types) but came to be regarded as much stronger on policy and decision-making decades after they left office.",
      "(Presidential legacy-making is fascinating and someone should write a book about it.)",
      "nrakich: I agree that the Inflation Reduction Act \u2014 a truly robust anti-climate-change bill \u2014 was probably Biden's biggest legislative achievement. But without tipping my hand too much, I'm skeptical that specific legislation, rather than general vibes/conditions, will be what Biden is most remembered for.",
      "I take your point about past presidents, Julia, and I think it's possible that, like Truman, people will be more impressed by Biden's policy achievements (which he accomplished with very narrow majorities in both the Senate and House) once they forget that he spent most of his presidency with pretty low approval ratings.",
      "And call me pessimistic, but I also am not sure that the Inflation Reduction Act will do enough to counter climate change to be remembered as truly transformative. We're already seeing the effects of a warming planet, and without decisive action from countries outside the U.S., the planet seems likely to get more than 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than the pre-industrial baseline \u2014 a red line set by many scientists.",
      "Monica Potts: Something that keeps me up at night, Nathaniel.",
      "nrakich: What about you, Julia? What do you think has been the defining event of the Biden presidency?",
      "julia_azari: I am still trying to think of the event that really illustrates this, but in addition to what everyone has already said, I think Biden's presidency will be seen as a turning point in the Democratic Party (though in what direction I'm not exactly sure).",
      "Something we don't talk about a lot is that Biden's 2020 nomination was unusual in a way: If you buy coalition theories of nominations, Biden wasn't so much the \"acceptable to all factions\" nominee as the one considered most \"electable,\" and then, once he clinched the nomination, he had to spend time and effort reaching out to the progressive wing of the party.",
      "I see this fault line less as one on policy and more as a split between a faction that wanted to go back to \"normal\" after Trump, that favors institutions and the status quo, and one that wants to see serious change in the structure of American government and politics. Biden did try, I think, as a party man through and through, to bring these two factions together. But the 2024 election loss puts a lot of strain on that alliance. What's the Democrats' path forward? Will the status quo people win? The progressives? Or will this be a long period of push and pull, with visible intraparty strife? I don't know at this point.",
      "I can think of two events that illustrate this: (1) Biden saying \"fund the police\" in his 2022 State of the Union address and (2) \u2014 this is going to sound weird \u2014 the withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not because it was clearly an action associated with either faction, but because it showed how much Biden's presidency was defined by contending with the decisions of his predecessors and how difficult it is to change directions, even as the American public soured on the Afghanistan war in particular and interventions like it in general.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: At a time when there's a major lack of faith in institutions, the perceived failures of an institutionalist like Biden could substantially influence Democrats moving forward. It connects to what I think is one of their larger challenges, which is being perceived as the party of government and status quo while the GOP is viewed as the anti-establishment force.",
      "Granted, let's be careful not to vastly overstate the meaning of a close election.",
      "nrakich: Interesting! Yeah, the future direction of the Democratic Party is definitely a big question going forward, but I think because of that, we won't know if this was a big part of Biden's legacy for a few more years.",
      "julia_azari: The corollary is that I wonder what Biden's legacy and Harris's loss (combined with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's loss in 2016) means for former President Barack Obama's legacy.",
      "nrakich: Now we're getting meta!",
      "I think the difference there is that Clinton's loss can't really be pinned on Obama. He was popular at the time; she wasn't. This year, Harris was more popular than Biden, so I think he is more responsible for Trump's win.",
      "julia_azari: You knew I would be annoying when you invited me. (I should get a T-shirt that says that.)",
      "Monica Potts: I think that's true, Julia, and something I hadn't thought of. What's interesting to me is that some of what Biden did as president was more progressive than the progressive wing of the party was expecting. Like Biden's National Labor Relations Board appointments, and appointing Lina Khan, a big opponent of tech monopolies, as chair of the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "nrakich: Yeah, I would actually argue that Biden was probably the most progressive president in U.S. history? But I'm not sure if he will be seen that way, and thus I'm not sure how that will affect the establishment vs. insurgent fight that's going to play out in the 2028 Democratic presidential primary.",
      "Monica Potts: Yes, agreed.",
      "julia_azari: Yes, I see that too.",
      "And Biden's reputation with the left flank of the party might be different without the Gaza issue, which we haven't talked about. But it is part of the fault line I mentioned.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: Internationally, the situation in Gaza will probably be a major part of Biden's legacy. I'm not sure it'll have as much traction in domestic remembrances, but it's worth noting.",
      "Of course, that gets at another aspect of Biden's legacy: the U.S.'s place in the world and its involvement in events elsewhere. Besides Gaza, Biden's defeat might have serious consequences for Ukraine, NATO and America's alliances generally.",
      "Monica Potts: Agreed, Geoffrey, I was thinking of that too. It's hard to know how history will assess it because Trump may change or shift U.S. policy toward Israel in ways that overshadow what Biden did or didn't do, and other countries around the world have played a role as well.",
      "And yes, Trump's win will likely have consequences for how the U.S. interacts with the rest of the world going forward too.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: Yeah, will we be making Smoot-Hawley comparisons here in a few years regarding protective trade measures?",
      "(OK, I might be the only one doing that.)",
      "Monica Potts: You might not be the only one: an entire generation learned about it from \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\"",
      "nrakich: Yeah, foreign policy was on my short list as well \u2014 namely, Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war and the withdrawal from Afghanistan. But I think the most remembered aspect of Biden's presidency will be something that I'm surprised hasn't come up yet: the rampant inflation of 2021 and 2022.",
      "After inflation basically went decades as a non-issue, it shot up to historic levels as the economy overheated post-pandemic and crested at 9.1 percent in June 2022. It became Republicans' go-to cudgel against Biden in the 2022 and 2024 campaigns, and the cost of living consistently ranked as Americans' number-one issue in polls. The first burst of inflation was probably at least partially responsible for Biden's approval rating going from net positive to net negative in September 2021, and of course it stayed net negative for the rest of his presidency. And according to most post-election analysis, the economy was probably the biggest factor behind Trump's victory in this year's election, keeping with the theme of that being a big part of Biden's legacy.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: I was sort of rolling inflation into the larger defeat story. But yes, undoubtedly Biden's presidency will be remembered for economic dissatisfaction. That might group him with other one-term presidents like Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush: Carter's tenure saw clear economic turmoil \u2014 \"stagflation\" and a significant shrinking of the economy \u2014 while Bush's also featured a recession. However, no one really thinks back positively about Carter's presidency, whereas the elder Bush arguably has fared better in hindsight.",
      "julia_azari: As someone who sort of remembers the H.W. Bush years, it's almost amusing how much his legacy has changed over time.",
      "Monica Potts: I guess part of me wonders whether, in hindsight, inflation will be wrapped up in the pandemic story (since it was partly caused by supply-chain issues related to the pandemic) and not thought of as part of Biden's legacy. I guess I don't know whether history will lay that at Biden's feet, and it's a pet peeve of mine that voters tend to blame presidents for every single thing that happens in this free market economy of ours.",
      "nrakich: Sure, presidents actually have little control over the economy. But I think history has shown that presidents do get assigned a lot of the credit or blame for how the economy fares under their watch. Plus, many economists believe that the American Rescue Plan \u2014 Biden's first major piece of legislation \u2014 actually did contribute somewhat to inflation.",
      "julia_azari: The economic story seems complicated to me. While inflation makes the comparisons between Carter and Biden inevitable, several other economic indicators were actually pretty strong under Biden, which wasn't the case for Carter. So I think that makes 2024 different from other incumbent-party-rejecting elections like 1980 or 2008.",
      "nrakich: You guys are already getting into it, but my next and final question was going to be, where do you think historians will place Biden in the pantheon of presidents? Will he largely be remembered positively or negatively?",
      "julia_azari: I think it sort of depends on (1) who is crafting the legacy, and whether Democrats (or people in Biden's inner circle) decide they want to work on rehabilitating Biden's legacy, and (2) what the impact and legacy of Trump's second term is.",
      "Monica Potts: I think it's hard to say, but I will go back to where we started. I think Biden's most important decision from a legacy perspective will turn out to be his decision to run again, and I think not knowing when to step aside will overshadow everything else. Everything he did while in office now has to survive a Trump presidency or risks being overshadowed by it, and it would be a completely different conversation if a Democrat were taking office next year. Although, to be clear, the anti-incumbency feeling might have extended to any Democrat, and I don't know that any of them would have won.",
      "nrakich: Yeah, one-term presidents are usually not rated very highly in historical rankings, and I suspect there's a reason for that.",
      "For instance, in C-SPAN's 2021 survey of presidential historians, eight of the top 10 presidents served two terms (or quite close to two terms, like Truman and Teddy Roosevelt). The only exceptions were Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy \u2014 two presidents who didn't have the chance to serve two terms because they were assassinated.",
      "geoffrey.skelley: I mean, if we're getting really cynical, in 50 years most people may only remember Trump from this era in history, making Biden something of a footnote analogous to, say, Benjamin Harrison or one of the other one-term presidents of the late 19th century (another period of intense partisanship and polarization).",
      "If I'm still around, I'll spend my dotage talking about it, though."

      "Three Oregon lawmakers say they plan to introduce a bill that would bar utilities from raising rates if they have unresolved wildfire lawsuits for three or more years",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Three Oregon lawmakers say they plan to introduce a bill that would bar utilities from raising rates if they have unresolved wildfire lawsuits for three or more years, describing it as an effort to hold PacifiCorp accountable as the utility faces a series of lawsuits stemming from the deadly 2020 wildfires that ravaged the state.",
      "Republican state Reps. Jami Cate, Virgle Osborne and Ed Diehl announced their proposal in a statement Monday, on the heels of an approved rate increase for PacifiCorp customers and a federal lawsuit against the electric power company.",
      "The federal government sued PacifiCorp last week over the Archie Creek Fire, which ignited in Oregon's Douglas County in September 2020 and burned more than 200 square miles (520 square kilometers), about half of which was federal land. The complaint accuses the company of negligence for failing to maintain its power lines to prevent wildfires. In its filing, the government says it brought the suit to recover \u201csubstantial costs and damages.\"",
      "A PacifiCorp spokesperson said in an emailed statement Monday that the company was working with the U.S. government to resolve the claims.",
      "\u201cIt is unfortunate the U.S. government decided to file a lawsuit in federal district court, however PacifiCorp will continue to work with the U.S. government to find reasonable resolution of this matter,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The federal lawsuit was filed on the same day the Oregon Public Utility Commission approved a 9.8% rate increase for PacifiCorp's residential customers next year. In its rate case filings, the company said its request to increase rates was partly due to higher costs stemming from wildfire risk and activity.",
      "When the new rate takes effect in January, PacifiCorp rates will have increased nearly 50% since 2021, according to the Oregon Citizens' Utility Board, which advocates on behalf of utility customers.",
      "The three lawmakers said they will introduce their bill in the upcoming legislative session, which starts in January.",
      "\u201cThe federal government is doing the right thing by filing this lawsuit, and we stand firmly behind it,\u201d Osborne, who is set to be the future bill's co-chief sponsor, said in a statement. \u201cPacifiCorp needs to pay up and take responsibility for the destruction they\u2019ve caused, and putting a stop to rate hikes is the best way to achieve it.\u201d",
      "PacifiCorp is poised to be on the hook for billions in damages in the series of lawsuits over Oregon's 2020 fires.",
      "The company has already reached two settlement agreements over the Archie Creek Fire, including one for $299 million with 463 plaintiffs impacted by the blaze and another for $250 million with 10 companies with commercial timber interests, according to its website.",
      "In other litigation, an Oregon jury in June 2023 found it liable for negligently failing to cut power to its 600,000 customers despite warnings from top fire officials and determined it should have to pay punitive and other damages \u2014 a decision that applied to a class including the owners of up to 2,500 properties. Since then, other Oregon juries have ordered the company to pay tens of millions to other wildfire victims.",
      "The wildfires that erupted across Oregon over Labor Day weekend in 2020 were among the worst natural disasters in state history, killing nine people and destroying thousands of homes."

      "California has been hit hard by extreme weather over the past several weeks",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Record-setting flooding over three days dumped more than a foot of rain on parts of northern California, a fire left thousands under evacuation orders and warnings in Los Angeles County, forecasters issued the first-ever tornado warning in San Francisco and rough seas tore down part of a wharf in Santa Cruz.",
      "All of this extreme weather has hit California in the past several weeks, showcasing the state\u2019s particular vulnerability to major weather disasters.",
      "Strong storms Tuesday produced waves that forecasters said could reach 35 feet (10.7 meters) around Santa Cruz. The National Weather Service issued a high surf warning until early evening, cautioning people to stay out of the ocean and away from piers.",
      "For Chandler Price, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Diego, these extreme weather events are both typical and unusual for a La Ni\u00f1a winter, a natural climate cycle that can cause extreme weather across the planet. In California, it means a wetter than average northern region and a drier south.",
      "\u201cSo far we\u2019ve seen that pattern play out pretty well,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cobviously, you know, the tornado in the Bay Area was atypical. ... We haven\u2019t seen that before, at least not for a very long time.\u201d",
      "A storm and wind gusts of up to 60 mph (96 kph) prompted the San Francisco tornado warning that extended to neighboring San Mateo County, which went out to about 1 million people earlier this month. The tornado overturned cars and toppled trees and utility poles near a mall in Scotts Valley, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco, injuring several people. Tornadoes do occur in California, but they rarely hit populated areas.",
      "In San Francisco, local meteorologists said straight-line winds, not a tornado, felled trees onto cars and streets and damaged roofs.",
      "The storm also dumped significant snow across the northern Sierra Nevada.",
      "F. Martin Ralph, director of the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at the University of California, San Diego, said climate change means that atmospheric rivers, long stretches of wet air that can produce heavy rains, will be responsible for a greater share of California\u2019s yearly precipitation and the periods in between those big events will be drier. These storms are essential for the water supply but can also be dangerous.",
      "\u201cWhen they are too strong and too many in a row, we end up getting floods,\u201d he said, adding that they drive California\u2019s weather extremes.",
      "During storms this week around Santa Cruz, one man was trapped under debris and died and another person was pulled into the ocean. The surf also splintered off the end of a Santa Cruz municipal wharf that was under construction, plunging three people into the ocean. One swam to shore and the other two were rescued.",
      "A series of atmospheric rivers are expected through the rest of the week. Overall, this pattern is not unusual \u2014 these storms regularly produce high winds, heavy snow in the mountains and torrential rain this time of year.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s a little unique about this setup is how closely spaced they are, so there\u2019s not much of a break between them,\u201d said David Lawrence, a meteorologist and emergency response specialist with the National Weather Service.",
      "Bad storms hit the state ahead of Thanksgiving, too, dumping more than a foot of rain (32 centimeters) on Santa Rosa over three record-setting days, according to federal forecasters.",
      "But these storms haven\u2019t stretched very far south, creating dry weather in Southern California that increases fire risk.",
      "One of the state\u2019s most recent blazes, the Franklin Fire left some 20,000 people under evacuation orders and warnings and forced students at Pepperdine University to shelter in place. The blaze was fueled by the Santa Anas, the notorious seasonal winds that blow dry air from the interior toward the coast, pushing back moist ocean breezes.",
      "Most of the destruction occurred in Malibu, a community on the western corner of Los Angeles known for its beautiful bluffs and the Hollywood-famous Zuma Beach. The fire damaged or destroyed 48 structures and is one of nearly 8,000 wildfires that have scorched more than 1 million acres (more than 404,685 hectares) in the Golden State this year.",
      "The Santa Ana winds, which peak in December, have also contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in parts of the southern state, said Price with the National Weather Service.",
      "\u201cEighty-degree (26.7 Celsius) Christmases are not entirely uncommon around here,\u201d he added, but \u201cthere was a couple of high temperature record breaks in the mountains, which are usually less affected by the Santa Anas, and so those were a little unusual.\u201d",

      "Police say an 18-year-old man allegedly fired shots inside an Indianapolis shopping mall, wounding one person and prompting officers to evacuate holiday shoppers on Monday night",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- An 18-year-old man allegedly fired shots inside an Indianapolis shopping mall, wounding one person and prompting officers to evacuate holiday shoppers on Monday night, police said.",
      "The suspect was arrested a few hours after the Castleton Square Mall shooting on a felony charge of intimidation with a deadly weapon, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said. The man had not been formally charged as of Tuesday morning, according to online court records.",
      "Police were called to the mall about 8:30 p.m. on the city's northeast side on reports of shots fired inside. Officers evacuated shoppers from the mall during a busy shopping period two days before Christmas.",
      "\u201cHow many families were put at risk, and how hard this is for these families, how close it is to the holidays,\" Officer Tommy Thompson told reporters.",
      "While police initially said no injuries were reported, a man who officers believe was wounded in the shooting later arrived at a hospital with injuries consistent with a gunshot wound. He was in stable condition, police said.",
      "Police said the shooting inside one of the mall's entrances followed a \u201cdispute\u201d between individuals. The shooting left behind a bullet hole in a wall and another in an arcade machine.",
      "The mall has been the scene of several shootings in recent years, including a January 2023 shooting outside the mall that killed a teenager and wounded a man. Police later arrested a man in that shooting.",

      "SANTA CRUZ, Calif. -- Persistent high surf and flooding threats along California\u2019s coast have residents on high alert a day after a major storm was blamed for one man\u2019s death and the partial collapse of a pier, which propelled three people into the Pacific Ocean.",
      "The National Weather Service on Christmas Eve warned of dangerous, large-breaking waves of up to 35 feet (10.7 meters). Its latest high surf warning will be in effect until 6 p.m. Tuesday.",
      "\u201cLarge waves can sweep across the beach without warning, pulling people into the sea from rocks, jetties and beaches,\u201d the weather service said in a Christmas Eve bulletin.",
      "Some California cities ordered beachfront homes and hotels to evacuate early Monday afternoon as forecasters warned that storm swells would continue to increase throughout the day.",
      "In Watsonville along the Monterey Bay, first responders were called to Sunset State Beach, a state park, around 11:30 a.m. Monday for a report of a man trapped under debris. The Santa Cruz County Sheriff\u2019s Office believes a large wave pinned him there. The man was pronounced dead at a hospital.",
      "The storm\u2019s high surf also likely pulled another man into the Pacific Ocean around noon Monday at Marina State Beach, nearly 13 miles (21 kilometers) south of Watsonville, authorities said. Strong currents and high waves forced searchers to abandon their efforts roughly two hours later as conditions worsened. The man remained missing Monday evening.",
      "In Santa Cruz, a municipal wharf under construction partially collapsed and fell into the ocean around 12:45 p.m., taking three people with it. Two people were rescued by lifeguards and a third swam to safety. No one was seriously injured.",
      "\u201cWe are anticipating that what is coming toward us is more serious than what was there this morning,\u201d Santa Cruz Mayor Fred Keeley said Monday.",
      "Keeley said that section of the wharf had been damaged over time. The structure was in the middle of a $4 million renovation following destructive storms last winter about 70 miles (112 kilometers) south of San Francisco.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a catastrophe for those down at the end of the wharf,\u201d said David Johnston, who was allowed onto the pier to check on his business, Venture Quest Kayaking.",

      "The end of the Santa Cruz Wharf that broke off had been shut down during renovations. The portion, which included public restrooms and the closed Dolphin restaurant, floated about half a mile (0.8 kilometers) down the coast and wedged itself at the bottom of the San Lorenzo River.",
      "Those who fell into the water were two engineers and a project manager who were inspecting the end of the wharf, officials said. No members of the public were in the area.",
      "Building inspectors were looking at the rest of the pier\u2019s structural integrity.",
      "In a post on X, the National Weather Service office in Portland, Oregon, said, \u201cIt will likely go down as some of the highest surf this winter.\u201d",

      "Tarell Isaac McMillian, 34, has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Greensboro Police Officer Michael Horan in a Food Lion on Monday, Greensboro Police said in a news release. He was being held without bond.",
      "Police said McMillian also faces multiple charges related to the vehicle pursuit that led to his arrest in Duplin County, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) southeast of Greensboro in the central part of the state. Online court records do not list an attorney who could speak on McMillian's behalf. Police said they were not seeking anyone else in the investigation.",
      "Horan was responding to the report when he was shot shortly before midday at a Food Lion store in Greensboro. Authorities said Monday afternoon that the circumstances of the shooting remain under investigation. The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, the state's lead law enforcement agency, is continuing the investigation.",
      "Horan was hired in 2017 and became a sworn Greensboro Police Department officer in early 2018, Assistant Police Chief Milford J. Harris said. Horan served in the department\u2019s patrol bureau. He also was a U.S. Coast Guard member since 2000, according to his LinkedIn profile.",
      "\u201cHe was an excellent officer. He had an outstanding reputation inside the department and in the community,\u201d Harris said at a news conference.",

      "Sebastian Zapeta, 33, is facing murder and arson charges in the woman\u2019s death.",
      "Federal immigration officials said Zapeta is a Guatemalan citizen who entered the U.S. illegally after he was previously deported in 2018.",
      "The apparently random attack occurred Sunday morning on a stationary F train at the Coney Island station in Brooklyn, police said.",
      "Authorities say Zapeta approached the woman, who was sitting motionless in the train car and may have been sleeping, and used a lighter to set her clothing on fire. The woman quickly became engulfed in flames, while Zapeta then sat at a bench on the subway platform and watched as police officers and a transit worker doused the fire, according to police.",
      "The woman, whose identity has not yet been released, was pronounced dead at the scene.",
      "Zapeta was arrested Sunday afternoon while riding a train on the same subway line after police got a tip from some teenagers who recognized him from images circulated by the police.",
      "It was unclear if Zapeta has an attorney. A Brooklyn address for Zapeta released by police matches a shelter that provides housing and substance abuse support. The shelter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a statement, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez called the attack a \u201cgruesome and senseless act of violence against a vulnerable woman\u201d that would be \u201cmet with the most serious consequences.\u201d",
      "The crime \u2014 and a graphic video of it that ricocheted across social media \u2014 deepened a growing sense of unease among New Yorkers about the safety of the subway system.",
      "Violent crimes on trains in the city can put riders on edge, in part because most New Yorkers take the subway multiple times each day and often have their own experiences with uncomfortable interactions in the system.",
      "Policing the subway is also difficult, given the vast network of trains constantly moving between the system's 472 stations, with each stop containing multiple entry points and, in many stations, multiple floors and platforms. On Sunday, police at the station where the woman burned to death were patrolling a different area and responded after seeing and smelling smoke, authorities said.",
      "Overall, according to authorities, crime is down in the transit system this year when compared to last year.",
      "Major felonies declined 6% between January and November of this year and in 2023, data compiled by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority show. But murders are up, with nine killings this year through November compared to five in the same period last year.",
      "At the same time, high-profile incidents on the train \u2014 such as the case of Daniel Penny, a military veteran who choked an agitated New York subway rider and was acquitted of homicide this month \u2014 often attract national attention and further frighten passengers."

Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That\u2019s because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",

      "North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper leaves his job next week after eight years",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is leaving his job after eight years in which the southern Democrat picked his moments against a Republican-dominated legislature, winning big on Medicaid expansion and clean energy while falling short in fights over private-school vouchers and abortion rights.",
      "Cooper, who steered the state through the coronavirus pandemic, Hurricanes Helene and Florence and an early flashpoint in the culture wars over access to public restrooms, was barred from seeking a third consecutive term. He is wrapping up 24 consecutive years in statewide office \u2014 the first 16 as attorney general.",
      "In a December interview with The Associated Press at the executive mansion, Cooper reflected on his gubernatorial terms with an emphasis on the positive \u2014 an easier undertaking compared with many Democrats around the country in the aftermath of this year's election.",
      "\"To be able to wake up every morning and get to lead the state that you love has been humbling, challenging and fulfilling. I have really valued every day,\u201d said Cooper, who will be succeeded by state Attorney General Josh Stein, a fellow Democrat, in early January.",
      "Faced with veto-proof majorities for almost half of his time as governor, Cooper was unable to stop many GOP initiatives, including deep income tax cuts, taxpayer-funded vouchers to help public school students attend private schools and new restrictions on abortion.",
      "But Cooper, one of several Democratic governors seen as potential contenders for federal office, managed last year to persuade GOP legislative leaders to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 something he had sought since getting sworn in as governor in 2017. Now 600,000 low-income adults are enrolled in the program a year ahead of expectations.",
      "\u201cThis is a generational investment in people\u2019s health,\u201d Cooper said during a farewell address last week in Nash County, where he grew up and launched his first gubernatorial campaign in 2015. Another bipartisan agreement was reached in 2021 on a milestone energy bill that ordered sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.",
      "Cooper takes credit for conditions that led to big corporate expansions that he says have contributed to hundreds of thousands of new jobs being created during the past eight years, including those in the clean energy sector. But he also gives his rare praise to Republican lawmakers for all working together on offering economic incentives that have lured companies such as Apple, Toyota and Boom Supersonic to build in the state.",
      "Still, Republicans contend Cooper receives too much acclaim for the state\u2019s broad economic success and has pushed for reckless state spending at every turn. Most of his record 100-plus vetoes were overridden.",
      "\u201cThere has not been a governor who has had less of his agenda enacted and North Carolina has succeeded in spite of his leadership failures,\" state GOP spokesperson Matt Mercer said.",
      "Regardless, Cooper\u2019s perceived accomplishments in a swing state raised his national profile during this year\u2019s presidential campaign, making him as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris until he said it \"just wasn\u2019t the right time\" for him and for North Carolina. Now Cooper, 67, will have to decide whether trying to unseat U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican, in 2026 is in the cards after holding what he calls the \u201cbest job I have ever had.\u201d",
      "While North Carolina Democrats have won eight of past nine gubernatorial elections, they haven\u2019t won a U.S. Senate race since 2008.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to run for public office again, you must have your heart and soul in it, you must have the fire in the belly,\u201d Cooper told the AP.",
      "With that in mind, he said he planned to take a couple of months to clear his head before deciding what\u2019s next: \u201cI\u2019m going to think about how I can best contribute to the things that I care about.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s little wonder why many North Carolina Democrats want Cooper to remain on the political stage. He has never lost a race for state office, from the legislature in the mid-1980s and including a 10,000-vote win over then-GOP Gov. Pat McCrory in 2016.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s done really from my perspective is he\u2019s kept the progressive flame alive in North Carolina in a difficult time,\u201d said Gary Pearce, a longtime Democratic political consultant who worked with four-term Gov. Jim Hunt. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody else could have done it as well as he did.\u201d",
      "Cooper took on Republicans even before he was sworn in.",
      "As governor-elect he began a series of lawsuits challenging legislation approved weeks before he took office that shifted executive branch powers to the legislature. The legal results were mixed, and even now litigation over his appointment powers remains in court. This month, Republican lawmakers enacted more changes that would weaken Stein's gubernatorial authority. A lawsuit has been filed.",
      "In his first three months in office, Cooper worked with lawmakers to partially repeal the 2016 \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which had required transgender people to use public bathrooms aligned with the gender on their birth certificate. The law had lost the state business, including canceled sporting events and job expansions, and \u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s reputation was in tatters,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Eight years later, \u201cwe built a North Carolina that is healthier, better educated, with more money in people\u2019s pockets, and we stand ready to welcome prosperity with open arms for generations to come,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Republicans cite several shortcomings in Cooper's administration. They include spending overruns at the state Department of Transportation; continued delays to rebuild or renovate homes for eastern North Carolina residents after Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018; and executive orders that helped extend restrictions on businesses and school instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful dealing with the governor fiscally,\u201d Republican state Sen. Warren Daniel said. \u201cI just think he\u2019s not very good at managing government.\u201d",
      "Cooper has defended his actions, particularly his pandemic leadership, saying North Carolina came out better than many other states.",
      "Even in policy defeats, Cooper secured the admiration of supporters. The Democratic governor used lots of political capital in 2023 trying unsuccessfully to block a law that changed the state\u2019s ban on most abortions from after 20 weeks of pregnancy to 12 weeks. Republicans overrode his veto.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s simply no governor who\u2019s ever fought as hard or as publicly as Gov. Cooper has to protect access to abortion,\u201d said Paige Johnson with Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Plenty of North Carolinians see that differently. Cooper\u2019s opposition to the abortion bill reflects an administration that \u201chas been consistently hostile to policies that serve the best interests of North Carolina families,\u201d said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition.",
      "Cooper said he has confidence that Stein, who succeeded him as attorney general, will \u201ccontinue a lot of the progress that we have made.\u201d Cooper hired Stein two decades ago, while attorney general, to be his consumer protection chief.",
      "Otherwise, Cooper knows that he\u2019ll miss \u201chaving the opportunity every single day to do something to make a real difference.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what you can do in this job,\u201d he added. \"And whatever I decide to do, that\u2019s going to be hard to replicate.\""

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 04:23:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Conservators have uncovered eight angels in a historic Boston church that counted Paul Revere as a bell ringer and played a pivotal role in the Revolutionary War",
    "story": [
      "Conservators have uncovered eight angels in a historic Boston church that counted Paul Revere as a bell ringer and played a pivotal role in the Revolutionary War",
      "BOSTON -- Straddling the scaffolding high up in a historic Boston church, murals conservator Gianfranco Pocobene is working to uncover eight angels that were hidden under layers of paint for more than a century.",
      "The painted angels \u2014 with round childlike faces and wings \u2014 once were among the defining features of Old North Church when they were painted around 1730. But officials at the church, a seminal location of the Revolutionary War, painted over the angels in 1912 with thick coats of white paint, part of an austere renovation that restorationists are trying to reverse.",
      "\u201cWhen we first looked at the project six months ago, we had no idea what was here,\u201d Pocobene said as the church, the oldest church building in Boston, was preparing to remove the scaffolding earlier this month to reveal eight of the 20 painted-over angels.",
      "\u201cIt's really been quite a revelation to find these really interesting and historic works of art on the walls of the church that nobody has seen in our lifetime,\" he continued. \u201dJust to be part of a project where we are revealing something from colonial America is really extraordinary.\"",
      "A popular stop for tourists visiting Boston's North End, the Old North Church is best known for the two lanterns hung from its steeple on the night of Paul Revere\u2019s 1775 ride to warn of the British army\u2019s approach. Revere was also a teenage bell ringer in the congregation. In 1860, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote \u201cPaul Revere\u2019s Ride,\u201d mentioning the church and introducing the phrase, \u201cone if by land, and two if by sea.\u201d",
      "But as the 250th anniversary of Revere's ride approaches in April, church officials also want to draw attention to its beginnings in 1723 and its identity, both as a beacon of liberty but also its connections to the slave trade \u2014 many of its first congregants profited off slavery. The church was built to house Boston's growing colonial Anglican community and its interior was much more colorful and dynamic than what visitors see today.",
      "\u201cFor much of the church\u2019s history, people who were coming here to the church would have seen those angels, would have seen the colorful interior,\u201d said Emily Spence, the associate director of education at Old North Illuminated, which operates the church as a historic site.",
      "\u201cThe color scheme was an important part of the identity of the people who worshiped here as members of the congregation of a Church of England church,\u201d she said, adding the interiors would have set the church apart from Puritans who dominated Boston at the time.",
      "Spence said that exploration started in September with efforts to restore the sandstone and teal-colored angels \u2014 eight completed this month and another eight by the spring. They were made to look like stone sculptures and it remains unclear why they were painted over.",
      "Researchers knew from the historical record that the angels were on the walls and they still have a copy of a contract signed with John Gibbs, a congregation member who painted them. A paint study completed in 2017 confirmed their presence but their condition was unclear.",
      "Corrine Long, a painting conservator who works with Pocobene, said one of the challenges was removing seven layers of paint without damaging the angels. The team first applied a solvent gel to soften the layers of paint and then manually removed it with a plastic scraper. After that, they cleaned the angels with cotton swabs before retouching to remove any signs of damage.",
      "Once Pocobene and Long started removing the paint, they knew they'd uncovered something special.",
      "\"They all have their own character \u2014 they're not copies,\u201d Pocobene, who has his own studio in Lawrence, Massachusetts, said. \u201cThe artist John Gibbs painted them individually and they\u2019re all in different poses, which gives them a really wonderful rhythmic kind of pattern across the surface of the church.\u201d",
      "For Long, one of the most satisfying parts of the project was returning parts of the church to what the founders had intended \u2014 and what tourists should see.",
      "\u201cWhenever I go into a building with history, it amazes me to be surrounded with paintings or the decorations that were there originally,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s been repainted to be white, it takes away some of that majesty and some of that history.\"",
      "On a recent day, the church was mostly empty except for the conservators. But two tourists, Sean Dixon and Sarah Jardine from California, did slip in. They walked the aisles and stared up at the scaffolding. It was hard to see the angels through all the steel but what they did see inspired them.",
      "\u201cI was kind of shocked when I first saw it,\u201d said Dixon, an account manager from San Francisco. \u201cIt looks really cool and I\u2019m really excited to see the full picture once the scaffolding comes down.\u201d"

      "The visit led by Robert Petit, head of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism for Syria, was the first since the organization was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 2016. It was created to assist in evidence-gathering and prosecution of individuals responsible for possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide since Syria\u2019s civil war began in 2011.",
      "Petit highlighted the urgency of preserving documents and other evidence before it is lost.",
      "Since the rebel overthrow of Syria\u2019s President Bashar Assad and the rebel opening of prisons and detention facilities there have been rising demands from Syrians for the prosecution of those responsible for atrocities and killings while he was in power.",
      "\u201cThe fall of the Assad rule is a significant opportunity for us to fulfill our mandate on the ground,\u201d Petit said. \u201cTime is running out. There is a small window of opportunity to secure these sites and the material they hold.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe representatives from the caretaker authorities were very receptive to our request for cooperation and are aware of the scale of the task ahead,\u201d the spokesperson said, speaking on condition of not being named. \u201cThey emphasized that they will need expertise to help safeguard the newly accessible documentation.\u201d",
      "The IIIM did not disclose which officials in the new government it met with or the site that Petit visited afterward.",
      "\u201cEven at one facility,\u201d Petit said, \u201cthe mountains of government documentation reveal the chilling efficiency of systemizing the regime\u2019s atrocity crimes.\u201d",
      "He said that a collective effort by Syrians, civil society organizations and international partners will be needed, as a priority, \u201c to preserve evidence of the crimes committed, avoid duplication, and ensure that all victims are inclusively represented in the pursuit of justice.\u201d",
      "In June 2023, the 193-member General Assembly also established an Independent Institution of Missing Persons in the Syrian Arab Republic to clarify the fate and whereabouts of more than 130,000 people missing as a result of the conflict."

    "summary": "Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Gov.-elect Josh Stein have filed another lawsuit against a GOP-inspired law that strips away powers from several incoming Democratic state leaders",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Gov.-elect Josh Stein have filed another lawsuit against a GOP-inspired law that strips away powers from several incoming Democratic state leaders",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's current governor and his successor tacked on another lawsuit Monday disputing a key provision within a GOP law that erodes the powers of several incoming Democratic state leaders \u2014 the latest in a longstanding power struggle between North Carolina's executive and legislative branches over who controls the state's elections.",
      "The lawsuit challenges one of the law's core power shifts that move the ability to appoint members of the North Carolina State Board of Elections from the governor's authority to the state auditor's office \u2014 which will be run by Republican Dave Boliek next year. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper and Gov.-elect Josh Stein, who currently serves as the state attorney general, filed the suit in Wake County Superior Court on Monday, saying in the complaint that the provision is unconstitutional and violates the separation of powers.",
      "The change to state election board appointments will take place next spring if it isn't blocked in court. The state elections board would likely remain under GOP control for the next few years and would trickle down to county boards as well.",
      "\u201cWe have had the same structure for our state board of elections for nearly a century and it has served North Carolina well, with fair and secure elections across our state through every cycle,\u201d Cooper said in a news release Monday. \u201cThese blatantly partisan efforts to give control over elections boards to a newly elected Republican will create distrust in our elections process and serve no legitimate purpose.\u201d",
      "The suit from Cooper and Stein is the second challenge the pair has levied against the GOP-controlled state legislature concerning the law. Cooper and Stein are also contesting another provision that prevents the governor from choosing his State Highway Patrol commander.",
      "Those alterations to the governor's powers were part of a larger swath of changes to several statewide offices that Democrats won in November and will preside over next year \u2014 such as attorney general, state schools superintendent and lieutenant governor.",
      "If the law withstands the court challenges, it would further underscore the GOP-led legislature's tightened grip over the other two branches of government since Republicans took control of the General Assembly more than a decade ago. Last year, GOP supermajorities in both the House and Senate firmed up power even more.",
      "Pending legal disputes in a few outstanding races, Republicans could lose their supermajority if Democratic challenger Bryan Cohn's attempt to oust incumbent Republican Rep. Frank Sossamon proves successful. That would give Stein a slightly more effective veto stamp on future Republican legislation if Democratic lawmakers stay unified.",
      "Republican legislators passed the law in both chambers earlier this month \u2014 not without scathing disapproval from crowds of protesters in the building.",
      "The bill drew the ire of House and Senate Democrats, as well as some community organizers, who denounced it as a \u201cpower grab.\u201d They also criticized Republican lawmakers for tying the power shifts to disaster relief funding for western North Carolina in Hurricane Helene's aftermath. Most of the $252 million in recovery funds included in the law can't be spent until the next time the General Assembly acts.",
      "But GOP legislators defended the bill, with incoming House Speaker Destin Hall saying during the House vote that the changes are within the legislature's constitutional right. Republicans also point to previous Democratic actions, such as weakening the state\u2019s first GOP governor in 1972, as reasons necessitating the legislation.",
      "Spokespeople for Senate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore \u2014 who are both defendants listed in the lawsuit \u2014 did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday evening. A state elections board spokesperson also did not immediately respond.",
      "Changes to the state elections board aren't a first for GOP lawmakers. Previous attempts have been blocked by courts, including a suit last year that would move board appointment authority from the governor to the General Assembly. Berger and Moore's attorneys moved to dismiss that case last week, and the new lawsuit from Cooper and Stein seeks to replace it."

      "NEW YORK -- A triptych of criminal charges paints a searing, sometimes disparate portrait of the man accused of ambushing and killing UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO Brian Thompson as the executive arrived at a Manhattan hotel for his company\u2019s annual investor conference.",
      "Filed separately in state courts in New York and Pennsylvania, and a federal court in Manhattan, and totaling 20 counts, the charges brand Luigi Mangione as both a terrorist and a stalker, accuse him of carrying a ghost gun and a fake ID, and enable prosecutors to seek life in state prison and the federal death penalty.",
      "On Monday, in the last of three court appearances in five days, the 26-year-old Ivy League graduate pleaded not guilty in New York state court to an indictment charging him with 11 counts in connection with the Dec. 4 killing, including murder as a crime of terrorism.",
      "Mangione\u2019s state court arraignment followed back-to-back hearings last Thursday in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested Dec. 9, and in federal court in Manhattan, where a judge ordered him jailed without bail on murder, gun and stalking charges.",
      "Mangione\u2019s lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, has argued that the terrorism allegations in the state case and stalking charges in the federal complaint appear to be at odds. Prosecutors are treating him \"like a human ping-pong ball and \"some sort of spectacle,\u201d she said in court Monday.",
      "Here's a look at the cases and the charges involved:",
      "Mangione\u2019s state court indictment alleges he killed Thompson to \"intimidate or coerce\" a group of people and influence government policy \u201cby intimidation or coercion.\u201d",
      "It includes three counts of murder, alleging Mangione killed \u201cin furtherance of terrorism,\u201d as an act of terrorism and with intent, and carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.",
      "Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office is prosecuting the case, said last week that the midtown Manhattan ambush \u201cwas a killing that was intended to evoke terror.\u201d",
      "The indictment also charges Mangione with seven gun-related counts and one count related to a fake New Jersey driver\u2019s license that prosecutors said he used to check into a Manhattan hostel when he arrived in the city 10 days before the killing.",
      "Prosecutors say they anticipate the state case will be the first to go to trial.",
      "After his arraignment Monday, Mangione was returned to a federal jail in Brooklyn while state and federal authorities sort out where he'll be detained while the state case plays out.",
      "A day after Bragg announced Mangione\u2019s state indictment, federal prosecutors upped the ante with a four-count criminal complaint that could bring the death penalty if he is convicted.",
      "The complaint charges two counts of stalking and one count each of murder through use of a firearm, and a firearms offense. Murder through use of a firearm carries the possibility of the death penalty, though prosecutors have not said if they will seek it.",
      "Mangione made an initial appearance on the charges before a federal magistrate judge last Thursday but was not required to enter a plea. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has until mid-January to secure an indictment from a federal grand jury.",
      "According to the federal complaint, Mangione had a spiral notebook in which he expressed hostility toward the health insurance industry and wealthy executives. UnitedHealthcare is the largest health insurer in the U.S., though the company said Mangione was never a client.",
      "Among the entries, the complaint said, was one from August that said \u201cthe target is insurance\u201d because \u201cit checks every box\u201d and one from October that describes an intent to \u201cwack\u201d an insurance company CEO.",
      "Mangione was arrested on Dec. 9 in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City, and initially charged there with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police.",
      "Blair County Peter Weeks said last week that he intends to keep the case active and plans to revisit it once Mangione\u2019s murder charges are adjudicated.",
      "Mangione was arrested while eating breakfast at an Altoona McDonald\u2019s after a customer noticed that he looked like the person in surveillance photos that police were circulating of Thompson\u2019s killer.",
      "Officers found a gun that matched the one used in the shooting, a fake ID and writings that expressed hostility toward the health insurance industry, prosecutors said.",
      "Hours later, the Manhattan DA\u2019s office filed paperwork for a warrant for Mangione\u2019s arrest on a murder charge. Mangione, who was held without bail in Pennsylvania, headed off a protracted extradition fight by agreeing to be flown to New York last Thursday."

      "ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Attorneys for Adnan Syed, whose complex legal case was chronicled in the hit podcast \u201cSerial,\" are seeking to have his prison sentence reduced as he awaits further court decisions. Syed was released from prison in 2022 and has remained free ever since, though his court case is ongoing. His lawyers are seeking to reduce his sentence under a Maryland law that allows people who have been imprisoned for at least 20 years for crimes committed when they were minors to seek a change in sentence.",
      "Syed was released when a Baltimore judge overturned his conviction in response to a request from prosecutors who said they found flaws in the evidence. But in August, Maryland's Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision that reinstated Syed\u2019s conviction while allowing him to remain free pending a new hearing about whether he should have been released.",
      "The court said the victim\u2019s family didn\u2019t receive adequate notice to allow them to attend the original hearing in person.",
      "The defense attorneys' filing on Friday seeks to maintain Syed's freedom until the new hearing.",
      "\u201cThis filing is a small step toward ensuring that Adnan\u2019s custody status is stabilized and his freedom is safeguarded,\u201d said Erica Suter, Syed's attorney and an assistant public defender who directs the Innocence Project Clinic at University of Baltimore Law School.",
      "\u201cWe maintain his innocence and our mission of proving that hasn\u2019t changed,\" Suter said in a statement.",
      "She also said Syed's accomplishments and good conduct, both during his incarceration and since release, support reducing his sentence. Since his release, Syed has been working at Georgetown University\u2019s Prisons and Justice Initiative. His lawyers, including Brian Zavin, who is chief attorney of the Maryland Office of the Public Defender\u2019s Appellate Division, also noted in Friday's filing in Baltimore City Circuit Court that Syed has been caring for his elderly parents since his release and that his father recently died.",
      "The filing also said Syed has cared for his spouse's aging parents.",
      "The Maryland Supreme Court's 4-3 ruling in August came about 11 months after it heard arguments in a case that has been fraught with legal twists and divided court rulings since Syed was convicted in 2000 of killing his high school ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee.",
      "She was found strangled to death and buried in an unmarked grave in 1999. Syed was 17 at the time and was sentenced to life in prison, plus 30 years.",
      "David Sanford, an attorney who represents Lee\u2019s family, said in a statement Monday that \u201cif there is new and compelling evidence to support vacating the conviction of Adnan Syed, we will be the first to call for Mr. Syed\u2019s freedom.\u201d",
      "However, he said the state has not \u201cpresented a shred of new, let alone compelling, evidence which would warrant overturning a murder conviction that has withstood appeals for over two decades.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe State of Maryland engaged in a charade in 2022: it recycled old evidence and, in the process, bamboozled the trial court and the public into believing that Mr. Syed was likely innocent,\u201d Sanford said, adding that attorneys will confer with the family and present their position in court in the days ahead.",
      "Syed, who is now 43, has maintained his innocence.",
      "Baltimore State's Attorney Ivan Bates is weighing how to proceed given the Maryland Supreme Court's decision.",
      "Syed\u2019s case was chronicled in the \u201cSerial\u201d podcast, which debuted in 2014 and drew millions of listeners who became armchair detectives. The show, hosted by veteran radio producer Sarah Koenig, transformed the true-crime genre as it shattered podcast-streaming and downloading records, revealing little-known evidence and raising new questions about the case."

      "Family and friends are saying their final farewells to a substitute teacher killed in a school shooting in Wisconsin last week",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Family and friends said their final farewells Monday to a substitute teacher killed in a shooting at a private religious school in Wisconsin last week, describing her as a devout Christian with Southern roots who made copious notes in her personal Bible and planned to take her children to Disney World next year.",
      "Erin Michelle West, 42, was killed on Dec. 16 when 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow opened fire with a handgun at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison. A 14-year-old student, Rubi Vergara, also was killed and six others were wounded before Rupnow turned the gun on herself. Rupnow was a first-semester student at the school. Investigators are still trying to piece together her motive.",
      "Scores of people attended West's midday funeral at Doxa Church in Fitchburg, a Madison suburb. West's casket was set up before a stage decorated with Christmas trees adorned with golden lights. A giant photograph of her was displayed on a screen above the stage throughout the hourlong service.",
      "Rob Warren, the church's pastor, fought back tears as he welcomed people.",
      "\u201cIn a sense, no one wants to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in another sense I believe we're all supposed to be here right now, to hurt and heal together. As painful as it is, I believe we really all do need this moment.\u201d",
      "According to West's obituary, she was born in St. Charles, Missouri, and graduated from Kennesaw State University in 2005. She married her husband, Jack, in 2005, in Powder Springs, Georgia. The couple has three daughters.",
      "Warren read several verses from West's personal Bible, remarking on all the handwritten notes and underlined sections throughout. He said that after Jack West gave him the Bible, the first page he turned to had the phrase \u201cthe Gospel is for everyone\u201d written in blue ink.",
      "\u201cThis is what Erin West was about,\u201d the pastor said, adding later: \u201cErin is in heaven right now with Jesus and she's more alive than she ever has been and that's the truth.\u201d",
      "Nate Kaloupek, Doxa Church's director of leadership development and equipping, gave a short elegy, describing how Erin met Jack in an online Christian chatroom and how Jack's company, Cardinal Glass, moved the couple around the country, first to Oklahoma and the Pacific Northwest before they settled in Wisconsin about six years ago.",
      "Struggling at times to find his voice, Kaloupek said Erin loved the fast food restaurant chain Chick-fil-A and she showed her Georgia roots often by quipping \"love y'all\u201d or \u201chey, y'all.\"",
      "He joked that Erin was \u201creally bad\u201d at hiding her emotions and felt God had called her to work at ALCS. She led prayers for people in their church group and tracked what prayers were answered, he said.",
      "She loved camping trips with her family, wine-tasting trips with her husband and was looking forward to taking their daughters to Disney World this spring, he added, before concluding the elegy with: \u201cShe'd want me to say \u2018love y\u2019all.' Thank you.\u201d"

      "The UK motor industry is being consulted over how the phasing-out of new petrol and diesel cars by 2030 will work, the government has announced.",
      "The ban on sales of these vehicles had been extended to 2035 under the previous Conservative government but Labour said it would restore the 2030 deadline in its election manifesto.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander is now seeking views from automotive and charging experts to \"restore clarity\" on how to deliver the ban.",
      "Car industry leaders have warned drivers were not switching to electric vehicles at the rate needed to meet the deadline due to the cost of buying the cars privately and charging point infrastructure.",
      "Last month, Ford said the UK government's mandate to produce and sell more electric vehicles (EVs) \"just doesn't work\" without demand.",
      "Lisa Brankin, Ford UK's chair and managing director, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The one thing that we really need is government-backed incentives to urgently boost the uptake of electric vehicles.\"",
      "The Department for Transport said the consultation would \"restore clarity for vehicle manufacturers and the charging industry\" so they \"have the confidence to invest in the UK in the long term and drive growth in the UK automotive industry\".",
      "'The price point is crazy'",
      "But some say they are not yet sold on switching to EVs. Kaylan Evans from London said she wouldn't buy an electric car because \"the price point is crazy\".",
      "\"I don't like the element of relying on charging points and stations when the infrastructure isn't that set up at the moment,\" she added.",
      "She said she and her husband are sticking to their petrol car for now.",
      "Meanwhile, Angelina who is also from London says living in a block of flats there is not \"an option to charge\" vehicles there and wondered how having a personal electric point installed would affect electricity bills.",
      "She wants to move away from her diesel car because of \"the rising cost of fuel and the environmental issues\".",
      "Hybrid sales",
      "The government said the consultation would be part of a \"wider push\" to make it easier and cheaper to charge electric cars.",
      "There are now more than 72,000 public charging points in the UK, with another 100,000 planned by local authorities across England, according to the government.",
      "The lack of sufficient charging infrastructure, particularly in rural areas and homes without private parking spaces poses an issue as well - one that analysts will take several years to resolve.",
      "The cost of EVs remains a barrier to people switching as even the most affordable models are still pricier than their petrol or diesel counterparts.",
      "The government said EVs made up one in four cars sold in the UK. It said industry data put 1 in 3 used electric cars at under \u00a320,000.",
      "Edmund King, president of the AA, said drivers have been \"hesitant about the transition but not hostile\" but the consultation would bring more clarity and certainty.",

      "In 2024, EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales. This target is set to rise. Firms failing to meet these targets face a \u00a315,000 fine per sale.",
      "Companies can avoid fines by buying \"credits\" from firms that have exceeded their quotas for electric car sales. They can also \"borrow\" allowances from future years.",
      "The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank said target required to be achieved by each manufacturer was due to be reached as an average across the industry because these credits would be taken into account.",
      "Colin Walker, transport lead at the ECIU added: \"Certain manufacturers are proving themselves not just equal but better to the task they've been set. The likes of BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai, for example. They are all selling more EV's than they need to. It's proof it can be done and that more ambitious targets in the years ahead can be hit.\"",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "Where does the UK get its energy from?",
      "The government's eight-week consultation aims to gather views on which cars can be sold alongside zero emission vehicles from 2030, including full hybrids and plug-in hybrids, as well as the strategy for vans and the policy for small volume manufacturers.",
      "More than two-thirds of car manufacturers in the UK, including Stellantis, have committed to transitioning fully to electric cars by 2030.",
      "However, firms have also announced thousands of job cuts, partly because of EV targets.",
      "UK car production experienced a sharp decline in October 2024, with overall output dropping by over 15% compared to the previous year. Automotive industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) attributed this fall to weak demand and a significant decrease in exports.",
      "Electric and hybrid vehicle production saw an even steeper decline, falling by one-third due to flagging European demand and factory retooling for new models.",
      "\"Today's measures will help us capitalise on the clean energy transition to support thousands of jobs, make the UK a clean energy superpower, and rebuild Britain,\" Alexander said.",
      "Dan Caesar, chief executive of Electric Vehicles UK said this was an opportunity to position the UK as \"one of the most attractive battery EV markets on the global stage.\" He said there was a growing demand for used and new batteries, and this roadmap would give manufacturers and users more clarity."

      "He adds: \"All my life working. And for what?\"",

      "The flash flood killed more than 220 people in the Valencia region, many of them caught in their cars, or on the ground floors of buildings when the tsunami-like waters hit. But as well as claiming lives, the disaster also devastated livelihoods. Valencia's chamber of commerce estimated that 48,000 companies have been affected.",
      "The towns and industrial belt surrounding the Mediterranean city of Valencia, which itself avoided the impact of the floods, were the worst hit. In total, the province of Valencia represents 5% of Spain's GDP, according to CaixaBank Research, which estimates that the disaster could reduce national economic output by one to two percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
      "Much of the damage has been caused on industrial estates. Diego Rom\u00e1, executive president of the federation of industrial estates in the Valencia region (Feteval), says that \"thousands and thousands of jobs are in the air\" and that a total of 58 industrial estates were affected by the flood water.",

      "Valencians' faith in their authorities has already been severely shaken by the immediate response to the disaster. Protesters have been demanding the resignation of regional president Carlos Maz\u00f3n, who, it emerged, was absent from his office for several hours on the day the floods struck because he was having lunch with a journalist. Many believe his administration's delay in issuing an alert to the phones of people in the region cost lives.",
      "Maz\u00f3n has rejected such claims. \"We did the best we could with the information available,\" he says.",
      "Others criticise the central government for failing to deploy the military and other resources more forcefully. S\u00e1nchez, however, has insisted that his administration \"fulfilled its duties and did so from the very beginning\" of the crisis.",
      "Meanwhile, help has been provided by the private sector. Alcem-se, a charity platform set up by local supermarket entrepreneur Juan Roig, says it has distributed \u20ac35m euros in non-refundable aid to 4,600 businesses.",
      "However, for many, including Mr Milla, the relief may not be enough. He owned a local TV channel, an estate agency and a bar and he has only managed to reopen the latter \u2013 partially \u2013 in the wake of the October floods.",
      "He lists several nearby businesses - including a petrol station, a gym, a beautician and an optician \u2013 which he says will not reopen.",

    "story": [
      "Sega is considering launching its own Netflix-like subscription service for video games, a move which would accelerate gaming's transition towards streaming.",
      "There are already a number of similar services on the market - such as Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus - which see gamers pay a monthly fee for access to a range of titles rather than owning them outright.",
      "Sega's president Shuji Utsumi told the BBC such subscription products were \"very interesting\", and his firm was \"evaluating some opportunities\".",
      "\"We're thinking something - and discussing something - we cannot disclose right now,\" he said.",
      "Some in the industry have expressed concern about the move however telling the BBC it could see gamers \"shelling out more money\" on multiple subscription services.",
      "It is not just Sony and Microsoft who offer game subscriptions - there are now countless players in the space, with rivals such as Nintendo, EA and Ubisoft all offering their own membership plans.",
      "Currently, various Sega games are available across multiple streaming services.",
      "The amount these services individually charge vary depending on the features and games made available. For example, Xbox Game Pass prices range from \u00a36.99 to \u00a314.99 a month, while PlayStation Plus ranges from \u00a36.99 to \u00a313.49 a month.",
      "So it would make financial sense for Sega for people who are playing its titles to pay it subscription fees rather its rivals.",
      "It could also be attractive for people who mostly want to play Sega games - but for everyone else it could result in higher costs.",
      "Rachel Howie streams herself playing games on Twitch, where she is known as DontRachQuit to her fans, and said she was \"excited and worried\" about another subscription service",
      "\"We have so many subscriptions already that we find it very difficult to justify signing up for a new one,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"I think that SEGA will definitely have a core dedicated audience that will benefit from this, but will the average gamer choose this over something like Game Pass?\"",
      "And Sophie Smart, Production Director at UK developer No More Robots, agreed.",
      "\"As someone whose first console was the Sega Mega Drive, what I'd love more than anything is to see Sega thriving and this feels like a step in a modern direction,\" she said.",
      "But she wondered if Sega did create a rival subscription service if this would lead to their games being removed from other services.",

      "The very first thing Mr Utsumi said to me seemed to suggest that the firm, which dominated gaming in the 1990s with a rivalry between Sonic the Hedgehog and Nintendo's Super Mario, may have lost its way.",
      "\"I want to make Sega really shiny again,\" he said.",
      "He said Sega had been putting too much focus on domestic success in Japan, and needed to re-establish itself on a global stage, which would mean expanding past its base.",

      "\"But why? Sega has a great RPG group, Sega has amazing IPs, Sega is a really well-known brand.",
      "\"So I was like, hey, now is not the time to be defensive - but more offensive.\"",
      "He said the company was too concerned about controlling costs when he took over, and he wants to \"bring a rock and roll mentality\" to gaming.",
      "When I told him that sounded familiar - Sega's marketing in the 90s often tried to position Sonic the Hedgehog as the cool alternative to Mario - he agreed.",
      "He said the firm now simply must \"make a great game\" in the series.",
      "\"The next one is going to be a quite challenging, quite exciting game that we are working on,\" he said.",

      "Navantia had been in exclusive negotiations since October after Harland & Wolff's holding company fell into administration.",
      "About 1,000 jobs are to be saved in the deal, which also includes Harland & Wolff's facilities in Scotland and England.",
      "The UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the deal was \"good for jobs\" and \"good for national security\".",

      "He added that the deal was \"a major vote of confidence in the UK from Navantia\".",
      "Asked whether the government had sweetened the deal for Navantia by changing the terms of a contract to deliver three Royal Navy support ships, Reynolds said there had been a \"minor revision\" to the contract to include \"more support\" from the government.",
      "The deal is to be presented as early fruits of the government's post Brexit \"reset\".",
      "Gavin Robinson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP),  said he was \"delighted that this agreement has been reached which will secure the future of jobs in Belfast and in its other sites\".",
      "The MP for East Belfast said that uncertainty over the future of the business had been \"hugely unsettling... particularly for all the staff at the yard\".",
      "Robinson added that Harland & Wolff \"forms part of a wider defence sector that has huge potential for further growth in Northern Ireland\".",
      "George Brash, Unite the union's regional officer for the shipyard workers in Belfast, told BBC News NI that it was a \"hugely positive move\", but that \"the devil will be in the detail\".",
      "He said Unite would now engage with the deal and work to ensure the delivery of guarantees both for jobs and continuity of employment.",
      "Navantia, which is 100% owned by Spain's government, has been a significant recipient of funding from the European Commission as part of the European Defence Fund.",

      "Ovarian cancer is \u201crare, underfunded, and deadly\", says Audra Moran, head of the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance (Ocra), a global charity based in New York.",
      "Like all cancers, the earlier it is detected the better.",
      "Most ovarian cancer starts in the fallopian tubes, so by the time it gets to the ovaries, it may have already spread elsewhere too.",
      "\"Five years prior to ever having a symptom is when you might have to detect ovarian cancer, to affect mortality,\" says Ms Moran.",

      "His team have been developed a testing technology which uses nanotubes -  tiny tubes of carbon which are around 50,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.",
      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",
      "In this case the fingerprint is a pattern of molecules binding to sensors, with different sensitivities and binding strengths.",
      "But the patterns are too subtle for a human to pick out.",
      "\"We can look at the data and we will not make sense of it at all,\" he says. \"We can only see the patterns that are different with AI.\"",
      "Decoding the nanotube data meant loading the data into a machine-learning algorithm, and telling the algorithm which samples came from patients with ovarian cancer, and which from people without it.",

      "The system is undergoing further studies to see if it can be improved using larger sets of sensors, and samples from many more patients. More data can improve the algorithm, just as algorithms for self-driving cars can improve with more testing on the street.",

      "Karuis, based in California uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help identify the precise pneumonia pathogen in 24 hours, and select the right antibiotic for it.",

    "story": [
      "As the ink was drying on one of the world's biggest trade deals, signed in Uruguay this month, and hailed as a milestone for the global economy, anger was brewing thousands of miles away in France.",
      "Under the agreement between the EU on one hand, and Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay on the other, tariffs will be greatly reduced and the amounts of imports and exports allowed will be increased.",
      "The deal would affect almost 800 million people.",
      "It comes as a marked contrast to Donald Trump's plans to greatly increase protectionism when he returns to the White House next month.",
      "The deal still needs to be approved by the 27 EU member states, and France is planning to block it, due to fears that it will harm its farming sector.",
      "Alix Heurtault, a 34-year-old French farmer, says she is worried about her future if the planned agreement goes ahead.",
      "\"I fear that the deal will mean making ends meet becoming even more difficult for farmers like me,\" she says.",
      "As a result, she is crossing her fingers that the French government will be able to stop it.",
      "The planned trade agreement will mean more South American beef, chicken and sugar coming to the EU, and at lower prices. While in the opposite direction, the likes of European cars, clothing and wine would have more access to the Mercosur zone.",
      "For France to block the deal it will need to persuade at least three other EU countries, representing at least 35% of the total population to join it. Ireland, Poland and Austria are also opposed, but Italy will likely need to also come on board to achieve the required population quota.",
      "And with the media giving very conflicting reports about Italy's position, we'll have to wait and see which way the Italians go when the vote is held some time in 2025.",
      "In the meantime, French farmers are continuing to put pressure on Paris to not back down. French President Emmanuel Macron is listening, and has described the trade deal as \"unacceptable in its current form\".",
      "Ms Heurtault grows sugar beet, wheat and barley on a 150-hectare farm in the small village of Villeneuve-sur-Auvers located 60km (37 miles) south of Paris.",
      "She says that the deal would see French farmers badly hit in order to help EU manufacturers. \"It feels like we're a bargaining chip. Farmers in the Mercosur countries [the name of the Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay block] have less restrictions regarding pesticides and lower labour costs.\"",
      "Ms Heurtault's view is widely held across the French farming sector, which has been holding regular protests in recent months.",
      "A few weeks ago some 200 farmers dumped bales of straw in front of the Grand Palais museum and exhibition centre in Paris.",
      "They lit up red flares, and chanted slogans like \"We are feeding you, show us some respect\".",

      "Prof Dadush adds that while European farmers will be negatively impacted, he says this will be very limited.",
      "\"The deal is a threat for European farmers, as the world's most competitive agricultural sector gets access to their market, but we're talking about a tiny amount of liberalisation spread out over a long period of time,\" he says.",
      "He points out that under the agreement the Mercosur nations would still have limits on what they can export to the EU. Such as their proposed initial increased annual quota of beef exports still only accounting for less than 1% of EU consumption of the meat.",
      "Prof Dadush adds that \"the deal is an opportunity to push for much needed market-orientated reform in the heavily-subsidised EU agricultural sector, and Mercosur's highly-protected factory sector\".",

      "\"It obviously depends on the subcategory you're looking at, but French cheese and wine producers will benefit,\" he says.",
      "He adds that it will also improve health and environmental standards in the Mercosur countries, and increase ties with the EU at a time when \"China is also trying to get a foothold in Latin America\".",

      "Actress Blake Lively was arguably the internet's public enemy number one for a couple of weeks in the summer. She's now filed an explosive legal case that she claims lifts the lid on \"hostile work environments\" that are created to harm reputations in Hollywood - and which are making people question who and what to believe.",
      "Blake Lively had always been a pretty inoffensive kind of actress.",
      "She had been in successful TV shows and films, like Gossip Girl and The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants. She married fellow superstar Ryan Reynolds. She's friends with Taylor Swift.",
      "Then in August, while promoting her latest movie It Ends With Us, she suddenly became controversial, to the verge of being cancelled.",
      "She was criticised for comments appearing to downplay domestic violence, the film's theme; while awkward old interviews were resurfaced and repurposed as evidence of bullying behaviour.",
      "Public opinion - at least among those who knew and cared - seemed to have turned against her.",
      "Then the film came out, the furore died down, and social media moved on.",
      "But Lively has now filed a legal case that claims she suffered sexual harassment by It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni - and that when she complained, he and his studio Wayfarer retaliated by waging a campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation.",
      "She was the subject of \"a sophisticated, co-ordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" designed \"to silence her\", involving a \"weaponised a digital army\" and fake stories being fed to \"unwitting reporters\", her lawyers have alleged - and that's why she became the focus of negative publicity.",
      "Throughout the complaint, which spans some 80 pages, Lively's team repeatedly accuses Badoni and Wayfarer of creating a \"hostile work environment that nearly derailed production of the film\".",
      "Her lawyers have published text messages sent between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and Melissa Nathan, a crisis communications specialist hired by his studio to help manage the harassment complaint. They appear to give a rare glimpse into conversations that are normally kept well out of the spotlight.",
      "Nathan pitched a strategy to \"start threads of theories\" on social media, to \"create, seed, and promote content that appeared to be authentic\", and engage in \"social manipulation\", according to the legal papers.",
      "\"You know we can bury anyone,\" Nathan wrote to Abel in one damning discussion.",
      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni: What you need to know",
      "Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint",
      "Actor Baldoni women's solidarity award rescinded amid allegations",
      "Now, the people hired to do crisis PR for Baldoni are doing crisis PR for themselves.",
      "Abel has said Lively's lawyers \"cherry picked\" messages to include in their case without crucial context, and that there was \"no 'smear' implemented\".",
      "\"No negative press was ever facilitated, no social combat plan, although we were prepared for it as it's our job to be ready for any scenario.",
      "\"But we didn't have to implement anything because the internet was doing the work for us.\"",
      "The backlash against Lively occurred naturally and didn't need their help, Abel said.",
      "Lawyer Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni and his studio as well as Abel and Nathan, echoed that.",
      "He said Baldoni hired a crisis manager due to \"multiple demands and threats\" allegedly made by Lively, including \"threatening to not [show] up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "He said the plan drawn up by Nathan's firm \"proved unnecessary as audiences found Lively's own actions, interviews and marketing during the promotional tour distasteful, and responded organically to that, which the media themselves picked up on\".",
      "Overall, Freedman called Lively's complaint \"shameful\" and full of \"categorically false accusations\".",
      "In recent days, Lively has received support from a string of former co-stars and others in Hollywood.",
      "The name of one of her supporters stands out.",
      "Amber Heard, former wife of Johnny Depp, told NBC: \"Social media is the absolute personification of the classic saying, 'A lie travels halfway around the world before truth can get its boots on.'",
      "\"I saw this firsthand and up close. It's as horrifying as it is destructive.\"",
      "Heard was on the receiving end of social media hostility during two high-profile libel trials involving Depp in the UK and US in 2020 and 2022. Nathan also reportedly worked for Depp.",
      "Freedman responded to Heard by saying the only connection between her and Lively was that \"for decades every move they have made has been out there for everyone to see\" so the public could \"make up their own minds - which they did, organically\".",
      "Tortoise Media head of investigations Alexi Mostrous, who hosted a podcast called Who Trolled Amber? earlier this year examining the abuse she received, said there were parallels.",
      "\"In both the Blake Lively case and the Amber Heard case, you see PR companies working with digital media specialists and other 'contractors' to promote online stories beneficial to their wealthy clients in ways that are opaque and not well understood,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"It's an unregulated world where all sorts of tactics can take place behind closed doors.\"",
      "'Common tactic'",
      "Variety said Lively's case \"lays bare a show business process that's meant to operate in the shadows \u2013 the hiring of expensive crisis communications experts to sway opinion and uplift clients\".",
      "Her allegations suggest a \"sinister shadow campaign\" that went \"beyond what most publicity firms in Hollywood see as acceptable\", The Wrap's Sharon Waxman wrote.",
      "According to Rory Lynch, partner and head of reputation management law at Gateley Legal, it is \"quite a common tactic\" in Hollywood and business disputes to \"have PRs on both sides planting negative stories, sometimes false stories, about the opposition\".",
      "\"Even back in the golden era of Hollywood, there were rumours that Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were using PR professionals to negatively brief against each other.\"",
      "However, the PR people who worked for Baldoni and his studio \"dropped the ball a little bit\" by discussing tactics in texts, he told BBC News.",
      "\"It doesn't surprise me, especially in the US and Hollywood, that you've got quite aggressive crisis PR people.",
      "\"But the fact that they put that in writing, I think, was possibly not the wisest thing. Normally they might do something like that over the phone.\"",
      "Lively herself is \"a sophisticated operator\" who will \"have her own PR people working away in the background as well\", Lynch added.",
      "'Our eyes are open'",
      "The New York Times, which broke the story of Lively's complaint at the weekend, said she \"denied that she or any of her representatives planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer\".",
      "The paper also pointed out that \"it is impossible to know how much of the negative publicity\" towards Lively was originally seeded by those working on behalf of Baldoni, \"and how much they noticed and amplified\".",
      "Some fans have stressed that their criticisms were genuine, but many who turned against Lively now see the situation in a different light.",

      "Emerging from Glasgow's bustling music scene Kapranos, guitarist Nick McCarthy, bassist Bob Hardy and drummer Paul Thomson enjoyed chart success with inescapable singles like Take Me Out, earned a reputation as one of the country's finest live acts and snagged the Mercury Music Prize in 2004.",
      "That victory came as the band thought \"anyone but us would win,\" recalls the singer.",

      "\"Watching horror films or riding rollercoasters gives you a buzz and we should maybe approach some wider existential fears with the same attitude.",
      "\"I remember growing up in the 80s and thinking one diplomatic slip-up would mean we'd all be nuclear toast. There's always something to be afraid of, and you can either submit to it or stand up to it.\"",
      "'Loathe' to write about politics again",

      "However the second Presidency of Trump is unlikely to spur such a similiar reaction.",
      "\"Trump's not my favourite man and there's so much in worldwide politics that's disheartening,\" says the singer.",

      "Growing up, being surrounded by stars from the silver screen was normal for Geoffrey.",
      "\"I mean [Frank] Sinatra was very close to the family and we used to spend a lot of Thanksgivings and Easters together. Kirk Douglas, Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, they were all very, very dear friends.\"",
      "Sir Roger's daughter Deborah remembers her father couldn't keep up with Frank Sinatra's drinking and would secretly pour his whisky into the plant pots.",
      "The family would watch comedy duo Morecambe and Wise on TV on a Friday night, says Geoffrey, and then Eric and Ernie would come over for Sunday lunch.",
      "He also remembers meeting Clint Eastwood and Sean Connery - the first James Bond - as well as stars from Hollywood's golden age, such as Fred Astaire and Olivia De Havilland.",
      "\"I mean, if I think about how lucky we were\u2026 to the point where even Roger would say, 'Goodness, look at that, we've got Gene Kelly sitting there. Isn't that wonderful!'\".",
      "But despite being surrounded by stardom, Sir Roger was very \"self-deprecating\", says Geoffrey.",
      "\"I always say, the bigger the talent, the smaller the limousine. And he was incredibly humble,\" he says.",
      "At the end of a day's filming, Sir Roger would simply enjoy watching TV with his family in his dressing gown and slippers.",
      "\"His treat was baked beans on toast,\" says Geoffrey. \"He didn't need caviar.\"",
      "Sir Roger came from humble beginnings. He grew up in Stockwell in south London. His father was a police officer and his mother worked in a tearoom. He crafted his aristocratic English accent at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada) and earned money modelling knitting patterns.",
      "His big break came in 1962, playing Simon Templar in the TV series, The Saint.",
      "Geoffrey recalls the phone call his father received when he found out he had been chosen to take over the role of Britain's most famous secret agent.",
      "The last three digits of Sir Roger's phone number just happened to be 007.",
      "\"He answered the phone with '007', because that's what you do, and the voice said, 'That you are Roger,'\" says Geoffrey.",
      "Sean Connery was the closest to author Ian Fleming's depiction of the character in his spy novels, says Geoffrey, as in \"I'm going to sleep with you and kill your boss tomorrow\".",
      "\"Whereas, Roger didn't want to fire a gun really,\" says Geoffrey, \"he just sort of killed them with charm.\"",
      "He always had a very sardonic approach, says Geoffrey, and that was his interpretation, he adds.",
      "\"Let's make James Bond Roger Moore,\" he says, \"[as] opposed to Roger having to play a hired gun who is licensed to kill. And I think he was more like 'licensed to thrill.'\"",
      "This took an enormous amount of talent, says Geoffrey.",
      "Of the Bond films that starred Sir Roger, Geoffrey says his father's favourite was The Spy Who Loved Me.",
      "Growing up on movie sets was fantastic, recalls Geoffrey, but having James Bond as your father attracted quite a bit of attention on the school run.",
      "When Sir Roger came to pick him up from school one day, he remembers the car was suddenly surrounded by pupils - keen to catch a glimpse of the star.",
      "\"I thought, 'Oh, okay, he's known, I'm not the only one that sees him on the box,'\" he says.",
      "But living in the public eye could be difficult when there was a scandal.",
      "Geoffrey recalls a phone call his father made to him one morning, letting him know the papers had got hold of the story that he was leaving his mother.",
      "\"I said, 'Well, thanks for the heads up! How long have I got?'\" says Geoffrey.",
      "The press had already surrounded his mother's house. It creates \"a small scar to see that your pain is exposed,\" says Geoffrey. \"I think that's the worst part of being famous.\"",
      "After his split from Luisa, Sir Roger went on to marry his fourth wife, Kristina Tholstrup, otherwise known as Kiki. He had also been previously married to actress and professional ice skater Doorn van Steyn and singer Dorothy Squires.",
      "Sir Roger died in 2017 at the age of 89. In his later years, actress Audrey Hepburn had asked him to take on her humanitarian work for the children's charity Unicef, says Geoffrey.",

      "Until now.",

      "\"Everyone asked me what I was talking about,\" he said. \"Something seemed a little odd.\"",
      "'In love' with the fair, Goldberg wrote to Heller, introducing himself and proposing a new iteration of the Austrian's original dream.",
      "The two slowly built a rapport and Heller revealed that the attractions had been stored in 44 shipping containers in Austin, Texas since their disassembly.",
      "Opening in 1987, Luna Luna was a colourful success for three months. Its run was extended twice due to high demand, but while trying to fund a European tour, Heller fell into debt and sold the fair to an American foundation.",
      "The foundation tried to back out of the deal - \"buyers remorse\", according to Goldberg - but eventually went through with it. For the duration of the years-long battle and the new ownership, however, the rides were kept in storage.",
      "Decades since Luna Luna was packed away, Goldberg rallied a team of investors to buy what might be left of the exhibition from the foundation - sight unseen.",

      "The New York Times estimated they paid $100m (about \u00a380m). The Guardian reported the sum at $1m. Goldberg did not disclose the final price to the BBC.",
      "When he opened the first of the containers, Goldberg started to sweat. Luna Luna's original merchandise had been torn to shreds.",
      "\"Did I just lead a group to spend millions of dollars on a pile of dust artwork that essentially rotted away?\" he wondered.",
      "It was a sleepless night.",

      "Most of the original rides are now housed in a towering 17,000-square foot space. There, exhibition-goers can \"marry\" one another in Heller's Wedding Chapel - originally a form of protest art against anti-LGBTQ marriage laws of the 80s.",
      "Hockney's Enchanted Tree Pavilion still smells faintly sweet, as if stampeding children once crushed fallen popcorn into its floor.",
      "Goldberg's wish to incorporate \"today's greatest artists\" is fulfilled with a soundtrack by modern musicians Andr\u00e9 3000, Jamie xx and Jockstrap echoing around the space.",
      "Drake isn't involved day-to-day but, \"he is passionate about Luna Luna and has provided his full support since the beginning,\" Gonzales said.",
      "All the fun of the fair?",
      "There's one big difference between 1987's Luna Luna and today's: Children aren't allowed on the rides.",
      "Basquiat's Ferris Wheel and Kenny Scharf's swing ride are display-only. So too (thankfully) is Manfred Deix's Palace of the Winds in which performers originally farted into microphones.",
      "Haring biographer Gooch doesn't think the artist would have approved of children just watching his carousel turn.",
      "\"I can't imagine he would allow it,\" he said. \"He was pretty insistent about interactivity of children with art, and this was art that was specifically made for them.\"",
      "Poots, who played a significant role in coordinating the interdisciplinary side of the exhibition said of the decision: \"They're priceless works of art now.\"",
      "But he champions the possibility of audiences becoming \"part of this moving exhibition\" through the \"carnival-esque environment with performance artists with light, with sound\".",
      "It has been a career-long mission of Poots not \"to create these silos for elites\".",

      "Among the families wandering around The Shed on Thanksgiving weekend were Raemy Suwatson and her 11-year-old daughter, who learned she wouldn't be able to go on the rides the morning of their visit.",
      "Haring's carousel was her favourite. \"I wanted to ride it\" she said, then added \"but it was also cool to watch\".",

      "The birth of Jesus Christ - a seminal biblical event - has been the subject of many paintings by Western artists, who have often applied the ideas of beauty and creativity prevalent there while depicting the event on canvas.",
      "These works are among the most widely available representations of Christian art, shaping how the world views this biblical event and subliminally divesting those outside the West from influencing it.",
      "But over the centuries, artists in India have sought to express their vision of this event by painting Jesus's birth and other Christian themes in their own style.",
      "Some have done so consciously, others unconsciously, but the end result is a body of work that breathes new life and meaning into the event of Christ's birth, and Christianity itself.",
      "Here are some paintings from Indian art history that present Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective.",
      "Mughal emperor Muhammad Jalaluddin Akbar is credited with introducing northern India to Christianity by inviting Jesuit missionaries to visit his court.",
      "The missionaries brought with them holy scriptures and European artworks on Christian themes which influenced court painters. Akbar and his successors also commissioned many murals with Christian themes and some court painters began infusing these paintings with elements of Islamic art.",
      "Neha Vermani, a historian of South Asia, talks about a painting made by Mughal court artists which featured emperor Jahangir in the nativity scene, which traditionally feature Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus.",
      "\"Mughal rulers saw themselves as being 'just' rulers, capable of maintaining harmony and balance in their kingdoms; they were 'universal rulers'. Allowing different religions to co-exist was integral to how they saw themselves and wanted themselves to be remembered,\" Ms Vermani says.",
      "The 18th Century painting below features typical stylistic elements of Mughal art, including highly stylised figures, vibrant colours, naturalism and ornamentation.",
      "Born in 1887 in what is now India's West Bengal state, Jamini Roy is celebrated for creating a unique visual language by bringing together elements of Bengali folk art and Kalighat paintings - a distinctive art form that originated in the vicinity of a renowned temple in Kolkata city.",

      "When Blake Lively, who rose to fame in the 2000s playing Serena van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl, was cast as the main character, fans became even more excited, describing her as the perfect choice to play Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse and winds up in the same position years later.",
      "Lily, a florist in Boston, navigates a complicated love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend Ryle Kincaid - played by Jane the Virgin's Justin Baldoni - and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar).",
      "Released at the beginning of August, the film became a box office success bringing in more than $350m (\u00a3280m) globally.",
      "But despite its financial success, everything wasn't running so smoothly behind the scenes. Rumours of a feud between Baldoni and Lively began swirling before the film was even released.",
      "Last week, Lively filed a legal complaint against her co-star, accusing him of sexual harassment and starting a smear campaign against her, something Baldoni strongly denies. Here is the story so far:",
      "Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint",
      "Blake Lively accuses co-star Justin Baldoni of smear campaign",
      "It Ends With Us press tour",
      "For a film about domestic abuse, the press tour for It Ends With Us was probably not what you would have expected. There were pink carpets, flowers galore and the promotion of Lively's new haircare brand and her husband's gin company.",
      "Instead of advocacy on the red carpet, Lively highlighted fashion and florals.",
      "At the London premiere, press were told to keep questions \"fun and light-hearted\" with one event organiser telling me to \"steer away from questions on domestic abuse\".",

      "Ms Paige accused Lively of promoting the film like it's \"the sequel to Barbie\".",
      "Justin Baldoni's absence",
      "Alongside the press tour being described as \"tone-deaf\", people started asking questions about why the Lively and Baldoni weren't photographed on the red carpet together at the film's New York premiere on 6 August.",
      "The pair also did no interviews together during the press tour and at the London premiere, which Baldoni didn't attend, I was warned by Lively's team to not \"ask any questions about Justin\".",
      "Internet sleuths also spotted that cast members including Lively and author Hoover did not follow Baldoni on social media.",
      "Neither Lively or Baldoni addressed rumours of a feud during the press tour and the only reference to each other was Baldoni telling Today that his co-star was a \"dynamic creative\".",
      "\"She had her hands in every part of this production, and everything she touched made [it] better,\" he said about the 37-year-old.",
      "Mixed critic reviews",
      "While the film was a box office success, it received mixed reviews from critics with some saying it romanticised domestic abuse.",
      "There was a two-star review from The Telegraph's Tim Robey, who called it a \"queasy drama\" that \"repackages domestic violence as slick romance\".",
      "He suggested the film \"splices abuse and glossy courtship in the big city to deeply dubious effects\".",
      "The movie also sparked a debate on TikTok, with some saying that it's not clear from the trailer that this story is about an abusive relationship and rather it appears to be telling a love story.",
      "Based on this misconception, some people said they found the film traumatic as they didn't know it contained scenes of domestic abuse.",
      "'Smear campaign'",
      "During the film's press tour, Baldoni hired a crisis manager, Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake.",
      "Shortly after the press tour, Lively faced a barrage of criticism on social media relating to her comments on that tour as well as from old interviews.",
      "One of the interviews to resurface was one shared by a Norwegian journalist, Kjersti Flaa, who posted a video on YouTube of her interviewing Lively in 2016. It was titled \"The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.\"",
      "Flaa has since said she had \"nothing to do with Justin Baldoni and his smear campaign\".",
      "Actor Brandon Sklenar, who plays Atlas in the film, defended Lively and said in a post on Instagram that people had been \"vilifying\" the women involved in the film online.",
      "He said it was \"disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected\" and that someone close to him who had experienced a relationship similar to Lily's had credited the film with \"saving her life\".",
      "Legal complaint",
      "Four months after the film's launch, Lively filed a legal complaint against Mr Baldoni in which she accused him of sexual harassment.",
      "The complaint also listed Wayfarer Studios, Mr Baldoni's production company which produced It Ends With Us, as a defendant.",
      "The legal filing accuses Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer CEO Jamey Heath of \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\". Some other female cast and crew had also spoken up about their conduct, the filing alleges.",
      "It also alleges that Ms Lively, Mr Baldoni and other people involved in the development of the film attended a meeting in January to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set. Her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, attended the meeting alongside her, according to the complaint.",
      "At the meeting, attendees agreed to a list of demands, including Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath making \"no more descriptions of their own genitalia\", requiring an intimacy coordinator on set at all times when Ms Lively was in scenes with Mr Baldoni and no \"friends\" of the producers and directors being on set during scenes when Ms Lively was in a state of nudity.",
      "The list of demands also implied that Mr Baldoni had asked Ms Lively's trainer how much she weighed and alleged that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath had spoken about their \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively.",
      "Plan to 'destroy' reputation",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively also alleges that Mr Baldoni and his team attacked her public image after the meeting.",
      "She accuses him of orchestrating a plan to \"destroy\" her reputation in the press and online, including hiring a crisis manager who led a \"sophisticated, coordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" against her and used a \"digital army\" to post social media content that seemed authentic.",
      "\"To safeguard against the risk of Ms Lively ever revealing the truth about Mr Baldoni, the Baldoni-Wayfarer team created, planted, amplified, and boosted content designed to eviscerate Ms Lively's credibility,\" her team wrote in the filing.",
      "It adds: \"They engaged in the same techniques to bolster Mr Baldoni's credibility and suppress any negative content about him.\"",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively says that this had led to \"substantial harm\" that affected \"all aspects\" of her life.",
      "Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met.",
      "Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\"",
      "Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "Support for Lively",
      "Hollywood stars including America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel have publicly backed Blake Lively after she filed her complaint.",
      "Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel, who starred with Lively in 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, issued a joint statement on Instagram, on Sunday saying they \"stand with her in solidarity\".",
      "\"Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice,\" they wrote.",
      "Colleen Hoover, the author of It Ends With Us, also showed her support, describing Ms Lively as \"honest, kind, supportive and patient\".",

      "When Charli XCX recorded her sixth album, Brat, she thought her prickly, abrasive dance anthems were \"not going to appeal to a lot of people\".",
      "In the end, the record topped the charts and became a cultural phenomenon. It was nominated for seven Grammys, referenced in the US presidential election, turned into a paint swatch, and named \"word of the year\" by Collins Dictionary.",
      "Now the album has been named the best new release of 2024 in a \"poll of polls\" compiled by BBC News.",
      "In multiple end of year lists, critics called Brat \"brilliant from start to finish\" and \"pop music for the future\", praising the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's insecurities, anxieties and obsessions.",
      "In the star's own words, the record is \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "\"The louder you play it, the more honest it gets,\" said the Los Angeles Times.",
      "The BBC's poll is a \"super-ranking\" compiled from 30 year-end lists published by the world's most influential music magazines - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Spain's Mondo Sonoro and France's Les Inrockuptibles.",
      "Records were assigned points based on their position in each list - with the number one album getting 20 points, the number two album receiving 19 points, and so on.",
      "Brat was the runaway winner with a score of 486 points, nearly twice as many as the number two album, Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter.",
      "In total, the critics named 184 records among their favourites, from the The Cure's long-awaited comeback, Songs Of A Lost World, to the kaleidoscopic rap of Doechii's Alligator Bites Never Heal.",
      "Here's the top 25 in full.",
      "1) Charli XCX - Brat",
      "Charli was born Emma Aitchison in Essex, UK, and has been chipping away at the coalface of pop for more than a decade.",
      "At the start of her career, she scored hits with shiny pop anthems such as Fancy, I Love It and Boom Clap - but over the years, her music has become more volatile and aggressive.",
      "Underground anthems like Vroom, Vroom and Track 10 turned her into a cult star but, as she confessed on Brat: \"I've started thinking again about whether I deserve commercial success\".",
      "With that in mind, she entered 2024 with a new sense of purpose.",
      "\"Before we'd even done much writing, she had a masterplan of all the stuff she wanted to write about, and all the things she wanted to say,\" producer AG Cook tells the BBC. \"She had a real vision for the album, right from the start.\"",
      "\"Even the name Brat was in play for about two years,\" adds co-producer Finn Keane.",
      "Released in June, Brat became the soundtrack to the summer; and Charli extended her success with a remix album that rewrote many of the songs and added an array of guest stars, from Billie Eilish and Robyn to The 1975 and Lorde.",
      "The remix project was \"really, off-the-cuff and last minute\", says Cook, \"but that's been part of the fun of Brat\".",
      "\"Charli is just incredibly quick and open to ideas,\" adds Keane. \"You can give her kind of any kind of crazy track, and she'll instantly be able to come up with something super hooky, with a twist that's very memorable and elaborate.",
      "\"She's just incredibly musical.\"",
      "Billboard: \"Charli XCX pulled off one of the most exciting and culturally significant album launches in modern memory... And best of all? It was all on Charli's own terms. Drawing inspiration primarily from club culture and hyperpop, Charli pulled once-niche spaces in music into the mainstream.\"",
      "The Forty Five: \"In making a club record to ignite the underground, she's reached the world's biggest stages. Musically, Charli is at her peak.\"",
      "2) Beyonc\u00e9 - Cowboy Carter",
      "Frequently mis-labelled as a country album, Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter is so much more. A racial reckoning with the black roots of American folk music, its 27 tracks embrace everything from line-dancing to psychedelic rock, with guest appearances from Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Post Malone.",
      "The Times: \"The pop hoedown single Texas Hold 'Em remains the best piece, but the acoustic guitar-driven sexy ode Bodyguard is another highlight. Will this finally win Beyonc\u00e9 her best album Grammy?\"",
      "NME: \"A masterclass in creativity from an artist who never forgets her roots.\"",
      "3) Fontaines D.C. - Romance",
      "The fourth album by Dublin's Fontaines DC saw the quintet take their scratchy, sinister sound and run it through a technicolor filter. The results include everything from stadium-sized sing-alongs (Favourite) to panic-inducing punk anthems (Starburster).",
      "Allmusic: \"When all is said and done, they remain fantastic songwriters, able to convey a variety of emotions without relying on the trappings of punk. The corners may have been sanded off, but it has only revealed new and interesting textures underneath.\"",
      "Mojo magazine: \"Fontaines D.C. are now, in terms of risk-taking potential, the Arctic Monkeys' closest rivals.\"",
      "4) Billie Eilish - Hit Me Hard And Soft",
      "The title says it all. None of the songs on Billie Eilish's exquisite third album are content to sit still, moving from hushed intimacy to emotional volatility as the singer navigates the murky waters of her early 20s.",
      "The Telegraph: \"Eilish has made something rich, strange, smart, sad and wise enough to stand comparison with Joni Mitchell's Blue. A heartbreak masterpiece for her generation, and for the ages.\"",
      "The Guardian: \"An album that keeps wrongfooting the listener, Hit Me Hard and Soft is clearly intended as something to gradually unpick: A bold move in a pop world where audiences are usually depicted as suffering from an attention deficit that requires instant gratification.\"",
      "5) MJ Lenderman - Manning Fireworks",
      "Billed by one publication as the \"poet laureate of indie rock\", MJ Lenderman's breakthrough album is tender, melancholy and wryly funny, populated by a cast of flawed, disappointed and disappointing characters he observed around his hometown of Asheville, North Carolina.",
      "New York Times: \"An ace guitarist with a keen ear for jangly tones, he lends even his most pathetic characters a bit of warm-blooded humanity.\"",
      "The Line Of Best Fit: \"How he gets you to care about nobodies from nowhere and their very strange plights is in part to do with his knack for universal empathy, but more importantly, the fact that he sings everything like he was just robbed at gunpoint by his 8th grade bully who he later watched win the lottery. You feel bad for things you don't necessarily even understand.\"",
      "6) The Cure - Songs Of A Lost World",
      "Sixteen years in the making, The Cure's 14th studio album didn't disappoint. Written during a period where frontman Robert Smith lost his mother, father and brother, it is simultaneously dark and fragile.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Smith said making the record had been \"hugely cathartic\" in escaping the \"doom and gloom\" he felt.",
      "Time magazine: \"It's no exaggeration that this is an album haunted by death, so it's almost ironic that, musically speaking, there hasn't been this much life in The Cure for decades.\"",
      "Pitchfork: \"It feels like a record whose time is right, delivering a concentrated dose of The Cure and cutting the fat that dogged their later albums.\"",
      "7) Cindy Lee - Diamond Jubilee",
      "A sprawling, two-hour opus of dreamy pop and psychedelia, this is one of the year's most mysterious records. You can't buy the CD or vinyl, and it's not available on Spotify or Apple Music. At the time of writing, it's only available as a continuous, ad-free stream on YouTube, or as a download from Bandcamp.",
      "But the seventh album by Cyndi Lee (the drag alter-ego of rock musician Patrick Flegel) is definitely worth your seeking out - like the lost transmissions of a ghostly 1960s pirate radio station.",
      "Uncut: \"Cindy Lee has managed to buck just about every trend, convention and expectation of what releasing music in the digital age is supposed to look and like. And, even more crucially, it sounds just as refreshing.\"",
      "Stereogum: \"Diamond Jubilee is two hours of unrushed wandering through a lo-fi escape, catchy to the point of sticky, tarnishing in its abrasiveness yet sun-baked to perfection.\"",
      "8) Waxahatchee - Tigers Blood",
      "On her sixth album as Waxahatchee, singer-songwriter Katie Crutchfield tackles everything from anxiety and self-doubt, to her ongoing struggle with sobriety, with piercing insight and a laid-back country-rock feel.",
      "Pitchfork: \"Her mind is alive and humming, and her language leaps out at you with its hunger.\"",
      "Consequence of Sound: \"Crutchfield is still growing, both personally and artistically, and we're just glad she's invited us along for the ride.\"",
      "9) Kendrick Lamar - GNX",
      "After landing the decisive blow in his rap beef with Drake, Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar took a victory lap on his surprise sixth album, GNX. Razor sharp and rhythmically complex, it's both a poison pen letter to his detractors, and a love letter to Los Angeles' hip-hop culture.",
      "LA Times: \"Lamar is worked up about liars, about folks doling out backhanded compliments, about other rappers with \"old-ass flows\" wasting space with empty rhymes. Indeed, what seems to make him angriest is the idea that a person could triumph in hip-hop by taking hip-hop less seriously than he does.\"",
      "Complex: \"Even cooler is how much space Kendrick gives to underground rappers from the LA scene\u2014figures who are talented but raw, and would likely struggle to gain national recognition without a boost.\"",
      "10) Sabrina Carpenter - Short N' Sweet",
      "Six albums into her career, former Disney star Sabrina Carpenter landed on a winning formula - one that puts aside the cookie-cutter pop of her teen years, and zeroes in on her sly humour as a USP.",
      "Fleet of foot and packed with memorable one-liners, it produced three number one singles in the UK, including song of the year contender Espresso.",
      "New York Times: \"A smart, funny, cheerfully merciless catalogue of bad boyfriend behaviour.\"",
      "Esquire: \"The range, humour, and sophistication of these 12 songs were a revelation.\"",
      "The next 15",
      "11) Tyler, The Creator - Chromokopia",
      "12) Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds - Wild God",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 18:03:28 GMT",
    "summary": "From Monzo and Duolingo to Trainline and Sainsbury's, companies have hopped onto the year in review bandwagon following the success of Spotify Wrapped",
    "story": [
      "Throughout December, Instagram feeds are flooded with pictures of Christmas trees, snaps from festive work parties \u2013 and screenshots of people's most-listened-to songs of the year.",
      "That's because at the end of every year, since 2016, Spotify releases Wrapped. The campaign pulls together what users listened to the most and usually includes their top songs, artists, and genres.",
      "It's now \"plastered across every possible social media platform known to man,\" says Dr Gillian Brooks, a senior lecturer in strategic marketing at King's College London.",
      "She says its Wrapped feature works so well because music is personal and people enjoy the nostalgia of seeing the songs that marked their lives over the past year.",
      "Since Wrapped goes viral annually, other businesses have joined in, from language learning app Duolingo to bank Monzo, all creating their own personalised \"year in review\" summaries - alongside other music streaming apps such as Apple Music and Amazon Music.",
      "Prof Jonathan Wilson, a professor of brand strategy and culture at Regent's University London, thinks there is an ulterior motive for people sharing these end-of-year-reviews - especially on apps that people use to track their virtuous activities, like fitness and education.",
      "\"It's like bragging but without the selfie,\" he explains. \"Lots of people don't want to take selfies for various reasons but one of them is that people feel a bit cringe, that it's a bit narcissistic.\"",
      "People share information on social media if it \"enhances the image we wish to portray publicly of who we are and what we want to align ourselves with\", he says.",
      "Apps like Strava will tot up how far you have run or cycled this year, while Duolingo will tell you how many hours you've spent learning another language.",
      "Goodreads provides you with images you can share on social media displaying the books you have read this year, with details about the average page length and your top genres.",
      "\"Data is a really good way to humblebrag, as opposed to actually taking selfies in all of your best clothes surrounded by all of your best people and belongings,\" Prof Wilson adds.",
      "\"It's less like bragging and a bit more evidence-based,\" agrees Prof Caroline Wiertz, a professor in marketing at City, University of London.",
      "Spotify Wrapped is part of the festive calendar",
      "\"This is a thing now in the calendar,\" Prof Wiertz says. \"We wait for the John Lewis Christmas ad, we also wait to receive our Spotify Wrapped.\"",
      "Other brands jumping on the bandwagon include Tesco and Sainsbury's for your favourite groceries, Trainline and Uber for your most frequent journeys, Monzo and Lloyds for your spending habits, Xbox and Nintendo for your gaming.",
      "Prof Wilson tells the BBC this copycat behaviour was inevitable - the prospect of people promoting a company or product seems like too good an opportunity to miss.",
      "As Dr Brooks says: \"It's free advertising for them.\"",
      "Can you remember these 2024 culture moments?",
      "'Barry Island is on the up but it'll never be posh'",
      "Watch: Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr reunite on stage",
      "Some year in review features are more tongue in cheek, which brands hope can make them more relatable, and shareable, to their customers, these experts say.",
      "People typically don't post information about their financial situation on social media. But Monzo has found a way to make its year in review sharable, by telling people whether they're among the top spenders at Greggs.",
      "Reddit tells users the distance they've scrolled, measured in bananas.",
      "And though Prof Wilson says that people typically don't want to post mundane things on social media, like \"which kind of bread roll they bought,\" Sainsbury's shows shoppers whether they were the top buyers of certain products in their local area.",
      "It has led to people boasting online about being the top consumer of paprika, toilet cleaner or pickled gherkins.",
      "Year in review features can raise questions about just how much data companies collect. It is widely understood that the vast majority of apps and websites someone might use are collecting huge reams of data, which they use for marketing purposes.",
      "Dr Brooks suggests \"people blindly accept privacy preferences online\" because they want to get on with whatever they visited the website to do.",
      "Data privacy is \"not as huge of an issue as it used to be\", she says. \"If we get more targeted adverts as a result, most people I've spoken to are okay with that.\"",
      "And though people like to keep some information about themselves private, they seem to have few qualms about sharing their hobbies and leisure activities online.",
      "\"Paradoxically, when you share a selfie you are sharing far less information about yourself than you do with data showing what you do,\" Prof Wilson says. \"People seem more comfortable with doing that than sharing a picture of themselves.\"",

    "summary": "Having been cleared of rape, the rapper will soon be plotting his path back to the top of UK rap music.",
    "story": [
      "\"Even if he is acquitted, it will not leave him. He'll be cancelled for the rest of time,\" Patrick Gibbs KC, defending Slowthai, told the jury.",
      "As the not guilty verdicts were read out by the foreman, the rapper collapsed in tears in the dock - he had just been acquitted of three counts of rape following a three-week-long trial at Oxford Crown Court.",
      "In that moment, most people in that court room, including the rapper's friends and family, were focussed on the relief and joy of those two words - \"not guilty\".",
      "But over the coming weeks, Slowthai - whose real name is Tyron Frampton - will begin to plot a course to overcome his ''cancellation\", and regain his status as one of UK rap music's most celebrated artists.",
      "The rapper released his first album in 2019.",
      "He has since gone on to release two more critically acclaimed albums, including 2023's UGLY - which received a five-star review from the NME's Thomas Smith, who called it the rapper's \"most exhilarating project to date from front to back\".",
      "But soon after the release of his third album, the Grammy-nominated rapper was charged with rape.",
      "He was quickly removed from the line-up of Glastonbury Festival, as well as Reading and Leeds, soon after.",
      "Fast forward 18 months, and he has been cleared of those charges by a jury of his peers - and is now free to re-start his music career.",
      "Marcus Johnstone, who is a criminal defence solicitor specialising in sexual offences, explains: \"Winning a criminal case [and being found not guilty] is often not the end, but the start of the real problem actually.\"",
      "\"Celebrities in particular experience being 'cancelled' when they find themselves accused of a sex crime.\"",
      "\"They go from hero to zero overnight.\"",
      "In predicting how any Slowthai comeback could be received, it may be useful to look at similar cases.",
      "In 2019, JLS star Oritse Williams stood trial accused of raping a woman in his hotel room after a concert in Wolverhampton.",
      "Williams stressed in court that the encounter had been entirely consensual - and was unanimously acquitted after just two hours of jury deliberations.",
      "Two years later, JLS reformed for a 29-date comeback tour that saw the band perform to a more than 350,000 people.",
      "The musician, who has also released his own solo music since being acquitted, has seen his career climb back to, and even possibly exceed, its previous heights since his trial five years ago.",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the English singer-songwriter Rex Orange County.",
      "The musician was widely regarded as a darling of modern indie music, and had released critically acclaimed albums that reached the top ten in both the UK and US charts, before being charged with six counts of sexual assault in 2022.",
      "All charges against him were dropped later that year, but the singer decided to take a two-year hiatus from music - which ended earlier this year with the release of his fifth studio album, The Alexander Technique.",
      "The album has failed to garner anywhere near as much interest as his previous efforts though, spending just one week in the UK album chart and only reaching 151 in the US.",
      "Despite seeing off the charges, Rex Orange County thus far appears to have failed to shake-off his \"cancelled\" tag and reignite his career.",
      "The stories of Oritse Williams and Rex Orange County may guide what Slowthai does next with his career - but only the general public will determine the outcome of his comeback.",
      "Marcus Johnstone says he feels there \"may be some hope\" for the Northampton-based rapper.",
      "\"His attraction is to a certain demographic who may not see the need to 'cancel' him,\" he says.",
      "He adds that Slowthai's future song writing will be \"inspired by what he has endured\".",
      "In his 2021 song CANCELLED, Slowthai asked: \"How you gonna cancel me?\"",
      "\"Said I won't come back, I must be cancer, ain't got much longer, then I made a comeback,\" he rapped on the song.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 02:22:49 GMT",
    "summary": "The British actress has reunited with Mike Leigh for a film that could score her an Oscar nomination.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly three decades after being nominated for an Oscar, British actress Marianne Jean-Baptiste is back in the awards race thanks to a tremendous performance in director Mike Leigh's new drama, Hard Truths.",
      "The 57-year-old jokes she feels \"older and wider\" (rather than wiser) this time around - a line she credits to co-star Michele Austin, who plays her on-screen sister.",
      "But waistlines aside, her reunion with Leigh, whom she first worked with on 1996's Secrets & Lies, has prompted some of the most positive reviews of her career.",
      "Hard Truths centres on Pansy, a woman who is constantly grumpy and miserable, and the impact her unspoken depression has on those around her.",
      "It would be unfair to call the film a comeback for Jean-Baptiste, because she has been working tirelessly in the intervening years. But her second collaboration with Leigh has led to renewed attention on the film awards circuit.",
      "\"It's kind of a full circle moment, rather than a comeback,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "\"It's very interesting, because the first time, I was not aware at all that we were even in an Oscar race. You've got to remember, in 1996, there was still a huge independent film presence in the United States.",
      "\"At that time, we weren't that aware of the whole Oscar thing. It was something that happened over there,\" she says, gesturing far away, \"with really big stars. So it really was not on our radar.\"",
      "Having won the top prize at Cannes, it was only when Secrets & Lies played at the New York Film Festival four months later that Jean-Baptiste became more aware of the awards buzz. \"I hadn't even heard of the Golden Globes at that point,\" she recalls.",
      "\"We were just talking about the film, doing loads of interviews, we were just knackered from all the plane rides, so there was a naivety to it the first time.",
      "\"Now we have the internet and it's become more of an aggressive pursuit of those awards. The campaigning process has changed quite a lot. Or maybe it hasn't and we just weren't aware of it back then.\"",
      "Leigh and Jean-Baptiste have \"kept in touch over the years\", she explains - which ultimately led to their second project together.",
      "Hard Truths has been praised for its hard-hitting but nuanced depiction of depression and complex family dynamics.",
      "There is humour in many of the scenes as Pansy starts arguments with pretty much everyone she encounters, from her closest relatives to her dentist. The man in the car park who asks if she's leaving gets it with both barrels.",
      "But there is something deeper going on. Although the word \"depression\" isn't mentioned in the film, it's clear Pansy is struggling.",
      "\"Yeah, it's not spoken,\" Jean-Baptiste says. \"And the interesting thing about that is the whole family, everyone that she comes into contact with, other than her sister, just sort of gets on with it.",
      "\"It's under the surface. 'Oh, it's just Pansy.' And so many people live like that, where you have somebody that's really difficult, and nobody says to them, 'Man, what is it? What's really going on?' You just sort of avoid them.\"",
      "On paper, it might sound like fun for an actor to play such a juicy, bad-tempered character. But Jean-Baptiste's performance reveals something much more complex.",
      "\"People have asked if it was cathartic, the chance to just spew. But no, it wasn't like that,\" she says. \"I felt the very real pain, anxiety and fear. There was not a lot of enjoyment to be had in that.",
      "\"And also, Pansy comes from a generation where you're taught to just get on with things. It's like the pre-Oprah generation, self-help - it's before all that. You just went, 'I feel rubbish, but I've got to do the laundry.' You get up and you get on with it.\"",
      "'Raw and realistic'",
      "In her review of Hard Truths, Carla Hay of Culture Mix said Jean-Baptiste \"gives a fierce and complex performance\", describing it as \"a raw and realistic portrayal of how toxic anger and untreated mental illness can affect a family\".",
      "\"Even at its funniest, Hard Truths finds Marianne Jean-Baptiste channelling an anger that feels excruciatingly real,\" wrote Slant's Cole Kronman.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's Jon Frosch noted that Leigh \"pushes the bounds of our empathy and asks us to look, really look, at someone from whom we'd surely avert our gaze if we had the misfortune of crossing her path in real life\".",
      "Leigh famously spends several months rehearsing, and crafts his script based on improvisation sessions with the actors.",
      "\"Basically, the process is to create a character from scratch,\" Jean-Baptiste explains. \"Their first memory, their education, house they grew up in, family members, neighbours, where the local park was. Minute detail.\"",
      "The actors are then introduced to one another to build their characters' relationships. \"We do all sorts of exercises to establish the family routines and the traditions. We do improvisations based on, 'What's Sunday dinner like?'\"",
      "By the time shooting begins, the script is firmly in place. \"Nothing is ever improvised on camera,\" she explains. \"So we rehearse it and rehearse it.\"",
      "Oscars record",
      "Jean-Baptiste is speaking to BBC News the morning after the British Independent Film Awards, where she won best lead performance, one of several early accolades she has picked up.",
      "If she is ultimately shortlisted by Hollywood's Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on 17 January, Jean-Baptiste could become the first black British woman to receive two Oscar nominations for acting.",
      "Coincidentally, Wicked's Cynthia Erivo is also a contender for best actress - meaning she could match that record, after also being nominated in 2020.",
      "\"I guess it's a sign of progress, and I think it's all great,\" Jean-Baptiste reflects. \"It's recognition for a job well done, I guess.\"",
      "Four black actresses from the US have previously scored two Academy nominations - Whoopi Goldberg, Angela Bassett, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer.",
      "Jean-Baptiste agrees strides have been made on diversity nearly a decade on from the OscarsSoWhite movement, but notes that the real issue is whether the work is available in the first place.",
      "\"I think [awards bodies] are trying. It's always going to come back down to opportunity, though,\" she says.",
      "\"If the films aren't being made that feature black women [or] Asian women in the lead role, then they don't even stand a chance of being nominated.",
      "\"So we always have to come back to the opportunities in the first place, the work being made, the stories being told.\"",
      "Notably, Jean-Baptiste now lives in Los Angeles - a place many British actors have moved to for the sake of their careers.",
      "\"Well, I was being offered work out there, so it made sense actually, because in the end I left to do a job that would require me to be there for an extended amount of time,\" she explains, referring to her 2000s TV police drama Without A Trace.",
      "\"Because that show went on for seven years. I'd been flying back and forth for the first year or two of the show, and then it was like, you know what, this is a lot. It's a long flight just for a weekend.\"",
      "When she's back in the UK, she relishes the chance to catch up on British theatre and read books on the London Underground (\"You have to drive in LA, so it's books on tape\").",
      "For now, though, her focus is on Hard Truths, which will be released in the UK on 31 January. Jean-Baptiste hopes viewers ultimately leave the film with \"a bit more compassion for people, difficult people\".",
      "\"Not to avoid them, necessarily, but just sort of ask your aunt what's going on, and if there's something you can do to help. Don't assume you're going to be berated for doing it.\"",
      "Older and wider, we all begrudgingly are. But Marianne Jean-Baptiste is clearly quite a lot wiser, too.",

      "\"The Superman story has the history and pedigree to be a hit in today's market,\" he told BBC News. \"It's a 'classic' and will be taken seriously by both superhero fanatics and broader fans.",

      "\"So they were there to witness some of that, but then we would hug or they would bring me cups of tea.\"",
      "Jolie added that it was \"a new way\" of finding out how to be honest with her children about her feelings, \"in an even greater way\".",
      "Written by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight, the film focuses on Callas's final years, in the 1970s, when she was living in Paris.",
      "With Jolie taking on acting roles relatively infrequently in recent years, the film has provided something of a comeback narrative for her and could lead to an Oscar nomination for best actress.",
      "Callas was a US-born Greek soprano, and one of opera's best-known singers.",
      "In Maria, a blend of Jolie's own voice and original recordings by Callas are used in the singing scenes.",

      "Training took around seven months, she said.",
      "\"We started with regular singing classes and it was challenging in many ways, but when the opera classes began, what it requires with your breathwork and your body and just the force of what you push through yourself, it's just a very different physicality.\"",

      "\"It was probably one of the areas in my life that I was hesitant,\" she said.",
      "But she indicated that it was also something she enjoyed.",
      "\"One of the greatest privileges of being an actor is you often are supported by a crew to try something and explore something you've never done and this certainly was most challenging,\" she said.",
      "Jolie's sons Maddox, 23, and Pax, 21, have worked on a number of productions with her before, including her film Without Blood.",
      "Both of them accompanied her at the New York City premiere of Maria in September, alongside their younger sister Zahara.",

      "\"It's always good for your children to watch your mum not do something easily, but swear and fight and fail and have to try again,\" she said.",
      "\"So that's an important and beautiful thing.\"",

      "The film has received mixed reviews, although critics have generally praised its central performance.",
      "\"Jolie is absolutely spellbinding as Maria Callas, imbuing her with grace and resolve,\" said Sophia Ciminello of AwardsWatch. \"She doesn't disappear into the role, she transcends.\"",
      "Time's Stephanie Zacharek was less keen on her performance, however, saying Jolie \"plays her subject as haughtily cool and deeply insecure, but captures none of her imperious charisma\".",

      "One of her most famous performances was as Tosca, in Covent Garden, in 1964.",
      "But vocal decline, possibly caused by dramatic weight loss, led to the premature end of her career.",
      "She spent her last years living largely in isolation, and died of a heart attack aged 53.",

      "Giving the AI extra details about other background risk factors, such as the patient's age, sex and whether they already have high blood pressure and or are overweight, can improve the predictive power, says lead researcher Dr Fu Siong Ng.",
      "He told BBC News: \"It is already quite good just with the ECG data, but it is even better when you add in those.\"",
      "An ECG (electrocardiogram) records and can reveal problems with the electrical activity of the heart, including the rate and rhythm.",

      "\"It's not as simple as saying it's this or that bit of the ECG. It's looking at a combination of subtle things.\"",
      "As part of the trial up to 1,000 patients at both hospitals will have ECG scans read by the AI system to see if it helps detect and predict disease.",
      "It's not something that will be offered to routinely yet, although the experts hope it could be rolled out more widely on the NHS. That could take five years or more, says Dr Ng.",

      "\"Type 2 diabetes is a rapidly growing health challenge that increases the risk of developing heart disease, however with the right support it is possible for people to reduce their risk of developing the condition. We look forward to seeing how this technology could be incorporated into clinical practice.\"",
      "Dr Faye Riley from Diabetes UK said: \u201cType 2 diabetes often goes undiagnosed, sometimes for many years. With 1.2 million people in England alone unaware they're living with the condition and millions more at high risk of developing it, identifying those at risk early on is crucial.",

      "Type 2 diabetes is a common condition where the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood becomes too high.",

      "The responding NHS trusts invoiced a total of \u00a3223m for such treatments over the five-year period, but \u00a3112m was subsequently written off as bad debt.",
      "Though emergency and GP services remain free for everyone, trusts are required to bill for other types of non-urgent treatment for patients who do not ordinarily reside in the UK and charge at 150% of standard NHS rates.",
      "This premium is meant to cover the administrative burden of identifying patients and pursuing payment.",
      "While aimed at tackling \"health tourism\", the charging system has exemptions for vulnerable groups including asylum seekers and trafficking victims.",
      "But hospitals often struggle to recover costs, particularly when patients return overseas.",

      "Mauritius's deputy prime minister has hinted that negotiations with the UK over  the future of the Chagos Islands are being held up over the amount of money involved.",
      "Under the terms of the original agreement, which was announced in October, the UK would relinquish sovereignty to Mauritius over the archipelago but maintain a 99-year lease for Diego Garcia, home to a major UK-US military airbase.",
      "As part of the deal, the UK said it would provide a package of financial support to Mauritius, including annual payments and infrastructure investment, but neither side has said how much is involved.",
      "However a new government in Mauritius, elected since the agreement was first made, has said it wants to see some changes.",
      "The proposed deal has also attracted criticism in the UK, with the opposition Conservative party calling it a \"monumental failure of statecraft\".",
      "When the agreement was first made public after years of talks, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the then Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth called it a \"seminal moment in our relationship and a demonstration of our enduring commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes and the rule of law\".",

      "In a joint statement issued on Friday, the UK and Mauritius said they were committed \"to finalising a treaty as quickly as possible\" that included both the \"secure and effective operation of the existing base on Diego Garcia and that Mauritius is sovereign over the archipelago\".",
      "They added that \"ongoing conversations\" were productive.",
      "The new Mauritian government, elected in a landslide last month, has not been explicit in public about what exactly its problems with the deal were.",
      "But talking to his constituents on Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Paul B\u00e9renger spoke about the money involved.",
      "\"This base existed on our land, on our territory... but not only it is [about] our sovereignty. There are some things you can't accept if you're a true patriot. They are trying to make us sign and they are quibbling on a small amount,\" he said.",
      "Speaking in parliament last week about the negotiations B\u00e9renger admitted that Mauritius needs \"money to get out of the economic mess the previous government got us into, but not at any price, not under any conditions\".",
      "Addressing MPs on Friday, Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam said that the UK was keen to complete the deal \"before [Donald] Trump swears in as president on 20 January\".",
      "Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, has described the deal as a threat to US security.",
      "Last week in the UK's House of Commons, Shadow Foreign Secretary Dame Priti Patel accused the Labour government of putting the UK's national security at risk, ignoring the interests of Chagossians, and \"letting our standing go into freefall\" in an increasingly dangerous world.",
      "\"How much is the British taxpayer going to be liable for each year, and in total, over 99 years?\" she asked.",
      "Foreign Office Minister Stephen Doughty  insisted the deal would enhance, not damage UK security, saying it would protect the military base's operation and ensure it was \"on a safe footing well into the next century\".",
      "In recent years, the UK has faced rising diplomatic isolation over its claim to what it refers to as the British Indian Ocean Territory, with various United Nations bodies - including its top court and general assembly - overwhelmingly siding with Mauritius and demanding the UK surrender what some have called its \"last colony in Africa\".",
      "The government of Mauritius has long argued that it was illegally forced to give the Chagos Islands away in return for its own independence from the UK in 1968.",
      "Until very recently, the UK insisted that Mauritius itself had no legitimate claim to the islands.",

      "A government spokesperson said: \"Over one million pensioners will still receive the winter fuel payment, and our drive to boost pension credit take-up has seen applications more than double with over 40,000 more pensioners now receiving it, as well as the winter fuel payment.",
      "\"We continue to urge anyone who thinks they may be entitled to pension credit to check now, as all eligible claims can be backdated, and anyone who makes a successful claim before December 21 will receive their payment.\""

    "story": [
      "Government borrowing fell in November as more money was raised from taxes and less was spent on the country's debt interest payments, according to official figures.",

      "November's borrowing figure was down by \u00a33.4bn from the same month last year and below expectations of around \u00a313bn.",

      "Dennis\u202fTatarkov, senior economist at KPMG UK, added the government had some \"temporary respite\" due to lower interest repayments, but warned the trend was \"unlikely to last as actual and projected inflation has moved up in recent months\".",
      "Retail sales rose 0.2% in November after a 0.7% fall in October, but a rise in sales at supermarkets was partly offset by a fall in clothing sales, the ONS said.",
      "However, its latest survey period did not cover the official Black Friday date of 29 November.",
      "The latest economic figures come after the Bank of England voted to hold interest rates on Thursday, stating it thought the UK economy had performed worse than expected, with no growth at all between October and December.",
      "The Bank downgraded its growth forecast from 0.3% for the final three months of 2024, to zero growth.",
      "The growth revisions were seen as a blow to Labour, which has made growing the economy its top priority.",
      "Other figures released this week showed inflation hit 2.6% in the year to November, above the Bank's 2% target.",

      "Nick Stowe, chief executive of Monsoon Accessorize, said retailers had \"seen quite soft demand\" due to low consumer confidence, hitting clothes shops."

    "story": [
      "It's been a markedly turbulent year on Scotland's frequently bonkers political scene, and for none more than John Swinney.",
      "As recently as April this year, the SNP veteran was a humble backbencher at Holyrood, beginning to contemplate whether he might stand down in 2026.",
      "But then came Humza Yousaf's self-inflicted downfall, which thrust Mr Swinney back into government.",
      "He was back on the campaign trail as his party suffered one of the worst electoral reverses in its history - a result he says could have easily been a wipeout.",
      "And now he insists the SNP is back on the front foot and striding towards a Holyrood vote - where he says he'll seek a full term, to be first minister until 2031.",
      "The first minister spoke to BBC Scotland's Podlitical podcast to go behind the scenes on the big moments of 2024.",
      "The SNP was not in a happy place at the turn of the year.",
      "Humza Yousaf came into office after a fractious leadership contest, and it felt like events were against him at every turn.",
      "Every time he planned a big announcement, Police Scotland seemed to scoop him with a fresh twist in Operation Branchform, the inquiry into the SNP's funding and finances.",
      "Mr Yousaf was also keen to allow more debate around the direction of the SNP, in a break from the very tight circle run by his predecessor Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "But it led to constant questions and rebellions over policy, with some contentious proposals being dropped, and particular debate about the party's partnership in government with the Greens.",
      "Mr Yousaf ultimately showed them the door in unceremonious fashion, and within days the Greens made clear they could help return the favour via a confidence vote in Holyrood.",
      "The first minister had to go. And with the SNP teetering on the brink, it turned to John Swinney.",
      "He was seen as taking the job - one he had decided not to run for a year earlier - out of loyalty to his party, rather than personal ambition.",
      "He accepts that his \"sense of duty prevailed\" - \"I felt I had to come back in and strengthen and rebuild my party and its reputation with the public\".",
      "The scale of the problem was immediately clear when a general election was called just weeks later.",
      "Mr Swinney described watching the exit poll come in - delivering the news that the SNP was to lose most of its seats - and thinking \"this could actually have been worse\".",
      "\"The conditions that I inherited, we could quite easily have been wiped out,\" he said. \"I don't think it would have taken much for that to have happened, when you look at the vote shares and all that went on.\"",
      "This isn't to escape the gravity of the result - being slashed from 48 seats to nine was \"an absolutely colossal setback\".",
      "But Mr Swinney always felt he could pick up the pieces.",
      "\"That's why my party turned to me,\" he said. \"They knew if there was one person on the planet who could turn things around for the SNP, it was John Swinney.\"",
      "That kind of bullishness might seem more in the vein of Alex Salmond than John Swinney.",
      "Mr Swinney served as his right-hand man before having a similar role under Nicola Sturgeon.",
      "But he says his plans for his own leadership were inspired more by conversations with backbenchers - including Lib Dem Willie Rennie.",
      "The two spoke for \"quite a while\" on the fringes of a gender reform debate at Holyrood which went on deep into the night, and Mr Swinney says he had a vivid realisation that he had got out of the habit of even talking to opposition MSPs.",
      "He had more time for such chats during his period on the back benches, and on returning to government was \"determined I wasn't going to lose that important understanding of the need to connect\".",
      "Running a minority administration, Mr Swinney knows he needs to build bridges and find common ground with opponents in order to get anything done.",
      "But that doesn't mean there's no time for politics.",
      "The draft budget was the culmination of a period of furious manoeuvring between the SNP and Labour, two parties fighting for a very similar voter base and which view each other as their key electoral rival.",
      "It marked a major shift in tone from the government, and potentially of momentum in parliament.",
      "In September, Finance Secretary Shona Robison set out huge in-year cuts to balance the books, talking gloomily about austerity.",
      "Two months later she was announcing eye-catching new initiatives, and pitching a message of \"hope\".",
      "An injection of cash from the Treasury was doubtless pivotal, but Mr Swinney says the \"really tough stuff\" that had to be done in September got the government to a position of sustainability from which they could make more policy choices.",
      "The most striking choice was a promise to mitigate the two-child cap on benefit payments, something ministers had long bemoaned while insisting they had neither the power nor the funding to reverse it.",
      "The announcement was added to the budget so late in the day that the Scottish Fiscal Commission didn't have time to cost it; the watchdog termed it a \"fiscal risk\".",
      "Mr Swinney rejected the notion that the plan had been drafted in at the last moment because the original \"rabbit out of the hat\" - a reinstatement of a winter fuel payment for pensioner households - had to be released a week early.",
      "He said the team drawing up the budget, with himself and his deputy Kate Forbes \"very close to the construction\" along with the finance secretary Shona Robison, were looking for steps that would make the \"maximum impact\" on child poverty.",
      "\"We kept on feeling there wasn't enough there,\" he said, and \"we came to the conclusion that we had to add that into the programme\".",
      "The announcement left Labour in a spin.",
      "It ended a period of several years where the SNP seemed to be in the bunker; ditching controversial policies, desperately trying to scrape together the funds to keep expensive existing pledges afloat, and pitching very little that was new or notable.",
      "Nicola Sturgeon's former chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, said there had been a \"clear statement that the SNP has remembered that being in government enables it to drive the political agenda in Scotland\".",
      "Mr Swinney insists that the SNP is \"back on the front foot, and intend to stay there\".",
      "That will not be straightforward, because many of the pressures facing the party have not gone away.",
      "Operation Branchform will wrap up at some point, one way or another.",
      "The SNP is still short on cash, even more so following the general election catastrophe, and is gutting its HQ of staff.",
      "Mr Swinney still heads a minority administration, one short on goodwill in parliament.",
      "Former flagship policies have run aground - it is only a matter of time until the National Care Service is scrapped, once an excuse to blame the opposition presents itself.",
      "The first test of Mr Swinney's outreach programme will be the votes on the budget in February.",
      "He intends to hit the road in January to \"communicate the advantages of the budget to the public, to make sure the public exert pressure on parliament\" and vote for it.",
      "Appealing to the public is of course a handy thing to do in advance of an election campaign.",
      "Mr Swinney accepts that he might have stood down in 2026, had he remained on the back benches.",
      "Humza Yousaf has announced he is doing just that, making way for a \"new generation\" at the age of 39.",
      "His successor meanwhile will now be pitching himself to serve a full term as first minister, until 2031 - the year he will turn 67.",
      "Mr Swinney says he has been re-energised by what he terms a \"sabbatical year\" - saying that \"the best thing that happened to me was standing down and having a year out of the front line\".",
      "It provided time for parkruns in Perth, walks in the hills and standing on the side of pitches watching his son play hockey.",
      "He says this was a chance to \"totally recharge physically and mentally\", and insists that even after 27 years at Westminster and Holyrood he is absolutely up for another seven years in high office.",
      "That will require the support of voters - and it will need to be overwhelming support if Mr Swinney is to achieve his ultimate political goal, of Scottish independence.",
      "The constitutional question, so vital for the past decade, seems becalmed after the general election result.",
      "That defeat followed one in the Supreme Court, which meant the levers which could trigger independence seem largely outwith the first minister's hands.",
      "After years of head-scratching about ways to force the issue, Mr Swinney insists he doesn't want to get \"bogged down in process\".",
      "But some within the movement remain concerned that means there is no plan, no route map to follow through to independence.",
      "After years of talk of \"de facto referendums\" and complex solutions, Mr Swinney says there is a \"hard reality\" - \"independence will not come about unless enough folk in Scotland want it to happen\".",
      "He says he is focused on delivering good government, to make the case that Holyrood is capable of running its own affairs.",
      "And that is a task that Mr Swinney insists he is not just enjoying, but \"loving\" every moment of."

    "summary": "The US wants the app to be sold or banned because of what it says are links to the Chinese state.",
    "story": [
      "The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear last-ditch legal arguments from TikTok as to why it should not be banned or sold in the US.",
      "The US government is taking action against the app because of what it says are its links to the Chinese state - links which TikTok and its parent company ByteDance have denied.",
      "The Supreme Court justices did not act on a request by TikTok for an emergency injunction against the law, but will instead allow TikTok and ByteDance to make their case on 10 January - nine days before the ban is due to take effect.",
      "Earlier in December, a federal appeals court rejected an attempt to overturn the legislation, saying it was \"the culmination of extensive, bipartisan action by the Congress and by successive presidents\".",
      "When and why could the US ban TikTok?",
      "The Supreme Court is the highest legal authority in the US, and the decision to take on TikTok's case is significant as it only hears 100 or so cases a year out of the more than 7,000 petitions it receives.",
      "TikTok had previously argued that the attempt to ban it was unconstitutional because it would impact the free speech of its users in the country.",
      "TikTok said Wednesday it was pleased with the Supreme Court's order.",
      "\"We believe the Court will find the TikTok ban unconstitutional so the over 170 million Americans on our platform can continue to exercise their free speech rights,\" a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement to the BBC.",
      "The appeal sets up a clash between free speech and national security, according to University of Richmond law professor Carl Tobias.",
      "\"The appeals court found that national security was stronger than the First Amendment contentions. However, the Justices will scrutinize the potentially conflicting, but significant, values,\" Mr Tobias said in an email.",
      "While it is difficult to predict the outcome, Cornell professor Sarah Kreps said it would be surprising to the court to overturn the prior rulings and go against the wills of both congress and the White House.",
      "\"The case has already gone through the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the lower court, all of which upheld the argument that TikTok's ownership by China-based ByteDance poses a national security risk,\" Dr Kreps said.",
      "Will Trump intervene?",
      "TikTok's future does not just hang on the legal process, however - Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election may also hand it a lifeline.",
      "He met TikTok boss Shou Zi Chew on Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported, citing sources familiar with the meeting.",
      "Trump has publicly said he opposes the ban, despite supporting one in his first term as president.",
      "But he will not take office until 20 January, the day after the deadline for TikTok to be banned or sold.",
      "\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, because I won youth by 34 points,\" he claimed at a press conference on Monday - though a majority of 18 to 29-year-olds backed his opponent Kamala Harris.",
      "\"There are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that,\" he said.",
      "But despite Trump's support, senior Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, urged the Supreme Court to reject TikTok's bid.",
      "In a brief filed to the court, he called the firm's arguments \"meritless and unsound.\"",
      "TikTok has the backing of some civil liberties organisations however.",
      "A group of them have made a joint filing to the court urging it to block the banning of a platform which they argue \"millions use every day to communicate, learn about the world, and express themselves.\"",
      "Kelsey Chickering from market research firm Forrester said Instagram's parent company Meta would be a major beneficiary of ban on TikTok.",
      "\"TikTok is central to a thriving creator economy, and a ban would effectively create a Meta monopoly on short-form video,\" Ms Chickering said, citing a Forrester survey that found 56% of TikTok users would switch to Instagram Reels in that event."

      "This is the third feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "Ovarian cancer is \u201crare, underfunded, and deadly\", says Audra Moran, head of the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance (Ocra), a global charity based in New York.",
      "Like all cancers, the earlier it is detected the better.",
      "Most ovarian cancer starts in the fallopian tubes, so by the time it gets to the ovaries, it may have already spread elsewhere too.",
      "\"Five years prior to ever having a symptom is when you might have to detect ovarian cancer, to affect mortality,\" says Ms Moran.",
      "But new blood tests are emerging that use the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to spot signs of the cancer in its very early stages.",
      "And it's not just cancer, AI can also speed up other blood tests for potentially deadly infections like pneumonia.",
      "Dr Daniel Heller is a biomedical engineer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.",
      "His team have been developed a testing technology which uses nanotubes -  tiny tubes of carbon which are around 50,000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.",
      "About 20 years ago, scientists began discovering nanotubes that can emit fluorescent light.",
      "In the past decade, researchers learned how to change these nanotubes' properties so they respond to almost anything in the blood.",
      "Now it is possible to put millions of nanotubes into a blood sample and have them emit different wavelengths of light based on what sticks to them.",
      "But that still left the question of interpreting the signal, which Dr Heller likens to finding a match for a fingerprint.",
      "In this case the fingerprint is a pattern of molecules binding to sensors, with different sensitivities and binding strengths.",
      "But the patterns are too subtle for a human to pick out.",
      "\"We can look at the data and we will not make sense of it at all,\" he says. \"We can only see the patterns that are different with AI.\"",
      "Decoding the nanotube data meant loading the data into a machine-learning algorithm, and telling the algorithm which samples came from patients with ovarian cancer, and which from people without it.",

      "More AI and Medicine",
      "A big challenge in using AI to develop blood tests for ovarian cancer research is that it is relatively rare, which limits the data for training algorithms.",
      "And much of even that data is siloed in hospitals that treated them, with minimal data sharing for researchers.",
      "Dr Heller describes training the algorithm on available data from just a few 100 patients as a \"Hail Mary pass\".",
      "But he says the AI was able to get better accuracy than the best cancer biomarkers that are available today - and that was just the first try.",
      "The system is undergoing further studies to see if it can be improved using larger sets of sensors, and samples from many more patients. More data can improve the algorithm, just as algorithms for self-driving cars can improve with more testing on the street.",
      "Dr Heller has high hopes for the tech.",
      "\"What we'd like to do is triage all gynaecological disease - so when someone comes in with a complaint, can we give doctors a tool that quickly tells them it's more likely to be a cancer or not, or this cancer than that.\"",
      "Dr Heller says this may be \"three to five years\" away.",
      "It's not just early detection that AI is potentially useful for, it is also speeding up other blood tests.",
      "For a cancer patient, catching pneumonia can be deadly and, as there are around 600 different organisms that can cause pneumonia, doctors have to conduct multiple tests to identify the infection.",
      "But new types of blood tests are simplifying and speeding up the process.",
      "Karuis, based in California uses artificial intelligence (AI) to help identify the precise pneumonia pathogen in 24 hours, and select the right antibiotic for it.",
      "\u201cBefore our test, a patient with pneumonia would have 15 to 20 different tests to identify their infection in just in their first week in hospital - that's about $20,000 in testing,\u201d says Karius chief executive Alec Ford.",
      "Karius has a database of microbial DNA which has tens of billions of data points. Test samples from patients can be compared to that database to identify the exact pathogen.",
      "Mr Ford says that would have been impossible without AI.",
      "One challenge is that researchers don\u2019t necessarily currently understand all the connections that an AI might make between the test biomarkers and the diseases.",
      "Over the last two years Dr Slav\u00e9 Petrovski has developed an AI platform called Milton that, using biomarkers in the UK biobank data to identify 120 diseases with a success rate of over 90%.",
      "Finding patterns in such a mass of data is only something that AI can do.",
      "\u201cThese are often complex patterns, where there may not be one biomarker, but you have to take into consideration the whole pattern,\u201d says Dr Petrovski, whose is a researcher at pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca.",
      "Dr Heller uses a similar pattern matching technique in his work on ovarian cancer.",
      "\"We know that the sensor binds and responds to proteins and small molecules in the blood, but we don't know which of the proteins or molecules are specific to cancer,\" he says.",

      "Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said the package was a \"double digit billion amount\" in krone, or at least $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn).",
      "He described the timing of the announcement as an \"irony of fate\". On Monday Trump said ownership and control of the huge island was an \"absolute necessity\" for the US.",
      "Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, is home to a large US space facility and is strategically important for the US, lying on the shortest route from North America to Europe. It has major mineral reserves.",
      "Poulsen said the package would allow for the purchase of two new inspection ships, two new long-range drones and two extra dog sled teams.",
      "It would also include funding for increased staffing at Arctic Command in the capital Nuuk and an upgrade for one of Greenland's three main civilian airports to handle F-35 supersonic fighter aircraft.",
      "\"We have not invested enough in the Arctic for many years, now we are planning a stronger presence,\" he said.",
      "The defence minister did not give an exact figure for the package, but Danish media estimated it would be around 12-15bn krone.",
      "The announcement came a day after Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social: \"For purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\"",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede responded to Trump's comments, saying \"we are not for sale\".",
      "But he added that Greenlanders should continue to be open for cooperation and trade, especially with their neighbours.",
      "Analysts say that the plan has been under discussion for a long time and should not be seen as a direct response to Trump's comments.",
      "Until now Denmark has been very slow to expand its military capacity in Greenland, they say, but if the country is not able to protect waters around the territory against encroachments by China and Russia then US demands for greater control are likely to grow.",
      "Army Maj Steen Kjaergaard of the Danish Defence Academy suggests it may have been Trump's intention to pressure Denmark into such a move.",
      "\"It is likely to be sparked by the renewed Trump focus on the need for air and maritime control around Greenland and the internal developments in Greenland where some are voicing a will to look towards the US \u2013 a new international airport in Nuuk was just inaugurated,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"I think Trump is smart\u2026 he gets Denmark to prioritise its Arctic military capabilities by raising this voice, without having to take over a very un-American welfare system,\" he added, referring to Greenland's heavy dependence on subsidies from Copenhagen.",
      "Trump's original suggestion in 2019 that the US acquire Greenland, which is the world's largest island, led to a similarly sharp rebuke from leaders there.",
      "At the time Danish Prime Minister Mette Fredericksen described the idea as \"absurd\", leading Trump to cancel a state trip to the country.",
      "He is not the first US president to suggest buying Greenland. The idea was first mooted during the 1860s under the presidency of Andrew Johnson.",

      "But in recent days he has suggested a more outwardly aggressive approach for his foreign policy.",
      "At first, he joked about Canada being an additional US state. Since, he has threatened to take back control of the Panama Canal. He also reiterated a desire from his first term to own the autonomous Danish territory of Greenland, which is not for sale.",
      "The US is unlikely to take control of any of these regions. But these statements could indicate that Trump's \"America First\" vision includes flexing the superpower's muscle beyond its borders for US trade and national security interests.",
      "On Sunday, Trump told a conservative conference in Arizona that Panama was charging US ships \"ridiculous, highly unfair\" fees to use its namesake canal.",

    "title": "As Biden commutes death row sentences, how Trump plans to expand executions",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 00:58:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of 40 death row inmates, derailing Trump's plan to ramp up executions.",
    "story": [
      "With just weeks left in office, US President Joe Biden has commuted the sentences of 37 of 40 federal death row inmates - potentially thwarting President-elect Donald Trump's plans to expand federal executions during his upcoming administration.",
      "Biden's move was swiftly condemned by Republicans, with some accusing the president of siding with criminals over law-abiding Americans.",
      "Federal executions were relatively rare before Trump's first term in office, which finished with a flurry of executions that ended a 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition.",
      "He has vowed to resume the practice when he returns to the White House in January, setting the stage for possible legal battles early in the administration.",
      "Here's what we know.",
      "Biden's decision criticised",
      "On Monday, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 death row inmates, switching their penalty to life without parole.",
      "Only three inmates were left to face the death penalty, including convicted Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Robert Bowers, who was sentenced to death for killing 11 worshippers and wounding seven during a shooting at a the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018.",
      "The third, Dylann Roof, was sentenced to death in 2017 for a mass shooting that left nine black parishioners dead at the Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.",
      "While the move was widely praised by human rights groups such as Amnesty International, it was quickly condemned by some Republicans, as well as Trump's transition team and political allies.",
      "In a statement, Trump communications director Steven Cheung said that \"these are among the worst killers in the world and this abhorrent decision by Joe Biden is a slap in the face to the victims, their families, and their loved ones.",
      "\"President Trump stands for the rule of law, which will return when he is back in the White House,\" he added. Trump cannot undo the commutations when he returns to the White House next month.",
      "Texas Republican Chip Roy posted on X that the decision was \"unconscionable\" and an abuse of power \"to carry out a miscarriage of justice\".",
      "Another Republican, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, said that \"when given the choice between law-abiding Americans or criminals, Joe Biden and the Democrats choose criminals every time.\"",
      "Some family members also expressed anger.",
      "On Facebook, Heather Turner - whose mother was killed in a 2017 bank robbery - called the commutations a \"gross abuse of power\".",
      "\"At no point did the president consider the victims,\" she wrote. \"He, and his supporters, have blood on their hands.\"",
      "The commutations do not apply to the approximately 2,200 death row inmates convicted by state courts, over which the president holds no authority.",
      "What has Trump said about the death penalty?",
      "Over the course of his election campaign, Trump vowed to resume federal executions and make more people eligible to receive the death penalty, including those convicted of raping children or drug and human-trafficking cases, as well as migrants who kill US citizens or police officers.",
      "\"These are terrible, terrible, horrible people who are responsible for death, carnage and crime all over the country,\" Trump said when he announced his presidential candidacy in 2022.",
      "\"We're going to be asking everyone who sells drugs, gets caught, to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts,\" he added.",
      "There are more than 40 federal laws that can, in theory, result in the death penalty, ranging from murders committed during a drug-related shooting to genocide.",
      "Almost all - with the exception of espionage and treason - explicitly involve the death of a victim.",
      "Trump, however, has provided few details on how he plans to accomplish his campaign pledge.",
      "Despite the lack of clarity, Trump's vows to expand the federal death penalty have elicited strong warnings from human rights advocates.",
      "In an 11 December statement, for example, the American Civil Liberties Union said Trump's \"chilling\" plans amount to an expansion of the \"killing spree he initiated in the final six months of his first presidency\".",
      "\"He's already shown us that he will act on these promises,\" the statement said.",
      "The inmates executed during the waning days of Trump's first administration included Lisa Montgomery, the first woman executed by the federal government since 1953, and Lezmond Mitchell, the only Native American on federal death row.",
      "What can Trump actually do?",
      "US media reported that Trump cannot reverse Biden's commutations.",
      "Trump's efforts to expand the death penalty to crimes that do not involve murder are likely to face legal challenges.",
      "In 2008, for example, the Supreme Court ruled that those convicted of raping children cannot be executed, adding that it's unclear if the death penalty could be applied to crimes in which a victim is not killed.",
      "According to the National Registry of Exonerations, cases with child victims are particularly prone to wrongful convictions, can be \"extremely emotional\" and pit family members against one another.",
      "Any further expansion of crimes that are eligible for the federal death penalty would require Congress to act and change the law.",
      "In 2024, two bills - both sponsored by Florida Republican and Trump ally Anna Paulina Luna - sought to expand the use of capital offences to include possession of child pornography, as well as the trafficking, exploitation and abuse of children.",
      "Both failed to pass in the House of Representatives.",
      "Trump is also unlikely to be able to quickly re-populate the pool of federal death row inmates, as most death penalty cases take years and are subject to lengthy appeals processes.",
      "While he does not have any direct authority over state executions, some experts have warned that Trump's pro-death penalty stance may trigger more executions at a state level.",
      "\"His rhetoric can and has spurred draconian measures and attitudes by leaders in states on several issues, including in the context of the criminal legal system,\" Yasmin Cader, a deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union and director of the Trone Center for Justice and Equality told CNN.",
      "In addition to the federal government and US military, 27 US states still have the death penalty on the books.",
      "A Gallup poll conducted in October found that a slim majority of Americans - 53% - support the death penalty for convicted murderers, up from 50% a year before."

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 10:41:04 GMT",
    "summary": "The report gives fresh details about the former Florida congressman's alleged payments for sex and drugs.",
    "story": [
      "The House Ethics Committee report on Donald Trump ally Matt Gaetz released on Monday revealed fresh details about the former congressman's alleged behaviour, at least one new accusation and insights into the panel's investigation.",
      "From at least 2017 to 2020, the committee concluded that the former Florida congressman regularly paid women for \"engaging in sexual activity\", had sex with a 17-year-old girl, used or possessed illegal drugs, accepted gifts beyond House limits and helped a woman obtain a passport, according to the report.",
      "The 42-year-old was first elected as a Republican member of the US House of Representatives in 2016.",
      "He resigned in November - days before the report was scheduled to be made public and after Trump announced him as his pick for US attorney general. Gaetz withdrew from consideration a week later.",
      "He denied the committee's findings and has accused it of conducting an unfair investigation.",
      "Here are four parts of the much-anticipated report that stand out.",
      "A winding money trail",
      "House investigators said Gaetz paid more than $90,000 (\u00a371,843) to women for sex and drugs, but created a complicated web of transactions that were hard to trace, according to the report.",
      "\"The committee was unable to determine the full extent to which Representative Gaetz's payments to women were compensation for engaging in sexual activity with him,\" the report found.",
      "He allegedly used his friend Joel Greenberg, currently serving 11 years in prison for crimes he said he committed with Gaetz, as a frequent go-between and logged onto Greenberg's account on SeekingArrangement.com, which bills itself as a \"luxury dating site\", to interact with young women.",
      "Gaetz also paid women directly, sometimes through platforms such as Venmo, according to the report. But the committee said he often used another person's PayPal account or an account linked to an email address with a fake name.",
      "He also obscured payments, the panel wrote. In one example, he gave a college student a cheque made out to \"cash\" with \"tuition reimbursement\" in the memo line. The woman said she received it after a group encounter, which \"could potentially be a form of coercion because I really needed the money\".",
      "Gaetz has posted on social media that he gave money to women he was involved with as gifts, not payments. The committee found that two women, aged 27 and 25, did not consider their relationships transactional.",
      "Another woman who was considered his girlfriend invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when asked if she was given money for sex or drugs, or to pay others.",
      "The committee attempted to prove Gaetz frequently paid for sex through evidence such as a text message where he reportedly balked at a woman's request that he send her money after he accused her of \"ditching\" him one night. The woman then asserted she was \"treated differently\" than other women he was paying for sex.",
      "In another message, his then-girlfriend said that he and Greenberg were \"a little limited in their cash flow\" and asked a group of women \"if it can be more of a customer appreciation week\".",
      "A few months later, according to the committee, she wrote: \"Btw Matt also mentioned he is going to be a bit generous cause of the 'customer appreciation' thing last time.\"",
      "As a Congressman, Gaetz earned $174,000 (\u00a3138,843) a year.",
      "His net worth is greater: On his most recent federal financial disclosure filed in August, he reported owning assets worth at least $575,000. His father Don Gaetz, who co-founded hospice provider Vitas Healthcare, has a fortune of about $35m, Forbes reported.",
      "Sex, drugs, and a passport application",
      "The committee also said Gaetz bought illegal drugs or reimbursed people for them.",
      "It gives examples of his alleged cocaine and ecstasy/MDMA use, but focused on what appeared to be a heavy marijuana habit. He allegedly asked women to bring marijuana cartridges to meetings and events, and created the fake-name email account to buy marijuana.",
      "A trip he took to the Bahamas \"was paid for by an associate of Representative Gaetz with connections to the medical marijuana industry, who allegedly also paid for female escorts to accompany them\", according to the report.",
      "One woman felt the use of drugs and alcohol at parties had impaired her ability \"to really know what was going on or fully consent\".",
      "\"Indeed, nearly every woman that the committee spoke with could not remember the details of at least one or more of the events they attended with Representative Gaetz and attributed that to drug or alcohol consumption,\" the report said.",
      "His then-girlfriend, who was 21 when they met and \"was paid tens of thousands of dollars\" during their two-year relationship\", often participated in encounters with women and acted as an intermediary, according to the report.",
      "A woman who told the committee she was 17 at the time she had sex with Gaetz twice at a party in 2017 - at least once in front of other people -  while under the influence of ecstasy. The woman, who had just completed her junior year in high school, then received $400 from him.",
      "She also told the panel she did not tell Gaetz she was a minor and the committee did not find any evidence that the former congressman knew she was underage.",
      "The age of consent in Florida is 18, although a 16 or 17 year-old can legally consent to sexual conduct with a person between the ages of 16 and 23. Gaetz turned 35 in 2017.",
      "The Department of Justice investigated an allegation that he had sex with a minor, but ultimately did not file any criminal charges against him.",
      "In 2021, Greenberg pleaded guilty to sex trafficking the girl. According to his plea agreement, Greenberg paid for sex acts with the minor and introduced her to other adult men who engaged in commercial sex acts with her.",
      "Gaetz also allegedly directed his chief of staff to expedite a passport application for a woman he was sleeping with, whom he said was a voter in his district. He also allegedly gave her $1,000.",
      "Gaetz violated House rules that bar using his position for special favours, according to the committee, which wrote: \"The woman was not his constituent, and the case was not handled in the same manner as similar passport assistance cases\".",
      "Accusations of obstruction",
      "The committee dedicated a great deal of the report to detailing how Gaetz allegedly obstructed its investigation, including failing to produce evidence he said would \"exonerate\" him.",
      "The report concluded he \"continuously sought to deflect, deter, or mislead the Committee in order to prevent his actions from being exposed\".",
      "Gaetz, who has accused the committee of being \"weaponised\" against him and leaking information to the press, alleged the panel was working on behalf of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, according to the report. Last year he helped lead an effort to oust then-Speaker McCarthy from his role.",
      "While Gaetz claimed he had \"voluntarily produced tens of thousands of records,\" he gave the committee \"only a couple hundred records, more than 90% of which was either irrelevant or publicly available,\" the report found.",
      "One sore point was a trip to the Bahamas, where the committee said he withheld information. Ultimately it concluded he violated rules on gifts because the trip was too high in value.",
      "The committee also cited the Justice Department's probe into the allegations against Gaetz as a reason for delays.",
      "Some witnesses asked the committee to use statements they had given to the department, but it refused to share them because they had not issued charges and because it said it could deter future witnesses in other cases from coming forward.",
      "Committee chairman dissents",
      "The report ends with a single-page statement  from Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Guest \"on behalf of dissenting committee members\" who are not named.",
      "Those members do not challenge the committee's findings, but disagree with releasing the report after Gaetz resigned from the House, which has not happened since 2006, they write.",
      "It \"breaks from the Committee's long-standing practice, opens the Committee to undue criticism, and will be viewed by some as an attempt to weaponise the Committee's process\".",
      "Gaetz paid 'tens of thousands' for sex and drugs, ethics report says"

      "In fact, India's music concerts generated about 8bn rupees ($94.1m; \u00a375.3m) in revenue last year - a figure that is set to increase by 25% by the end of 2025.",
      "Young, well-to-do Indians are not just willing to pay more to see their favourite music stars, but are actively seeking out these events. In 2023, more than 400,000 people in India said they travelled to other Indian cities to attend live events.",
      "But despite the enthusiasm, many concertgoers say their experience has been far from ideal. The issue made headlines earlier this week, when a diabetic patient with incontinence issues said he ended up soiling himself at a Bryan Adams concert due to unavailability of washrooms at the venue.",
      "On the same day, Dosanjh, who has been on a nationwide tour, shocked his fans by announcing that he wouldn't perform in India again until the infrastructure at concert venues got better. The singer later clarified he was referring to only one of the venues.",
      "Since then, social media has been awash with similar complaints from concertgoers. From booking tickets on dodgy scalping websites for astonishingly high prices, to braving hours-long traffic before and after a show, often on a full bladder, fans say they have to pay with more than just money to see their favourite acts.",
      "Those who have the means are now opting to attend shows in other countries for a safer and generally more fun experience. \"At Adele's concert in Munich, the staff continuously cleaned the toilets and it was super clean even after a three-hour concert,\" says Ishika Goon, a Bengaluru-based lawyer. \"If I have to spend so much money, I might as well go for the full experience.\"",
      "Organisers and promoters acknowledge the problems but say they too are hobbled by wider infrastructural challenges.",
      "That's because India does not have enough venues dedicated to live concerts, forcing them to opt for suboptimal spaces or simply avoid certain cities altogether, all of which prevents the industry from scaling up, says Anmol Kukreja, the co-founder of Skillbox, a live entertainment company that has organised more than 300 concerts.",
      "Unlike a lot of western countries where concert venues are plenty, he says that events in India have to be held in places like malls, sports stadiums or on public land - all of which come with their own limitations and many variables.",
      "A mall might have better toilets and designated parking areas, but it won't necessarily be able to accommodate huge crowds the way a large barren ground located in a far-flung corner of the city with bad connectivity might.",
      "Nowadays, a lot of music events are held inside public stadiums to minimise some of the inconveniences - but that comes with its own challenges, such as poor sound quality, crowd management issues and lots of red tape.",
      "Government-owned venues are more suitable for big events, but the process of booking them can often be a complex \"web of permissions and licences, making them less attractive\", Mr Kukreja says.",
      "To address these gaps, organisers end up spending thousands of dollars on building temporary infrastructure at venues - the stage, temporary bathrooms and parking spaces - before each concert which could incur serious losses, adds Tej Brar, founder of Mumbai-based Third Culture and the director of NH7, one of India's biggest music festivals.",
      "And it's not just business that suffers, the live music scene is impacted too, as a whole segment of smaller and independent artists are left out because they are not \"big enough\" to make people want to pay an exorbitant price to watch them.",
      "\"If they can't pull crowds of more than 10,000 people or more, they usually won't get shows because the economics won't work for the organisers.\"",
      "But of late, even major international music festivals with star-studded line-ups and million-dollar budgets have left fans disappointed.",
      "\"Everything is fine but why can't you have clean toilets?\" asks Sreoshi Mukherjee, a Delhi-based journalist.",
      "Ms Mukherjee, who attends music concerts around the country, was particularly aghast by the lack of washrooms at Lollapalooza and Backstreet Boys, tickets for which cost anywhere between 5,000 ($59; \u00a347) and 10,000 ($118; \u00a394) rupees.",
      "\"There was a point when the loos ran out of both toilet paper and water. We had to actually buy water bottles to relieve ourselves,\" she says.",
      "Criticism against inflated ticket prices turning these events into highbrow cultural experiences meant for only a few has been mounting, but there are other accessibility concerns as well.",
      "Most venues have little to no arrangements for people with disabilities - such as wheelchair access and audio description. At Dosanjh's Chandigarh concert, Ms Kaur said they had to carry their wheelchair-using friend into the venue as there was no ramp or accessibility lane.",
      "The BBC has reached out to the organisers of all the events mentioned in the story for comment.",
      "Others in the business say there can't be a one-size-fits all solution for the problems, but they worry about its longer impact on business. Right now, people are still willing to pay. But persistently poor facilities might change their minds.",
      "\"Word-of-mouth plays a crucial role in event attendance, and negative feedback can be damaging to an organiser's reputation,\" Mr Brar says.",
      "But the onus to fix that, he adds, needs to be shared. \"While the company takes charge of choosing the location and setting ticket prices, the venue should provide fundamental amenities. Adequate washroom facilities and dedicated cleaning staff should be a venue standard.\"",
      "As the country gears up to host big names like Sheeran and Green Day, fans are hoping for a better experience.",
      "And for some, huge crowds and the risk of a potential infection still feels like a small price for seeing their favourite star.",
      "\"There's a thrill to the mess and chaos,\" says Mohammad Sami, a student.",
      "\"It's like you're stuck on an island with hundreds of strangers, united by their determination to survive the night.\""

    "story": [
      "On a hill overlooking the city of Palermo, in Sicily, sits a lesser-known gem of Italian art: the cathedral of Monreale.",
      "Built in the 12th century under Norman rule, it boasts Italy's largest Byzantine-style mosaics, second in the world only to those of Hagia Sophia in Istanbul.",
      "Now, this Unesco World Heritage site has undergone an extensive restoration to bring it back to its former glory.",
      "The Monreale mosaics were meant to impress, humble and inspire the visitor who walked down the central nave, following the fashion of Constantinople, the capital of the surviving Roman empire in the east.",
      "They span over 6,400 sq m and contain about 2.2kg of solid gold.",
      "The restoration lasted over a year, and in that time the cathedral was turned into a bit of a building site, with a maze of scaffolds set up on the altar and transept.",
      "Local experts from the Italian Ministry of Culture led a series of interventions, starting with the removal of a thick layer of dust that had accumulated on the mosaics over the years.",
      "Then they repaired some of the tiles that had lost their enamel and gold leaf, making them look like black spots from down below.",
      "Finally, they intervened in the areas where the tiles were peeling off the wall and secured them.",
      "Working on the mosaics was a challenge and a big responsibility, says Father Nicola Gaglio.",
      "He has been a priest here for 17 years and has followed the restoration closely, not unlike an apprehensive dad.",
      "\"The team approached this work almost on their tiptoes,\" he tells me.",
      "\"At times, there were some unforeseen issues and they had to pause the operations while they found a solution.",
      "\"For example, when they got to the ceiling, they realised that in the past it had been covered with a layer of varnish that had turned yellowish. They had to peel it off, quite literally, like cling film.\"",
      "The mosaics were last partly restored in 1978 , but this time the intervention had a much wider scope and it included replacing the old lighting system.",
      "\"There was a very old system. The light was low, the energy costs were through the roof and in no way it made justice to the beauty of the mosaics,\" says Matteo Cundari.",
      "He's the Country Manager of Zumtobel, the firm that was tasked with installing the new lights.",
      "\"The main challenge was to make sure we'd highlight the mosaics and we'd create something that answers to the various needs of the cathedral,\" he adds.",
      "\"We also wanted to create a completely reversible system, something that could be replaced in 10 or 15 years without damaging the building.\"",
      "This first tranche of works cost 1.1 million euros. A second one, focussing on the central nave, is being planned next.",
      "I ask Fr Gaglio what it was like to see the scaffolding finally come off and the mosaics shine in their new light. He laughs and shrugs.",
      "\"When you see it, you're overwhelmed with awe and you can't really think of anything. It's pure beauty,\" he says.",

      "When Blake Lively, who rose to fame in the 2000s playing Serena van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl, was cast as the main character, fans became even more excited, describing her as the perfect choice to play Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse and winds up in the same position years later.",

      "But despite its financial success, everything wasn't running so smoothly behind the scenes. Rumours of a feud between Baldoni and Lively began swirling before the film was even released.",
      "Last week, Lively filed a legal complaint against her co-star, accusing him of sexual harassment and starting a smear campaign against her, something Baldoni strongly denies. Here is the story so far:",

      "It Ends With Us press tour",
      "For a film about domestic abuse, the press tour for It Ends With Us was probably not what you would have expected. There were pink carpets, flowers galore and the promotion of Lively's new haircare brand and her husband's gin company.",
      "Instead of advocacy on the red carpet, Lively highlighted fashion and florals.",

      "There was a two-star review from The Telegraph's Tim Robey, who called it a \"queasy drama\" that \"repackages domestic violence as slick romance\".",
      "He suggested the film \"splices abuse and glossy courtship in the big city to deeply dubious effects\".",
      "The movie also sparked a debate on TikTok, with some saying that it's not clear from the trailer that this story is about an abusive relationship and rather it appears to be telling a love story.",
      "Based on this misconception, some people said they found the film traumatic as they didn't know it contained scenes of domestic abuse.",
      "'Smear campaign'",
      "During the film's press tour, Baldoni hired a crisis manager, Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake.",
      "Shortly after the press tour, Lively faced a barrage of criticism on social media relating to her comments on that tour as well as from old interviews.",

      "Legal complaint",
      "Four months after the film's launch, Lively filed a legal complaint against Mr Baldoni in which she accused him of sexual harassment.",

      "At the meeting, attendees agreed to a list of demands, including Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath making \"no more descriptions of their own genitalia\", requiring an intimacy coordinator on set at all times when Ms Lively was in scenes with Mr Baldoni and no \"friends\" of the producers and directors being on set during scenes when Ms Lively was in a state of nudity.",
      "The list of demands also implied that Mr Baldoni had asked Ms Lively's trainer how much she weighed and alleged that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath had spoken about their \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively.",
      "Plan to 'destroy' reputation",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively also alleges that Mr Baldoni and his team attacked her public image after the meeting.",
      "She accuses him of orchestrating a plan to \"destroy\" her reputation in the press and online, including hiring a crisis manager who led a \"sophisticated, coordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" against her and used a \"digital army\" to post social media content that seemed authentic.",
      "\"To safeguard against the risk of Ms Lively ever revealing the truth about Mr Baldoni, the Baldoni-Wayfarer team created, planted, amplified, and boosted content designed to eviscerate Ms Lively's credibility,\" her team wrote in the filing.",
      "It adds: \"They engaged in the same techniques to bolster Mr Baldoni's credibility and suppress any negative content about him.\"",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively says that this had led to \"substantial harm\" that affected \"all aspects\" of her life.",
      "Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met.",
      "Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\"",
      "Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "Support for Lively",
      "Hollywood stars including America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel have publicly backed Blake Lively after she filed her complaint.",
      "Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel, who starred with Lively in 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, issued a joint statement on Instagram, on Sunday saying they \"stand with her in solidarity\".",
      "\"Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice,\" they wrote.",
      "Colleen Hoover, the author of It Ends With Us, also showed her support, describing Ms Lively as \"honest, kind, supportive and patient\".",
      "Baldoni's award rescinded",
      "Earlier in December, Baldoni was awarded a women's solidarity honour by Vital Voices, a global non-profit organisation that focuses on empowering women.",
      "The organisation has now rescinded the award after the legal complaint filed by Lively alleged \"abhorrent conduct\" by the actor, his studio and a crisis public relations team that it said was \"contrary to the values\" it held.",

      "New Mexico prosecutors have dropped their appeal, ending an effort to\u00a0reinstate charges against Alec Baldwin in connection with the fatal shooting on the set of his movie \"Rust.\"",
      "Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey withdrew the state's appeal, originally filed in November, on Monday, according to a statement from the First Judicial District Attorney's Office.",
      "\"The appeal would have challenged the Court's dismissal of criminal charges against Producer and Actor, Alec Baldwin which included involuntary manslaughter in the tragic shooting of Cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins on the set of\u00a0Rust\u00a0on October 21, 2021,\" the statement said.",
      "The district attorney's office commended Morrissey for her work prosecuting \"two cases of such magnitude and national attention, including the successful prosecution against Hannah Gutierrez Reed,\" the film's armorer, who convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. The DA's office said it \"supports the Hutchins family and their continued fight for justice in civil court.\"",
      "Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, attorneys representing Baldwin, told CBS News in a statement: \"Today's decision to dismiss the appeal is the final vindication of what Alec Baldwin and his attorneys have said from the beginning \u2014 this was an unspeakable tragedy but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. The rule of law remains intact in New Mexico.\"",
      "The decision to drop the appeal solidifies the decision by Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer halfway through trial to dismiss the case following allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Baldwin's trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins' killing. Prosecutors said they deemed the ammo unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin's lawyers say investigators \"buried\" the evidence in a separate case file and filed a successful motion to dismiss.",
      "The district attorney's office said that under state law, the New Mexico attorney general would have carried forward the appeal, but \"did not intend to exhaustively pursue the appeal on behalf of the prosecution.\"",
      "\"As a result, the State's efforts to continue to litigate the case in a fair and comprehensive manner have been met with multiple barriers that have compromised its ability to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law,\" the local prosecutors said.",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, attorney Gloria Allred, representing Halyna Hutchins' parents and sister, who live in Ukraine, condemned the decision to drop the appeal.",
      "\"Even though the criminal justice system and case has now concluded, and Halyna's parents were denied justice in the criminal case, we will continue to fight for justice in our civil lawsuit in New Mexico against Alec Baldwin and the Rust Productions and we will vigorously continue to litigate our case in the civil court in New Mexico,\" she said.",
      "\"We have confidence that a New Mexico jury, if allowed to decide our civil case, would do the right thing and we as their lawyers will do anything and everything that is legally possible and appropriate to win justice for Halyna and her family,\" Allred said.",
      "Hutchins' sister, in a statement read by Allred in a news conference Tuesday, said, \"Mr. Baldwin must be held accountable for my sister's death. He has never contacted our family to apologize or accept any responsibility for my sister's death. We will press forward for a civil lawsuit until there is justice for her loss caused by Mr. Baldwin.\"",
      "Allred said the dismissal of the criminal case shouldn't hurt the family in civil court, noting the different burdens of proof required in criminal and civil trials. She also noted the civil case is focused on \"negligence against Baldwin and the executive producers and crew members involved in the death, which was not part of the criminal case.\"",
      "\"Alec Baldwin said recently that he's looking forward to the truth coming out, so they're looking forward to his testimony under oath as to what his truth fully is,\" Allred said. \"He has not done a deposition under oath and now is able to since what he will testify to now will not criminalize him in New Mexico.\"",
      "The shooting occurred during a rehearsal on the set of the Western film \"Rust,\" in which Baldwin stars and also served as a producer. Baldwin was holding a prop gun that had been loaded with a live round when it discharged, killing Hutchens and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has maintained he never pulled the gun's trigger and did not know it was loaded with a live round, which is prohibited by both industry and union guidelines.",
      "Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was accused of loading the gun, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. She appealed her conviction after the charges against Baldwin were dismissed, but it was upheld by a judge in September.",
      "Prosecutors had also accused Gutierrez-Reed of bringing the live rounds onto the set, but defense lawyers argued the film's ammunition supplier was not properly investigated. Guttierez-Reed maintained she did not know how the gun was loaded with live rounds. She was acquitted of evidence tampering in her trial.",
      "David Halls, the film's safety coordinator, pleaded no contest last year to negligent use of a firearm. He completed six months of unsupervised parole."

      "As the holiday season lights up New York City, few traditions shine brighter than the iconic holiday windows at Bergdorf Goodman. The luxury department store's displays are more than just decorations \u2014 they are works of art.",
      "And the mastermind behind the art is David Hoey, the senior director of visual presentation at Bergdorf Goodman. He has been with the store for more than 20 years and oversees the design of the windows each year.",
      "He noted that there's no school for making window displays, and that it seems no one in the field sets out to do the job \"on purpose.\"",
      "\"We just kind of happened into it,\" he said. \"And we wouldn't wanna do anything else because we're doing a little of everything. We're doing a little theater, a little storytelling, a little advertising, a little fashion.\"",
      "This year's theme is \"Toast of the Town,\" a nod to the 200th anniversary of Fifth Avenue's retail strip. The store's five large windows feature references to iconic elements of the avenue, such as parks, libraries and flagship stores. Hoey's team used a variety of materials, including actual taxi parts, to create scenes that celebrate New York.",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 12:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The visionary director talks about his recent memoir, \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\"; the epic making of his 1982 classic, \"Fitzcarraldo\"; and why he likes playing villains.",
    "story": [
      "Asked if he'd turned his cellphone off, writer-director Werner Herzog said, \"I do not have a cellphone. I don't have to turn off anything. I just want to live and have a real conversation with a real person.\"",
      "Herzog got his wish: An authentic conversation not long ago at his home in the Hollywood Hills.",
      "He is a legitimate filmmaking visionary, in Hollywood and around the world, having directed more than 20 feature films and better than 30 documentaries \u2013 from a journey to the heart of darkness in the Amazon, to a life among grizzlies in the Arctic.",
      "He's put it all into a memoir with a title that's vintage Werner: \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\" (Penguin Press).",
      "\"A title has to somehow jump at you,\" Herzog said. \"When you walk by some books and you see this, you stop: 'Man, what is this?'\"",
      "What it is, is the story of a filmmaker unlike any other. \"Yes, I have experienced a lot, as if I had lived ten times over already,\" he said. \"And that's the beauty of the memoir, is that it's so condensed. When you read it, you will not be bored.\"",
      "Born in Munich, Germany during World War II, Herzog started making films as a teen. He was drawn to characters with impossible dreams: you see it in his 1982 film \"Fitzcarraldo,\" with a longtime collaborator, Klaus Kinski. The character of Fitzcarraldo wants to build an opera house in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. To do it, he needs to haul a steamship up, then down, a mountain.",
      "Herzog said, \"20th Century Fox was interested to finance and produce a film. But they wanted to produce it with a small, plastic replica of a ship in a jungle, a 'good' jungle. And they thought, 'We should do it in the botanic garden in San Diego.' And I said, 'No, it has to be really shot in a big jungle, and big rivers, and everything.'\"",
      "Without the benefit of CGI, Herzog found his big jungle, his big river. He made the astonishing decision to pull a real 320-ton riverboat over a real mountain to the Amazon River on the other side.",
      "I asked, \"It sounds to me like there were moments in 'Fitzcarraldo' where maybe for the first time, and maybe for the only time, that you at least feared that maybe the crew stopped believing in you. Is that true?\"",
      "\"It is true,\" Herzog replied. \"There were moments where it was very precarious. And only my fire within somehow carried us. The strength of my vision carried everyone along, even though many of them did not believe I could move the ship over the mountain.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Fitzcarraldo\" starring Klaus Kinski, click on the video player below:",
      "The finished film made believers out of the crew, and the critics. Herzog won best director at Cannes, though \"Fitzcarraldo\" was nearly a very different movie. Jason Robards originally led the cast, with Mick Jagger playing his assistant. Then, with nearly half the movie shot, Robards got sick and had to be evacuated back to the U.S. The delay cost them Jagger, too \u2013 The Rolling Stones were going on tour.",
      "So, Herzog hired Kinski.",
      "He said if Kinski had been unable to do the film, he would have played the character himself: \"I would have done it. Because the main task, moving a ship over the mountain, was not cinema anymore. It was the task that I had to deliver. I had to do it. And I was struggling. I wouldn't have been half as good as Kinski, and not half as good as Jason Robards or Mick Jagger. 'Thanks, God, on my knees,' that I didn't have to play it.\"",
      "That's not to say Herzog isn't a good actor; he was born to play bad. He's starred as the villain in \"Jack Reacher,\" and a sinister figure in \"The Mandalorian.\" \"Well, I was dragged into acting,\" he said, \"but I enjoy it tremendously, and I do it well. I know I do it well, but only for very specific parts. and I can deliver. But I swear to God, it's a performance.\"",
      "His greatest performance, though, is a love story: his own. Werner Herzog is a hopeless romantic. He fell for photographer Elena Pisetski in the late '90s. To seal the deal, he sold everything he owned and flew from Germany to the U.S. with nothing but a toothbrush in his pocket and passion in his heart.",
      "\"It's only me; it's me, only me, the man, the person, and that's it,\" he said of his arrival on Pisetski's doorstep. \"So, I have nothing to offer, only me, myself. And I am in America and I'm in Los Angeles because I fell in love very deeply. And I have been very lucky. I'm not here because of Hollywood. I'm here because I'm in love.\"",
      "It's Herzog's third marriage; he and Elena have been together now for 28 years. \"I'm a very lucky bastard,\" he said.",
      "It's been 63 years since his first film, and Herzog is still at it. And, he promises, there is more to come. \"I am working on two feature films,\" he said.",
      "\"You're not saturated?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, who knows?\" Herzog replied. \"Ultimately, you'll have to carry me out from a set feet first. That's what hopefully is gonna happen.\"",

      "One rule in a piano bar? Play the hits.  Criss had his first hit at the University of Michigan. He starred as Harry Potter in an unauthorized student show based on the books that became a YouTube sensation in 2009.",
      "\"This was a very interesting moment in time,\" he said, of \"A Very Potter Musical.\" \"That really did kind of change my life. That would kind of set me on the path to where I am now.\"",

      "I asked if \"A Very Potter Musical\" was the first musical to go viral. \"I don't know; I guess we'll let the YouTube historians sort of decide the validity of that,\" Criss said.",
      "But Criss took a detour on his way to Broadway, by becoming a TV star. \"'Glee' was happening at the time,\" he said. \"And I went out for it, like hundreds of thousands of other people in my situation at that time. And I happened to book it.\"",
      "He played Blaine Anderson, and quickly became a fan favorite. \"I owe my tenure on that show to the sub-cultural fan base army that we had gathered from the Potter stuff,\" he said.",

      "I asked, \"Does this feel like the best year of your life?\"",
      "\"Well, it certainly is a blessed one,\" Criss laughed. \"I've had some extraordinary years of my life, and I think this has been a certainly exciting time.\"",
      "He's had some hard years, too. In 2020, his father, Bill, died at 78 from a heart condition. In 2022, his brother, Chuck, died at 36 by suicide.",
      "Criss said, \"I don't necessarily think of my own experience with those people specifically in my life that I have lost. But I do think about the feeling of loss, the sadness and emptiness and loneliness that that yields, because we all feel it. But the things that move me, in life and in [\"Maybe Happy Ending\"], are not the darkness of the loss, but the Herculean grace that it takes to be resilient in the inevitable truth of that.\"",

    "story": [

      "Growing up in the iron-rich mining town of Hibbing, Minnesota, in the 1940s and '50s, Bob Dylan was not exposed to much non-conformity or social upheaval. Except, that is, at the movies.",
      "It was at the local theaters, one of which was owned by his relatives, that he first set eyes on Brigitte Bardot, an early crush and muse for some of his first songs.",

      "Seeing James Dean in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" inspired him to stand up against the shackles of Cold War conformity in his music.",
      "Once Dylan made it to New York's Greenwich Village, it was the art-house international films that caught his eye: Truffaut's \"Shoot the Piano Player\" \u2026 Fellini's \"La dolce vita.\" That film, about a tabloid journalist searching in vain for fulfillment in a hedonistic Rome, looked, Dylan later said, \"like life in a carnival mirror.\"",
      "Dylan's first major film appearance, however, was a cameo in director Sam Peckinpah's \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\" The film spawned the classic song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" now the Nobel laureate's most-streamed song.",

    "title": "The story of Handel's \"Messiah\"",
    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:13:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Since its premiere in 1742, George Frideric Handel's 3.5-hour oratorio for chorus, soloists and orchestra has become a timeless message of hope, and a Christmas tradition.",
    "story": [
      "It's probably the most-heard piece of classical music on Earth, the most sung, and the most recorded. It's \"Messiah,\" by German-British opera composer George Frideric Handel.",
      "\"It has been in near continuous performance from 1742, when it premiered, all the way up to the present,\" said author Charles King. \"It's absolutely everywhere. And you can't say that about really any other piece of serious music.\"",
      "King's new book, \"Every Valley\" (Doubleday), gives us the backstory of \"Messiah\" and its \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" which comes about two-thirds of the way through Handel's oratorio. \"It's not the finale!\" King said. \"People start getting ready to leave, you know, grabbing their keys and their parking validation, and then it's like, 'Nope, sit down. There's a third more of this thing left to go!'\"",
      "\"Messiah\" wasn't actually Handel's idea. The words came from a friend named Charles Jennens. King suggests it should really be called Handel's and Jennens' \"Messiah.\"",
      "\"Charles Jennens was a wealthy landowner, but he also suffered from this kind of encasing sense of doom and despair \u2013 we might now call it chronic depression or even bipolar disorder,\" King said. \"He starts to pull down books from the shelves, and he starts to copy down bits of scripture. He was also working out, I think, a kind of philosophy of living.\"",
      "Conductor and writer Jane Glover has conducted \"Messiah\" more than 100 times (most recently, this month at Trinity Church in New York City). \"I never fail to doff my hat, actually, at Charles Jennens for putting that together,\" she said. \"'Messiah'\" is in three parts. The first part is the Christmas story, which is why everybody does it at Christmas. The second part is the crucifixion, but then also the resurrection; and then Part III is about redemption. So, there's a tremendous shape to this three-part oratorio.\"",
      "In the 1720s and '30s, Handel's popular Italian-style operas had made him a musical megastar. But in his 50s, his popularity was waning. So, when he was invited to stage a series of concerts in Dublin, King said, Handel thought he could restart his career: \"And so, he sits down with this text that he's received from Charles Jennens and decides to try to make something of it. You can imagine him thinking, 'Hmpf, what am I gonna do with these? I got a bunch of Bible verses in the wrong order that I'm supposed to set to Italian opera music?' But he does it.\"",
      "In his book, King describes the final product as \"weird.\" \"It is weird,\" he laughed. \"It's the strangest thing that Handel ever composed.\"",
      "Handel wrote the three-hour piece (for chorus, soloists, and nine-piece orchestra) in 24 days \u2026 260 pages of music!",
      "At the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, music curator Robin McClellan showed me a replica of Handel's original score. \"It shows the speed that he wrote. It's so messy!\" McClellan laughed. \"He really was concerned with getting his ideas onto paper as fast as possible.\"",
      "For the \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" Handel wrote the word \"Hallelujah\" once \u2026 and then used the standard jazz repeat sign that we still use today! \"He's writing down the musical equivalent of 'et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,'\" said King. \"In that era, there was really no assumption that anything would ever be performed again.\"",
      "\"Messiah\" was a huge hit in Dublin, and, eventually, in London. It seems to offer a sense of hope and light at a time when they were in short supply.",
      "King said, \"'Messiah' was born in the kind of dark shadows of the Enlightenment. Britain was at war. The infant mortality rate in London at the time was 75%. And so, 'Messiah' is a kind of piece of art that is grappling with what basis, what possible basis for hope could there be when you have all of this evidence around you to suggest otherwise?\"",
      "Just about everyone loved it \u2013 except Charles Jennens! \"He was worried that Handel had done a kind of cheap job,\" said King. \"He says, 'I am never going to offer my words to Handel again to be so abused!'\"",
      "Handel agreed to make some changes, and Jennens softened. \"In the end, he wrote to a friend of his that he thought it was 'in the main, a fine composition,'\" King said.",
      "\"Messiah\" came to the American colonies in 1770, six years before this was even a country. It was performed in Trinity Church in New York City, sounding much as it did this month in exactly the same hall.",
      "Hear the Trinity Choir and Trinity Baroque Orchestra's 2024 performance of \"Messiah\" conducted by Jane Glover",
      "Hear the Trinity Choir and Trinity Baroque Orchestra's 2024 performance of \"Messiah\" conducted by Jane Glover",
      "Over time, \"Messiah\" has changed in all kinds of different ways. Handel's nine-piece orchestra gave way to thunderous musical forces; various trims were implemented. Glover said, \"People sitting in a church on hard pews don't want to sit here for three-and-a-half hours.\"",
      "And whole sections were dropped. \"Some people just do Part I at Christmas; that's a very good way of doing it,\" Glover said.",
      "Still, in all its versions, Handel and Jennens's masterpiece has offered the same message for nearly 300 years: That there is always hope.",
      "\"Every single generation that has heard this thing, has felt that this music is kind of a message in a bottle for them,\" said King. \"It's a piece of music that does stuff to us.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 16:16:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A Chicago man was stuck with a big medical bill after undergoing a colonoscopy that found no evidence of cancer. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Tom Contos is an avid runner. When he started experiencing rectal bleeding in March, he thought exercise could be the cause and tried to ignore it. But he became increasingly worried when the bleeding continued for weeks.",
      "The Chicago health care consultant contacted his physician at Northwestern Medicine, who referred him for a diagnostic colonoscopy, at least partly because Contos, 45, has a family history of colon issues.",
      "\"I work out a lot,\" he said. \"But my partner said this isn't normal. My primary care physician said, 'Given your family history, let's get you in.'\"",
      "Northwestern Memorial Hospital asked him to prepay $1,000 out-of-pocket, and he underwent the procedure in June.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "Colonoscopies are performed in the United States more than 15 million times a year. Rates of colorectal cancer are on the rise, particularly among younger people.",
      "The procedure, which is also a recommended screening for people 45 or older, involves examining the large intestine using a tube with a video camera that can also collect tissue samples.",
      "It typically takes less than one hour, with another hour spent taking the patient's history, administering anesthesia, and monitoring their recovery, said Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",
      "According to Contos' medical record, the gastroenterologist who performed his colonoscopy described it as \"not difficult.\" He biopsied and removed small growths called polyps from two spots and identified large internal hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins.",
      "The biopsy samples were sent to pathology for testing and found to be precancerous. But the gastroenterologist reported finding no evidence of cancer, and after reviewing the pathology report, he concluded hemorrhoids were the likely cause of the bleeding.",
      "The final bill",
      "The hospital charged a total of $19,206 for the procedure, including physician fees. The insurer negotiated the price to $5,816 and paid $1,979, leaving a patient share of $4,047. (It wasn't clear why the payments added up to slightly more than the negotiated price.) After Contos had paid $1,000 up front, plus $1,381 right after the procedure, the hospital said he still owed $1,666.",
      "The billing problem: Colonoscopies that find polyps cost more",
      "Contos was shocked and angry when he received his itemized bill. \"I said, 'I don't understand this.' Then I started to research the cost.\"",
      "He asked the hospital what it charges for a diagnostic colonoscopy and was told he'd been sent a cost estimate through his online patient portal prior to the procedure.",
      "The estimate, which took his deductible of $3,200 into account, listed a total price of $7,203, with an out-of-pocket bill of $2,381. He asked Northwestern why the charges were nearly three times the estimate and why his out-of-pocket share was nearly twice as high.",
      "One big reason was revealed in an explanation of benefits (EOB) statement from Contos' insurance company, Aetna: Northwestern had charged for two colonoscopies, at $5,466 each. And there were two fees for the gastroenterologist \u2014 $1,535 and $1,291.",
      "The first procedure was listed as \"colonoscopy and biopsy,\" while the second was listed as \"colonoscopy w/lesion removal.\" Aetna's negotiated member rate reduced the first $5,466 hospital charge to $3,425, while the charge for the second procedure was lowered to $1,787 \u2014 $1,638 less.",
      "Neither the bill nor the EOB explained why there was a second procedure listed, at a reduced price.",
      "After examining Contos' bill, Littenberg said it's standard for providers to bill for two colonoscopies if they remove two or more polyps in different ways, because of the extra work. As in this case, hospitals typically use a modifier code that reduces the amount charged for the second billed colonoscopy so they charge only for the extra work, he added.",
      "\"How do you explain that in sensible terms that anyone could understand?\" Littenberg said.",
      "Even with that reduction, Littenberg said, he thought Contos' total out-of-pocket cost of $4,047 was \"a lot, though not rare for large academic centers.\"",
      "Contos' insurance documents show Aetna's negotiated rate for his colonoscopy at Northwestern was more than twice the insurer's median negotiated rate for the same procedure at other Chicago-area hospitals, according to Forrest Xiao, director of quantitative research at Turquoise Health, a company that gathers health care price data.",
      "In exchanges with Northwestern and Aetna representatives, Contos asked why he was charged for two colonoscopies. A Northwestern representative said that because of the modifier code, he wasn't actually being billed for two procedures, which Contos found bewildering.",
      "\"I told Northwestern, 'I'm not paying that, and I don't care if you send me to collections,'\" he said. He filed appeals with the hospital and Aetna but was ultimately told the billing was correct.",
      "The resolution",
      "In an email, Contos told the billing department that its charge was \"ridiculously high.\" A representative responded that Northwestern's pricing is in line with other academic medical centers in Chicago and \"non-negotiable\" \u2014 and that his account would be turned over to a collections agency.",
      "CVS Health spokesperson Phillip Blando said in a written statement to KFF Health News that the claims for Contos were \"paid accurately\" by Aetna, declining further comment. (CVS Health owns Aetna.)",
      "Northwestern did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Contos said he wrote to his physician that he was regretfully dropping him and leaving Northwestern entirely because of the health system's high pricing.",
      "He said he's still experiencing periodic symptoms, which he relieves with over-the-counter Preparation H. A one-ounce tube of the ointment costs $10.99 at CVS.",
      "The takeaway",
      "To get a colonoscopy at a lower price, Littenberg said, patients should consider going to a freestanding endoscopy center or ambulatory surgery center not associated with a hospital. A 2023 study found that ambulatory surgery centers billed insurers an average of about $1,030 for a colonoscopy with biopsy or with removal of a polyp, compared with $1,760 at a hospital.",

      "More from the series",
      "To get a sense of how much a diagnostic colonoscopy could cost, patients can consult a hospital's price website and an insurer's cost-estimator website, both required by federal price transparency rules.",
      "Patients also can look up a good-faith estimate of the cash price, which can be lower than the price for patients using insurance to pay for a procedure. In addition, they can check prices through websites such as Turquoise Health and Fair Health, which draw from federal price transparency data or claims data from insurers.",
      "Still, the actual cost could be higher than the estimate if the colonoscopy finds one or more polyps that need to be removed and biopsied, which occurs in at least 40% of all colonoscopies, Littenberg said. Patients should ask whether the price includes those potentially extra services. After all, the point of a diagnostic colonoscopy is to find and, if necessary, treat lesions that could cause problems \u2014 regardless of the number found.",
      "It all should be easier for patients, Xiao said: \"You shouldn't have to be a medical billing expert to know what you're going to pay.\"",

      "The FDA said it had been alerted by a consumer that the product might contain undeclared milk. The bags of chips affected by recall were distributed to some retail stores and e-commerce distributors in Oregon and Washington, and were available for sale beginning Nov. 3, 2024.",

    "story": [
      "Americans are being urged not to buy or use liquid-burning portable firepits sold for tabletops and other uses following the deaths of two people and dozens of injuries.",
      "Sold as tabletop firepits, firepots, miniature fireplaces or portable fires for indoor use, \"these firepits are extremely dangerous and have been associated with two deaths and at least 60 injuries since 2019,\" the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday in issuing a consumer alert. \"Consumers should immediately stop using and dispose of these products. Sellers should stop selling these products,\" the agency stated.",
      "The warning follows the June deaths of an elderly couple, Herm and Thelma Stolzenburg, in Dover, New Hampshire. Both were engulfed in flames from a tabletop firepit their family was seated around, Dee McEneaney, their daughter, relayed to CBS News in Boston. \"All of a sudden, these flames shot out and like a blow torch, is all I describe it as. That totally took over both my parents' bodies,\" McEneaney told WBZ-TV in July.",
      "Married for 71 years, McEneaney's 93-year-old parents died three days apart a week after the accident from third-degree burn injuries.",
      "A Hanover, Massachusetts, is also speaking out about the potential dangers. Katelyn Little was gifted a tabletop firepit in the summer, and just after setting it up, it erupted into flames, setting her on fire.",
      "Little jumped in the pool in her backyard to put out the flames, and was then hospitalized, unable to move with second- and third-degree burns all over her body. \"I was there for a total of four days being treated by the burn unit. With daily dressing changes and soaks and I didn't get out of bed for four days. I couldn't walk,\" Little said. \"It was just, it was horrible,\" she\u00a0told WBZ earlier this month.",
      "Little opted to share what happened to her while noticing the popularity of the firepits while shopping for the holidays.",
      "\"When I search Yankee swap gifts under $30, it's pretty much the No. 1 gift that comes up right now,\" Little said. \"A lot of different companies are making them.\"",
      "The CPSC recently warned against FLIKRFIRE Tabletop Fireplaces and announced the recall of Colsen-branded firepits after a series of alarming incidents left 19 people with burn injuries, with some requiring surgery and others permanently disfigured.",
      "Fire pits that require pouring isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol or other liquid fuel into an open container or bowl and then ignite the pooled liquid in the same location in which it was poured violate voluntary safety requirements.",
      "Isopropyl alcohol, ethanol/bioethanol, and similar liquid fuels burn with flame temperatures over 1,600\u00b0F and can cause third-degree burns in less than one second. Igniting a pool of alcohol or other liquid fuel in a firepit's open container creates an uncontrollable pool fire, which can suddenly produce larger, hotter flames that can spread beyond the firepit product, according to the agency.",
      "Flame jetting, a second hazard, can occur when refilling alcohol or other liquid-burning firepits while a flame is present. A small flame in the firepit can be hard to see and can ignite alcohol or other liquid fuel as it is poured, causing an explosion that propels flames and burning liquid onto the consumer or bystanders.",

    "story": [
      "An anti-money laundering law called the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, is now back in action after a Monday court ruling that will require millions of small business owners to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by mid-January, or potentially pay fines of up to $10,000.",
      "The registration rule had been on hold since Dec. 3, when a federal court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting its enforcement. But on Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the order, ruling that the decision is in the \"public's urgent interest in combating financial crime and protecting our country's national security.\"",
      "The CTA requires that the owners and part-owners of an estimated 32.6 million small businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address, by Jan. 1. With the court ruling that enforcement can proceed, many small business owners may scramble to register ahead of deadline, although FinCEN said on Monday that it is extending the deadline until Jan. 13 due to the late December court ruling.",
      "\"Reporting companies that were created or registered prior to Jan. 1, 2024 have until Jan. 13, 2025 to file their initial beneficial ownership information reports with FinCEN,\" the agency said in a statement. \"These companies would otherwise have been required to report by Jan. 1, 2025.\"",
      "Some civil liberties groups decried the ruling, saying that the regulation represents governmental overreach.",
      "\"The government cannot be allowed to maintain this unconstitutional statute, which stretches beyond Congress's proper authority to regulate Americans,\" said the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a civil rights group, said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, a FinCEN spokesperson said the appeals court ruling \"underscores the importance and urgency of the Corporate Transparency Act for national security.\"",
      "\"The Corporate Transparency Act levels the playing field for tens of millions of law-abiding small businesses across the United States and makes it harder for bad actors to exploit loopholes in order to gain an unfair advantage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Here's what to know about the ruling and the CTA.",
      "What is the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA?",
      "The CTA, an anti-money laundering statute passed in 2021, was intended to get a look inside shell companies and crack down on attempts by \"criminals, organized crime rings, and other illicit actors to hide their identities and launder their money through the financial system,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in 2022.",

    "summary": "A government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel.",
    "story": [
      "A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving a decision to President Joe Biden, a longtime opponent of the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Mr. Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March of this year and now has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is that Nippon Steel also has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "The interagency committee reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks. Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Mr. Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "The Washington Post earlier reported CFIUS' submission of its report.",
      "Under the terms of the approximately\u00a0$14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steel-producing companies in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union has said it doesn't believe Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\"Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it's up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\" David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \"We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel had waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \"is the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel's blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "In a statement Tuesday to CBS News, the company urged the president \"to reflect on the great lengths that we have gone to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U.S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\"",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America's manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security.",
      "The committee's powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",
      "In September, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals \u2014 such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or puts Americans' sensitive personal data at risk.",
      "Nippon Steel already has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world's top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

      "The streaming giant agreed to a three-year contract in May to carry Christmas Day games.",
      "Netflix's 282.3 million subscribers in over 190 countries will be able to stream the games, marking the first time one outlet has distributed an NFL game globally. Netflix will have the games available in five languages - English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German.",
      "The games will also air on CBS affiliates in Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Houston. NFL policy dictates that games on cable or being exclusively streamed must also be on an over-the-air station in the competing teams' markets. It will also be available on mobile devices in the U.S. for those who have NFL+.",
      "The biggest reason is money. The league is getting $150 million from Netflix for the two games this season. It also continues the NFL's moves into streaming - Thursday night games are in their third season on Amazon Prime Video and the \"Sunday Ticket\" package moved to YouTube TV last year.",
      "And the league wasn't about to give up Christmas after seeing the ratings. Last year's three games averaged 28.68 million viewers. The early afternoon contest between the Las Vegas Raiders and Chiefs led the way, averaging 29.48 million.",
      "This time, the Chiefs, Steelers, Ravens and Texans played on Saturday, giving them the same turnaround they would have if they played on Sunday and then Thursday.",
      "All four have clinched playoff spots in the AFC, but seeding remains up for grabs.",
      "Kansas City (14-1) can clinch the top seed - which would mean a first-round bye and home field throughout the playoffs - with a win over the Steelers. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are tied atop the AFC North at 10-5, with the Steelers holding the tiebreaker due to a better conference record.",
      "Houston (9-6) has wrapped up the AFC South and holds the fourth seed.",

    "summary": "Legislation now headed to President Biden's desk comes with the Social Security Administration staffed at a 50-year low.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly 3 million Americans will receive full Social Security benefits under legislation passed in the waning hours of the current Congress and now headed to President Biden, who is expected to sign into law.",
      "Senators voted 76-20 for the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, which would\u00a0eliminate two federal policies\u00a0that prevent nearly 3 million people, including police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension, from collecting their full Social Security benefits. The legislation has been decades in the making, as the Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation at 12:15 a.m. Saturday.",
      "Democrats uniformly voted for the measure, while Republicans in the Senate were split, with 20 voting to pass it and 20 voting against it. Four senators did not vote, including California's Adam Schiff, a Democrat; Joe Manchin, an independent from West Virginia; and two Republicans \u2014 Marco Rubio of Florida and Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance of Ohio.",
      "Congressional passage came down to the wire. After garnering bipartisan approval in the U.S. House in November, Senate approval came at about 12:15 a.m. on Saturday, just ahead of a continuing resolution to keep the government\u00a0from shutting down. The votes marked the final ones cast by senators in the 118th Congress before the next Congress is sworn in on January 3.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class. You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber Wednesday ahead of one of multiple votes to advance the bill. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",
      "Senators rejected four amendments and a budgetary point of order that would have derailed the measure, given the small window of time left to pass it.",
      "Republicans who spoke against the bill largely objected to its cost, noting that the measure would accelerate the Social Security trust fund's projected insolvency by about six months, now estimated to be roughly a decade away. Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act go into effect",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation's effective date involves Social Security payments for months after December 2023, according to the text of the bill.\u00a0Still, calculating what folks are due, not to mention retroactive payments, may not be simple or quick.",
      "The new law would come at a time when the Social Security Administration is operating with its lowest staffing level in more than 50 years, or since 1972, with a hiring freeze recently put in place, a spokesperson noted. Congress rejected the White House budget office's request to increase its funding, first in September and again last week, leaving it flat.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost. According\u00a0to\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance of Ohio was among the 24 Republican senators to join 49 Democrats to advance the measure in an initial procedural vote that took place Wednesday.",
      "Without Senate approval, the bill's fate would have ended with the current session of Congress and would have needed to be re-introduced in the next Congress.",

      "That credit was designed for people who didn't get all or some of the stimulus checks when they were issued during the pandemic. Lawmakers authorized three stimulus payments, with two sent in 2020 and a third in 2021.",

    "summary": "The work never ends on a dairy farm. The job is \"rewarding spiritually, not always financially,\" New York farmer Nate Chittenden says.",
    "story": [
      "As the holiday season gets underway, Americans are preparing to spend big on baking ingredients. Butter consumption, for example, grew 16% last November and December compared to the rest of 2023, according to USDA data. On average, Americans consumed 6.5 pounds of butter last year, a number that's been on the rise.",
      "Prices of staples like flour, sugar and milk have been steadily climbing for the past five years, as have the prices for many grocery items, according to the CBS News Price Tracker. Egg prices have skyrocketed 160% since 2019, due in part to shortages linked to several outbreaks of bird flu. Butter is more expensive by 29%, about in line with all grocery increases over the same period.",
      "Yet the people who harvest the milk that goes into baking essentials say they don't always benefit from the price hikes.",
      "\"Rewarding spiritually, not always financially\"",
      "Nate Chittenden starts his day taking care of nearly a thousand cows on his family's dairy farm, Dutch Hollow, in New York's Hudson Valley. His herd of Jersey cows, known for high-fat milk that goes into products like cheese, butter and ice cream, requires round-the-clock maintenance to stay healthy and maximize productivity.",
      "Chittenden, who runs the farm with his brothers and extended family, is able to pool resources with other farms as part of Cabot Creamery's co-op. Still, it can be a grueling business.",
      "\"Working on the farm every day, you get an appreciation for caring for animals, caring for another living creature, working with the land, just realizing all of this goes into making food that provides for people,\" Chittenden said. \"It's rewarding spiritually, not always financially.\"",
      "How milk is priced",
      "Farmers often sell milk at a federally mandated price to producers who process it into fluid milk, butter, cheese or other dairy products. Around 15 cents of every retail dollar go to farms, and to keep things equitable the government sets the price from farms.",
      "\"When you spend a dollar [at the store], 85 cents of it is beyond the farm,\" said Michael Swanson, an agricultural economist at Wells Fargo's Agricultural Food Institute. Another 15% goes to processors, who turn milk into consumer products, and the remainder is spent on wholesaling, advertising and other costs.",
      "\"Milk doesn't stay good for very long. You have to eat it, sell it that day or get rid of it. So [the government] wants to make sure that everybody who sends milk to a processor buyer in a district gets the same price back,\" Swanson explained.",
      "Farmers can't directly charge more money for their product if their expenses climb, and many cite increased animal feed and labor costs as hits to their margins.",
      "\"It's a struggle every year,\" Chittenden said. \"We are one big mistake away from being bankrupted.\"",
      "Hope for the future",
      "Swanson said the tide may be turning for some farmers. Dairy retail prices for consumers have been stable for the past several months, though they are elevated from 2019 levels. Other key expenses are easing as well, with lower feed costs for the past year only now getting passed down to farmers.",
      "\"This year, the dairymen actually have, year to date, 10% more revenue,\" compared to in 2023, Swanson said. Although labor \"never gets cheaper,\" he added that many farmers could be set up for a strong 2025. \"They're in a much better position right now in early December than they were a year ago,\" Swanson said.",
      "Still, for small family farms like Chittenden's, every day is a challenge \u2014 one that requires grit and a determination to keep marching forward.",
      "\"No matter how rough a day we have, you get to the end of the day, you get home with your family and you say, we're gonna do better tomorrow,\" Chittenden said. \"I don't need a pat on the back to do this job, you know, but I need people to understand what it takes to do this job.\""

    "story": [
      "Starbucks workers' strikes expanded on Saturday to include stores in Denver; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio, Union leaders said.",
      "Starbucks Workers United, the union that has organized workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores since 2021, launched strikes that started Friday in Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle, to protest a lack of progress in contract negotiations with the company.",
      "According to the union, the company has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. Workers United has said the latest strikes could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve.",
      "Starbucks proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years, the union said Friday.",
      "In a post Sunday on X, the union said that picket lines had expanded to Brooklyn and Long Island in New York, St. Louis and Pittsburgh. Without providing a specific number, labor leaders said dozens of Starbucks stores are now affected by the strike. On Monday, baristas at several Philadelphia Starbucks locations joined the nationwide strike\u00a0against the company as well.",
      "\"We were ready to bring the foundational framework home this year, but Starbucks wasn't,\" Lynne Fox, president of Workers United said in a statement. \"After all Starbucks has said about how they value partners throughout the system, we refuse to accept zero immediate investment in baristas' wages and no resolution of the hundreds of outstanding unfair labor practices.\"",
      "Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. The company also says it already offers pay and benefits worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.",
      "Strikes at Starbucks and Amazon",
      "The union also wants Starbucks to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The agency also has opened or settled hundreds of charges against Amazon. On Thursday, a day before the Starbucks walkouts, the Teamsters union\u00a0announced strikes\u00a0at seven Amazon delivery hubs.",
      "Amazon delivery drivers and Starbucks baristas are on strike in a handful of U.S. cities as they seek to exert pressure on the two major companies to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "The strikes that started Thursday and Friday followed other recent standoffs between corporate America and organized labor. Large and established labor unions secured meaningful employer concessions this year following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "But workers at Starbucks, Amazon and some other prominent consumer brands still are fighting for their first contracts. Amazon refuses to acknowledge the organizing efforts of drivers and warehouse workers \u2014 many of whom have voted to unionize \u2014 even though the powerful Teamsters union says it represents them.",
      "The e-commerce giant says the delivery drivers, which the Teamsters have organized for more than a year, aren't its employees. Under its business model, the drivers work for third-party businesses, called Delivery Service Partners, who drop off millions of packages to customers every day.",
      "\"For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public \u2014 claiming that they represent 'thousands of Amazon employees and drivers.' They don't, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel recently said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks has long resisted the unionization of its stores, but had agreed to negotiate a contract by the end of the year.",
      "Strikes \u2014 particularly ones that happen during the holidays, a time of high economic activity \u2014 can help unions exercise leverage during negotiations or flex their muscles by garnering support from workers and sympathetic consumers.",
      "Wave of union efforts following COVID-19",
      "Both Amazon and Starbucks saw a wave of organizing efforts following the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic focused attention on front-line workers and the impact of economic inequality on the lives of wage-earning Americans.",
      "Employees organized at bookstores, where unions are rare, and were successful with campaigns at some stores run by Apple, Trader Joe's and the outdoor equipment company REI.",
      "But turning those wins into contracts can be a challenge. At Amazon and Starbucks, which were not unionized before the pandemic, workers have yet to secure an agreement with the e-commerce and coffee giants, which both have their headquarters in Seattle.",
      "Unions' last effort before Trump",
      "John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, said he thinks the Amazon and Starbucks workers are \"desperate\" to make progress before President-elect Donald Trump gets to appoint a Republican majority to the National Labor Relations Board, which is expected to be less friendly to unions during his administration.",
      "\"The unions want to make these disputes public and bring political pressures on the companies,\" Logan said in a written statement. \"If these disputes drag on until next year, and if they are fought largely through the labor board and the courts, the unions and workers will almost certainly lose. This might be their last, best chance to pressure the companies in public before Trump comes into office.\"",
      "However, Trump has also given some signs that he might be friendlier to labor during his second term compared to his first term. Last month, he picked Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor in his new administration, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions, including the Teamsters. Teamsters President Sean O'Brien also spoke at the Republican National Convention this past summer.",
      "The Teamsters say workers at Amazon are striking at seven delivery stations in Southern California, San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta and Skokie, Illinois, because the company ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. At midnight on Saturday, the Teamsters say workers will also strike at a prominent warehouse in New York, which voted to join the fledgling Amazon Labor Union in 2022 and have since elected to affiliate with the Teamsters.",
      "Union demands",
      "The prominent labor group says it's fighting for higher wages, better benefits and safer working conditions for Amazon employees, many of whom experience economic insecurity while working for a company worth $2.3 trillion. It has not said how many Amazon warehouse workers or drivers are joining the striking.",
      "The union has mainly focused on organizing delivery drivers, which the company says are not its workers because they are directly employed by contractors Amazon recruited to handle package deliveries.",
      "That type of setup gives the Amazon more cover from unionization attempts in an industry \u2014 transportation and trucking \u2014 that's dominated by the Teamsters. However, the union has argued before the National Labor Relations Board that the drivers, who wear Amazon's ubiquitous gray-blue vests and drive similarly colored vans, should be classified as company employees.",
      "Meanwhile, the online retailer has accused the union of pushing a \"false narrative\" about the thousands of workers it claims to represent. Amazon has also touted its pay, saying it provides warehouse and transportation employees a base wage of $22 per hour plus benefits. It also recently boosted hourly pay for the subcontracted delivery drivers.",
      "NLRB under Biden",
      "In September, the NLRB, which has taken a more pro-labor stance under President Joe Biden, filed a complaint that found the drivers to be joint employees of Amazon. The agency also accused Amazon of unlawfully failing to bargain with the Teamsters on a contract for drivers at a California delivery hub.",
      "The Teamsters union says it also represents Amazon warehouse workers, including thousands of employees at the major New York City fulfillment center who voted to be represented by the Amazon Labor Union.",
      "Amazon objected to the 2022 warehouse election results, alleging the Amazon Labor Union and the federal labor board had tainted the vote. A regional NLRB director issued a complaint last year that accused Amazon of violating the law by refusing to bargain with the union.",
      "Amazon, in turn, is challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB in federal court along with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In June, the Supreme Court made it harder for the agency to win court orders in labor disputes, siding with Starbucks in a case brought by the company.",
      "Unlike Amazon, contract negotiation have been underway at Starbucks. The coffee chain's workers walked off the job on two occasions last year.",
      "Patricia Campos-Medina, who recently ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in New Jersey and leads Cornell University's Worker Institute at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said she expects there to be more union activity before Trump takes office.",
      "Trump's reactions will give the public a chance to see what his \"commitments are to the working class,\" Campos-Medina said.",

      "Century-old department store Nordstrom has agreed to be acquired and taken private by Nordstrom family members and a Mexican retail group in a $6.25 billion deal that comes as department stores are facing pressure from discount chains and other competition.",
      "Nordstrom shareholders will receive $24.25 in cash for each share of Nordstrom common stock they own, or about $4 billion in all, representing a 42% premium on the company's stock as of March 18, which is the day before media reports of a potential transaction began to circulate. The Nordstroms will also pick up more than $2 billion in debt.",
      "As a private business, the Nordstroms may have more leeway in reviving a department store chain that, like others, has looked to revive lackluster sales for years. Other publicly traded retailers, including Macy's and Kohl's, have faced pressure from major investors in order to provide bigger returns to investors, while also attempting to fend off competition from lower-cost rivals such as Walmart and Amazon.com.",
      "\"While a change in ownership does not automatically remedy all of the problems with the department store operation, it will allow the family and their backers to take a long term view of the business and make necessary investments and changes away from the short term scrutiny of public markets,\" noted GlobalData analyst Neil Saunders in a Monday research note.",
      "He added, \"The [Nordstrom] family have the talent and ability to enact change as does El Puerto de Liverpool. They will likely run the business as a retailer rather than as some kind of financial play thing which, in our view, is a very positive thing for the long term health of the brand.\"",
      "Shares of Nordstrom fell 36 cents, or 1.5%, to $24.17 in late morning trading.",
      "Nordstrom family, El Puerto de Liverpool's offer",
      "That offer announced Monday tops the previous $23-per-share bid that the Nordstrom family and Mexican retail group, El Puerto de Liverpool, made in September.",
      "The board also plans to authorize a special dividend of up to 25 cents per share, based on Nordstrom's cash on hand immediately prior to and contingent on the close of the transaction.",
      "The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, at which time the company's shares will no longer trade publicly.",
      "Nordstrom's board of directors unanimously approved the the proposed transaction, with members Erik and Pete Nordstrom, part of the Nordstrom family taking over the company \u2014 recusing themselves from that vote.",
      "Following the close of the transaction, the Nordstrom family will have a majority ownership stake in the company. Erik and Pete Nordstrom are the fourth-generation leadership at the Seattle retailer, which was founded in 1901 as a shoe store. Erik is the company's chief executive and Peter is president.",

    "story": [
      "Tokyo \u2014 Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan have announced plans to join forces, forming world's third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses.",
      "\"We anticipate that if this integration comes to fruition, we will be able to deliver even greater value to a wider customer base,\" Nissan's CEO Makoto Uchida said in a statement.",
      "Automakers in Japan have lagged behind their big rivals in electric vehicles and are trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "News of a possible merger surfaced earlier this month, with unconfirmed reports saying that the talks on closer collaboration partly were driven by aspirations of Taiwan iPhone maker Foxconn to tie up with Nissan, which has an alliance with Renault SA of France and Mitsubishi.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda and the Nissan alliance with Renault SA of France and smaller automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany's Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Even after a merger Toyota, which rolled out 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, would remain the leading Japanese automaker. If they join, the three smaller companies would make about 8 million vehicles. In 2023, Honda made 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they would share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes centered around electrification, following a preliminary agreement between Nissan and Honda set in March.",
      "Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, is widely viewed as the only likely Japanese partner able to effect a rescue of Nissan, which has struggled following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Speaking Monday to reporters in Tokyo via a video link, Ghosn derided the planned merger as a \"desperate move.\"",
      "From Nissan, Honda could get truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "But the company said in November that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing its global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "It recently reshuffled its management and Makoto Uchida, its chief executive, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \"negative,\" citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price also has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain.",
      "On Monday, its Tokyo-traded shares gained 1.6%. They jumped more than 20% after news of the possible merger broke last week.",
      "Honda's shares surged 3.8%. Honda's net profit slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 00:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. government faced the threat of a shutdown if Congress didn't pass a spending bill before Dec. 21, 2024. Here's a look at the potential impact.",
    "story": [
      "Update, 12:45 a.m. Saturday:\u00a0The U.S. government avoided a prolonged government shutdown after the House and Senate approved a short-term\u00a0funding bill,\u00a0sending it to President Biden's desk for his signature.",
      "As the fight over a federal spending bill went down to the wire, the U.S. faced a looming deadline for a government shutdown that could have began at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 21. That raised questions about what types of services and payments could be impacted if funding lapsed just days before the holidays.",
      "The threat of a shutdown stemmed from controversy over a spending bill to extended funding through March 14, but which fell apart after some Republicans \u2014 including President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk \u2014 objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending that had been added to the bill. A revised version also failed on Thursday before another attempt on Friday finally passed.",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically barred from doling out money, although there are some exceptions, such as activities to protect life and property. At the same time, agencies must make decisions about which workers will stay on the job, which can lead to varying impacts on government operations.",
      "\"Shutdowns can be disruptive, leading to delays in processing applications for passports, small business loans or government benefits,\" David Wessel, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, wrote earlier this year in a blog post.",
      "Each week of a federal shutdown will cost the U.S. economy $6 billion, due to delays in government spending and a reduction in pay for furloughed workers.",
      "Here's what could be impacted if the U.S. government shuts down.",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "If the federal government shuts down, each federal agency will determine its own plan for how to handle a shutdown, although government operations deemed nonessential will stop happening.",
      "Many government workers will be furloughed, although those providing essential services such as law enforcement and air traffic control will continue to report to their jobs. For instance, essential government agencies like the FBI, the Border Patrol and the Coast Guard would remain open.",
      "However, none of those federal workers would get paid until Congress approves a new spending bill. After the shutdown ends, workers will receive retroactive paychecks covering the days they were furloughed or had to work without pay, according to the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "That could create hardships for some government workers, as occurred during a shutdown that stretched for more than 30 days, starting on Dec. 22, 2018. During that stoppage, many federal workers turned to food pantries and other forms of aid to get through the several weeks when they didn't receive paychecks.",
      "Could a shutdown hurt the U.S. economy?",
      "Each week of a federal shutdown will cost the U.S. economy $6 billion, due to delays in government spending and a reduction in pay for furloughed workers, among other impacts, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",
      "\"A government shutdown could leave a visible mark on the economy,\" he wrote. \"Apart from the direct macroeconomic consequences of a shutdown, financial markets and private sector confidence could also be affected.\"",
      "Is Social Security affected by a government shutdown?",
      "The nation's 67 million Social Security recipients would continue to receive their checks even if the government closes for business. Medicare will also continue to operate, which means seniors covered by the health care plan won't have their medications or treatments impacted.",
      "That's because both Social Security and Medicare benefits are authorized by laws that don't require annual approval.",
      "Even so, Social Security's administrative budget is discretionary, which means it needs approval from Congress, according to the AARP. As a result, some services offered by the Social Security Administration could be impacted in a shutdown, such as benefit verification and new applications for benefits, the group says.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect the TSA or air travel?",
      "With millions of Americans expected to travel over the holidays, there are plenty of questions about how a shutdown could impact air travel. Because they provide essential services, air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"We expect to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2,\" a TSA spokesperson said. \"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports.\"",
      "Does the USPS deliver mail in a government shutdown?",
      "Yes, because the U.S. Postal Service is an independent agency. In previous shutdowns, operations have continued. That means mail would still be delivered, and post offices will remain open.",
      "Does the military get paid in a government shutdown?",
      "Active-duty members of the military and federal law enforcement would continue to work, but would not be paid until Congress signs off on new spending. But most civilian personnel working for the U.S. Department of Defense would be furloughed.",
      "Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department are expected to start alerting workers about shutdown protocols on Thursday, according to the Military Times. The impact would likely be felt in the first week of January when the first military paychecks of 2025 will be deposited, which are scheduled to include a 4.5% pay increase for all troops, the publication noted.",
      "What closes in a government shutdown?",
      "Many services would be put on hold or delayed if there is a shutdown, including environmental and food inspections by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a public policy group that focuses on federal spending.",
      "The national parks would likely close, while the National Institutes of Health could also be impacted, the group noted.",
      "While taxes are still due, such as quarterly estimated payments due on Jan. 15, the IRS could also be impacted by furloughs, although tax filing season typically doesn't kick off until late January. Still, a shutdown plan published earlier this year notes that many IRS functions would cease, including tax audits and services such as answering calls from taxpayers.",
      "How long could a government shutdown last?",
      "The odds of a government shutdown have increased with the latest developments, according to Goldman Sachs analysts in a Dec. 18 research note. But, they added, \"a protracted shutdown looks unlikely in our view.\"",
      "A spending measure also could be passed before the Dec. 21 deadline if Republicans can revise it to appease Trump, who objected to\u00a0billions of dollars\u00a0in spending added to the bill, Goldman's analysts added.",
      "\"Trump's opposition was unrelated to the main components \u2014 he stated support for the spending extension, and the disaster and agricultural aid \u2014 so it is possible that a revised package could still pass before\" the deadline, they wrote.",

      "\"We are ready to continue negotiations to reach agreements. We need the union to return to the table,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Negotiations are currently focused on pay raises. Starbucks said it has committed to an annual pay increase of at least 1.5% for unionized workers. If the company gave a lower increase to non-union workers in any given year, it still would give union workers a 1.5% increase.",
      "Starbucks said the union wants to increase the minimum wage for hourly workers by 64% immediately and 77% over the life of a three-year contract.",
      "Starbucks said it already pays an average of $18 per hour. With benefits \u2014 including health care, free college tuition and paid family leave \u2014 Starbucks' pay package is worth an average of $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.",

In November 2023, thousands of workers at more than 200 stores walked out on Red Cup Day, when the company usually gives away thousands of reusable cups. Hundreds of workers also went on strike in June 2023 to protest after the union said Starbucks banned Pride displays at some stores.",

    "summary": "More than 119 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year's Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019, according to AAA.",
    "story": [
      "Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it because it's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S., as the House appeared to have averted a government shutdown late Friday.",
      "The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel\u00a0at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year's Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports.",
      "Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.",
      "A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.",
      "What will be the busiest travel days?",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year \u2014 by a wide margin \u2014 was Thanksgiving Day.",
      "The\u00a0Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2.",
      "About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.",
      "\"Airline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,\" AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.05 a gallon, down from $3.08 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation's highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",
      "Weather and other wildcards",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \"interline agreements\" that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.",
      "\"When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,\" said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.",
      "People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.",
      "\"They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,\" and paying more to rebook on\u00a0a big airline\u00a0might be worthwhile, French said.",
      "Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays \u2014 Delta, United and JetBlue, for example \u2014 are now using the government standard.",
      "Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover.",
      "Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?",
      "A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn't pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.",
      "More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks\u00a0into a government shutdown\u00a0that started in December 2019.",
      "About 59,000 of the TSA's 62,000 workers are considered essential and would continue working without pay during a shutdown, the TSA said in an email sent to CBS News. But a shutdown could cause delays at airports over the holidays, the agency warned.",
      "\"While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.",
      "AAA advises travelers to \"continue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,\" spokesperson Diaz said. \"Airport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.\"",
      "Planning ahead for 2025",
      "Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year's trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.",
      "\"Because travel is so popular, you're not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,\" Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. \"If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.\""

    "story": [
      "Update, 6:43 p.m.:\u00a0The U.S. government looked poised to avoid a prolonged government shutdown after the House of Representatives on Friday voted to approve a\u00a0funding bill\u00a0just\u00a0hours before a midnight deadline. The bill is expected to pass in the Senate before heading to President Biden's desk for his signature.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has cautioned that a looming government shutdown could lead to longer wait times for travelers at airport security checkpoints. The warning comes as the TSA announced it is expecting a record 40 million airline passengers to take to the skies over the two-week holiday travel period that began Thursday.",
      "Most TSA workers, about 95%, are considered essential, and would therefore remain on the job in the event of a shutdown \u2014 but without pay \u2014 TSA administrator David Pekoske said in a post on X.",
      "Air traffic controllers are also deemed essential employees and would be expected to work while foregoing a paycheck. Employees would be paid after a shutdown were to end.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group representing the industry, on Friday said a government shutdown could cost the sector $1 billion per week given that disruptions would occur during a peak travel period.",
      "\"A prolonged government shutdown threatens holiday travel disruptions that Americans won't tolerate,\" Geoff Freeman, the group's CEO, said in a statement. \"It's hard to see how anyone in Congress wins if they force TSA workers, air traffic controllers and other essential employees to work without pay during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.\"",
      "A survey by the group also found that 60% of Americans said they would consider changing their travel plans if a government shutdown occurs, including canceling flights and trips altogether, resulting in significant economic losses for travel-related businesses.",
      "Here is how a government shutdown will affect air travel for consumers.",
      "Will the government shutdown affect flights?",
      "Not for now. Passengers will still be able to travel on flights they have booked, with operations expected to continue as normal at least in the early days of a shutdown. That's because TSA agents, air traffic controllers, and other essential airport staff will remain on the job.",
      "Will TSA screening lines be longer?",
      "While passengers are always encouraged to arrive at the airport earlier than usual during peak travel periods, that advice could be even more applicable in the event of a shutdown.",
      "\"While our personnel are prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, please be aware that an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,\" the TSA's Pekoske warned.",
      "\"My advice? Arrive at your airport early, with plenty of time to park your car, check your bags and make your way through security,\" he added.",
      "The last government shutdown, in 2018-2019, lasted 35 days. While TSA officers were also deemed essential then, the number officers who called out sick rose as the shutdown dragged on and financial woes ensued.",
      "\"It was after TSA officers started missing paychecks that you saw the sick call numbers increase,\" said senior CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"There may not be an immediate impact at all airports, particularly if it is a short shutdown. If it drags on, then you have a workforce that is among the lowest-paid government employees,\" he said.",
      "If, in the event of a prolonged government shutdown, TSA employees stop showing up to work in significant numbers, wait times at security screening checkpoints would likely increase.",
      "What about air traffic controllers?",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is already grappling with a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are responsible for securing the national airspace by guiding takeoffs and landings and ensuring that aircraft don't fly too close to one another. About a month into the last shutdown, LaGuardia Airport temporarily delayed flights\u00a0because of staffing shortages, including among air traffic controllers.",
      "In the event of a shutdown, the more than 14,000 air traffic controllers in the U.S. would be expected to show up to work without pay.",
      "What would a government shutdown mean for passport processing?",
      "According to the State Department's contingency plan, consular operations will continue as normal \"so long as there are sufficient fees to support operation,\" given that they are integral to national security. That includes passport and visa services.",
      "Still, some passport services could be limited, if they are located in buildings run by another agency that is inoperational.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 17:20:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what's driving up home heating costs, and how much families are expected to spend this winter.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to spend more money heating their homes this winter than on holiday gifts, according to new research.",
      "The elevated cost of staying warm indoors amid cold outdoor temperatures comes after an unusually hot summer, that led to households spending bigger shares of their budgets on cooling costs, compared with previous years, according to a report from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA).",
      "On average, spending on home heating this winter is projected to increase by 8.7% to $941, up from $866 last winter. The increased costs are attributed in part to both expected colder temperatures in the Northeast and Midwest states.",
      "The new average expenditure on heating costs outpaces the $902 the average household is expected to spend on Christmas presents this year, according to a forecast from the National Retail Federation.",
      "What's driving up home heating costs?",
      "There are different ways to keep residences warm. Families that use electricity to heat their homes are expected to face the largest increase in costs \u2014 more than 14% \u2014 which will bring the total up to $1,189 from $1,040 from mid-November through mid-March, which NEADA considers to be the winter period.",
      "Driving up prices is the rising cost of updating and maintaining the electric grid. Plus, colder weather is expected to lead to increased consumption.",
      "\"It's colder, and the cost of electricity is up as the grid is rebuilt. So we're seeing both higher prices and greater usage,\" NEADA Executive Director Mark Wolfe told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Natural gas, propane and heating oil cost differences",
      "Natural gas and propane users are also expected to be hit with bigger bills this winter. Heating costs for natural gas are up just over 3%, for an average cost of $634 for the winter period, compared with $615 for 2023-2024. Costs are expected to rise only modestly in line with wholesale prices.",
      "Propane costs are up 4.4%, with families expected to spend an average of $1,231 heating homes, up from $1,179 last season.",
      "Heating oil costs, by contrast, have declined 2.7%, which means average spending this winter will be $1,518, down from $1,560 last winter.",
      "Early start to the season",
      "November was colder than usual, with temperatures dropping prematurely after a \"very expensive summer\" of heat waves straining cooling resources, said Wolfe.",
      "Blame climate change for the big swings in temperature, he added.",
      "\"Weather conditions can be very unpredictable even though over time, winters are getting warmer and summers are getting hotter. It's not a straight line, and for consumers, it's quite upsetting because higher utility bills are coming right before Christmas,\" Wolfe said.",
      "Steps to take now",
      "There are steps consumers can take to help keep a lid on home heating costs.",
      "Wolfe urges people to have their thermostats serviced now, before the coldest temperatures of the season roll in. That way, families won't be on the hook for an emergency repair if their thermostat breaks in the middle of a cold front. A tune-up will also help heating systems run more efficiently, he said.",
      "Always close the furnace flue, or else it will lead heat outside the house, advises Wolfe. Lastly, manually turn down the heat at night, if you can, to save up to 10% on your energy bill.",

    "story": [
      "Three Major banks and Zelle rushed to bring a peer-to-peer payment network to market without first ensuring users would be protected against \"widespread\" fraud, alleges a lawsuit filed on Friday by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo ignored customer complaints related to Zelle, with users losing hundreds of millions of dollars in scams, the regulatory agency alleges. Zelle is run by Early Warning Services, which is owned by the three banks named in the CFPB's suit, along with four other financial institutions.",
      "According to the CFPB, bank customers have lost more than $870 million over the seven years Zelle has been in operation. Early Warning and the three banks named in the complaint\u00a0hastily created the payments network to head off rival payment apps including Venmo and CashApp without adequately protecting end users, the suit alleges.",
      "\"The nation's largest banks felt threatened by competing apps, so they rushed to put out Zelle,\" Rohit Chopra, the CFPB's director, said in a statement. \"By their failing to put in place proper safeguards, Zelle became a gold mine for fraudsters, while often leaving victims to fends for themselves.\"",
      "Zelle blasted the CFPB's accusations as \"legally and factually flawed,\" with a spokesperson also suggesting the timing of the suit was \"driven by political factors unrelated\" to the company.",
      "\"The CFPB's headline-grabbing number is misleading, as many reported fraud claims are not found to involve actual fraud after investigation,\" the Zelle spokesperson said of the agency's more than $870 million loss figure.",
      "JPMorgan also accused the agency of pursuing a \"political agenda,\" stating that the agency was \"overreaching its authority by making banks accountable for criminals, even including romance scammers.\"",
      "JPMorgan Chase said it prevents nearly $20 billion in fraud attempts each year, and that 99.95% of its transactions are completed without dispute.",
      "A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment. Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Offered by more than 2,200 banks and credit unions, Zelle has more than 143 million users in the U.S., according to the suit. Customers transferred a total of $481 billion in conducting 1.7 billion transactions during the first half of 2024, the CFPB noted.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of customers filed fraud complaints and were denied assistance by Zelle and the three banks, according to the suit, which noted that some people were advised to contact those behind the fraud to get their money back.",
      "Zelle \"has been slow to implement anti-fraud measures, including closing accounts accused of fraud,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report, pointing to the CFPB's allegations. \"It also permitted the registration of emails that were impersonating legitimate entities, including Zelle itself.\"",
      "Since Zelle launched in 2017, according to the CFPB, JPMorgan Chase received 420,00 customer complaints involving more than $360 million; Bank of America heard from 210,000 customers with more than $290 million in fraud losses; and Wells Fargo tallied $220 million in fraud losses by 280,000 people.",
      "\"These troubling alleged practices need to be addressed by all parties as quickly as possible,\" Mike Litt, consumer campaign director at US PIRG, a consumer advocacy group. \"It's crucial that in our increasingly cashless age, we have digital financial systems that the public can trust and use without fear of losing their money.\"",
      "In 2023 Early Warning\u00a0began refunding money to an undisclosed number of fraud victims amid pressure from lawmakers. In late 2022, Sen. Elizabeth Warren issued a report that found increasing incidents of fraud and scams to be occurring on the popular payment app, with large banks typically reluctant to compensate victims, the Massachusetts Democrat said.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 12:46:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of Medicare enrollees are likely to see relief in 2025 when a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription drug-spending goes into effect.",
    "story": [
      "Starting Jan. 1, millions of Americans who get their prescription drugs through Medicare could get a major financial break when a $2,000 out-of-pocket spending cap on medications goes into effect.",
      "The yearly price cap has been in the works since President Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law in 2022, with that legislation including provisions tackling drug costs for seniors as well as other Americans. While some of those other rules have already kicked in, such as a $35 price cap on insulin for seniors, Medicare's $2,000 drug cap will become effective starting next month.",
      "The out-of-pocket cost cap could be a \"game changer\" for many seniors, Ryan Ramsey, the associate director of health coverage and benefits at the National Council on Aging (NCOA) told CBS MoneyWatch. In the first year of the cap, about 3.2 million Medicare recipients are likely to see lower costs due to the new rule, particularly seniors who take multiple medications or have high-cost prescriptions,\u00a0according to an analysis from AARP.",
      "Before the law, there was no out-of-pocket cap for Medicare's Part D, the section that covers prescription drugs, which left seniors at risk of \"significant financial burdens,\" the AARP noted.",
      "\"Having a cap where somebody can know, 'Hey, this is what my maximum out of pocket will be for my medication,' that will be an enormous deal,\" Ramsey noted.",
      "Here's what to know about the new Medicare prescription drug spending cap.",
      "Who is covered by the new Medicare drug cap?",
      "The new $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on prescription drugs covers everyone with a Medicare Part D plan, which is the section of Medicare that covers most pharmaceutical products. The annual new cap also includes people with drug plans through Medicare Advantage, which are health plans offered by private insurers.",
      "There are more than 50 million older Americans who have either Part D or prescription plans through Medicare Advantage, according to health policy site KFF.",
      "Will Medicare's so-called \"donut hole\" still exist?",
      "No, according to Medicare. \"Because of the prescription drug law, the coverage gap ends on Dec. 31, 2024,\" its website states.",
      "The so-called \"donut hole,\" or coverage gap, has affected almost all prescription plans. In the current calendar year, seniors could enter the donut hole once they and their plans had spent more than $5,030 on drug costs, at which point they were on the hook for out-of-pocket drug costs until they hit $8,000 in spending. Catastrophic coverage would kick in above that amount and cover additional spending.",
      "Which prescription drugs are covered by the Medicare cap?",
      "The $2,000 cap includes all the prescriptions that are in a Medicare recipient's Plan D formulary, or a plan's list of covered drugs. That means that if a doctor prescribes a drug that's not on your formulary, it won't be covered by the $2,000 cap, potentially adding to your costs.",
      "Medicare enrollees can ask their doctors to prescribe drugs that are covered on their formulary, Ramsey noted.",
      "\"What I advise, in a situation where you are prescribed a new prescription, take your formulary to the doctor's office. Say it's a drug pressure medication, and you can say, 'Can you make sure you can prescribe something that's on my plan?,'\" he noted.",
      "In other cases, such as for new medications or drugs for which there aren't alternatives, Medicare enrollees can ask for a drug exception, which can be granted if deemed medically necessary, according to Medicare.",
      "Because formularies can change their coverage each year, and people's prescriptions can also vary over time, it's important to check your Part D plan during open enrollment each year to ensure you're in the best drug plan for your needs, Ramsey added. Open enrollment typically occurs between mid-October to early December.",
      "Do I need to sign up for the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap?",
      "No, the cap will automatically be applied to your Part D plan, and the plan will track your spending. Once you hit $2,000, the new cap will go into effect and cover your eligible drug costs beyond that amount.",
      "What costs are covered in the $2,000 Medicare Part D spending cap?",
      "The new measure will cover medications included in your formulary, as well as your deductible, copayments and coinsurance for drugs that qualify for the cap.",
      "However, the cap doesn't include coverage for drugs outside of your Part D plan, which means that it also doesn't apply to pharmaceuticals covered by Medicare Part B, which include drugs you typically wouldn't give to yourself, such as injectables that you'd get at a medical office.",
      "It also doesn't cover your Part D premiums.",
      "The cap will allow people \"to make better decisions on how to get their health care,\" Ramsey noted. Prior to this change, \"I have had discussions with people, 'Am I going to buy groceries late in the year or pay for my prescriptions?'\"",

      "\"Important factors common among the top-performing markets in 2025 include available inventory at affordable price points, a better chance of unlocking low mortgage rates, higher income growth for young adults and net migration into specific metro areas,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist and senior vice president of research, in the report.",
      "One of those factors is the share of \"locked-in\" homeowners in a given area \u2014 those with low mortgage rates from previous years who are in no rush to sell and take on new loans at much higher rates. Areas with fewer locked-in homeowners were considered by NAR to be hotter than others as they are more likely to see properties listed. More listings means and more opportunities for buyers.",
      "Predictions for 2025",
      "NAR expects mortgage rates to stabilize, if not fall as sharply as some house-hunters were hoping, next year. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced its third straight cut in its benchmark rate, lowering the federal funds rate by another quarter of a percentage point. Although mortgage rates don't always mirror the Fed's rate moves, they tend to track the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, rising or falling along with the return on government debt.",
      "NAR thinks the Fed will continue to cut borrowing costs in 2025 and predicts that mortgage rates will settle around 6%, bringing in millions more buyers back to the market. The Fed is now hinting at only two rate cuts in 2025, down from its previous projection in September of four. Experts expect mortgage rates may come down slightly with the Fed's the latest reduction possibly contributing to a modest decline.",
      "The real estate group also expects home prices to rise further in the coming year, though more slowly than in 2024. The number of homes on the market is \u00a0and will continue to increase in 2025.",
      "\"Homebuyers will have more success next year,\" Yun said in the report. \"The worst of the affordability challenges are over as more inventory, stable mortgage rates and continued job and income growth pave the way for more Americans to achieve homeownership.\"",
      "Here, in alphabetical order, are NAR's 10 top housing hot spots for 2025.",
      "Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Massachusetts-New Hampshire",
      "Buying a home in Boston-Cambridge-Newton area isn't exactly cheap, with home prices averaging $694,494, according to Zillow. That's more than $200,000 north of the national average home price of\u00a0$430,584.",
      "Still, the metro area has a number of strengths. For one, NAR expects the local housing market, which includes portions of southern New Hampshire, next year to benefit from stabilizing mortgage rates, which would likely mean fewer locked-in homeowners. Mortgage rates in Boston typically skew lower than the national average, according to the real estate group, which noted that Boston also has a good number starter-homes. Typically priced at 85% of the median-priced home, starter homes are critical for first-time buyers.",
      "Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, North Carolina-South Carolina",
      "In addition to 10% job growth over the last five years, Charlotte has a significant share of affordable housing, with 43% of homes priced below $324,000 \u2014 a huge draw for first-time buyers and young families. The average interest rate in the area is 6.85%, slightly below the national average of 6.89% for a 30-year fixed mortgage.",
      "Grand Rapids-Kentwood, Michigan",
      "Grand Rapids, Michigan, offers an ample stock of affordable homes, with the average home price at $271,960, while mortgage rates hover around 6.9%, slightly above the national average. But because Grand Rapids has a small proportion of mortgage originations with rates below 6%, NAR predicts fewer lock-ins and more listings in 2025.",
      "Greenville-Anderson, South Carolina",
      "With home prices averaging $307,315 and a large influx of new residents, houses in Greenville don't stay listed for long \u2014 typically about 17 days. Mortgage rates run just above the national average, at 6.9%, most likely because of recent foreclosures happening in the state, according to MorgageRates.com.",
      "NAR points to the 42% of homes categorized as starter homes in Greenville as another reason why it predicts the local housing market will be a standout for families and young professionals in 2025.",
      "Hartford-East-Hartford-Middletown, Connecticut",
      "When it comes to affordability, Hartford's average home price of $178,696 is hard to beat. In 2023, The city's average mortgage rate of 6.5% was one of the lowest among the top markets. Connecticut's capital city also has the highest proportion of homeowners surpassing the area's average tenure of 17 years, an indication of a potential increase in local inventory, according to NAR.",
      "Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, Indiana",
      "Indianapolis made NAR's list because of strong job growth and housing affordability. Nearly 42% of the housing stock is priced below $236,000, with the average home value at $223,261. \"With fewer 'locked-in' homeowners than the national level, this area is likely to see more available inventory as mortgage rates stabilize around 6% next year,\" according to NAR.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri-Kansas",
      "Kansas City's generally lower average mortgage rate and smaller share of locked-in homeowners makes it a favorable market for financing and inventory. The average house is priced at $233,826, making homeownership in the area affordable for one in three millennials. Affordability plus competitive financing will make the Kansas City housing market a top performer in 2025, according to NAR.",
      "Knoxville, Tennessee",
      "One of the hottest housing markets in Tennessee, Knoxville is a place where newcomers go to settle down \u2014 roughly 50% of movers to the area decide to buy a home, NAR says. The average value of a home in Knoxville is $350,614, making this city located in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains affordable compared with other major cities.",
      "Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, Arizona",
      "The average home value in Phoenix is $414,977. The relatively affordable housing stock, plus a comparatively lower cost of living and strong job growth, have made Arizona's capital city a key destination for Californians looking to relocate. \"Demographic shifts and economic expansion has established Phoenix as a prosperous and dynamic market,\" according to NAR.",
      "San Antonio-New Braunfels, Texas",
      "The average home in San Antonio is priced at\u00a0$250,834, which makes it one of the few markets to see a decrease in residential real estate costs over the past year. The city, home of The Alamo, also has had one of the strongest records of job growth in the U.S. in recent years, according to the NAR report, and it continues to attract a steady influx of new residents.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Biden administration is canceling federal student loans for another 55,000 workers through an existing program known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness.",
      "The Education Department's announcement Friday targets teachers, nurses, service members, law enforcement officials and others who've reached eligibility through the program, which promises to erase loans after 10 years of work in government or nonprofit jobs.",
      "The $4.28 billion in relief is expected to be the final round of public service loan forgiveness before President Biden leaves office in January. After failing to deliver his promise of widespread loan cancellation, Mr. Biden has instead focused on expanding loan relief through programs that were created before his presidency.",
      "Under Mr. Biden, the Education Department loosened the rules for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which previously had a 99% rejection rate amid burdensome rules and widespread confusion over eligibility requirements.",
      "With the latest round of relief, Mr. Biden has now canceled an unprecedented $180 billion in federal student loans through existing programs, covering 4.9 million Americans. That includes $78 billion for roughly 1 million borrowers through the PSLF.",
      "\"From Day One of my Administration, I promised to make sure that higher education is a ticket to the middle class, not a barrier to opportunity,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \"Because of our actions, millions of people across the country now have the breathing room to start businesses, save for retirement, and pursue life plans they had to put on hold because of the burden of student loan debt.\"",
      "Still, he has fallen short of his goal to deliver widespread relief to millions of other Americans. Mr. Biden's first attempt at mass cancellation was blocked by the Supreme Court, and his second attempt remains tangled in a legal battle brought by Republican states.",
      "In October, he proposed another rule that would cancel loans for people facing various kinds of financial hardship, though it's unlikely to take effect.",
      "President-elect Trump hasn't detailed student loan plans for his second term, but on the campaign trail he called Mr. Biden's cancellation plans illegal and \"vile.\" Republicans in Congress have slammed Mr. Biden over his cancellation work, saying it unfairly transfers the burden to taxpayers who didn't go to college or already repaid their loans.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 16:16:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A Chicago man was stuck with a big medical bill after undergoing a colonoscopy that found no evidence of cancer. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Tom Contos is an avid runner. When he started experiencing rectal bleeding in March, he thought exercise could be the cause and tried to ignore it. But he became increasingly worried when the bleeding continued for weeks.",
      "The Chicago health care consultant contacted his physician at Northwestern Medicine, who referred him for a diagnostic colonoscopy, at least partly because Contos, 45, has a family history of colon issues.",
      "\"I work out a lot,\" he said. \"But my partner said this isn't normal. My primary care physician said, 'Given your family history, let's get you in.'\"",
      "Northwestern Memorial Hospital asked him to prepay $1,000 out-of-pocket, and he underwent the procedure in June.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "Colonoscopies are performed in the United States more than 15 million times a year. Rates of colorectal cancer are on the rise, particularly among younger people.",
      "The procedure, which is also a recommended screening for people 45 or older, involves examining the large intestine using a tube with a video camera that can also collect tissue samples.",
      "It typically takes less than one hour, with another hour spent taking the patient's history, administering anesthesia, and monitoring their recovery, said Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy.",
      "According to Contos' medical record, the gastroenterologist who performed his colonoscopy described it as \"not difficult.\" He biopsied and removed small growths called polyps from two spots and identified large internal hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins.",
      "The biopsy samples were sent to pathology for testing and found to be precancerous. But the gastroenterologist reported finding no evidence of cancer, and after reviewing the pathology report, he concluded hemorrhoids were the likely cause of the bleeding.",
      "The final bill",
      "The hospital charged a total of $19,206 for the procedure, including physician fees. The insurer negotiated the price to $5,816 and paid $1,979, leaving a patient share of $4,047. (It wasn't clear why the payments added up to slightly more than the negotiated price.) After Contos had paid $1,000 up front, plus $1,381 right after the procedure, the hospital said he still owed $1,666.",
      "The billing problem: Colonoscopies that find polyps cost more",
      "Contos was shocked and angry when he received his itemized bill. \"I said, 'I don't understand this.' Then I started to research the cost.\"",
      "He asked the hospital what it charges for a diagnostic colonoscopy and was told he'd been sent a cost estimate through his online patient portal prior to the procedure.",
      "The estimate, which took his deductible of $3,200 into account, listed a total price of $7,203, with an out-of-pocket bill of $2,381. He asked Northwestern why the charges were nearly three times the estimate and why his out-of-pocket share was nearly twice as high.",
      "One big reason was revealed in an explanation of benefits (EOB) statement from Contos' insurance company, Aetna: Northwestern had charged for two colonoscopies, at $5,466 each. And there were two fees for the gastroenterologist \u2014 $1,535 and $1,291.",
      "The first procedure was listed as \"colonoscopy and biopsy,\" while the second was listed as \"colonoscopy w/lesion removal.\" Aetna's negotiated member rate reduced the first $5,466 hospital charge to $3,425, while the charge for the second procedure was lowered to $1,787 \u2014 $1,638 less.",
      "Neither the bill nor the EOB explained why there was a second procedure listed, at a reduced price.",
      "After examining Contos' bill, Littenberg said it's standard for providers to bill for two colonoscopies if they remove two or more polyps in different ways, because of the extra work. As in this case, hospitals typically use a modifier code that reduces the amount charged for the second billed colonoscopy so they charge only for the extra work, he added.",
      "\"How do you explain that in sensible terms that anyone could understand?\" Littenberg said.",
      "Even with that reduction, Littenberg said, he thought Contos' total out-of-pocket cost of $4,047 was \"a lot, though not rare for large academic centers.\"",
      "Contos' insurance documents show Aetna's negotiated rate for his colonoscopy at Northwestern was more than twice the insurer's median negotiated rate for the same procedure at other Chicago-area hospitals, according to Forrest Xiao, director of quantitative research at Turquoise Health, a company that gathers health care price data.",
      "In exchanges with Northwestern and Aetna representatives, Contos asked why he was charged for two colonoscopies. A Northwestern representative said that because of the modifier code, he wasn't actually being billed for two procedures, which Contos found bewildering.",
      "\"I told Northwestern, 'I'm not paying that, and I don't care if you send me to collections,'\" he said. He filed appeals with the hospital and Aetna but was ultimately told the billing was correct.",
      "The resolution",
      "In an email, Contos told the billing department that its charge was \"ridiculously high.\" A representative responded that Northwestern's pricing is in line with other academic medical centers in Chicago and \"non-negotiable\" \u2014 and that his account would be turned over to a collections agency.",
      "CVS Health spokesperson Phillip Blando said in a written statement to KFF Health News that the claims for Contos were \"paid accurately\" by Aetna, declining further comment. (CVS Health owns Aetna.)",
      "Northwestern did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Contos said he wrote to his physician that he was regretfully dropping him and leaving Northwestern entirely because of the health system's high pricing.",
      "He said he's still experiencing periodic symptoms, which he relieves with over-the-counter Preparation H. A one-ounce tube of the ointment costs $10.99 at CVS.",
      "The takeaway",
      "To get a colonoscopy at a lower price, Littenberg said, patients should consider going to a freestanding endoscopy center or ambulatory surgery center not associated with a hospital. A 2023 study found that ambulatory surgery centers billed insurers an average of about $1,030 for a colonoscopy with biopsy or with removal of a polyp, compared with $1,760 at a hospital.",

      "More from the series",
      "To get a sense of how much a diagnostic colonoscopy could cost, patients can consult a hospital's price website and an insurer's cost-estimator website, both required by federal price transparency rules.",
      "Patients also can look up a good-faith estimate of the cash price, which can be lower than the price for patients using insurance to pay for a procedure. In addition, they can check prices through websites such as Turquoise Health and Fair Health, which draw from federal price transparency data or claims data from insurers.",
      "Still, the actual cost could be higher than the estimate if the colonoscopy finds one or more polyps that need to be removed and biopsied, which occurs in at least 40% of all colonoscopies, Littenberg said. Patients should ask whether the price includes those potentially extra services. After all, the point of a diagnostic colonoscopy is to find and, if necessary, treat lesions that could cause problems \u2014 regardless of the number found.",
      "It all should be easier for patients, Xiao said: \"You shouldn't have to be a medical billing expert to know what you're going to pay.\"",

      "The St. Louis-based company watches social media and gets ideas from talking to store employees and patrons, John said. It usually takes Build-A-Bear up to a year to introduce a new stuffed toy, she said, but the company can move faster if it spots a trend. It sometimes tests a small batch online to make sure a trend is sticking, John said.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 12:08:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Products sold as tabletop firepits, firepots, miniature fireplaces or portable fires for indoor use are \"extremely dangerous,\" consumer agency warns.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are being urged not to buy or use liquid-burning portable firepits sold for tabletops and other uses following the deaths of two people and dozens of injuries.",
      "Sold as tabletop firepits, firepots, miniature fireplaces or portable fires for indoor use, \"these firepits are extremely dangerous and have been associated with two deaths and at least 60 injuries since 2019,\" the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday in issuing a consumer alert. \"Consumers should immediately stop using and dispose of these products. Sellers should stop selling these products,\" the agency stated.",
      "The warning follows the June deaths of an elderly couple, Herm and Thelma Stolzenburg, in Dover, New Hampshire. Both were engulfed in flames from a tabletop firepit their family was seated around, Dee McEneaney, their daughter, relayed to CBS News in Boston. \"All of a sudden, these flames shot out and like a blow torch, is all I describe it as. That totally took over both my parents' bodies,\" McEneaney told WBZ-TV in July.",
      "Married for 71 years, McEneaney's 93-year-old parents died three days apart a week after the accident from third-degree burn injuries.",
      "A Hanover, Massachusetts, is also speaking out about the potential dangers. Katelyn Little was gifted a tabletop firepit in the summer, and just after setting it up, it erupted into flames, setting her on fire.",
      "Little jumped in the pool in her backyard to put out the flames, and was then hospitalized, unable to move with second- and third-degree burns all over her body. \"I was there for a total of four days being treated by the burn unit. With daily dressing changes and soaks and I didn't get out of bed for four days. I couldn't walk,\" Little said. \"It was just, it was horrible,\" she\u00a0told WBZ earlier this month.",
      "Little opted to share what happened to her while noticing the popularity of the firepits while shopping for the holidays.",
      "\"When I search Yankee swap gifts under $30, it's pretty much the No. 1 gift that comes up right now,\" Little said. \"A lot of different companies are making them.\"",
      "The CPSC recently warned against FLIKRFIRE Tabletop Fireplaces and announced the recall of Colsen-branded firepits after a series of alarming incidents left 19 people with burn injuries, with some requiring surgery and others permanently disfigured.",
      "Fire pits that require pouring isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol or other liquid fuel into an open container or bowl and then ignite the pooled liquid in the same location in which it was poured violate voluntary safety requirements.",
      "Isopropyl alcohol, ethanol/bioethanol, and similar liquid fuels burn with flame temperatures over 1,600\u00b0F and can cause third-degree burns in less than one second. Igniting a pool of alcohol or other liquid fuel in a firepit's open container creates an uncontrollable pool fire, which can suddenly produce larger, hotter flames that can spread beyond the firepit product, according to the agency.",
      "Flame jetting, a second hazard, can occur when refilling alcohol or other liquid-burning firepits while a flame is present. A small flame in the firepit can be hard to see and can ignite alcohol or other liquid fuel as it is poured, causing an explosion that propels flames and burning liquid onto the consumer or bystanders.",

      "U.S. stocks are stabilizing Thursday following one of their worst days of the year.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 0.4% in morning trading, a day after tumbling 2.9% when the Federal Reserve said it may deliver fewer cuts to interest rates next year than earlier thought. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 194 points, or 0.5%, as of 10:05 a.m. Eastern time, following Wednesday's drop of more than 1,100 points. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.5%.",
      "Indexes are still near their records, and the S&P 500 is still on track for one of its best years of the millennium. Wednesday's drop just took some of the enthusiasm out of the market, which critics had already been warning was overly buoyant and would need everything to go correctly for it to justify its high prices.",
      "Traders are now expecting the Federal Reserve to deliver just one or maybe two cuts to interest rates next year, according to data from CME Group. A month ago, the majority saw at least two cuts in 2025 as a safe bet. Wall Street loves lower interest rates because they give the economy a boost and goose prices for investments, but they can also provide fuel for inflation.",
      "Darden Restaurants, the company behind Olive Garden and other chains, helped lift the market Thursday after leaping 13.4%. It delivered profit for the latest quarter that edged past analysts' expectations. The operator of LongHorn Steakhouses also gave a forecast for revenue for this fiscal year that topped analysts'.",
      "Accenture rose 6.5% after the consulting company topped expectations for profit in the latest quarter. CEO Julie Sweet said it saw growth around the world, and the company raised its forecast for revenue this fiscal year.",
      "Amazon shares added 1.6%, even as workers at seven of its facilities went on strike Thursday, right in the middle of the online retail giant's busiest time of the year. Amazon says it doesn't expect an impact on its operations during what the workers' union calls the largest strike against the company in U.S. history.",
      "They helped offset a tumble for Micron Technology, which fell 17.4% despite reporting stronger profit than expected. The computer memory company's revenue fell short of Wall Street's forecasts, and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said it expects demand from consumers to remain weaker in the near term. It gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that was well short of what analysts were thinking.",
      "Lamb Weston, which makes French fries and other potato products, dropped 19.1% after falling short of analysts' expectations for profit and revenue in the latest quarter. It also cut its financial targets for the fiscal year, saying demand for frozen potatoes is continuing to soften, particularly outside North America. The company replaced its chief executive.",
      "In the bond market, yields were mixed a day after shooting higher on expectations that the Fed would deliver fewer cuts to rates in 2025. Reports on the U.S. economy came in mixed.",
      "One showed the overall economy grew at a 3.1% annualized rate during the summer, faster than earlier thought. The economy has remained remarkably resilient even though the Fed held its main interest rate at a two-decade high for a while before beginning to cut them in September.",
      "A separate report showed fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, an indication that the job market also remains solid. But a third report said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region is unexpectedly contracting again despite economists' expectations for growth.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.56% from from 4.52% late Wednesday and from less than 4.20% earlier this month.",
      "But the two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for action by the Fed in the near term, edged back to 4.31% from 4.35%.",
      "The rise in longer-term yields has put pressure on the housing market by keeping mortgage rates higher. Homebuilder Lennar fell 4.6% after it reported weaker profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected.",
      "CEO Stuart Miller said that \"the housing market that appeared to be improving as the Fed cut short-term interest rates, proved to be far more challenging as mortgage rates rose\" through the quarter.",
      "\"Even while demand remained strong, and the chronic supply shortage continued to drive the market, our results were driven by affordability limitations from higher interest rates,\" he said.",
      "In stock markets abroad, London's FTSE 100 fell 1.2% after the Bank of England paused its cuts to rates and kept its main interest rate unchanged on Thursday. The move comes as inflation there moved further above the central bank's 2% target rate, while the British economy is flatlining at best.",

    "story": [
      "A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving a decision to President Joe Biden, a longtime opponent of the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Mr. Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March of this year and now has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is that Nippon Steel also has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "The interagency committee reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks. Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Mr. Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "The Washington Post earlier reported CFIUS' submission of its report.",
      "Under the terms of the approximately\u00a0$14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steel-producing companies in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union has said it doesn't believe Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\"Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it's up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\" David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \"We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel had waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \"is the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel's blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",

    "summary": "President Biden vetoed an effort to add 66 federal district judgeships, saying \"hurried action\" by the House left important questions unanswered.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Monday vetoed a once-bipartisan effort to add 66 federal district judgeships, saying \"hurried action\" by the House left important questions unanswered about the life-tenured positions.",
      "The legislation would have spread the establishment of the new trial court judgeships over more than a decade to give three presidential administrations and six Congresses the chance to appoint the new judges. The bipartisan effort was carefully designed so that lawmakers wouldn't knowingly give an advantage to either political party in shaping the federal judiciary.",
      "The Democratic-controlled Senate passed the measure unanimously in August. But the Republican-led House brought it to the floor only after Republican Donald Trump was reelected to a second term as president in November, adding the veneer of political gamesmanship to the process.",
      "The White House had said at the time that Mr. Biden would veto the bill.",
      "\"The House of Representative's hurried action fails to resolve key questions in the legislation, especially regarding how the new judgeships are allocated, and neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate explored fully how the work of senior status judges and magistrate judges affects the need for new judgeships,\" the president said in a statement.",
      "\"The efficient and effective administration of justice requires that these questions about need and allocation be further studied and answered before we create permanent judgeships for life-tenured judges,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "He said the bill would also have created new judgeships in states where senators haven't filled existing judicial vacancies and that those efforts \"suggest that concerns about judicial economy and caseload are not the true motivating force behind passage of this bill now.",
      "\"Therefore, I am vetoing this bill,\" Mr. Biden said, essentially dooming the legislation for the current Congress. Overturning his veto would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, and the House vote fell well short of that margin.",
      "Organizations representing judges and attorneys had urged Congress to vote for the bill. They argued that the lack of new federal judgeships had contributed to profound delays in the resolution of cases and serious concerns about access to justice.",
      "Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., reacted swiftly, calling the veto a \"misguided decision\" and \"another example of why Americans are counting down the days until President Biden leaves the White House.\" He alluded to a full pardon Mr. Biden recently granted his son Hunter on federal gun and tax charges.",
      "\"The President is more enthusiastic about using his office to provide relief to his family members who received due process than he is about giving relief to the millions of regular Americans who are waiting years for their due process,\" Young asserted. \"Biden's legacy will be 'pardons for me, no justice for thee.'\"",
      "The Senate confirmed two more of Mr. Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary on Friday \u2014 giving him a total of 235 since he took office and surpassing\u00a0the number of federal judges\u00a0approved during President-elect Donald Trump's first term.",
      "Mr. Biden said in a statement at that time: \"Judges matter. They shape the everyday lives of Americans, preserving our freedoms and defending our liberties. They hear cases and issue rulings on whether Americans can cast their ballots, whether workers can unionize and make a living wage for their families, and whether children can breathe clean air and drink clean water. I am proud of the legacy I will leave with our nation's judges.\"",

      "\"I respect the court's ruling and will appeal,\" Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "The law would have created a new process to challenge library materials and request that they be relocated to areas not accessible to children. The measure was signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in 2023, but an earlier ruling had temporarily blocked it from taking effect while it was being challenged in court.",
      "\"The law deputizes librarians and booksellers as the agents of censorship; when motivated by the fear of jail time, it is likely they will shelve only books fit for young children and segregate or discard the rest,\" Brooks wrote in his ruling.",
      "A coalition that included the Central Arkansas Library System in Little Rock had challenged the law, saying fear of prosecution under the measure could prompt libraries and booksellers to no longer carry titles that could be challenged.",
      "\"This was an attempt to 'thought police,' and this victory over totalitarianism is a testament to the courage of librarians, booksellers, and readers who refused to bow to intimidation,\" said Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas.",
      "But supporters of the law, known as Act 372, say they will continue to fight for its implementation.",
      "\"Act 372 is just common sense: schools and libraries shouldn't put obscene material in front of our kids,\" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement to KATV-TV. \"I will work with Attorney General Griffin to appeal this ruling and uphold Arkansas law.\"",

      "Bowers, 51, received the death penalty in August 2023 after he was convicted of 63 federal counts for the 2018 attack at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Bowers shot and killed 11 worshipers and wounded seven people in the deadliest antisemetic attack in U.S. history.",
      "A truck driver who had a history of making antisemitic statements online, Bowers was armed with an AR-15 rifle and three handguns when he opened fire during Saturday morning prayers. Federal prosecutors said he turned the synagogue into a \"killing ground,\" and police said Bowers told them \"all Jews need to die.\"",
      "The Justice Department said Bowers \"meticulously planned\" the attack based on his antisemitic beliefs.",
      "Dylann Roof",
      "A jury sentenced Roof to death in 2017 for the mass shooting at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015, making him the first person ordered to be executed for a federal hate crime. Nine Black parishioners were killed and three were wounded in the attack, which took place during a Bible study.",
      "Prosecutors said before Roof mounted the racially motivated assault, he posted a manifesto online that used racial slurs and expressed a belief that White people are superior to African Americans. They said Roof wanted to attack Black worshipers to stoke racial conflict.",
      "Roof was convicted of 33 counts in 2016. He appealed his conviction, with his attorneys arguing that Roof was wrongly allowed to represent himself during the sentencing phase of his trial. But a federal appeals court upheld Roof's conviction and death sentence in 2021.",
      "\"Dylann Roof murdered African Americans at their church, during their Bible study and worship. They had welcomed him. He slaughtered them. He did so with the express intent of terrorizing not just his immediate victims at the historically important Mother Emanuel Church, but as many similar people as would hear of the mass murder,\" a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit wrote in its ruling.",

      "The jury recommended, and a federal district court imposed, the death penalty on six of 17 capital counts.",
      "Three people were killed and scores more were injured during the attack. Tsarnaev's role in the bombing is not disputed \u2014 his attorneys acknowledged he and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, detonated two homemade explosive devices near the finish line of the marathon. But Tsarnaev's lawyers said Tamerlan Tsarnaev was the mastermind behind the attack, and the younger Tsarnaev, who was 19 at the time of the attack, acted under his brother's influence.",
      "The two brothers attempted to flee Massachusetts following the attack, sparking a four-day manhunt that put Boston and the surrounding areas on lockdown. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested by police after he was discovered hiding out in a boat behind a house in Watertown, Massachusetts. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with police during their pursuit of the two brothers.",

      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to review the 1st Circuit's decision, arguing a new sentencing proceeding would impose significant burdens on the victims of the 2013 bombing. The Biden administration maintained that position in the case, despite the president's opposition to the death penalty.",

      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz had sex with a minor",
      "The committee says in its report that there is \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz engaged in sexual activity with a minor, detailing two alleged encounters with a 17-year-old girl at a party in 2017 when the former congressman was 35, in violation of Florida's statutory rape law.",
      "The committee said it obtained testimony from the girl, identified as \"Victim A,\" as well as other witnesses who corroborated the allegations. The report also notes that evidence suggests Gaetz was not aware that the girl was 17 until more than a month after the sexual encounters. Victim A had just completed her junior year of high school when the encounter occurred, the report says.",
      "The report says Gaetz maintained contact with Victim A, and less than six months after she turned 18, he \"met up with her again for commercial sex.\" Victim A said she received $400 from Gaetz that was understood to be payment for sex at the party, the committee said.",
      "Gaetz has previously denied these allegations and has not been charged with a crime. In a recent post on X, he wrote: \"I NEVER had sexual contact with someone under 18.\u00a0 Any claim that I have would be destroyed in court - which is why no such claim was ever made in court.\"",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz paid women for sex",
      "The report found \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz paid women for sex and had others pay them on his behalf, in violation of Florida state law.",
      "The report lists payments to 12 different women totaling more than $90,000 between 2017 and 2020, paid via check or apps like PayPal, Venmo and CashApp.",
      "The report notes that there was no evidence that the sex acts were \"induced by force, fraud, or coercion.\"",
      "One of the women testified that she met up with Gaetz at a hotel, where he was with another man and a 20-year-old woman, and there was an \"expectation\" of a \"sexual encounter,\" after which he gave her a $750 check with \"tuition reimbursement\" written in the memo line. She told the committee that on other occasions \"he had normally sent Venmo payments.\"",
      "Gaetz has denied paying for sex. He wrote on X: \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated - even some I never dated but who asked. I dated several of these women for years.\"",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz used illegal drugs",
      "The report says there is \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz used illegal drugs between 2017 to 2019, including cocaine, ecstasy and marijuana, in violation of state laws.",
      "A number of women understood Gaetz to be a regular user of ecstasy, the report says, while some noted that they had seen him use ecstasy and cocaine at different events. The report says Gaetz appeared to set up a \"pseudonymous e-mail account from his House office in the Capitol complex for the purpose of purchasing marijuana.\"",
      "The committee noted that it also received evidence that Gaetz provided drugs to",
      "women to facilitate sexual encounters.",
      "Gaetz wrote on X: \"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life.\u00a0 I live a different life now.\"",
      "Report found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz accepted luxury travel gifts in violation of House rules",
      "The committee outlines \"substantial evidence\" that Gaetz accepted gifts exceeding the amount allowed under House rules, in connection with a 2018 trip to the Bahamas.",
      "Lawmakers are required to apply to the committee for a waiver in order to accept gifts that surpass a certain cost threshold. The committee said for Gaetz, a flight on a private plane, lodging, meal expenses and entertainment expenses on the trip exceeded the limit.",

Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who briefly stood to become President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be attorney general, was found by congressional ethics investigators to have paid numerous women \u2014 including a 17-year-old girl \u2014 for sex, and to have purchased and used illegal drugs, including from his Capitol Hill office.",
      "Those are among the findings of the long-running investigation by the House Ethics Committee into Gaetz, which concluded the former Florida congressman violated multiple state laws related to sexual misconduct while in office. The\u00a0full report was released by the committee Monday.",

      "Gaetz resigned from Congress in November after Trump announced plans to nominate him for attorney general. But facing opposition from some fellow Republicans, Gaetz withdrew from consideration a week later. The release of the ethics report brings to a close \u2014 at least for now \u2014 Gaetz's incendiary tenure on Capitol Hill, where he became one of the most vocal and provocative members of the pro-Trump faction in Congress.",
      "Gaetz has denied any improper conduct and asserted the claims were a \"smear\" invented by his political enemies. The committee said the congressman refused to sit for sworn testimony, though he did submit written answers to some of the committee's questions.",
      "The report gives fresh voice to allegations of misconduct that have circulated around Gaetz for years, in spite of his firm denials. It draws on testimony from witnesses who told the committee they were paid to have sex with Gaetz, text messages discussing the transactions, and Venmo and PayPal receipts.",
      "Among the report's most lurid findings were the allegations of sex- and drug-fueled parties and travel, including a 2018 trip to the Bahamas where witnesses say he took ecstasy and had sex with four women.",
      "\"From 2017 to 2020, Representative Gaetz made tens of thousands of dollars in payments to women that the Committee determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use,\" noted the report, which lists payments totaling more than $90,000 to 12 different women.",
      "The committee said it also received testimony that at a 2017 party, Gaetz twice had sex with \"Victim A,\" who was 17 years old at the time and had just completed her junior year in high school.",
      "\"Victim A recalled receiving $400 in cash from Representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for sex,\" the committee wrote. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "In his written responses to the committee, Gaetz denied having sex with a minor. The Department of Justice previously investigated Gaetz for violating sex trafficking laws but did not bring charges. The committee said it did not find sufficient evidence Gaetz violated the federal sex trafficking statute because although he transported women across state lines for the purpose of sex, those women were all 18 or older at the time.",
      "The report noted that while all the women who testified said the sexual encounters with Gaetz were consensual, one woman told the committee the use of drugs at the parties and events they attended may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\"",
      "Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report also found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz engaged in rampant illicit drug use. The committee said it obtained text messages he sent where he referred to drugs as \"party favors,\" \"rolls\" or \"vitamins.\" It also said he created a fake email from his Capitol Hill office \"for the purpose of purchasing marijuana.\" The report noted that Gaetz had denied using illicit drugs in his written answers to the committee.",
      "In a statement\u00a0posted on X last week,\u00a0 Gaetz said: \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated - even some I never dated but who asked. I dated several of these women for years. It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.\"",
      "In addition to sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, the report also accused Gaetz of accepting gifts of luxury travel in excess of permissible limits with the 2018 trip to the Bahamas.

Pillen was transported to Nebraska Medicine Sunday afternoon after a horseback riding accident while riding with his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter near Columbus,\" Pillen's office said in a follow-up statement Monday. \"The governor's injuries included minor lacerations to his spleen and kidney, seven broken ribs, a partially collapsed lung resulting from the rib damage, and a minor fracture in one of his vertebrae.

      "Nudging Congress to do their work is technically still President Biden's job, but it was Trump and Musk calling the shots by social media last week. They didn't get all of what they wanted, but will the drama prove to be a preview of what's to come within the GOP in 2025?",
      "We will talk with two House Republicans, Arkansan French Hill and Texan Tony Gonzales.",
      "Then, outgoing Homeland Security Chief Alejandro Mayorkas weighs in on extremism and the immigration crisis.",

      "We are just three days away from Christmas and the start of Hanukkah. Congress has gone home, but is last week's chaos on Capitol Hill an omen of what is ahead in 2025?",
      "Texas Republican Congressman Tony Gonzales is here in studio to answer that.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES (R-Texas): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we just saw turmoil within the party over the past few days after president-elect Trump and Elon Musk scuttled this bipartisan deal, then demanded another deal that couldn't get enough Republican support to get over the finish line.",
      "Then we have this emergency stopgap measure that only takes us through mid- March. You are one of 34 Republicans to vote against it. Why?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: It's pretty simple. My constituents were against the C.R. just as much as I was against the C.R.",
      "It's been a tough week, though. It started with the tragic shooting in Madison, Wisconsin. I have worked in a very bipartisan manner to make sure we have a national strategy that prevents against some of the school shootings that are occurring. I have been working with others to get that done. I think that's important.",
      "And then, in the House, of course, we had this messy bill that was put on the floor. It started with a 1,500-page bill. In my eyes, there's no doubt that there's a sickness in D.C., and that sickness isn't going to be cured with these big, long, pork-filled bills.",
      "You do got to give President Trump a lot of credit, though. He was able to whittle that down to 116 pages. Once again, the reason I voted no is, I think C.R.s are terrible. They do nothing but kick the can down the road. Let's fast forward to March. Do you think we're going to be any closer to coming up with a spending deal then than we are now? I don't think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But if the government had shut down, the Border Patrol agents who live in your district wouldn't have received paychecks.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Right.",
      "That's why we should have done our job, instead of just saying, hey, give us three more months, and I promise you, in three months, we're going to do our job. We have ran that play before.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: We're \u2013 in my eyes, you use Christmas. You use New Year's. You lock everybody in a room and you say, let's get it done now.",
      "There's also a bigger danger to this, too, is, if we're not funding the government long term\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: \u2026 now all of a sudden, you're telling the government you have to spend a year's worth of money in six months or three months. That's not fair to any of these agencies as well.",
      "So, basically, it was a vote on my end to say, let's do our job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, which the Republicans who are in leadership had failed to get some of those bills done. In fact, Speaker Johnson chose to go this route with the C.R.",
      "But I want to ask you about the dynamic here because it's confusing, frankly. I mean, Elon Musk is tweeting against bipartisan deals negotiated and led by the speaker of the House. What role exactly is he playing here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: It's kind of interesting. We have a president. We have a vice president. We have a speaker. And it feels like - - as if Elon Musk is our prime minister.",
      "And I spoke with Elon a couple of times this week. I think many of us\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Unelected.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Well, unelected.",
      "But, I mean, he has a voice. And I think a lot of \u2013 large part of that voice is a reflection of the voice of the people. Once again, these \u2013 a 1,500-page bill, how does that pass the smell test? It's absolutely wrong. It's what's wrong with this place. So we have to get back to regular order.",
      "The other part of it too is, while House Republicans were fighting over this spending bill, guess what Senate Democrats were doing?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: They were ensuring that President Biden got his 235th liberal judge over the finish line. That's why it's so important that House Republicans stay united, stay laser-focused on delivering on a President Trump agenda next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Republicans in the House are clearly not united. And it was Speaker Johnson who led that bipartisan deal.",
      "Do you support him if \u2013 he's standing for reelection. Should he still lead the party, if you're saying he was leading in the wrong direction with a 15-page (sic) initial funding deal?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Yes. And I do. I do support Speaker Johnson. I think he's done a fantastic job keeping us all together. It's like feral cats on the House, right?",
      "So that's a tough job to begin with. But the fact that he was able to work with President Trump in order to whittle it down to a little over 100 pages, the fact that he was able to work with \u2013 with Elon Musk and some of these other folks, other members to find a solution just goes to prove that he's found a way.",
      "But there also \u2013 this can't be the norm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: This cannot be the norm. Once again, that's the reason why I voted against the C.R. is, this cannot be the norm. We have to get back to regular order and pass our appropriations bills.",
      "Homeland security is certainly important to us. There's other things that are going on in the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, because the Republican majority now is so thin, it will also be thin in the new Congress. But, right now, any missed vote gets a lot of attention.",
      "Congresswoman Kay Granger hasn't cast a vote since July. And there was a local reporter in Dallas who looked into this and found the 81-year-old has been living in a local memory care and assisted living facility for some time. That was not shared with the public.",
      "Were you and others in the Texas delegation aware?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I wasn't aware.",
      "I think there's no doubt a lot of us knew that she was gaining in age, like a lot of members do. And, sadly, some of these members wait until it's too long \u2013 too \u2013 too \u2013 things have gone too far.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And leadership allowed for it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I think it's maybe \u2013 I'm not too sure what leadership knew on it or didn't know on it.",
      "I'd say, on the other side of the aisle, it's the same thing. I mean, we saw what happened on the Senate side with Senator Feinstein and some of these others that have missed votes for a long time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I think this goes \u2013 gets back to the root of it. Congress should do its job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And if you can't do your job, maybe you shouldn't be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, she wasn't there. And, apparently, it went either unnoticed or just not acknowledged to the public, which certainly raises eyebrows.",
      "I need to get to the border, because that is \u2013 you have, what, 800 miles of the border in your district.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: That's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Border Patrol had fewer than 50,000 apprehensions at the southern border last month. That's a Biden era low.",
      "Does that mean, coming into office, that essentially the crisis has been fixed before Donald Trump even arrives, and that it's not as big of a project as initially thought?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Oh, no, it's a huge project. And while the Biden administration has started to do some things right, the Trump administration is going to do everything right, in this manner.",
      "And I will tell you why. This is why it's important. Earlier this week, I had a classified briefing on the threat \u2013 the worldwide threats to homeland \u2013 to our homeland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I won't share some of the sensitive stuff, but I will share some of the open-source stuff in Syria. A lot of us are rooting for a free Syria.",
      "A free Syria brings a lot of opportunities for first ability in that region, but it also brings a national security threat. Assad was a bad guy. He imprisoned a lot of folks, sometimes wrongfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Some of those folks are terrorists. Now they are loose. Where are they? Where are they going?",
      "Well, let's bring it back to the southern border. This year, the Biden administration has apprehended 600 Syrians. Does that mean all those Syrians are terrorists?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Of course not.",
      "But do we know who these people are and who are \u2013 and are they coming into our country? This is something that President Trump is going to get to the bottom of.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want to halt refugee admissions, like Donald Trump is talking about? You want to block travel from Muslim-majority countries, like the Trump team is talking about?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I want \u2013 I want the president \u2013 I want the president to enforce the laws that we have on the books, that simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, no? Those aren't laws on the books.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: It\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Refugees are accepted in the United States of America.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And they should be, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: I want us to follow our laws, right? And if \u2013 and if we need to make changes to our laws, Congress should be the body to make those changes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: And in my eyes, we can both protect those that are warm and welcoming.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: We want people to come and live the American dream, those that are fleeing political persecution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: But we also have to go after the criminals and the terrorists.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Tony Gonzales, good to have you here.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TONY GONZALES: Thank you. Merry Christmas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in a minute.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday, we sat down with outgoing DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to get his thoughts on the homeland security challenges facing the new next administration.",
      "Here's part of our conversation.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We recently saw that killing of the UnitedHealthcare division CEO on the streets of Manhattan.",
      "Manhattan prosecutors called it a killing that was intended to evoke terror. Would you consider him a terrorist? Is this domestic violent extremism?",
      "ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS (U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security): The rhetoric on social media following that \u2013 that murder is extraordinarily alarming.",
      "It speaks of what is really bubbling here in this country. And, unfortunately, we see that manifested in violence, the domestic violent extremism that exists. The threat of it in the United States is one of the great threat streams that we must counter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you say something's bubbling, what's the national trend that you're seeing?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: I \u2013 look, we have been concerned about the rhetoric on social media for some time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's against CEOs? That's against the government? That's against leadership?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We've seen narratives of hate. We've seen narratives of anti-government sentiment. We've seen personal grievances.",
      "And the language of violence accompanying or being a part of those narratives is something that we're very concerned about that. That is a heightened threat environment. I still am alarmed, though, by the heroism that is being attributed to an alleged murderer of a father of two children on the streets in New York City.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a lot of that seems to be around the health care industry and what that company was doing. It's depersonalized. The victim is depersonalized.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And \u2013 and the victim is a person.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And the victim is a husband, and the victim is a father.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation has been to the border, toured some of the federal facilities, and we saw some of those small children who came across without parents and without caregivers.",
      "And I don't think \u2013 I certainly won't ever forget that. There were also children who were separated from their families by the Trump administration. The last report we saw shows that Homeland Security reunified just short of 800 children with their parents.",
      "Why is it so hard to reunite families? And how much unfinished business are you leaving behind here?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: So we are very proud of the work that we performed through the Family Reunification Task Force. But there's more work to be done.",
      "Some of the parents who were removed are difficult to find.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Some are reluctant to come forward, worried that the separation could occur again. We're dealing with vulnerable populations who have gone through trauma.",
      "So there are a myriad of challenges, some of which we have been able to overcome, as you note, for 800 or so families, but there's more work to be done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How many are left?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is unclear\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 because the \u2013 we were not left with good records. Data was not kept. And so that was also one of the great challenges that we had to overcome.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: ICE was also unable to account for more than 32,000 unaccompanied kids who failed to appear in court from 2019 to 2023, according to the report we read.",
      "The incoming border czar, Tom Homan, says these children are being exploited and trafficked. Is that true?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Well, we certainly\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we certainly have received reports of children being trafficked, even those as to whom we know where they are.",
      "That is outside the responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: What we do is, we turn children over within 72 hours, as the law requires, to the Department of Health and Human Services, and then HHS places those children.",
      "Of course, we investigate cases of trafficking. But there are children who are reunited with a parent here in the United States or a legal guardian. And they move, and, sometimes, the government loses track. Individuals do not comply with the reporting obligations or otherwise.",
      "I think it is inaccurate to say that all of them are trafficked or victimized.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In December of last year, border crossings were at record highs. Now they've dropped to the lowest level of the Biden administration.",
      "How much of that drop-off is because Mexico is now stopping migrants from even getting to that southern border with the United States?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: That is, critically, one element of it. It is not the only element of it.",
      "The president took executive action in June of this year. That has been a key driver of the \u2013 the low number of encounters at our border. We are now delivering\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 to the incoming administration a southern border at which the number of individuals encountered is well below the level experienced in 2019, the last year before the pandemic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the immigration surge into the U.S. since 2021 has been the largest in American history.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is incredible. So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Oh, it is \u2013 Margaret, it is one element of the greatest displacement of people in the world since World War II.",
      "This is a phenomenon that has not been unique to the southern border of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: It is something that has gripped the entire hemisphere and the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you have said to me one of the very first things the Biden administration did was ask Congress to act in the earliest days.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then, fast forward, you had this bipartisan near- miss on a border bill. All that time passed.",
      "Why wait until five months before the U.S. election to put in place those asylum restrictions that did cut off the flow, that ended the crisis?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, remember where \u2013 Margaret, remember where we were when the president took office. We were in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The prior administration had imposed Title 42, which is a public health authority\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: \u2026 and enabled us to expel individuals, to continue to expel individuals at the border, as the prior administration had done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: There was tremendous pressure to maintain the workings of Title 42, which we did. That held until May of 2023.",
      "We then turned to Congress, and we asked for supplemental funding that was desperately needed to make our administration of a broken immigration system work much better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: We were denied. We went back to Congress a second time and requested supplemental funding.",
      "Denied. We then turned to the bipartisan negotiations, which proved successful, which were then killed. The result of it, a really terrific solution was killed by irresponsible politics.",
      "Looking back now in hindsight, in 20/20, if we had known that irresponsible politics would have killed what was clearly a meritorious effort and a meritorious result, perhaps we would have taken executive action more rapidly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "Because Republicans argue in this back-and-forth over whose job it is to fix the problem, Congress would argue there was executive authority that could have been used before Congress legislated, and they point back to the crisis starting at day one, when Trump era immigration policy was peeled back, remain in Mexico, the 100-day moratorium on most deportations that was announced, the halt to wall construction.",
      "Did those measures \u2013 and I know you weren't yet in office personally, but did those measures set you up for failure?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Remember something. Remain in Mexico is touted as the great panacea.",
      "The trend lines of migration were increasing quite exponentially from 2018 to 2019. And that is reflected worldwide.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "Remember something also about the executive action that the president took in May \u2013 in \u2013 in June of this year. We also over time built capabilities that we did not previously have, not just domestically, the number of facilities that we stood up, the ability to transport individuals and decompress areas that were experiencing surges of individuals, but our negotiations with Mexico, with other countries in Latin America and around the world.",
      "We are now removing or returning more individuals in three years than the prior administration did in four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: And we are doing so not only greater in volume, but greater in speed, because of the negotiations with other countries and to more countries than has ever been the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, why didn't we hear more about those enforcement actions during the election cycle, when immigration was so key?",
      "SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS: Margaret, we've been executing on enforcement at an unprecedented level throughout this administration. And ICE just published data that evidences that quite powerfully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

And that's critical. And I think this last week demonstrated that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will have a fractured conference, a slim majority. Mark Short, who was the director of legislative affairs in the first Trump administration, said this chaos shows just how hard it will be to tackle border and tax policies in 2025.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think Speaker Johnson and, again, Majority Leader Thune, working with President Trump, wanted to use the budget reconciliation process. That's still being discussed as to exactly what that procedure will be. But I believe actually that Republicans on both sides of The Hill are united that we want to unleash American energy for future production and an all of the above energy strategy. We want to secure the border. We want to fight inflation through supply side regulatory reforms. We want to roll back those regulations that are constraining the markets and constraining private business having access to capital.",
      "So, I think we're on the same page. And I think budget reconciliation will be a way to start that process and also rein in unsustainable $2 trillion deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you can do a party line vote in the Senate there with the Republicans, but can you really get 218 Republicans to vote in the same direction when it was such a struggle just with keeping the lights on?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I think we can. I think we demonstrated that last year when we - last year, in the last Congress, when we put together the most comprehensive Republican only voting for border security for an all of the above energy strategy. Those are two priorities that President Trump campaigned on. We are united on those strategies, and I think we can get those priorities across the House floor, as well, as I say, rolling back unneeded regulatory burden on the American economy and small businesses to help fight inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things that was stripped out of that initial bipartisan deal that Speaker Johnson had put together was a restriction on U.S. investments in China. It would have affirmed presidential authority to impose sanctions on advanced technologies.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, look, President Biden had an executive order governing outbound investment. We've had a debate in Congress between the House and Senate on the best way to do that. We all want to limit American investment in dangerous, I would say, dual use technologies that can be turned around and hurt the - America's - America's national security. But striking that balance has been difficult. But I don't believe that was at the heart of the 1,500-page problem. I think people - a majority of members clearly wanted a simple, straightforward, continuing resolution and not what was turned into a large omnibus spending bill on top of a CR.",

And we're very excited to have Lisa McClain from Michigan, our conference chairwoman, and also Maria Salazar from south Florida, joining our committee.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, first, we need the United States to be very active, work with partners to support a free and democratic Syria. Secondly, we need to document the war crimes committed by the Assad regime as it relates to all the people murdered, killed, imprisoned, tortured, in the - from the regime, and also track down the networks that were producing Captagon. We will have support from the kingdom in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states to do that. But it needs to be stopped.",

      "Do you still object?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: And it's not - well, I don't know, but that's how I would characterize what I said. I said it's up to that committee. I think they are - they have released documents before. But I think that's something they should do with a great deal of caution because you open up a pandora's box of a lot of other investigations over many, many years, conducted by that committee. But if they've thought it through, reviewed the material and made that decision, that's their decision.",

I was one of the few Democrats that went over and worked with him and we always got along great. We're very friendly. Had - just - we just had disagreements on some things. But you can do that.",

They have the power. And I think there's enough Republican senators, and Democrat senators too. That are not going to let the filibuster blow apart, they're not going to let basically run amok of the reconciliation process just to do anything they want to. It takes four Republican senators, just four. And I guarantee you, I think there's a lot more than four.",

So, with 51 votes, not the 60, you - you're saying right now that this is - this is not how the system's supposed to work.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet that is what the Republican leader is saying he's going to do right out of the gate.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Hold on, Margaret. If - he's going to have to show the financial connotation and the cost it's causing and how it's harming our country. If it's harming it in the financial burden that we're carrying because of all the illegals coming and he can tie that to it, then he'll have a pathway forward.",

      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: The American Rescue Plan. Not to go in reconciliation. That's basically, when you've given up, that you can't work with the other side, they come out of the box that way. So, this is the plan that the Republicans are following now that the Democrats basically showed them the pathway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it a strategic mistake?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Oh, I think it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, you played a big role in crafting. That was party line. That was through reconciliation.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: That's how the vote came down. We wrote that bill in my committee. And I guarantee you, I had over five years of input for Republicans. But because of reconciliation, they don't cross over and vote. That's just the way it was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you feel good about that?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Well, I feel - no, I feel horrible about that we had to do it in reconciliation. I feel horrible about that. But I can tell you, the United States of America has benefited from that. We didn't fall into a recession. We brought down inflation from 9 to 3 percent. We brought down gas prices from $5 to $3. We did all of that. But the supply chains were so broken because of the pandemic. The prices of everyday staple of life, food, things of that sort, made it almost unbearable for people to - for the burden they were carrying.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president-elect has vowed to repeal it.",

      "If the White House says, I want this type of interpretation, that makes it very, very liberal interpretation. It's not what the bill was supposed to do. I said, you people are going down a primrose path, which is horrible. We didn't write the bill that way. In spite of themselves trying to liberalize and putting EVs out and all of the critical minerals, we're still depending on China when we were supposed to be weaning ourself off of China. He can fix that immediately.",
      "President Trump can come in here and change some of those rules to get back. He - and change - change the bill. It will be his - it will be his energy bill. But, you know -",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you didn't hear much about that from the Democratic ticket during the campaign.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: They couldn't talk about it. He was tongue tied.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I had no idea. I kept saying, can't you just exact - tell what the bill did. They were saying, renewable, renewable, renewable. The only thing I said, you cannot eliminate your way to a cleaner environment, Margaret. You can't just say, I want to get rid of coal. I want to get rid of oil. I want no gas. I want nothing extracted. We're going to do everything with renewables. We'd be a third world country. You can't keep this economy running.",
      "Now, you can do it with innovation, technology. So, I said, we're going to produce what we need, and we do it cleaner and better than anywhere in the world, producing more. So, the bill did exactly on energy production. You wouldn't be number one in the world right now 30 trillion cubic feet of gas, 4.7 billion barrels of oil, you wouldn't do that if we hadn't written that bill. He can take that and even go further with it. There are so many good things in that bill, then he can change it, change the name, it will be his. I'll help any way I can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sound, speaking about energy policy, like a Republican.",
      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I hope I sound like an American. It makes sense. OK? My Democrat friends are so far off the rail. OK, I love them all, but they're - I said, guys. But a lot of them really understand it. They just can't speak it because the base has gone so far. And that's - I just - I couldn't take it anymore.",

      "SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: Thank God for rank choice voting. Without - without rank choice voting, my dear friend Lisa wouldn't be here. Or open primaries. If the Democrat and Republican Party control the primaries, they can control you up here. So, they're going to say, hey, Margaret, I'm sorry, you just didn't toe the line right. You didn't vote with us when we needed you. So, I'm going to find somebody else that I can control.",

If you can do it with respect and just say, Mr. President, I'm so sorry, where I come from that doesn't make sense. I can't explain it back home. I never did say, oh, you're wrong.

      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS (U.S. Special Presidential Envoy For Hostage Affairs): So, it's not going to shock me to find out that there are prisons that have yet to be discovered and searched. I would say if I'm stunned by anything, it's just the amount of prisons. I mean you would almost think that if you were running a country and you wanted to jail your enemies, you'd have one prison, and it wouldn't be secret. But to have, like, 35 or 40 secret prisons, I find that just horrifying, disturbing and yet in a way fascinating.",
      "But really the bottom line is that we have to help and - or rather work with our interim authorities, officials, to make sure we do a good search so that I can one day look Debra Tice in the eyes and tell them that our search has been exhausted.",
      "Now, in a perfect world, we're going to find Austin Tice. I think I've gone on record numerous times saying that I believe that he's alive and he's waiting for me to find him. And the president, not long ago, said that he believes Austin's alive.",

Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS, also known as Mohammed al-Golani, was described by State Department officials as being very pragmatic in those meetings today. But his group and he himself are still technically designated as terrorist under U.S. law because of prior affiliation with al Qaeda.",
      "Do you trust that they are being helpful to the U.S. now?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: They were definitely helpful today. We conducted a joint search of a facility that we thought - we all thought would have a probable, I guess, have some sort of relation to Austin Tice. So, I understand, of course, their past. What I can tell you right - is that right now they're being helpful in the search for Austin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you conducted a joint search with HTS of a prison today. Did you believe that that is where Austin was being held?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: We came up with a priority list of about six sites. And of those six sites, we felt that this had the highest probability of having held Austin at one time. But really the long - the - I guess I would say the best way to describe it is, we're just not sure. With the time that we had on the ground, it seemed to be our best shot. So, we gave it a good, hard look. We're going to review all the information and evidence that we collected, and hopefully render some more decisions about the probability. But really our job is to just to keep searching.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Assad intelligence ministries were known for keeping scrupulously detailed records, numbering prisoners, alive and dead. Do those records still exist?",

Again, in the joint search that we conducted with the interim authorities today, we came across numerous documents. That's going to have to be brought back. It's going to have to be translated from Arabic into English. And sometimes these documents will actually have evidence on them. They may have fingerprints. They may have traces of DNA.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this was a search you conducted along with special operators from JSOC?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: I would never go into talking about who I was with. But I will tell you this, I was with members of the FBI. The hostage recovery fusion cell holds primacy on these cases. People that are experts at looking at crime scenes. And they did a wonderful job of sweeping it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know back in 2020 you went there at the direction of then President Donald Trump along with Kash Patel. The regime at that time never admitted to the United States that they held Austin Tice. Do you believe they were lying back then and that the regime did have him?",
      "AMBASSADOR ROGER CARSTENS: The regime, when we talked to them in 2020, they issued maximalist demands. They want - they asked for the world. They weren't really giving anything. They never admitted to having Austin Tice. They never promised to give us any proof of life, POL as we call it.",

      "The judge said the string of messages that Lamond and Tarrio exchanged over the course of months revealed a pattern: \"Lamond and Tarrio talk, and Tarrio immediately disseminates what he learns,\" Jackson said.",
      "She referred to Tarrio as an \"awful witness\" who was \"flippant, grandiose and obnoxious\" on the stand.",
      "\"He was one of the worst I've had the opportunity to sit next to during my tenure on the bench,\" Jackson said.",
      "After the verdict, defense attorney Mark Schamel said it was premature to say if there would be an appeal.",
      "\"It's unbelievably disappointing to see every single thing that Lt. Lamond did viewed through a lens to make it appear to be something other than it was,\" Schamel said outside the courtroom. \"There is nothing disloyal about him at all, and it's a sad day for him.\"",
      "Tarrio eventually pleaded guilty to burning the banner stolen from a historic Black church in downtown Washington in December 2020.",
      "He was later sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, part of what prosecutors called a plot to use force keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 election.",
      "Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence branch of the police department's Homeland Security Bureau. He was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington.",
      "Tarrio was arrested in Washington two days before the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. The Miami resident wasn't at the Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building and interrupted the congressional count of the electoral votes finalizing\u00a0Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory.",
      "Prosecutors said the trial evidence proved Lamond tipped off Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been signed.",
      "\"Similarly, the defendant affirmatively advised Mr. Tarrio in a written message that he was being asked to identify him for a warrant, a warning obviously in contemplation of the subsequent prosecution and with obvious ramifications for it,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lamond's indictment says he and Tarrio exchanged messages about the Jan. 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger of being charged in the attack.",
      "\"Of course I can't say it officially, but personally I support you all and don't want to see your group's name and reputation dragged through the mud,\" Lamond wrote.",
      "Lamond said he was upset that a prosecutor labeled him as a Proud Boys \"sympathizer\" who acted as a \"double agent\" for the group after Tarrio burned a stolen Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020.",
      "\"I don't support the Proud Boys, and I'm not a Proud Boys sympathizer,\" Lamond testified.",
      "Lamond said he considered Tarrio to be a source, not a friend. But he said he tried to build a friendly rapport with the group leader to gain his trust.",
      "Justice Department prosecutor Joshua Rothstein pointed to messages that suggest Lamond provided Tarrio with \"real-time updates\" on the police investigation of the Dec. 12, 2020, banner burning.",
      "Lamond, 48, of Colonial Beach, Virginia, was charged with one count of obstruction of justice and three counts of making false statements. He retired in May 2023 after 23 years of service to the police department.",

      "Washington \u2014 Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said as his time at the helm of the nation's immigration enforcement comes to a close that \"a really terrific solution was killed by irresponsible politics\" when the bipartisan border deal fell apart earlier this year.",
      "Mayorkas pointed to the\u00a0agreement on a border package\u00a0reached by a bipartisan group of Senate negotiators in February reached after months of deliberations that would have marked the first comprehensive border security policy overhaul in decades \u2014 and give the president far-reaching powers to clamp down on unlawful border crossings. But the bill was quickly rejected by Republicans after President-elect Donald Trump expressed his opposition.",
      "Following the legislation's failure, the Biden administration instituted asylum restrictions that dramatically cut off the flow of immigration. When asked about the timing amid criticism from Republicans that the Biden administration possessed the authority without Congress to act on the border, Mayorkas acknowledged that the administration may have taken the action more quickly if they knew the border deal would be torpedoed.",
      "\"Looking back now in hindsight, in 2020 if we had known that irresponsible politics would have killed what was clearly a meritorious effort and a meritorious result, perhaps we would have taken executive action more rapidly,\" Mayorkas said in an interview that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The comments come as border crossings have dropped to the lowest level of the Biden administration, after reaching record highs a year ago.",
      "The Homeland Security Secretary noted that before Mr. Biden came into office, the \"trend lines of migration\" were increasing exponentially in 2018 and 2019 worldwide, \"and then the COVID-19 pandemic hit.\" He added over time, the Biden administration built up capabilities that have allowed it to transport individuals and decompress areas seeing surges in immigration, saying that \"we've been executing on enforcement at an unprecedented level throughout this administration.\"",
      "\"We are now removing or returning more individuals in three years than the prior administration did in four, and we are doing so not only greater in volume, but greater in speed, because of the negotiations with other countries and to more countries than has ever been the case,\" Mayorkas said.",

Manchin has for years hosted politicians of both parties aboard the \"Almost Heaven,\" which has been docked in Washington, his way of bringing his colleagues on both sides of the aisle together.",
      "\"I'm going to be involved,\" Manchin told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"The boat's staying here.\"",
      "Manchin, who mulled an independent presidential bid this year, said he would have \"loved to have had a platform\" to speak centrist common sense, as he put it.",
      "He expressed hope for President-elect Donald Trump's success \u2014 despite previously saying that electing Trump would be \"very detrimental\" to the country. Manchin has said the rioting at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was a \"bridge too far\" for him.",
      "\"When the people speak and they make their choice and the election's over, you better pray with everything you have the president will be successful,\" Manchin told Brennan. \"And if you're in a position to help, you have knowledge of how the system works and can make it work, do it. \u2026 This is about our country, and I want him to succeed, and I have said this to him, I'll do whatever I can to help in any way humanly possible.\"",

He understands the process,\u00a0 but he understands, also, the power that he's wielding right now, the influence he has\" with the House and Senate, which will be in Republican hands in January. Manchin wants to keep the filibuster in place; it requires most bills to reach a 60-vote threshold for consideration.",
      "\"I think there's enough Republican senators and Democrat senators too, but Republicans have control because they're the majority, that are not going to let the filibuster blow apart,\" Manchin said. \"...

After's Musk's criticism, Trump ultimately delievered the final blow.",
      "Musk, who spent $277 million to help Trump win the election and has since become a key member of the president-elect's brain trust, posted dozens of times on his social media platform X opposing the initial government funding measure following its release. Hours later, after Trump intervened, the deal was dead.",
      "Gonzales, who was among 34 Republicans who opposed the final measure to keep the government funded, said he did so because his constituents were against the continuing resolution, or CR, \"just as much as I was against the CR.\"",

Thomas Massie of Kentucky, said he wouldn't support Johnson for speaker in the new Congress, while questions swirled about his ability to retain enough support to hold onto the gavel.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Roger Carstens, special presidential envoy for hostage affairs,\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 22, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Roger Carstens is the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs, and he joins us now from Amman, Jordan. This was a high risk visit to Damascus, the first since the Assad regime fell. Why was it important to be face to face and go there?",
      "ROGER CARSTENS, SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY FOR HOSTAGE AFFAIRS: Margaret, thanks for having me on today. You know, I think it was important because we've been in the area since about the 9th of December, shortly after Damascus fell and the Assad regime left. We flew out to Beirut, later, we restaged to Amman, and our job's been really to cast a wide net to work with partners, allies, NGOs, and even members of the media to try to cast this wide net to search for places that we believe Austin Tice may have been held over the last 12 years. But there's something about getting face to face with the people that have been searching and certainly something about getting face to face with the interim authorities to determine what's seen, to what extent has it- have these sites been cleared, and to maybe find bits of information that you're just not going to get over a phone or over email.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You told reporters that you were amazed at the number of secret prisons that Bashar al-Assad had, more than 40 of them. Have those prisons been searched yet, and do you know if journalist Austin Tice was held in them?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: So it's not going to shock me to find out that there are prisons that have yet to be discovered and searched. I think obviously a lot of them have been, not only by members of the general public, but also by members of this conglomerate of people that are on the hunt and search for not only Austin Tice, but people like Majd Kamalmaz, and other Americans that have gone missing. So if another, I would say, underground prison compound's discovered even tomorrow or three days from now or three weeks from now, at this point, I'm not gonna be shocked. I would say if I'm stunned by anything, it's just the amount of prisons. I mean, you'd almost think that if you were running a country and you wanted to jail your enemies, you'd have one prison, and it wouldn't be secret. But to have like 35 or 40 secret prisons, I find that just horrifying, disturbing, and yet in a way fascinating. But really the bottom line is that we have to help, and- or rather work with our interim authorities, officials, to make sure that we do a good search so that I can one day look Debra Tice in the eyes and tell them that our search been- has been exhaustive. Now in a perfect world, we're gonna find Austin Tice. I think I've gone on record numerous times saying that I believe that he's alive and he's waiting for me to find him. And the president not long ago said that he believes Austin's alive. Our job in the U.S. government is to keep pressing and pressing and pressing to find out Austin's location, his disposition, his status, and to bring him home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're referring to them as interim authorities. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS, also known as Mohammad al-Jolani, was described by State Department officials as being \"very pragmatic\" in those meetings today, but his group and he himself are still technically designated as terrorists under U.S. law because of prior affiliation with Al Qaeda. Do you trust that they are being helpful to the U.S. now?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: So Margaret, I'm- I'm not one of the policy people that render some of these decisions, that's done by people that spend years perfecting this. They're- most of them are lawyers, and I wasn't smart enough to get a law degree. But what I can tell you is that they've treated us well in terms of our search. I've been talking to them for, I wanna say almost, probably nine or 10 days, and they've been helpful in conducting the search. They were definitely helpful today. We conducted a joint search of a facility that we- we all thought would have a probable, I guess, have some sort of relation to Austin Tice. So I understand, of course their- their past. What I can tell you right- is that right now they're being helpful in the search for Austin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you conducted a joint search with HTS of a prison today. Did you believe that that is where Austin was being held?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: You know, Margaret, we had a lot of information over the last 12 years that pointed to a variety of facilities. And in necking that down over 12 years, we came up with a priority list of about six sites and of those six sites, we felt that this had the highest probability of having held Austin at one time. But really the long- the- I guess I would say the best way to describe it is, we're just not sure. You know, you can get information from Syria, which to an extent has been a black box in terms of gathering information on Austin, and with all the things, all the, I guess I'd say reports being overlaid, it becomes clear that some places have a higher probability than others. And this, with the time that we had in the ground, seemed to be our best shot. So we- we gave it a good, hard look. We're gonna review all the information and evidence that we collected and hopefully render some more decisions about the probability, but really, our- our job is to just keep searching. You know, it- sometimes it takes a while to determine whether the information is valid or not. And when we g- go to the hard work of crosschecking it, but out of all the sites that we could have looked at, out of the 40 or so prisons that we've identified, and out of the six priority prisons, we went to the one that we felt had the highest chance of giving us some sort of evidence that Austin had been there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Assad intelligence ministries were known for keeping scrupulously detailed records, numbering prison- prisoners, alive and dead. Do those records still exist? Have you gone through them to look for evidence of Austin and the Virginia doctor you mentioned, Majd Kamalmaz?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: So we've had a chance to find various documents, or I would even say file folders, holding information. Again, in the joint search that we conducted with interim authorities today, we came across numerous documents. That's gonna have to be brought back. It's gonna have to be translated from Arabic into English. And sometimes these documents will actually have evidence on them. They may have fingerprints, they may have traces of DNA. So we're still in the, I would say the research phase, but the bottom line is we did find some documents. We're taking a hard look at them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And this was a search you conducted along with special operators from JSOC?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: I would never go into talking about who I was with, but I will tell you this. I was with members of the FBI. The hostage recovery fusion cell holds primacy on these cases. My office SPEHA is involved because of the diplomatic angle and aspect. So today on the ground, we were working with members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, people that are experts at looking at crime scenes, and they did a wonderful job of sweeping it, using all their skills, talents, and capabilities to bear, to- to find the right documents that might make sense to gather the evidence that they felt might give us a- more certainty. But that's- I'll probably just leave it at that. We were with members of the- the law enforcement community, the FBI, and I think they- they were the ones that were able to give us this good look that we otherwise would not have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Debra Tice, Austin's mother, sent a letter that became public to the Israeli prime minister, asking him to have his military stop bombing prisons, because she believed her son might be in one of them. Has that bombing complicated the search?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: I would say, to the extent that- of knowledge that I have, no. Now I may not have full- a full picture. You talked earlier about the dis- or the difference between being in Beirut and talking to people on the phones and sending texts, WhatsApp, Signal messages, or being in Amman and doing the same. When you get on the ground and get face to face, you're able to suck in or vacuum in a lot more information. From the information that I've received, the bombing has not really impeded any of the search efforts for Austin. However, I would not want to be too firm about that because there are bits of information that I may not have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This wasn't your first trip to Damascus. I know back in 2020, you went there at the direction of then president Donald Trump- Trump, along with Kash Patel. The regime at that time never admitted to the United States that they held Austin Tice. Do you believe they were lying back then, and that the regime did have him?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: Well, what I can tell you is that the regime, when we talked to them in- in 2020, they issued maximalist demands. They- they asked for the world. They weren't really giving anything. They never admitted to having Austin Tice. They never promised to give us any proof of life, POL, as we call it. They essentially asked for a lot and said, if we're- the United States were able to deliver everything, they might be willing to have a discussion about this- this person that we're asking about, or to discuss our interests. At that time, they wouldn't even mention his name. So they were not- they were asking for a lot and giving pretty much nothing, and it made for the conversations very frustrating. I would say that at some point we came across information and that's- as highlighted by President Biden and Secretary of State Tony Blinken, that led us to believe that at one point, the Syrian government truly did have Austin Tice. Did they- did they have him until the very end? That's information we're still trying to sort through. But at one point we- we feel very confident that the regime did detain and have Austin Tice in their custody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And before I let you go, the family of Dr. Majd Kamalmaz was told by U.S. intelligence that their father likely died when he was in captivity. Is there a reason for them to continue to hope? Did you discover anything about him?",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: I would say that if I were in their shoes, I would always want to press to- until I get something that's very conclusive. And my role is- being a part of the U.S. government, my job is to pursue- pursue as rigorously as I can, the truth. And my- I would probably tell the family, and I actually have, I- I've met the family numerous times, I've been in their homes, I've had a chance to- to break bread with them. And I always tell them, no matter what the status is of Majd, we're bringing him home one day. I think if I was in the family's shoes, I'd always have a hope that he was alive. I think the U.S. government's been firm, at least on the information that they've been able to provide about his status. But regardless, we're gonna keep pursuing Majd's case. And one day, at some point, I think we're gonna be able to put that to rest and bring him home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Roger Carstens. I know it's been an extremely long day and an extremely long effort. Thank you for sharing details with us.",
      "AMB. CARSTENS: Margaret. Thanks for having me on.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \"Face the Nation\" will be back in one minute. Stay with us."

      "The following is the full transcript of an interview with Sen. Joe Manchin, independent of West Virginia, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 22, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator Manchin, thank you for making time for us.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Margaret, it's always good to be with you. You know that, and I enjoy it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're always plain spoken, and there's a lot to get to with you. I have to start on this moment of time we are in. There's such uncertainty here on Capitol Hill about whether Congress can come to this new agreement just to keep the lights on and the government funded. After Jan- after- Excuse me, let me start again. There's concern that the government may not come to an agreement to keep the lights on after December 20. This is after Elon Musk and President Elect Trump came out against a bipartisan deal at this 11th hour. Do you think the government's going to shut down?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No, I don't. I don't think anybody- I think anyone's been here from 2013 remembers- goes back, when it was shut down, all the harm it's done to so many good people, not their fault at all. Innocent people in America, getting harmed because of dysfunction here in Washington. I think what you'll see, Margaret, is, if they're having a hard time getting their legs under them right now, President Trump is out there, but also he wants to hit the ground running. So he's looking, don't put me behind- behind the eight ball, if you will. So they're watching everything very closely. Unfortunately, what you're going to see is a bunch of CRs, probably, you know, right now\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Continuing resolutions.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Continuing resolution, was going to go, okay. That means we're going to continue what we've been doing, and nothing new, nothing different. And that's a very, very poor way of running a government, a very expensive way of running a government, because you should be making some adjustments to make things smoother and better and- and things of that sort. Especially the military. It's very difficult in the military. But they were going to go to March. They wanted to wait. That's what Mike- Mike Johnson, the Speaker, wanted to wait until, I think, after his January 3 election for Speaker, because he's on the thin margin here, and they're just- they're just basically, I mean, just stone cold, they just can't do anything. And that one vote vacate, he's always threatened by just one Republican and say, well, if you don't do what I want, I'm going to go ahead and- and ask for a vacation- a vacate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To oust the speaker.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: To oust the speaker, and he can be threatened with that, and that just shuts everything down. So you only have a two vote threshold over there. I think 20- 220, is what they have, 218. But what gets me- it blows my mind. They won't even think about- I know there'd be moderate centrist Democrats, 10, 15, 20 that would have no problem voting for Mike Johnson to help him, but they're saying, oh no, no, the Democrats will extract too much. Well, if you have 200 Republicans and 10 or 15, or 20 Democrats, I think they'll be more than reasonable just being able to participate, because over there, majority rules.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it seems, though, the direction is coming not from the elected members, but from the outside. Elon Musk, the world's richest man, was the one who came out against this short term funding deal, and then the President Elect also said, he's- that he's not on board. He's not even in office yet.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I think what they looked at as they started getting into the bill, what's- the agreement was made on a continuing resolution, but\u2014",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This 1500 page bill that had other\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, [cross talk] that was agreed upon. There was- that went through all the spending. And you know, Elon's coming in as the new DOGE czar and- and looking at that. So wait a minute, why are you doing that, when it's behind the eight ball before we start? They're- they're looking at all these things here. What they don't\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think these are regional- these are reasonable objections?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No. I can understand where they're coming from. Did I say they're reasonable? No. This Congress, 118th Congress. First of all, Mike Johnson and the Republican leadership in the House has to come to grip that's the worst performing Congress in the history of our country. That means lack of production. And I say that because most of the time there's been about 500 bills that have been passed, and every two year, it's 117th Congress, one of the most productive. 118th was not, they become in charge again. But because of that thing that you went through with Kevin McCarthy, how all that unfolded and what it left them with, they have been just tied in knots and can't get anything through. And they- they will not reach out and work for- with Democrats to continue to have a majority with some bipartisanship. If they can't get over that hump, and if Democrats can't get over that hump, that they've got to work with Republicans, when they're in charge.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats did come to a bipartisan agreement on this short term spending deal, and then the President Elect said, no deal.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Right, right. So\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Democrats were working with Republicans on that.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yes, oh no, this last deal that was made here. Mike Johnson shouldn't have done an extension to March, okay, with the CR. We should have finished out. The Senate had all appropriation- 12 appropriation bills done, working with Patty Murray and Susan Collins. Those are two wonderful senators that really worked hard and did their job. And then, boom, nothing happens. And Schumer, for whatever reason, didn't put them on the floor. Should have, we should have had our package altogether. That's all doable. But I would have thought they would have finished out this year, the 118th Congress, and President Trump comes in and starts his new term on the 20th of January. That'll be the 119th Congress. But they're looking at things, they don't want to be strapped with certain things. And they- they- they have a lot of input, let's put it that way, an awful lot of influence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you- you are an independent and you are independent minded.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Always have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you will object at times to\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014to what the party direction is. Will you support whatever it is that Senate leadership says Democrats should be on board with, if it's to keep the lights on?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Let me make sure you understand. I will never vote to shut down the government. There's no reason. There's- you have no excuse in the world just because it's not the right thing, not perfect enough.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But doesn't that mean that the Senate will just have to swallow whatever it is the House sends up here?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Pretty much- pretty much, you're in a situation now, they just want to get out of here and not let the government shutdown and live to fight another day. I can see what's coming now. So my vote, or anybody's vote, right now, I think they're going to come to an agreement. They'll swallow hard, say, let's go home for Christmas. That's what's going to happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So whatever it is that gets sent here by the House\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Pretty much, whatever it is right now, no matter what they have to do to skinny it down, they're not going to fight. There's not much fight left. Okay? The die has been cast. The election of November pretty much set the die where it's going. So whether you do it now and fight to the death now, it's going to be changing anyway when President Trump brings his new administration in. So they're just trying- President Trump and him are just trying to wield their power right now, and they have that influence with the Republican delegation, if you will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the President Elect has now publicly called for the debt ceiling to be dealt with. Not clear if he wants it\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That won't happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014completely eliminated or lifted. It won't happen? Well, he says it has to be part of this deal before he takes office January 20.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I don't see the Democrats, basically- and this is going to be from a bipartisan standpoint. You have to have bipartisanship here, okay?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you'll need 60 votes in the Senate to do this.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That's exactly right. And you've got 51 Democrats right now. So if you had all 49 Republicans, you'll need 11 Democrats to raise that debt ceiling. I just don't see getting the votes to do that. My reason for saying that is that's going to have to be, the Republicans do it when they take over with- with the trifecta, if you will. They're saying is, well, this debt we're getting from- from everybody that you've given us to us, and why won't you raise it now so we can go ahead and just do our work? Well, if you're going to do all the thing with DOGE, and you're going to be in charge of all of the rearrangement of government, and trying to look at the waste, fraud and abuse in government, then you shouldn't, maybe have to raise that right now, you know. So- but if you do, you have to justify why you're doing it. I would think that would be their thought process. I'm not sure what they're going to end up with. But I don't see an appetite, and I have not heard an appetite of that being thrown in. Yesterday was the first time we heard about that, and that being thrown in right now to the mix, it's either this or nothing. I don't know how they're going to get over that one.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think the President Elect understands the political realities that you are talking about, that there aren't the votes?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I think he understands- he understands it an awful lot better now than he did in 2016 when he won the first time. So now he's had- he's got- got some experience under him. He understands the process and- but he understands, also, the power that he's wielding right now, the influence he has with the Republican congregation or delegation, if you will. On the House and the Senate. The Senate has always been more dependent- independent. Senators are independent to a certain extent. The six year term makes you\u00a0 a little bit more independent, so you have that to deal with. But on the house, it's every two years, the whims and wishes of the person that's setting and if they're popular at the White House, makes it almost impossible for them to- to fight back hard, or sit down and work out a really tough agreement that the President wouldn't be on board for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have been pushing to make it easier or less burdensome for energy companies to be able to drill, this permitting reform that you've been pushing.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, all types of energy. What I- what we did, Margaret, we did- we did a permitting- we were working on a permitting bill, the John Barrosso, Republican, and I worked together for over a year and a half trying to work through the nuances of trying to say, okay, you have to produce energy that this country needs to operate on our economy, and also be able to defend ourself with our military. That comes from fossil fuels. Renewables is a direction that there's- we'd like to be able to go with technology that will lets- they give us the energy with less carbon emissions. So we looked at everything, and only thing that we said, we came to this permitting bill, how can we produce the energy we need today and continue to invest and not waste money, but invest in technology we- for the energy we want for tomorrow? That's what the bill did. And with that, we had, I mean, a really great bill that came out of our committee, 15 to 4, never happened before. So you would think that it would be a slam dunk. Here we have something.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it didn't make it into that short term (INAUDIBLE).",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: And you would think that President Trump, I was hoping, and I tried everything I could to talk to him and make sure they understood: this bill will allow you to do what you want to do, produce the energy that this country needs. We're producing more energy than anybody in the world. People don't realize that. And you never heard\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Record levels. Record levels of output of oil and natural gas.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2014record levels, and you never heard- you never heard President Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris, and even when she was running for president, until a couple weeks before the election they even acknowledge it. They never did acknowledge that with the IRA, we paid down $230 billion of debt. That was part of the bill. Never talked about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think they were\u2014",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: They just couldn't, because it wasn't where they were. They were forced. I wrote the bill, energy portion, and it forced them to have a balanced energy position, and- and then they were just going balls to the wall, to the- with the EVs and everything else. And I told them it was completely wrong. They were way ahead of their skis. We were trying to bring the manufacturing and also the production and- and supply chain with critical minerals back to the United States, or with our free trade agreement countries, there will be reliable supply chains. Right now, they cut everything in half. The rules were absolutely horrible, and I've been fighting them ever since. And I think maybe the President Trump can clean that up.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't see this latest proposal from you, making it into some 11th hour deal to avoid a government shutdown?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: If the President Trump would- if President Trump would actually say to Mike Johnson, I need that permitting bill. I need that permitting bill to do what I've got to do. If he thinks he wants to raise this- the debt ceiling because he doesn't want to be encumbered about how he wants to operate, I can tell you he's going to be tied in knots wanting to do that, the drill, baby drill, or basically producing more, because you just can't. You have to be able to have leasing permits, and you have to go through a rigmarole thing. And the court systems are so, so onerous, to the point to where it's almost impossible. We cut all that burden out. We basically still are very concerned about the environment, but if you're going to have a problem, tell me up front, don't wait to six years and sue me later. We did judicial reforms, a lot of things that really accelerated us being able to meet the challenges and the energy that we need in the next five years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you were spotted at that Army-Navy game\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yes, I was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013-speaking to Donald Trump.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I made a point to be there. I was\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were talking to him about exactly this. Premitting reform.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I did. Well, he had so much going on. I had a chance just to mention this. I hope you really think about this and- and I'm sure he had so much more- x",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll watch.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: We'll watch",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will see.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: You never know.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you reached out to Mr. Trump since last weekend on this?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No, I haven't, I haven't talked to him. They've got- I think they got a lot on their plate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: This is important though. I hope- I'm going to try.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when you were speaking to us on \"Face the Nation\" last January, and we were talking about what was happening and the election cycle, and you were spending time on the campaign trail, you said, 'I love my country too much to vote for Donald Trump\u2026I think it would be very detrimental to my country.' He's the president-elect. Do you think he is detrimental to America?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Here's the thing I've said, you know, I said basically what I had known from the four years before. January 6 was a bridge too far for me and I think everyone knows that. I had a good relationship with him, you know, when he was- when he was the president, and we worked together. I was one of the few Democrats that went over and worked with him, and we always got along great, we're very friendly. We used to have disagreements on some things, but you can do that. I've said this, Margaret, I mean it all my- all my heart, when the people speak and they make their choice and the election's over, you better pray everything you have the president will be successful. And if you're in a position to help, you have knowledge of how the system works and can make it work, do it. Don't worry about well, did you vote or not vote for him? Did you- did- is that in your same party that you're in, or whatever? Forget about that. This is about our country, and I want him to succeed, and I have said this to him, I'll do whatever I can to help in any way humanly possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've talked about the need to return to bipartisanship and regular order. Donald Trump is promising to destroy regular order. Upend the system.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I- I have\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you reconcile that?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I have- I have total confidence and faith in my Republican Senate colleagues that are institutionalists that will not let that happen. They have the chance. They have the power. Here's the thing. We have three branches of government. Bob Byrd used to tell me all the time, he says, Joe, he says, the president's not my boss, he said, and the majority leader is not my boss. The people of West Virginia are my boss. That's who I work for, and for the betterment of our country, as long as you keep that, what's your purpose of being here? And I think there's enough Republican senators and Democrat senators too, but Republicans have control because they're the majority, that are not going to let the filibuster blow apart. They're not going to let basically run amok of the reconciliation process just to do anything they want to and override the parliamentarian and play some rough games. I don't think they will do that. And it only takes five, or it takes four, I'm sorry, it takes four Republican senators, just four, and I guarantee you, I think there's a lot more than four.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who are going to hold the line?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That'll- that'll protect the institution. They've been here long enough. What goes around comes around, and in two years, this thing could flip. 2026, you never know. It's- it's the power of the people. People go to the polls however this thing comes out. So with that being said, they're not going to put themselves in a position. I faulted my Democrat colleagues for always, as soon as they got a chance, they wanted to get rid of the filibuster, and they know I was dead set- I'd do anything I could to stop that from happening, because I thought that was the Holy Grail of keeping democracy. That, and not allowing the reconciliation to be used every day they want to for basically policy-making. That's not what it's for. The reconciliation process was for keeping our finances in check, and we have done a horrible job on finances in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that point, in the first 100 days of the Trump administration, Leader John Thune has said he plans a once-in-a-generation investment in border security, but he's going to try to do it without Democratic votes, using that reconciliation process you just talked about. So with 51 votes, not the 60. You're saying right now, that this is- this is not how the system is supposed to work.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: It's not supposed to on policy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And yet, that is what the Republican leader is saying he's going to do right out of the gate.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Hold on Margaret, if he's going to have to show the financial connotation, and the cost is- it's costing and how it's harming our country. If it's harming it in the financial burden that we're carrying because of all the illegals coming and he can tie that to it, then he'll have a pathway for it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 And then step two is tax reform.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Tax reform definitely finds- falls\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Also through reconciliation.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah. Well, here I followed Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden, starting out in their 117th Congress with the ARP. I begged the president\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The American Rescue Plan.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: The American Rescue Plan. Not to go in reconciliation. That's basically when you've given up that you can't work with the other side. They come out of the box that way. So this is the plan that the Republicans are following now that the Democrats basically showed them the- the pathway.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it a strategic mistake?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Oh, I think it is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's damaging to the institution.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, it's damaging from the standpoint, if you don't think that you want, you want to do it alone, I'm going to give you a chance to prove to me you won't work with me. I'm not just going to come out the box Margaret. I know you won't work with me, so I'm going to do this. Obviously, I'd put it- put it, and I've said this to President Biden, please put it in the committee of jurisdiction wherever it falls within, whether it's Finance or whether it's",
      "Energy or wherever it may be, and then put the shot clock on us. Say, guys, you got- you got 60 days to make this happen, and if they shut you down, they'll prove to you they don't want to work with you. Then you do what you got to do, but don't come out of the box that way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, you played a big role in crafting, that was party line. That was through reconciliation.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: That's how the vote came down. But I guarantee it. We did majority of all that bill. We wrote that bill in my committee, and I guarantee I had over five years of input for Republicans. But because of reconciliation, they don't cross over and vote. That's just the way it was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you feel good about that?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, I feel, no I feel horrible about that. We had to do it in reconciliation. I felt horrible about that. But I can tell you, the United States of America has benefited from that. From the standpoint of more investments, more offshore coming back to the United States for manufacturing, we didn't fall into a recession. We brought down inflation from 9 to 3%, we brought down gas prices from 5 to $3. We did all of that, but the supply chains were so broken because of the pandemic, the prices of everyday staple of life, food, things of that sort made this almost unbearable for people to the burden they were carrying. The thing that the IRA kept the United States economy in better shape than any place else in the world during the pandemic. That's a fact.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The President Elect has vowed to repeal it.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, I think there's some things that need to be fixed. I think there is some things that need to be fixed in it because of how and I've said, you heard me say this many times, when you pass a piece of legislation and you write the bill, and we wrote it as tight as we possibly could, and then they start basically putting the rules to it. So okay, if you're going to put out incentives and tax incentives, it goes to IRS. Well, if the White House says, I want this type of interpretation that makes it very very liberal interpretation. It's not what the bill was supposed to do. And I have told them many times with President Biden and with Mr. Podesta, these are all good people I know, friendly with very much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The energy advisor.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Energy advisor, I said you people are going down a primrose path, which is horrible. We didn't write the bill that way, in spite of themselves trying to liberalize and putting EVs out and all of the critical minerals we're still depending on China when we're supposed to be weaning ourselves off of China. He can fix that immediately. President Trump can come in here and change some of those rules to get back. He, and then change, change the bill. It'll be his- it'll be his energy bill, but\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013So reprogramming some of these funds you'd be OK with\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013Reprogramming absolutely\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are things in there tax credits for nuclear bio fuels. Do you think parts of- you think parts of this will survive?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I think it almost has to. The investments are made, and most of the investments, the majority of the investments, are made in what you would consider red states, Republican states. That's just because of what they do and how they operate, like West Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you didn't hear much about that from the Democratic ticket during the campaign\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013They couldn't talk about it, he was talking\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Why?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I had no idea. I kept saying, Can't you just exact- tell what the bill did? They were saying, renewable, renewable, renewable. Only thing I said, you cannot eliminate your way to a cleaner environment, Margaret. You can't just say, I want to get rid of coal. I want to get rid of oil. I want no gas. I want nothing extracted. We're going to do everything for renewables. We'd be a third world country. You can't keep this economy running. Now, you can do it with innovation, technology. So I said we're going to produce what we need. We do it cleaner and better than anywhere in the world, producing more. So the bill did exactly on energy production. You wouldn't be number one in the world right now, 30 trillion cubic feet of gas, 4.7 billion barrels of oil. You wouldn't do that if we hadn't written that bill. He can take that and even go further with it. There are so many good things in that bill that he can change it. Change the name. It'll be his. I'll help any way I can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the energy secretary, Jennifer Granholm, just had a memo arguing unfettered U.S. gas exports will harm the U.S. economy.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: What we're talking about unfettered, we don't know where the base is from this standpoint, we are doing about 12 billion cubic feet a day of LNG exports. We've\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Liquefied natural gas.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, we've replaced, Margaret, an awful lot of the- this the foreign Russia fuel coming into NATO ally, our country in Europe. We replaced that because of this. But the bottom line is, I don't know where we- the tipping point would be. We're going to be up to about 26 billion cubic feet a day. We're going to double where we are. 2016 we had zero. This is where- how far we come. And with that, we've been able to keep the gas prices fairly reasonable and low in America, there's still two and a half $3 in MCF, million cubic feet of gas, which is extremely, very reasonable. Other countries are paying 12, 13, 14, 15 dollars for the same amount of gas. So we have been awash in gas. I have not seen the final report, and they wanted to start curbing it and say we're going to stop LNG, remember that? A Pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, the Biden administration said they were pausing for review\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013So I said, oh no, that doesn't make any sense at all. Give me the report that shows me what the reserves we have left, what the domestic demand is going to be, and if we have the reserve to help our allies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sound, speaking about energy policy, like a Republican.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I hope I sound like an American. It makes sense. Okay? My Democrat friends are all so far off the rail. Okay, I love them all. But I say guys- but a lot of them really understand it, they just can't speak it because the base has gone so far, and that's I just I couldn't take it anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about what's happening here in the Senate. Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, she is a Republican, but she's also known for being pretty independent\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: She's the best of the best, my dear friend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She said that the next four years are going to be hard. The Trump administration's approach is going to be, everybody toe the line. Everybody line up. We got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good, or we will primary you.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Thank God for ranked choice voting. Without ranked choice voting, my dear friend Lisa wouldn't be here. Or open primaries. If the people of America want to get the best quality, the best character of a human being, they want to represent them so you can continue to enjoy this great domestic, what we call this great democracy ours, which is a representative form. We're still an experimental stage. We're responsible for putting the person that's going to represent us to run this government. You've got to get the best person there. But if the parties shut it down, which they've done, which is Heather, my daughter, we're working on Americans Together.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: And that Americans Together is basically saying-we're trying to teach every state how you can open your primaries up, how you can look at your districts for gerrymandering, how you can get more people participating. And that's exactly if the democrat and republican party control the primaries, they can control you up here. Because basically you have a hard time winning unless they unless the leadership of both sides, Democrat and Republican, are supporting you, putting their weight and their finances behind you. So they're going to say, hey, Margaret, I'm sorry you just didn't toe the line right. You didn't vote with us when we needed you. So I'm going to find somebody else that I can control",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Exactly. And she's explicitly saying\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013She's telling you exactly the- but they'll not get her because, you know why?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Too many good Alaskans that are Democrats or independents understand the quality of Lisa Murkowski",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who else is going to stand up to the president-elect when they disagree and be willing to say so out loud? Are there other senators up here who will do it?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I would hope. You know, my father used to tell me, if you can say no with a tear in your eye, you're okay. If you can do it with respect and just say, Mr. President, I'm so sorry, where I come from that doesn't make sense. I can't explain it back home. I know it's something, could I work with you and maybe- people have to try a different approach. I mean, I had, I had no problem talking to President Trump when he was, you know, I would just say, I'm not sure that's going to work, and maybe we could try something else. I never just say, Oh, you're wrong. You don't go, you can't start out a conversation that is going to end productive if I tell you how bad you are on the front end. If I tell you, that's a pretty good idea, Margaret, could we work on it together, make it a little better?\u00a0 I'm telling you, I can't do what you want me to do. I'll work with you, make it better. You're going to say, Oh no, Joe, it's got to be the way it is. If you're telling me that you're making a political statement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you also serve on armed services. You've said the Afghanistan withdrawal was one of the major failures\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: \u2013Horrible\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013of the Biden administration. And on the campaign trail, Donald Trump said he wants the resignation of every single military officer who touched the Afghanistan disaster on his desk by noon on Inauguration Day. Presidents make policy, officers execute it. Do you think there should be retribution, or whatever holding to account means?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I pray to God he doesn't do that. I hope that was just campaign rhetoric. You can't do that. You can't do that, Margaret, basically\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013He says he's going to at noon.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, let's just pray to God he doesn't. You know, things change around here pretty quickly. And the thing I'm saying is this, he's going to be the commander in chief. He's going to give orders, and I guarantee the military will take the orders and take them very well. I am so impressed. And just this amazes me, the military might that we have, but also it's ingrained in them, especially if you ever go through the military academies and people come up through ROTC, and all the people that are really in tune with who we are and the purpose of serving. They're not going to go off it. They do not try to make policy decisions. They will not jump into it. But they're thinking, there are some, well, there's going to be some, you know, that sometimes speak out that maybe shouldn't, but they did, and they've targeted and this and that, and we've had a few generals that have left the ranks because of those reasons. But I can tell you, I can assure you, the military that we have, have followed the private course of what we've dictated our geopolitical course that we're taking, and they've been very good at doing that. The mistakes have been made, even though they see those mistakes. So the people that basically were following orders of the extraction in Afghanistan- first of all, I couldn't believe that we'd just up and leave. I thought we would at least keep Bagram Air Force Base and have that established base, which is an unbelievable value to us, and keeping a little bit of peace in that part of the world. Working with- you can work with the Taliban, whoever you want to over there, but the bottom line, that was a show of force that we had. We could work and help people and do a lot of good from there. We just didn't have to tell them how to live their life and what they should be doing. That's the problem. But when they get out the way they did, that left a mark on us, and it help- it hurt. It reverberated around the world. And the geopolitical unrest that we were kind of on the tinder belt box anyway, it just kind of says, oh, look what's going on. Let's go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken about your friendship with Joe Biden for many, many years. That was tested during this presidency.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When was the last time you spoke with him?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: It was before the campaign. It was before the campaign, before he made his decision, before the- probably before, I'm just trying to think, probably before the debate, probably\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: before June.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: His debate, probably it's been a while.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A consequential debate at the end\u2013",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Yeah, and I mean, I just, I still think, think he's a very good person. I still like him and Jill and their family just tough. This is a tough situation, okay, but the bottom line is I still, when I spoke, I would still speak to him with respect, and I would do it in a way that I thought would be helpful. I think to be against something means, okay, what do you have better. If I was against what he was doing in energy, I thought I had something better that could help him with. If I was with something of public policy or a policy that they have taken, I'd have to have a better idea. And where I came from had to be more common sense. I had to go home and explain it. And I only think I've told everybody up here. If you want to know, I can tell you exactly. I cannot go home and explain this. And I think you know what that means. I'm not voting for it. I'm telling you up front, so don't be don't be all caught off guard and get excited when you see me get on the floor and vote for something. Oh, Manchin, killed it. No, no. You killed it because you brought it up. You knew you didn't have the votes before you brought it up, but you want to make a show, and you want me to be the bad guy. I know what you're doing, and I've been doing that for far too long, and they should never bring some of the people what they brought for confirmation, which I said, You do not have my vote. Without my vote, you can't pass them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the Wall Street Journal has a report about how the White House insulated Joe Biden during his presidency, largely shielding him from the press and not giving him access to lawmakers. They cite you in the article as spending time one on one with President Biden, but in it, you're cited as noticing he lacks stamina and relied on his staff to drive the agenda more than other presidents you had worked with. Do you think that they were concealing the president's decline?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I don't know how they got that conclusion. I never had a problem sitting and talking with him, and in fact- and the matter of fact, when we start negotiating, he knew that I was against the American rescue plan the way it was coming out, going to reconciliation. And he wanted to talk to me and everything. And when I walked in after he heard that I might be opposing that he's- I said something at 10 o'clock in the morning, by two o'clock, I'm sitting in the Oval Office. And when I came in, hey Jojo, how you doing? We got to talk. So if he says, Hey Jojo, I know things are pretty good. If he's a Joe, come in here. I want to talk to you. I know it's going to be a little bit more- little bit more tense. Depends how he approaches that. Okay, so with that I walked in, you made everybody leave the room, everybody just me and him, and that's when I said, Mr. President, I'm begging you not to do this. You're coming out assuming that Republicans won't work with you, and you were the only one on the stage saying you knew how to make things happen, because you were the deal maker. I know that. I watched it. Now, all of a sudden, you're coming out of the chute, throwing a nuclear bomb. I said, Please don't I said, make them prove they don't work with- with you first. But I said, Let's gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go. I said, Well, okay, and I've always been differential to a president, same as I'm differential to any president that wants to put their staff together. They have someone as long as they're qualified and don't have any nefarious problems that we will find out in a deep dive. That's why you should have FBI reviews. No matter who they are. You need to know. Senators need to know that. I guarantee you they don't want to go into this naked. Democrats and Republicans don't want to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're saying it's a mistake for the Trump administration to bypass the FBI background checks.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I can guarantee you one thing, the senators will get their own FBI report. They're not going to let it go. They're not going to make a decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All of them on Armed Services, not just leadership?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN:\u00a0 I would think that everyone- I would think that everyone understands how critical that advise and consent is. That is what you've got, and that's a purpose and a reason for that. But anyway\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Who do you have in mind when you say that? Who's background check do you think needs to be reviewed? Who are you concerned about?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: No, I mean, you know Tulsi. I know Tulsi Gabbard. I like Tulsi as a person. I just don't know all the other things have happened over the years. You follow me? But I knew when she was first here in Congress, and I came here as a senator and- and we had, you know, because she was moderate, very modern, centrist, we had a lot in common back then, when we could talk about different things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And Pete Hegseth.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Pete, I don't know well. I don't know Pete that well. And you want to make sure he has the qualifications, and if the President thinks he does, I would, you know, I don't have a bit of problem. Once the presidents pick their team, I'll tell you the reason why. That's will and pleasure. They come and go with the President. They're not hanging over to another president who has to inherit these people. So you always when I was governor, I used to go tell the state senator you might not know the people I'm bringing on board. Do your- do your do your investigation. If you find nothing that they've not done, they're a good character, might not be somebody you know or you like, but they have the qualifications. I have faith in them. Give me a chance to work with him, if not throw us both out. That's how I look at it. So anytime a president asked me something, I said, so I finally just had to tell President Biden, I said, Are you asking me as your friend and as my president to get on the American rescue plan? And he said, Yes. I'll do it one time. That was it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go. How are you going to influence politics from outside the Senate? And do you regret not running for president yourself?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I would have loved to have had a platform that I could speak, which I think is pretty centrist common sense, where most people in America are, and maybe I could have done this. Could I have won or not? Who knows? Could I put a team together that I could show that could responsibly govern, taking consideration that you have to be fiscally responsible and you can be socially compassionate, but you can run it- run your household, and you can run your country with compassion, but also being responsible. And right now I'm saying we're throwing caution to the wind on both of those. So with that, I could have brought that to a level in a discussion that maybe bring the extremes back. You know, the extremes have never run the parties, but the extremes are running the parties now and then they're closing and shutting everything down, open the process up. I had to fight when I was secretary of state of West Virginia to have open primaries. I wanted to basically- independents couldn't vote in a Democratic primary in West Virginia when I became Secretary of State, that's because we already had all the Democrats at 75% Democrat state. They said, why do we have to do anything? We don't need those people. I said, You mean you're going to sit back and allow the Republicans open the primary up, to allow an\u00a0 independent come in, says, I'd like to vote, and they're going to say, well, you don't even vote for the Republicans because the Democrats won't allow you. I finally got to change that. But you have to open this process up. If you want a representative form of democracy to work in this experiment of 240 years, then let's do it the right way and let people participate and have some say, and have a better quality of candidate or more selection, if you will.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Manchin,",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: There's a lot more. Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot more. There's more we can talk about.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: But I'm going to be involved. The boat's staying here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I heard that.",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: The boat's gonna stay.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What are you going to use the boat for?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: Well, I got on the boat. Everybody wants a boat, so yeah, and we're all gonna come down. I promise you that we'll do that. But here's what. Last night, we had a big dinner with D's and R's, 5 D's and five R's. And I said, guys, the only thing I can tell you is I'm leaving. I'm leaving, but I'm not going that far away, because I want you all to have a place. And we did so many good things in that boat. We got so many discussions. We got through so many problems. And I said, you know, you get four D's, four R's whatever. Only thing I'm going to tell you, the boat will be available to you, but you've got to bring a person from the other party when you come. So if you want to bring five of your D's down, or you'll be five R's, then bring five D's, and we'll take care of the rest. I'll have you down there, and we'll come down. And once I get through the gate and get on the boat, nobody can bother. Nobody hears them, nobody you never heard any conversations or any bills came out of that boat. But a lot did, and we had a lot of good friendships came out that boat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think that's going to be possible in this environment?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: I'm trying. I'm trying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That it's not too toxic for Democrats to work with Donald Trump?",
      "SEN. MANCHIN: It's never too toxic for people to get together and enjoy a little vibration, vibration and vibration. (laughing) Enjoy, enjoy getting together. And I tell you this on the boat, the most beautiful thing we do, no matter what we do that night, we have, we have some- some- some refreshments. We have some food. But before we leave, we always put Lee Greenwood on, \"Proud to be an American,\" and we all stand up and hug each other, I can tell you that. So if I can keep that alive, I've done something.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Manchin, thank you for your time.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We go now to Little Rock, Arkansas and Republican Congressman French Hill.\u00a0 Good morning to you, sir.",
      "REP. FRENCH HILL: Good morning, Margaret. Merry Christmas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a Merry Christmas as well to you. This was quite the journey to get you back home and to get lawmakers to wrap up business this past week. No Democrat voted against this measure to keep the government open, but 34 Republicans did. Doesn't this show that Republicans really struggle to govern when they pass things along party lines. Won't they need to work with Democrats in this new Congress?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I think it's very, very important that Speaker Johnson and incoming Majority Leader Thune have a steady plan together to work with the incoming Trump administration to prioritize the President's priorities, our priorities in the House and Senate, make sure we're on the same page. Because with narrow majorities, we've got to work together, and that's critical. And I think this last week demonstrated that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you will have a fractured conference, a slim majority. Marc Short, who was the Director of Legislative Affairs in the first Trump administration, said this chaos shows just how hard it will be to tackle border and tax policies in 2025. What's the reality check on the timing of that and actually delivering on what Trump campaigned on?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I think Speaker Johnson and again, Majority Leader Thune, working with President Trump, want to use the budget reconciliation process that's still -still being discussed as to exactly what that procedure will be. But I believe actually that Republicans on both sides of the Hill are united that we want to unleash American energy for future production and an all of the above energy strategy. We want to secure the border. We want to fight inflation through supply side regulatory reforms. We want to roll back those regulations that are constraining the markets and constraining private business, having access to capital. So, I think we're on the same page, and I think budget reconciliation will be a way to start that process and also rein in unsustainable $2 trillion deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but you can do a party line vote in the Senate there with the Republicans, but can you really get 218 Republicans to vote in the same direction when it was such a struggle just with keeping the lights on?",
      "REP. HILL: I think we can. I think we demonstrated that year when we last year in the last Congress, when we put together the most comprehensive Republican only voting for border security, for an all the above energy strategy. Those are two priorities that President Trump campaigned on, we are united on those strategies, and I think we can get those priorities across the House floor as well as I say, rolling back unneeded regulatory burden on the American economy and small businesses to help fight inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the things that was stripped out of that initial bipartisan deal that Speaker Johnson had put together was a restriction on US investments in China. It would have affirmed presidential authority to impose sanctions on advanced technologies. Your Democrat colleague Rosa DeLauro insinuated publicly that Elon Musk came out against this because his real motivation was his extensive business ties to China. Do you share her concerns, and will this get passed?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, look, President Biden had an executive order governing outbound investment. We've had a debate in Congress between the House and Senate on the best way to do that. We all want to limit American investment in dangerous, I would say, dual-use technologies that can be turned around and hurt the America's- America's national security, but striking that balance has been difficult, but I don't believe that was at the heart of the 1,500-page problem. I think people, a majority of members, clearly wanted a simple, straightforward continuing resolution, and not of what was turned into a large omnibus spending bill on top of a CR. So, I think President- I mean, Speaker Johnson, did a good job coming back around from that focusing on disaster assistance to the hurricane hurt states in the southeast, farm assistance for those farmers, and having a clean CR with an agreement with President Trump, with majority leader Thune, on how we would tackle reconciliation, to cut spending next Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are going to be the incoming chair of the House Financial Services Committee in the new Congress. It's one of 17 committees. Patrick McHenry, the outgoing Chair of House Financial Services was asked whether it matters that the Republican Party chose only male leaders. Take a listen.",
      "[START SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "REP. PATRICK MCHENRY: For us to have no women chairs of committees is a huge mistake and really an unfortunate thing, because we have powerful, smart, capable, tenacious Republican women, that are capable of leading big committees and doing major things.",
      "[END SOUND ON TAPE]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't the Republican Party select any female leaders?",
      "REP. HILL: Well that's a decision made by our steering committee, but I'm delighted in the House Financial Services Committee that we have strong, very passionate, successful Republican women like Ann Wagner of Missouri, Young Kim of California, Monica de la Cruz of Texas, and we're very excited to have Lisa McClain from Michigan our conference- our conference Chairwoman, and also Maria Salazar from South Florida, joining our committee. They will be active leaders in financial services policy making.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Quickly. I know you've been trying to restrict captagon, this amphetamine drug that the Assad regime was selling to prop up the dictatorship. Our teams in Syria filmed factories full of this stuff. What's going to happen now?",
      "FRENCH HILL: Well, we need the United States to be very active work with partners to support a free and democratic Syria. Secondly, we need to document the war crimes committed by the Assad regime, as it relates to all the people murdered, killed in prison, tortured in the- from the regime, and also track down the networks that were producing captagon. We will have support from the kingdom in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states to do that, but it needs to be stopped. But I'm proud of the work we did to interdict captagon and cut off the funding, because I think it absolutely contributed to the end of the Assad regime, and that's something to celebrate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will be tracking what happens with that. Before I let you go, I do want to ask you as well. A source familiar with the investigation tells CBS News that tomorrow, the House Ethics Committee's work investigating former congressman Matt Gaetz alleged sexual misconduct and drug use will be released. last month on this program, you said 'it's up to that committee, but we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.' Do you still object?",
      "FRENCH HILL: That's not- well I don't know that's how I would characterize what I said. I said it's up to that committee. I think they are- they have released documents before, but I think that's something they should do with a great deal of caution, because you open up a Pandora's box of a lot of other investigations over many, many years conducted by that committee. But if they've thought it through, reviewed the material and made that decision, that's their decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Congressman French Hill, thank you and have a Merry Christmas. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we just saw turmoil within the party over the past few days after President elect Trump and Elon Musk scuttled this bipartisan deal, then demanded another deal that couldn't get enough Republican support to get over the finish line. Then we have this emergency stopgap measure that only takes us through mid March. You were one of 34 Republicans to vote against it. Why?",
      "REP. GONZALES: It's pretty simple, my- my constituents were against the CR just as much as I was against the CR. This- it's been a tough week, though. It started with a tragic shooting in Madison, Wisconsin. I've worked in a very bipartisan manner to make sure we have a national strategy that prevents against some of the school shootings that are occurring. I've been working with others to get that done. I think that's important. And then in the house, of course, we have this messy bill that was put on the floor. It started with a 1500 page bill. In my eyes, there's no doubt that there's a sickness in DC, and that sickness isn't going to be cured with these big, long, pork-filled bills. You do got to give President Trump a lot of credit, though he was able to whittle that down to 116 pages. Once again, the reason I voted no is I think CRs are terrible. They do nothing but kick the can down the road. Let's fast forward to March. Do you think we're going to be any closer to coming up with a spending deal then than we are now? I don't think so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But if the government had shut down, the Border Patrol agents who live in your district wouldn't have received paychecks.",
      "REP. GONZALES: Right, that's why we should have done our job, instead of just saying, 'Hey, give us three more months, and I promise you, in three months, we're going to do our job.' We've ran that play before\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Yeah.",
      "REP. GONZALES: In my eyes, you use Christmas, you use New Year's. You lock everybody in a room and you say, 'let's get it done now.' There's also a bigger danger to this too, is if we're not funding the government long term, now all of a sudden you're telling the government you have to spend a year's worth of money in six months or three months. That's not fair to any of these agencies as well. So basically, it was- it was a vote on my end to say, 'let's do our job.'",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right which the Republicans who are in leadership had failed to get some of those, those bills done. In fact, Speaker Johnson chose to go this route with the CR, but I want to ask you about the dynamic here, because it's confusing, frankly. I mean, Elon Musk is tweeting against bipartisan deals negotiated and led by the Speaker of the House. At- what role exactly is he playing here?",
      "REP. GONZALES: It's kind of interesting. We have a president, we have a vice president, we have a speaker. It feels like as if Elon Musk is our prime minister. And I spoke with Elon a couple of times this week. I think many of us\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -unelected.",
      "REP. GONZALES: Unelected, But I mean, he has a voice, and I think a lot of the large part of that voice is a reflection of the voice of the people. Once again, these- a 1500 page bill, how does that pass the smell test? It's absolutely wrong. It's what's wrong with this place. So we have to get back to regular order. The other part of it too is, while House Republicans were fighting over the spending bill, guess what Senate Democrats were doing? They were- they were ensuring that President Biden got his 235th liberal judge over the finish line. That's why it's so important that House Republicans stay united, stay laser-focused on delivering on a President Trump agenda next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Republicans in the House are clearly not united, and it was Speaker Johnson who led that bipartisan deal. Do you support him if- he's standing for reelection should he still lead the party if you're saying he was leaning in the wrong direction with a 15 page, initial, funding deal?",
      "REP. GONZALES: Yeah, and I do, I do support Speaker Johnson, I think he's done a fantastic job keeping us all together. It's like feral cats in the house, right? So that's a tough job to begin with, but the fact that he was able to work with President Trump in order to whittle it down to a little over 100 pages, the fact that he was able to work with the, you know, with Elon Musk and some of these other folks, other members, to find a solution, just goes to prove that he's found a way. But they're also- this can't be the norm. This cannot be the norm. Once again, that's the reason why I voted against the CR is, this cannot be the norm, that we have to get back to regular order and pass our appropriations bills. Homeland Security is certainly important to us. There's other things that are going on in the world",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So because the Republican majority now is so thin, it will also be thin in the new Congress. But right now, any missed vote gets a lot of attention. Congresswoman Kay Granger hasn't cast a vote since July, and there was a local reporter in Dallas who looked into this and found the 81 year old has been living in a local memory care and assisted living facility for some time. That was not shared with the public. Were you and others in the Texas delegation aware?",
      "REP. GONZALES: I wasn't aware. I think there's no doubt a lot of us knew that she was gaining an age, like a lot of members do. And sadly, you know, some of these members wait until it's too long to things have gone too far\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013And leadership allowed for it?",
      "REP. GONZALES: I think it's- maybe, I'm not too sure what leadership knew on it or didn't know on it. I'd say on the other side of the aisle is the same thing. I mean, we saw what happened on the Senate side, you know, with Senator Feinstein and some of these others that have missed votes for a long time. I think this goes- gets back to the root of it. Congress should do its job, and if you can't do your job, maybe you shouldn't be there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, she wasn't there, and apparently it went either unnoticed or just not acknowledged to the public, which certainly raises eyebrows. I need to get to the border, because that is what 800 miles of the border\u2013",
      "REP. GONZALES: -that's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In your district. Border patrol had fewer than 50,000 apprehensions at the southern border last month. That's a Biden era low. Does that mean coming into office that essentially, the crisis has been fixed before Donald Trump even arrives, and that it's not as big of a project as initially thought?",
      "REP. GONZALES: Oh no, it's a huge project. And while the Biden administration has has started to do some things right. The Trump administration is going to do everything right in this manner. And I'll tell you why, this is why it's important. Earlier this week, I had a classified briefing on the threat, the worldwide threats to homeland, to our homeland. I won't share some of the sensitive stuff, but I'll share some of the open source stuff. In Syria, a lot of us are rooting for a free Syria. Free Syria, it brings a lot of opportunities for- for stability in that region, but it also brings a national security threat. Assad was a bad guy, he imprisoned a lot of folks, sometimes wrongfully. Some of those folks are terrorists. Now they are loose. Where are they? Where are they going? Let's bring it back to the southern border. This year, the Biden administration has apprehended 600 Syrians. Does that mean all those Syrians are terrorists? Of course not. But do we know who these people are, and who- are they coming to our country? This is something that President Trump is going to get to the bottom of.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to halt refugee admissions, like Donald Trump is talking about, you want to block travel from Muslim majority countries? Like the Trump team is talking about.",
      "REP. GONZALES: I want the president- I want the President to enforce the laws that we have on the books. That simple.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no, those aren't laws on the books. Refugees are, except in the United States of America.",
      "REP. GONZALES: And they should be right. I want us to follow our laws right. And if we need to make changes to our laws, Congress should be the body to make those changes. And in my eyes, we can both protect those that are warm and welcoming. We want people to come and live the dream- those that are fleeing political persecution, but we also have to go after the criminals and the terrorists.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Tony Gonzales, good to have you here.",
      "REP. GONZALES: Thank you. Merry Christmas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Merry Christmas 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute."

    "story": [
      "Spanish archaeologists have successfully removed a 2,600-year-old shipwreck from waters off the country's southeastern coast, two decades after the relic was initially found, officials said.",
      "The ancient Phoenician shipwreck dates back to the 7th century B.C.E. It was discovered in 1994 off the coast of Murcia in southeastern Spain, near the town of Mazarr\u00f3n,\u00a0according to Spain's Ministry of Culture.",
      "Now called the Mazarr\u00f3n II, this shipwreck was one of two located in that same general area. The first, called Mazarr\u00f3n I, was initially located in 1993, lifted from the water in June 1995, and put on display at Spain's National Museum of Underwater Archaeology in 2005 after undergoing years of conservation treatments, the museum said.",
      "Mazarr\u00f3n II is of particular interest to archaeologists and researchers because it is one of only a few Phoenician-era shipwrecks discovered largely intact, said Carlos de Juan, the director of the excavation project, in a video shared by the University of Valencia. The university partnered with the regional culture ministry in Murcia to carry out the excavation.",
      "A team of 14 specialists worked with de Juan to lift the shipwreck from the sea in less than two months, beginning the project Sept. 13 and finishing Nov. 7. Video shows divers carrying wooden fragments of the wreck to the surface in pieces.",
      "Phoenicia was an ancient civilization along the eastern Mediterranean coast, in the area of modern-day Lebanon, Syria and Israel, which existed from about 1500 to 300 B.C.E. Although historians say Phoenicians thrived for a time on trade and developed an alphabet that formed the basis for the ones later produced by ancient Greece and Rome, many traces of the civilization were considered lost until the 20th century.",
      "Artifacts like Mazarr\u00f3n II can help shed light on Phoenician culture, said de Juan. He noted in his comments to the University of Valencia that little is known about Phoenician naval construction, even now, despite the wealth of information about ships built nearby in the Mediterranean by the ancient Greeks.",
      "\"Therefore, this wreck is a very important contribution to this area of study,\" de Juan said. He noted that elements of the Mazarr\u00f3n II are similar to construction designs seen in cultures throughout the surrounding region, but some are distinctive and mysterious, at least for now.",
      "Each piece of the shipwreck has been transferred to a laboratory at the Museum of Underwater Archaeology, in southern Spain. The lab will work carefully to conserve its remains, in a process that will likely take several more years.",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 09:19:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, and is marked with traditions and celebrations around the world.",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, in the Northern Hemisphere. The celestial event signifies the first day of winter, astronomically.",
      "What is the winter solstice?",
      "The winter solstice is the day each year that has the shortest period of daylight between sunrise and sunset, and therefore the longest night. It happens when the sun is directly above the Tropic of Capricorn, a line of latitude that circles the globe south of the equator, the National Weather Service explains.",
      "The farther north you are, the shorter the day will be, and in the Arctic Circle, the sun won't rise at all.",
      "How is the day of the winter solstice determined?",
      "The winter solstice occurs because of the Earth's tilt as it rotates around the sun.",
      "When the Northern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun, the nights last longer. The longest night happens on the solstice because the hemisphere is in its furthest position from the sun. That occurs each year on Dec. 21 or 22.",
      "This year, it falls on Dec. 21 at 4:21 a.m ET, to be precise.",
      "On the summer solstice, when the northern tilt is closest to the sun, we have the longest day, usually June 20 or 21.",
      "The solstices are not always exactly on the 21st every year because the earth's rotation around the sun is 365.25 days, instead of 365 even.",
      "Will days start getting longer after the winter solstice?",
      "Yes. Each day after the solstice, we get one minute more of sunlight. It doesn't sound like much, but after just two months, or around 60 days, we'll be seeing about an hour more of sunlight.",
      "When will winter officially be over in 2025?",
      "The meteorological winter ends on March 20, 2025. Then, spring will last until June 20, when the summer solstice arrives.",
      "How is the winter solstice celebrated around the world?",
      "Nations and cultures around the world have celebrated the solstice since ancient times with varying rituals and traditions. The influence of those solstice traditions can still be seen in our celebrations of holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah, Britannica notes.",
      "The ancient Roman Saturnalia festival celebrated the end of the planting season and has close ties with modern-day Christmas. It honored Saturn, the god of harvest and farming. The multiple-day affair had lots of food, games and celebrations. Presents were given to children and the poor, and slaves were allowed to stop working.",
      "Gatherings are held every year at Stonehenge, a monumental circle of massive stones in England that dates back about 5,000 years. The origins of Stonehenge are shrouded in mystery, but it was built to align with the sun on solstice days.",
      "The Hopi, a Native American tribe in the northern Arizona area, celebrate the winter solstice with dancing, purification and sometimes gift-giving. A sacred ritual known as the Soyal Ceremony marks the annual milestone.",
      "In Peru, people honor the return of the sun god on the winter solstice. The ancient tradition would be to hold sacrificial ceremonies, but today, people hold mock sacrifices to celebrate. Because Peru is in the Southern Hemisphere, their winter solstice happens in June, when the Northern Hemisphere is marking its summer solstice.",
      "Scandinavia celebrates St. Lucia's Day, a festival of lights.",
      "The \"arrival of winter,\" or Dong Zhi, is a Chinese festival where family gathers to celebrate the year so far. Traditional foods include tang yuan, sweet rice balls with a black sesame filling. It's believed to have its origins in post-harvest celebrations.",
      "Researchers stationed in in Antarctica even have their own traditions, which may include an icy plunge into the polar waters. They celebrate \"midwinter\" with festive meals, movies and sometimes homemade gifts.",

      "Humans aren't alone when it comes to yawning\u00a0\u2014 all vertebrates do it too, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. But why?",
      "The \"evolutionarily ancient\" act of yawning likely serves a few purposes, according to Andrew Gallup, a professor of behavioral biology at Johns Hopkins University.",
      "\"The fact that it is conserved so widely across the animal kingdom suggests that it likely holds an evolutionary function, and research suggests that it functions in a variety of domains,\" he said on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0Friday.",
      "Those findings suggest yawning may have a role in promoting changes in our state of alertness or activity patterns.",
      "\"We often yawn frequently before we go to sleep or after we wake up,\" Gallup said. \"Yawns have been shown to increase arousal and alertness as associated with these state changes.\"",
      "Research also suggests yawning has a brain-cooling function.",
      "\"One of the mechanisms that could facilitate changes in state or heightened arousal as a result of yawning is brain cooling,\" Gallup said.",
      "Brain cooling refers to cooling the temperature of the brain, he said, and this can help us feel calmer, \"because stress and anxiety increase brain temperature and also trigger yawning.\"",
      "Gallup also said he isn't insulted when someone yawns, because it's both contagious and a common, natural mechanism.",
      "\"It helps promote mental awareness and alertness. So when individuals yawn in an academic setting or a boardroom, it could be an indicator that they're actually trying to pay attention,\" he said.",

    "published": "Fri, 20 Dec 2024 09:18:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Early Americans may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts, research shows.",
    "story": [
      "Sloths weren't always slow-moving, furry tree-dwellers. Their prehistoric ancestors were huge - up to 4 tons - and when startled, they brandished immense claws.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed the first humans to arrive in the Americas soon killed off these giant ground sloths through hunting, along with many other massive animals like mastodons, saber-toothed cats and dire wolves that once roamed North and South America.",
      "But new research from several sites is starting to suggest that people came to the Americas earlier - perhaps far earlier - than once thought. These findings hint at a remarkably different life for these early Americans, one in which they may have spent millennia sharing prehistoric savannas and wetlands with enormous beasts.",
      "\"There was this idea that humans arrived and killed everything off very quickly - what's called 'Pleistocene overkill,'\" said Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at White Sands National Park in New Mexico. But new discoveries suggest that \"humans were existing alongside these animals for at least 10,000 years, without making them go extinct.\"",
      "Some of the most tantalizing clues come from an archaeological site in central Brazil, called Santa Elina, where bones of giant ground sloths show signs of being manipulated by humans. Sloths like these once lived from Alaska to Argentina, and some species had bony structures on their backs, called osteoderms - a bit like the plates of modern armadillos - that may have been used to make decorations.",
      "In a lab at the University of Sao Paulo, researcher M\u00edrian Pacheco holds in her palm a round, penny-sized sloth fossil. She notes that its surface is surprisingly smooth, the edges appear to have been deliberately polished, and there's a tiny hole near one edge.",
      "\"We believe it was intentionally altered and used by ancient people as jewelry or adornment,\" she said. Three similar \"pendant\" fossils are visibly different from unworked osteoderms on a table - those are rough-surfaced and without any holes.",
      "These artifacts from Santa Elina are roughly 27,000 years old - more than 10,000 years before scientists once thought that humans arrived in the Americas.",
      "Originally researchers wondered if the craftsmen were working on already old fossils. But Pacheco's research strongly suggests that ancient people were carving \"fresh bones\" shortly after the animals died.",
      "Her findings, together with other recent discoveries, could help rewrite the tale of when humans first arrived in the Americas - and the effect they had on the environment they found.",
      "\"There's still a big debate,\" Pacheco said.",
      "\"Really compelling evidence\"",
      "Scientists know that the first humans emerged in Africa, then moved into Europe and Asia-Pacific, before finally making their way to the last continental frontier, the Americas. But questions remain about the final chapter of the human origins story.",
      "Pacheco was taught in high school the theory that most archaeologists held throughout the 20th century. \"What I learned in school was that Clovis was first,\" she said.",
      "Clovis is a site in New Mexico, where archaeologists in the 1920s and 1930s found distinctive projectile points and other artifacts dated to between 11,000 and 13,000 years ago.",
      "This date happens to coincide with the end of the last Ice Age, a time when an ice-free corridor likely emerged in North America - giving rise to an idea about how early humans moved into the continent after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia.",
      "And because the fossil record shows the widespread decline of American megafauna starting around the same time - with North America losing 70% of its large mammals, and South America losing more than 80% - many researchers surmised that humans' arrival led to mass extinctions.",
      "\"It was a nice story for a while, when all the timing lined up,\" said paleoanthropologist Briana Pobiner at the Smithsonian Institution's Human Origins Program. \"But it doesn't really work so well anymore.\"",
      "In the past 30 years, new research methods - including ancient DNA analysis and new laboratory techniques - coupled with the examination of additional archaeological sites and inclusion of more diverse scholars across the Americas, have upended the old narrative and raised new questions, especially about timing.",
      "\"Anything older than about 15,000 years still draws intense scrutiny,\" said Richard Fari\u00f1a, a paleontologist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay. \"But really compelling evidence from more and more older sites keeps coming to light.\"",
      "In Sao Paulo and at the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Pacheco studies the chemical changes that occur when a bone becomes a fossil. This allows her team to analyze when the sloth osteoderms were likely modified.",
      "\"We found that the osteoderms were carved before the fossilization process\" in \"fresh bones\" - meaning anywhere from a few days to a few years after the sloths died, but not thousands of years later.",
      "Her team also tested and ruled out several natural processes, like erosion and animal gnawing. The research was published last year in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",
      "One of her collaborators, paleontologist Tha\u00eds Pansani, recently based at the Smithsonian Institution, is analyzing whether similar-aged sloth bones found at Santa Elina were charred by human-made fires, which burn at different temperatures than natural wildfires.",
      "Her preliminary results suggest that the fresh sloth bones were present at human campsites - whether burned deliberately in cooking, or simply nearby, isn't clear. She is also testing and ruling out other possible causes for the black markings, such as natural chemical discoloration.",
      "\"A giant ground sloth\"",
      "The first site widely accepted as older than Clovis was in Monte Verde, Chile.",
      "Buried beneath a peat bog, researchers discovered 14,500-year-old stone tools, pieces of preserved animal hides, and various edible and medicinal plants.",
      "\"Monte Verde was a shock. You're here at the end of the world, with all this organic stuff preserved,\" said Vanderbilt University archaeologist Tom Dillehay, a longtime researcher at Monte Verde.",
      "Other archaeological sites suggest even earlier dates for human presence in the Americas.",
      "Among the oldest sites is Arroyo del Vizca\u00edno in Uruguay, where researchers are studying apparent human-made \"cut marks\" on animal bones dated to around 30,000 years ago.",
      "At New Mexico's White Sands, researchers have uncovered human footprints dated to between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, as well as similar-aged tracks of giant mammals. But some archaeologists say it's hard to imagine that humans would repeatedly traverse a site and leave no stone tools.",
      "\"They've made a strong case, but there are still some things about that site that puzzle me,\" said David Meltzer, an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University. \"Why would people leave footprints over a long period of time, but never any artifacts?\"",
      "Odess at White Sands said that he expects and welcomes such challenges. \"We didn't set out to find the oldest anything - we've really just followed the evidence where it leads,\" he said.",
      "While the exact timing of humans' arrival in the Americas remains contested - and may never be known - it seems clear that if the first people arrived earlier than once thought, they didn't immediately decimate the giant beasts they encountered.",
      "And the White Sands footprints preserve a few moments of their early interactions.",
      "As Odess interprets them, one set of tracks shows \"a giant ground sloth going along on four feet\" when it encounters the footprints of a small human who's recently dashed by. The huge animal \"stops and rears up on hind legs, shuffles around, then heads off in a different direction.\"",

    "summary": "New analysis techniques and decades-old research helped NASA scientists identify an unusual black hole in a distant galaxy.",
    "story": [
      "NASA researchers combined years of data and new imaging techniques to learn more about a \"tipped over\" black hole that is moving in an unexpected way.",
      "The black hole is located in a galaxy called NGC 5084. Researchers have been aware of the galaxy for years, NASA said in a news release.",
      "New analysis techniques developed at NASA's Ames Research Center in California helped researchers see four long plumes of plasma emanating from the galaxy. Most galaxies don't have plumes, and when they do, only one or two are present. The plumes suggested the galaxy might house a supermassive black hole, NASA said. Spotting both pairs, which formed an \"X\" shape, led researchers to focus more on the area.",
      "Using archived data from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Telescope based in Chile, researchers found that the galaxy also had a \"small, dusty inner disk\" rotating at the center of the galaxy, again suggesting a black hole there. Even more surprisingly, both the disk and black hole were rotating at a 90-degree angle relative to the rest of the galaxy, meaning both features are essentially \"lying on their sides,\" NASA said.",
      "\"It was like seeing a crime scene with multiple types of light,\" said research scientist Alejandro Serrano Borlaff, who will also publish a paper about the discovery, in the news release. \"Putting all the pictures together revealed that NGC 5084 has changed a lot in its recent past.\"",
      "It's not clear what caused the change in the galaxy. It may have collided with another galaxy and formed a chimney of superheated gas, creating the X-shaped plasma plumes. Further research will have to be conducted to learn more about the circumstances.",
      "\"Detecting two pairs of X-ray plumes in one galaxy is exceptional,\" said Pamela Marcum, an astrophysicist at Ames and co-author on the discovery, in the news release. \"The combination of their unusual, cross-shaped structure and the 'tipped-over,' dusty disk gives us unique insights into this galaxy's history.\"",

      "Preparing cancer patients for difficult decisions is an oncologist's job. They don't always remember to do it, however. At the University of Pennsylvania Health System, doctors are nudged to talk about a patient's treatment and end-of-life preferences by an artificially intelligent algorithm that predicts the chances of death.",
      "But it's far from being a set-it-and-forget-it tool. A routine tech checkup revealed the algorithm decayed during the covid-19 pandemic, getting 7 percentage points worse at predicting who would die, according to a 2022 study.",
      "There were likely real-life impacts. Ravi Parikh, an Emory University oncologist who was the study's lead author, told KFF Health News the tool failed hundreds of times to prompt doctors to initiate that important discussion \u2014 possibly heading off unnecessary chemotherapy \u2014 with patients who needed it.",
      "He believes several algorithms designed to enhance medical care weakened during the pandemic, not just the one at Penn Medicine. \"Many institutions are not routinely monitoring the performance\" of their products, Parikh said.",
      "Algorithm glitches are one facet of a dilemma that computer scientists and doctors have long acknowledged but that is starting to puzzle hospital executives and researchers: Artificial intelligence systems require consistent monitoring and staffing to put in place and to keep them working well.",
      "In essence: You need people, and more machines, to make sure the new tools don't mess up.",
      "\"Everybody thinks that AI will help us with our access and capacity and improve care and so on,\" said Nigam Shah, chief data scientist at Stanford Health Care. \"All of that is nice and good, but if it increases the cost of care by 20%, is that viable?\"",
      "Government officials worry hospitals lack the resources to put these technologies through their paces. \"I have looked far and wide,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said at a recent agency panel on AI. \"I do not believe there's a single health system, in the United States, that's capable of validating an AI algorithm that's put into place in a clinical care system.\"",
      "AI is already widespread in health care. Algorithms are used to predict patients' risk of death or deterioration, to suggest diagnoses or triage patients, to record and summarize visits to save doctors work and to approve insurance claims.",
      "If tech evangelists are right, the technology will become ubiquitous \u2014 and profitable. The investment firm Bessemer Venture Partners has identified some 20 health-focused AI startups on track to make $10 million in revenue each in a year. The FDA has approved nearly a thousand artificially intelligent products.",
      "Evaluating whether these products work is challenging. Evaluating whether they continue to work \u2014 or have developed the software equivalent of a blown gasket or leaky engine \u2014 is even trickier.",
      "Take a recent study at Yale Medicine evaluating six \"early warning systems,\" which alert clinicians when patients are likely to deteriorate rapidly. A supercomputer ran the data for several days, said Dana Edelson, a doctor at the University of Chicago and co-founder of a company that provided one algorithm for the study. The process was fruitful, showing huge differences in performance among the six products.",
      "It's not easy for hospitals and providers to select the best algorithms for their needs. The average doctor doesn't have a supercomputer sitting around, and there is no Consumer Reports for AI.",
      "\"We have no standards,\" said Jesse Ehrenfeld, immediate past president of the American Medical Association. \"There is nothing I can point you to today that is a standard around how you evaluate, monitor, look at the performance of a model of an algorithm, AI-enabled or not, when it's deployed.\"",
      "Perhaps the most common AI product in doctors' offices is called ambient documentation, a tech-enabled assistant that listens to and summarizes patient visits. So far this year, investors at Rock Health have tracked $353 million flowing into these documentation companies. But, Ehrenfeld said, \"There is no standard right now for comparing the output of these tools.\"",
      "And that's a problem, when even small errors can be devastating. A team at Stanford University tried using large language models \u2014 the technology underlying popular AI tools like ChatGPT \u2014 to summarize patients' medical history. They compared the results with what a physician would write.",
      "\"Even in the best case, the models had a 35% error rate,\" said Stanford's Shah. In medicine, \"when you're writing a summary and you forget one word, like 'fever' \u2014 I mean, that's a problem, right?\"",
      "Sometimes the reasons algorithms fail are fairly logical. For example, changes to underlying data can erode their effectiveness, like when hospitals switch lab providers.",
      "Sometimes, however, the pitfalls yawn open for no apparent reason.",
      "Sandy Aronson, a tech executive at Mass General Brigham's personalized medicine program in Boston, said that when his team tested one application meant to help genetic counselors locate relevant literature about DNA variants, the product suffered \"nondeterminism\" \u2014 that is, when asked the same question multiple times in a short period, it gave different results.",
      "Aronson is excited about the potential for large language models to summarize knowledge for overburdened genetic counselors, but \"the technology needs to improve.\"",
      "If metrics and standards are sparse and errors can crop up for strange reasons, what are institutions to do? Invest lots of resources. At Stanford, Shah said, it took eight to 10 months and 115 man-hours just to audit two models for fairness and reliability.",
      "Experts interviewed by KFF Health News floated the idea of artificial intelligence monitoring artificial intelligence, with some (human) data whiz monitoring both. All acknowledged that would require organizations to spend even more money \u2014 a tough ask given the realities of hospital budgets and the limited supply of AI tech specialists.",
      "\"It's great to have a vision where we're melting icebergs in order to have a model monitoring their model,\" Shah said. \"But is that really what I wanted? How many more people are we going to need?\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling and journalism.",

    "summary": "NORAD, the North American Aerospace Command, is tracking Santa on his trip around the world this Christmas, so children and families can see where he is right now.",
    "story": [
      "Santa Claus is making\u00a0his annual Christmas Eve journey from the North Pole to households around the world. In keeping with decades of tradition, the North American Aerospace Command, or NORAD, is once again tracking him\u00a0as he delivers gifts to children, using an official map that's updated consistently to show where he is.",
      "NORAD, the agency responsible for monitoring and defending airspaces over the United States and Canada, has tracked Santa's whereabouts every year since 1958. Its predecessor, the Continental Air Defense Command, handled the project for three years before NORAD took over.",
      "Here's what to know as the tracker maps out Santa's journey this Christmas.",
      "Where is Santa right now?",
      "NORAD updates its map in real time to show Santa's current location on his trip around the world. From his starting point at the North Pole, he headed south along the Pacific rim and then across Asia, Australia, Africa and Europe. He stopped in Antarctica, and as night fell in the Western Hemisphere, he traversed South America and the Caribbean and then traveled north across the Atlantic to Greenland, before making his way into Canada and the U.S. and has delivered more than 7 billion gifts and counting.",
      "Monitor Santa's progress on the live map on NORAD's website, or follow occasional updates throughout the day on the agency's\u00a0Facebook, X, Instagram and YouTube\u00a0pages.",
      "When will Santa be at your house?",
      "Although the NORAD tracker reflects where Santa is at different points on his route around the world so you can see how far Santa is from you, the map can't predict when he'll arrive at any given household. NORAD says its intel enables the tracker to follow Saint Nick along his Christmas journey but can't anticipate his itinerary or where he'll travel next once he stops at one location.",
      "\"Only Santa know his route, which means we cannot predict where and when he will arrive at your house,\" NORAD writes on its website. \"We do, however, know from history that it appears he arrives only when children are asleep!\"",
      "According to the experts at NORAD, Santa typically arrives at individual homes between 9 p.m. and midnight on Christmas Eve.",
      "How does the Santa tracker work?",
      "The tracker relies on radar technology and satellites to keep tabs on Santa, according to NORAD, which notes those methods are the same ones the agency employs to protect skies over North America. Its radar system, called the North American Warning System, includes 47 different checkpoints across northern Canada and Alaska.",
      "\"NORAD makes a point of checking the radar closely for indications of Santa Claus leaving the North Pole every holiday season,\" its website explains. \"The moment our radar tells us that Santa has lifted off, we begin to use the same satellites that we use in providing air warning of possible missile launches aimed at North America.\"",
      "You can also get updates via phone from the NORAD Tracks Santa Operations Center \u2014 just call 1-877-HI-NORAD (1-877-446-6723) to get Santa's exact location until midnight MST.",
      "More than 1,250 uniformed personnel from the United States and Canada volunteer on Christmas Eve to answer phone calls and emails that NORAD receives while its Santa tracker is live. Civilians from the U.S. Department of Defense help too \u2014 and some years, the president and first lady have\u00a0joined in to answer some calls.",
      "What else is there to know about the Santa tracker?",
      "NORAD says Santa Claus typically begins his Christmas journey at the International Date Line, located in the Pacific Ocean, and proceeds to travel westward around the globe. That means, historically, he begins by visiting areas in the South Pacific before moving on to New Zealand, Australia, Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, Central America and South America, in that order.",
      "\"Keep in mind, Santa's route can be affected by the weather, so it's really unpredictable,\" NORAD says, adding that it \"coordinates with Santa's Elf Launch Staff to confirm his launch time, but from that point on, Santa calls the shots.\"",

To keep from falling behind the approximately 365-day solar calendar, there's a 13th month on the Jewish calendar every few years to make a \"leap year.\"",
      "Another difference is that on the Jewish calendar, holidays begin at sundown and continue through the next day, so Hanukkah, which lasts eight days, will get its start this year hours after the start of Christmas.",
      "The holiday, also known as the \"Festival of Lights,\" celebrates the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the 2nd century B.C. after the Jews overcame the rule of the Greeks. While rededicating the Temple, they found a small amount of ritually pure oil, enough for just one day, and used it to light the menorah, a multibranched candelabrum. That oil miraculously lasted eight days.",

      "The first day of Hanukkah and Christmas have only coincided a handful of times since 1900, according to the Jewish Federations of North America. The holidays started on the same day in 1910, 1921, 1959 and 2005. Rabbi Joshua Stanton, vice president of interfaith initiatives for Jewish Federations of North America, views it as an opportunity for learning, collaboration and togetherness.",

      "The convergence of holidays also offer unique opportunities and challenges for interfaith families. Some people celebrate what's known as \"Chrismukkah,\" a name derived from the overlap of the holidays that was made popular by the television series \"The O.C.\"",

    "story": [
      "American Airlines flights across the United States were briefly delayed by technical issues on Tuesday morning, interrupting travel on one of the busiest days of the year.",
      "The airline requested a nationwide ground stop, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, but the FAA lifted it about an hour later once the problem was resolved. American Airlines said flights had resumed by 8:50 a.m. ET.",
      "No American Airlines flights were canceled as a result of the stoppage.",
      "\"A vendor technology issue briefly affected flights this morning. That issue has been resolved and flights have resumed,\" the airline said in a statement. \"We sincerely apologize to our customers for the inconvenience this morning. It's all hands on deck as our team is working diligently to get customers where they need to go as quickly as possible.\"",
      "The setback affected the systems needed for American to release flights, the airline said.",
      "The FAA ordered a ground stop for all American Airlines flights in the U.S., including those operated by the airline's subsidiaries, at around 6:50 a.m. on Tuesday. That order was canceled about an hour later, the Air Traffic Control Command Center said in an advisory.",
      "At the time, American reported \"a technical issue\" affecting its flights Tuesday morning.",
      "\"Our teams are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, and we apologize to our customers for the inconvenience,\" said the airline in an earlier statement obtained by CBS News.",
      "A few minutes prior to the ground stop, American Airlines acknowledged that technical problems were hindering flight plans in a social media post. Replying to a user on X who said at around 6:30 a.m. that their flight from St. Louis to Miami was stalled, mentioning a \"system wide outage,\" the airline said: \"We're currently experiencing a technical issue with all American Airlines flights. Your safety is our utmost priority, once this is rectified, we'll have you safely on your way to your destination.\"",
      "When asked by the traveler to provide an estimated timeframe, American said the airline could not but reiterated that its team was \"trying to fix it in the shortest possible time.\"",
      "The outage came in the middle of a particularly hectic holiday travel season, which could shape up to be American Airlines' busiest on record, the company's vice president said last week. Since last Wednesday, almost 3.3 million people have traveled on American flights, and another 700,000 were expected to do the same on Sunday, according to the airline.",
      "That's in line with national travel projections for the end of the year. AAA said more than 119 million people were expected to travel at least 50 miles from their homes between Saturday of last weekend and New Year's Day, which falls on Wednesday of next week. If those numbers prove true, they would top the previous year-end travel record in 2019, according to the auto club.",
      "Projections for air travel specifically were also quite high. After the U.S. House narrowly avoided a government shutdown last Friday, the Transportation Security Administration said it was preparing to screen almost 40 million people at U.S. airports between Dec. 19 and Jan. 2. Airlines for America, a trade group, offered a similar figure, saying in a separate statement that it anticipated U.S. airlines would carry 54 million passengers between Dec. 18 and Jan. 6. Both estimates from TSA and Airlines for America represented at least a 6% jump from holiday air travel statistics last year.",
      "American Airlines said it had been \"doing quite well\" prior to Christmas Eve as staff worked to keep up with holiday demands, noting in another statement that the airline \"has had more on-time departures than any of our major airline competitors since the holiday travel period began on Dec. 18.\" Tuesday was one of the lighter days for American as part of the holiday stretch.",
      "None of its mainline flights \u2014 which excludes those operated by its subsidiaries \u2014 were canceled on Sunday, Dec. 22, one of the busier days of the season, according to American. The airline also said it only canceled 136 of 31,000 flights scheduled from last Wednesday through Sunday, with almost all of the cancellations attributed to a bout of winter weather that reduced visibility.",

    "summary": "A government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel.",
    "story": [
      "A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving a decision to President Joe Biden, a longtime opponent of the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Mr. Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March of this year and now has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is that Nippon Steel also has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "The interagency committee reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks. Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Mr. Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "The Washington Post earlier reported CFIUS' submission of its report.",
      "Under the terms of the approximately\u00a0$14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steel-producing companies in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union has said it doesn't believe Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\"Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it's up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\" David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \"We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel had waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \"is the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel's blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "In a statement Tuesday to CBS News, the company urged the president \"to reflect on the great lengths that we have gone to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U.S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\"",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America's manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security.",
      "The committee's powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",
      "In September, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals \u2014 such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or puts Americans' sensitive personal data at risk.",
      "Nippon Steel already has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world's top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

    "story": [
      "A Russian cargo ship sank in the Mediterranean Sea between Spain and Algeria, leaving two crew members missing, Spain's maritime rescue agency and the Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday.",
      "Fourteen of the Ursa Major's crew were rescued uninjured from a lifeboat and transferred to Spain, the agency said. The Russian ministry said the ship started sinking following an explosion in the engine room.",
      "The vessel was owned by SK-Yug, a subsidiary of the Russian shipping and logistics company Oboronlogistika, which was established under Russia's defense ministry and placed under U.S. and European Union sanctions for its ties to Russia's military.",
      "Spanish authorities said there were empty containers and two cranes on board. They did not confirm the cause of the accident.",
      "In a statement on Dec. 20, Oboronlogistika said the cargo ship was headed to Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok carrying two cranes for the port weighing 380 tons each. Ursa Major had left St. Petersburg 12 days ago, Russian state news agency Ria Novosti said.",
      "Spanish authorities said they received an alert around 1 p.m. Monday when the vessel was roughly 57 nautical miles from Almer\u00eda in southeastern Spain. The maritime rescue agency contacted a ship nearby that reported poor weather conditions, a lifeboat in the water and the Ursa Major listing.",
      "Authorities said a Russian warship arrived later Monday to oversee rescue operations, and the 142-meter cargo vessel sank around midnight. The Russian embassy in Spain told RIA Novosti it was investigating the accident and was in contact with local authorities.",
      "Ursa Major was in the western Mediterranean at the same time as Sparta - another Russian cargo ship under U.S. sanctions - whose destination as reported Tuesday was Port Said in Egypt, according to ship-spotting platform MarineTraffic.com.",
      "It's not unusual for Russian ships going from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok to transit through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal. With global warming, the Northern Sea Route via Russia's Arctic is increasingly traversed year-round, but most ships still choose the southern route in winter.",
      "Spanish maritime rescue units remained in the area Tuesday to monitor for pollution and remove any floating objects that could be dangerous for navigation, authorities said.",

    "story": [
      "Spanish archaeologists have successfully removed a 2,600-year-old shipwreck from waters off the country's southeastern coast, two decades after the relic was initially found, officials said.",
      "The ancient Phoenician shipwreck dates back to the 7th century B.C.E. It was discovered in 1994 off the coast of Murcia in southeastern Spain, near the town of Mazarr\u00f3n,\u00a0according to Spain's Ministry of Culture.",
      "Now called the Mazarr\u00f3n II, this shipwreck was one of two located in that same general area. The first, called Mazarr\u00f3n I, was initially located in 1993, lifted from the water in June 1995, and put on display at Spain's National Museum of Underwater Archaeology in 2005 after undergoing years of conservation treatments, the museum said.",
      "Mazarr\u00f3n II is of particular interest to archaeologists and researchers because it is one of only a few Phoenician-era shipwrecks discovered largely intact, said Carlos de Juan, the director of the excavation project, in a video shared by the University of Valencia. The university partnered with the regional culture ministry in Murcia to carry out the excavation.",
      "A team of 14 specialists worked with de Juan to lift the shipwreck from the sea in less than two months, beginning the project Sept. 13 and finishing Nov. 7. Video shows divers carrying wooden fragments of the wreck to the surface in pieces.",
      "Phoenicia was an ancient civilization along the eastern Mediterranean coast, in the area of modern-day Lebanon, Syria and Israel, which existed from about 1500 to 300 B.C.E. Although historians say Phoenicians thrived for a time on trade and developed an alphabet that formed the basis for the ones later produced by ancient Greece and Rome, many traces of the civilization were considered lost until the 20th century.",
      "Artifacts like Mazarr\u00f3n II can help shed light on Phoenician culture, said de Juan. He noted in his comments to the University of Valencia that little is known about Phoenician naval construction, even now, despite the wealth of information about ships built nearby in the Mediterranean by the ancient Greeks.",
      "\"Therefore, this wreck is a very important contribution to this area of study,\" de Juan said. He noted that elements of the Mazarr\u00f3n II are similar to construction designs seen in cultures throughout the surrounding region, but some are distinctive and mysterious, at least for now.",
      "Each piece of the shipwreck has been transferred to a laboratory at the Museum of Underwater Archaeology, in southern Spain. The lab will work carefully to conserve its remains, in a process that will likely take several more years.",

      "The heaviest sentence imposed was six months in prison for a man identified as Sefa O. for public violence against several people.",
      "The Maccabi Tel Aviv fans came under \"hit-and-run\" style attacks in the early hours of Nov. 8 after their European League match against Amsterdam giant Ajax.",
      "Images of the violence, which left five fans briefly hospitalized, went around the world and sparked a furious reaction in Israel \u2014 including accusations of a \"pogrom.\"",
      "The most serious case under consideration Tuesday was that of a man identified as O., who prosecutors said played a \"leading role\" in the violence. The court saw images of the suspect kicking a person on the ground, chasing targets and punching people in the head and body.",

      "Colombia's national immigration agency promptly posted a brief statement on the social media platform X, saying Ochoa was \"freed so that he could join his family\" after immigration officials took his fingerprints and confirmed through a database that he is not wanted by Colombian authorities.",

      "He was the only suspect in that group who opted to go to trial, resulting in his conviction and a 30-year sentence. The other defendants got much lighter prison terms because most of them cooperated with the government.",
      "Ochoa's name has faded from popular memory as Mexican drug traffickers take center stage in the global drug trade.",

    "story": [
      "One thousand, one hundred North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded in Russia's war with Ukraine, and Pyongyang may be preparing to deploy more North Korean soldiers to the region, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said Monday. The information follows a report by Seoul's spy agency last week that said at least 100 North Korean soldiers had been killed since entering combat in December.",
      "Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to reinforce the Russian military, including to the Kursk border region where Ukrainian forces seized territory earlier this year.",
      "\"Through various sources of information and intelligence, we assess that North Korean troops who have recently engaged in combat with Ukrainian forces have suffered around 1,100 casualties,\" the JCS said in a statement.",
      "\"We are particularly interested in the possibility of additional deployments\" of North Korean soldiers to aid Russia's war effort, the JCS said, adding that Pyongyang is reportedly \"preparing for the rotation or additional deployment of soldiers.\"",
      "The JCS said intelligence also suggests that nuclear-armed North Korea was \"producing and providing self-destructible drones\" to Russia to further assist Moscow in its fight against Ukraine, and that North Korea was supplying \"240mm rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled artillery\" for the Russian army.",
      "Seoul's military said North Korea was aiming to modernize its conventional warfare capabilities based on combat experience in the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "\"This could lead to an increase in the North's military threat toward us,\" it said.",
      "The latest findings align with a report by the South Korea's National Intelligence Service, which informed lawmakers that \"Russia might offer reciprocal benefits\" for North Korea's military contributions, including \"modernizing North Korea's conventional weaponry.\"",
      "North Korean and Russian military ties",
      "North Korea and Russia have strengthened their military ties since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "A landmark defense pact between Pyongyang and Moscow, signed in June, came into force this month, and experts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is keen to acquire advanced technology from Russia and battle experience for his troops.",
      "Pyongyang lashed out on Thursday at what it called \"reckless provocation\" by the United States and its allies for a joint statement criticizing North Korea's support for Russia's war in Ukraine, including the deployment of troops.",
      "South Korea and Ukraine announced last month that they would deepen security cooperation in response to the \"threat\" posed by the deployment of North Korean troops, but there was no mention of potential arms shipments from Seoul to Kyiv.",
      "South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol said in November that Seoul was \"not ruling out the possibility of providing weapons\" to Ukraine, which would mark a significant shift in its long-standing policy barring the sale of weapons to countries in active conflict.",
      "North Korea constructing new border fence",
      "North Korea's military was also seen constructing a new fence stretching 25 miles along the border with the South, testing electric barbed-wire fences with what appeared to be goats.",

      "The stepped-up security measures aim to \"prevent defections by North Korean civilians and soldiers southward,\" the JCS said in its report.",
      "The North has also launched around 7,000 trash-carrying balloons into the South on 32 occasions since May, Seoul's military said.",
      "Activist groups in South Korea have long sent propaganda northwards, typically carried by balloons, including leaflets, U.S. dollar bills and sometimes USB drives containing K-pop or K-dramas, which are banned in the tightly controlled North.",
      "Pyongyang rails at such activity and has said its trash-carrying balloon offensive is in retaliation for the activists' propaganda efforts.",
      "While Pyongyang has refrained from launching such balloons since November 29, \"indications of their readiness for a surprise launch at multiple sites\" have been observed, Seoul's military said.",

    "story": [
      "West Virginia native Rachel Braslavi says she moved into her new home so that her family could have more space, and more of a community feel. But she faces bigger questions than she might with a typical home purchase. Their community is the Israeli settlement of Karnei Shomron, located inside the occupied West Bank.",
      "Asked if she sees her family of settlers as impediments to peace, Braslavi replied, \"No. I don't. I really don't. I feel that we have a right to be here. And I feel that the Palestinians have a right to be here.\"",
      "\"On this land?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not this house,\" Braslavi said. \"But I mean, in the area.\"",
      "This settlement, like hundreds of others, is carved into Palestinian land, surrounded by a security fence. \u00a0The border separating the West Bank from Israel is called the Green Line. It was drawn as part of an armistice agreement following the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, which was sparked when the modern state of Israel was formed.",
      "But after Israel's stunning military success in the Six Day War of 1967, Israel took more land, occupying the Palestinian territories, and Israeli citizens began building settlements.",
      "Today, upwards of 700,000 Israelis live in these communities, which the United Nations calls illegal. They're scattered inside the West Bank and East Jerusalem. About 15% of settlers are Americans.",
      "But Rachel Braslavi does not see herself as living on Palestinian land: \"No. I don't. I think that some of the first places that Jews arrived to back in Biblical times were in Judea and Samaria. So, to me, this is part of our indigenous right to be here.\"",
      "I asked, \"How much of your decision to move here to a settlement was cost of living versus ideology?\"",
      "\"I came from America when I was in my 20s to live in Israel,\" she said. \"And I kind of thought of that move as, like, my contribution to the Jewish people in our homeland. It didn't matter where I lived in Israel.",
      "\"And my husband grew up here, and he saw it differently. He really thought, to contribute in a meaningful way, it was moving across the Green Line and establishing, like, facts on the ground.\"",
      "\"What does 'facts on the ground' mean?\"",
      "\"Just strengthening the existing Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria,\" Braslavi replied.",
      "\"In the West Bank?",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "The settler population has grown more than 200 percent since 2000. The Israeli government encourages these moves, paying for the military to guard them, and funding public services like buses and schools.",
      "Judith Segaloff moved to Karnei Shomron seven years ago from Detroit, and says she was able to afford a bigger house here than she would have on the other side of the Green Line. She took us on a tour. \"Across the street is our mall,\" she said. \"We've got an ice cream shop. Here's our sushi shop.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you have friends or family who don't agree with you living in a settlement?\"",

      "Segaloff says she's excited by plans to expand a settlement just up the road. She believes Israeli presence offers security.",
      "\"But it's also a contested place,\" I said, \"a place considered an occupied territory.\"",

      "\"By the international community.\"",

      "He and his wife, Tamador, a high school science teacher, invited us to tea. They say they're most concerned about rising violence from Israeli settlers, emboldened by Benjamin Netanyahu's increasingly right-wing government.

      "Israeli settlers rampage through Palestinian town as violence escalates in occupied West Bank",
      "The Eids are also frustrated that the fence and checkpoints around a settlement have cut them off from their own olive trees. Saher said his freedom was taken away: \"He stole my land. He stole my olives. He stole everything.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is there any space for introspection here? Do you ever think, 'Maybe we aren't the best partners to try to find a path toward peace'?",
      "\"We believe that if there was a Palestinian state without settlements, there would be wide support for peace,\" Saher said.",
      "The differences on this side of the security barrier are stark. Incomes are a fraction of those in Israel, and Israel controls the water and much of the tax revenue.",
      "Saher said he would welcome an Israeli who lives in Tel Aviv into his home, but not a settler: \"No, because he's a thief.\"",
      "Assaf Sharon, a professor of political and legal philosophy at Tel Aviv University, noted, \"James Carville coined the phrase, 'It's the economy, stupid.' In Israel-Palestine, 'It's the settlements, stupid.'\"",
      "In regards to settlers who claim that they did not take anyone's land, that no one was living there before them, Sharon said, \"Well, of course, it wasn't done individually. Occupying a land doesn't mean you have a house on it. It can be grazing land. It can be land reserves for future building. And it can be just the area that is reserved for self-determination of a people.\"",
      "\"Settlers make a security argument, that Israel is safer with the settlements,\" I said.",
      "\"The security argument is completely bogus,\" Sharon replied. \"The settlements are not a security asset; they are a security burden, because defending, protecting scores of civilians, deep in densely populated Palestinian territory, is one hell of a burden for the military.\"",
      "He added, \"The best way to ensure Israel's security is to have partnership with the state or state-like entity that has an interest in preventing precisely this kind of hostile activity.\"",
      "David Makovsky, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said, \"We have ideologues on both sides of this equation that are determined to thwart any accommodation.\"",
      "In 2013, Makovsky was part of the team trying to negotiate a peace deal. That failed proposal, and two others, would have seen Palestinians keep about 95% of the West Bank.",
      "But today, with the increasing number of settlements \u2013 blue dots on the map, some far from the Green Line \u2013 it may be even more complicated to determine borders in a two-state solution.",
      "The negotiations changed under Donald Trump, said Makovsky: \"Until Trump, all of the U.S. peace approaches were similar. Under Trump, working with Prime Minister Netanyahu, he doesn't want to pick and choose which settlements make it and which don't. So, the prime minister convinced the president that every single settlement is called Israel. Now that creates an impossible situation of Swiss cheese. Any Palestinian entity is now going to be dotted with settlements.\"",
      "Now, settlers may have another ally with sway in President-elect Trump's nominee to be the next ambassador to Israel: Mike Huckabee, who has said he's open to annexing parts of the West Bank.",

      "Trump win fuels discussion of Israel annexing the West Bank",
      "Trump ambassador pick Huckabee says administration could back West Bank annexation (Times of Israel)",
      "But there is historical precedent for evacuating settlements. Almost 20 years ago, the Israeli government advocated that leaving Gaza was a path to peace.",
      "According to Makovsky, \"2005 is for the settlers their Waterloo, their defeat.\" That's when Israel removed all 8,000 settlers from Gaza.",
      "Back then, I profiled a 17-year-old who was being forced to leave Gush Katif, her settlement in Gaza. Nineteen years later, settlements are still front-page news. \"Yes, that's how it is in Israel,\" said Rachel Yechieli Gross. Today, she is now a mom with three kids, and no longer lives in a settlement.",
      "I asked, \"The fact that you left your home, your settlement as a teenager, shows that settlements can be closed. Might that be a step toward peace?\"",
      "\"After October 7th, I'm not so sure anymore, because I really believed that there could be change,\" said Gross. \"But I don't feel that anymore.\"",
      "Makovsky blamed the terror group Hamas, which he said \"has really led to the growth of the Israeli right. If people in Israel thought that a Palestinian state was Costa Rica, they would line up to sign, 'cause they want to end the conflict. They just want to be safe. But if they feel a Palestinian state is a mini-Iran, you can't find enough people in the phone booth.\"",

      "\"Nosferatu,\" on the other hand, is a dark, horror-filled retelling of the original 1922 silent film based on the story of \"Dracula,\" with early reviews also labeling it \"erotic\" and \"seductively macabre,\" according to IndieWire.",
      "One of the film\u2019s stars, Lily-Rose Depp, acknowledged the movie isn\u2019t your typical Christmas story, but joked, \"Who doesn't love a good scare on Christmas?\" in an interview with Entertainment Weekly.",

      "Knox explained, \"in order to qualify for the Academy, you have to be in a theater for seven days. And so, you look at the 25th of December and you open [then], that gives you seven days.

      "The third major release on Christmas Day is the Bob Dylan biopic, \"A Complete Unknown,\" starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, which certainly has broader appeal, in part because of its star, who Knox pointed out, is \"the number one favorite of everybody in their late teens and early 20s\" and likely to draw an audience.",

So I feel like it became more accessible and more of like a family-friendly kind of environment for people to just watch it.

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on the bombshell allegations on 'America Reports.'",
      "Donald Trump says it is \"an absolute necessity\" for our country to own Greenland.",
      "He says the U.S. should take back the Panama Canal unless the \"ridiculous\" shipping fees are lowered.",
      "He threatened that any Republican who opposed him on the bill to avoid a government shutdown can and should be primaried.",
      "The president-elect is earning his reputation as a disruptor, with enough influence over what is now his party to blow up carefully negotiated bipartisan compromises. Let\u2019s look at each of these.",
      "HOW PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP COULD PULL OFF 'THE DEAL OF THE CENTURY' AS HE ENTERS OFFICE",
      "Trump tried in his first term to buy Greenland, which is controlled by Denmark but under home rule. That went nowhere, though it created a diplomatic crisis with Danish officials.",
      "While the U.S. built the Panama Canal in the early 20th century, it was turned over to Panama under a treaty approved by both countries. Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino says \"every square meter of the Panama Canal and its adjacent zone is Panama\u2019s and will continue to be so. The sovereignty and independence of our country are not negotiable.\"",
      "That didn\u2019t stop Trump from posting an AI image of an American flag flying over a waterway presumed to be the canal.",
      "The incoming president has certainly demonstrated the ability to engineer primary challenges to those who cross him. But three dozen conservative Republicans voted against him on the government shutdown bill, including on final passage, which dropped his demand to eliminate the debt ceiling during his term. Would he really gin up primaries against all of them?",
      "So the overwhelming likelihood is that the status of Greenland, the Panama Canal and rebellious Republicans won\u2019t change in the second term.",
      "The reason Trump does this is that it reinforces his role as a disruptor, someone taking on the decrepit Washington establishment, even though a president, by definition, is the new establishment.",
      "President-elect Trump points while speaking at AmericaFest, Sunday, Dec. 22, 2024, in Phoenix. (AP Photo/Rick Scuteri)",
      "Beyond that, whether he\u2019s making outrageous demands or not, Trump shapes, and often dominates, the news agenda. As the 47th president has acknowledged to me, he sometimes crosses the line because he knows it will provoke a strong media reaction. As Trump sees it, even negative coverage is good coverage because the press is playing on his turf.",
      "And sometimes these are just negotiating positions to win concessions, as with the threatened 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico.",
      "Remember, most people outside the media-political complex aren\u2019t breathlessly following these developments. Since the government didn\u2019t actually close down, they don\u2019t see it as a setback for Trump that he didn\u2019t get most of what he wanted. They probably don\u2019t recall that he tried to buy Greenland before.",
      "What Trump clearly has the power to do is to blow up carefully crafted bipartisan agreements. He did it after Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. \u2013 whose own future is in doubt because, like Kevin McCarthy before him, he didn\u2019t have the votes \u2013 let the bill grow into a Christmas tree monstrosity.",
      "And he did it during the campaign when both parties agreed on a tough border enforcement deal, which was then trashed by Trump\u2019s objections.",
      "But there are clearly limits to Trump\u2019s ability to shape events, especially with the country. For three dozen Republicans to defy him on as fundamental a matter as the debt ceiling shows that he can only push his party so far.",

According to a July 2024 warning from the\u00a0FBI and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, these scams are part of the cartel's efforts to diversify their revenue streams and finance other criminal activities, including drug trafficking.",

      "How these scams work",
      "The Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) has expanded its criminal activities beyond traditional drug trafficking into sophisticated scams, including timeshare fraud targeting unsuspecting individuals, particularly Americans. Here are some of the methods employed by the cartel in executing these scams:",
      "Impersonation of legitimate entities: Scammers often pose as legitimate real estate agents, escrow companies or even officials from U.S. government agencies like the Treasury Department. This tactic is designed to instill a sense of trust and urgency in potential victims, making them more susceptible to fraud.",
      "Targeting vulnerable populations: The cartel primarily targets elderly Americans who own timeshares in Mexico. These individuals are often contacted with offers to buy their timeshares at inflated values, but they are required to pay various fees upfront, such as taxes or closing costs, before any transaction can be completed. Once these payments are made, the scammers disappear, leaving victims with significant financial losses.",
      "Use of call centers: The CJNG operates illegal call centers where employees, often unaware of the cartel's true nature, engage in telemarketing schemes. These centers are strategically located in regions with high unemployment rates, providing a pool of workers who may be desperate for jobs. The call centers not only facilitate scams but also serve as a means for the cartel to exert control over local populations through intimidation and violence.",
      "Complex fraud schemes: The scams can involve multiple layers of deception. For instance, victims may be contacted multiple times by different scammers posing as various professionals (e.g., lawyers or real estate agents) who claim they can assist with selling their timeshares or recovering lost funds. This re-victimization often leads to further financial exploitation.",
      "Violence and intimidation: The cartel employs extreme measures to maintain control over its operations and silence potential whistleblowers. Reports indicate that workers attempting to quit these call centers have faced dire consequences, including murder, which serves as a chilling message to others considering leaving the cartel's employment. This brutal enforcement mechanism not only protects their operations but also instills fear within communities.",
      "Digital infrastructure: The CJNG utilizes a network of fraudulent websites and domains that appear legitimate at first glance. These websites often mimic real escrow and real estate firms, making it difficult for victims to discern the authenticity of their interactions. Many of these domains have been linked back to a central hub that manages multiple scam operations simultaneously.",
      "By understanding these operational tactics, you can better appreciate the complexities and dangers associated with scams perpetrated by organized crime groups like the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. This knowledge is crucial for potentially preventing future victimization.",

      "To avoid falling victim to similar scams, it is crucial to take proactive steps to safeguard your financial interests:",
      "1) Verify the buyer's identity and offer legitimacy: Always confirm the identity of any potential buyer and the authenticity of their offer. Contact the timeshare company directly to validate any claims made by the buyer.",
      "2) Research any company that contacts you: Conduct thorough research on any business reaching out to you. Look for reviews, complaints and verify their credentials through reliable sources.",
      "3) Be wary of upfront fees: Legitimate transactions typically do not require upfront fees for administrative or processing purposes. If a company requests such payments, exercise caution.",
      "4) Use secure communication channels: Avoid sharing personal or financial information over unsecured methods such as phone calls or emails. Opt for secure communication channels whenever possible.",
      "5) Do not click on links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails. Scammers often use these tactics to steal your personal information. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Consult with professionals before proceeding with transactions: Seek advice from a real estate attorney or a trusted financial advisor before engaging in any transactions. Their expertise can help you navigate potential pitfalls.",
      "7) Report suspicious activity to authorities: If you suspect you've been targeted by a timeshare scam, don't hesitate to promptly report it to local authorities, the\u00a0FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov or the Federal Trade Commission. Reporting can help protect others from falling victim to similar schemes.",
      "8) Invest in personal data removal services: While the advice provided is valuable, the most crucial step in protecting yourself from such scams is to minimize your online presence. By reducing the amount of personal information available on the web, you make it significantly harder for scammers to target you. No service promises to remove all your data from the internet. However, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "If you\u2019re like me, your home Wi-Fi is at the center of almost everything you do online, whether it\u2019s online banking, paying bills, booking trips, chatting with friends or streaming movies.",
      "These days, it\u2019s not just your laptop and phone connected to the network, but also things like security cameras, thermostats and even air conditioners are all managed by your router. But be honest, when was the last time you did anything to secure your router? It\u2019s easy to forget about it, especially if it\u2019s working fine. The thing is, a lot of people feel the same way, and a study reveals this \"out of sight, out of mind\" attitude could be putting millions at serious risk.",

      "Shocking router security facts you need to know",
      "The\u00a02024 Broadband Genie router security survey has uncovered some startling facts about how internet users approach router security. Over half of respondents (52%) admitted they have never adjusted their router\u2019s factory settings. Even more concerning, 86% of users have never changed their router administrator password. Leaving the default admin password unchanged is like leaving your front door unlocked. It\u2019s an open invitation for hackers to exploit.",
      "Similarly, 72% of respondents have never changed their Wi-Fi password. Default passwords are often easily accessible and can be exploited in seconds by knowledgeable attackers. Firmware updates, essential for patching vulnerabilities and enhancing router functionality, are also largely ignored. An overwhelming 89% of users have never updated their router\u2019s firmware. While newer routers often handle updates automatically, user awareness and action remain vital for those with older devices.",
      "Another glaring issue is the failure to change default network names, such as \"SKY12345\" or \"Linksys-7890.\" These identifiers can provide hackers with crucial information about the router model, making it easier to exploit known vulnerabilities. Yet, 89% of respondents have never changed their network name.",

      "CLEVER TRICK TO MAKE A CONNECTION FASTER ON YOUR WI-FI NETWORK",
      "Most people don\u2019t know who\u2019s connected to their network",
      "Alarmingly, 75% of users have never checked to see who is connected to their network. With an average home now hosting around 12 connected devices, failing to monitor network activity could lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Even more worrying, three-quarters of respondents do not understand why adjusting router settings is important, showing a significant gap in awareness about the risks associated with default configurations.",
      "\"In 2022, we ran a similar study and found 48% had never touched their router's factory settings. It\u2019s concerning that not only has the number come down after two years, it\u2019s got worse,\" said Alex Tofts, strategist at Broadband Genie.",
      "\"Most concerning is the very high percentage of broadband subscribers who don\u2019t even know why they should be making any of these changes. This exposes a clear knowledge gap, and users need to be educated more about the simple steps they can take to help prevent cyberattacks.\"",

      "HOW TO CHECK IF SOMEONE IS STEALING YOUR WI-FI",
      "6 ways to protect your Wi-Fi router from hackers",
      "Keeping your home network secure is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Follow these steps to safeguard your Wi-Fi router:",
      "1) Change default passwords:\u00a0Most routers come with default passwords that hackers can easily find online. To secure your router, change both the admin password (used to access settings) and the Wi-Fi network password. Use a strong password with at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid simple options like \"password123\" or personal details such as your name or birth date.",
      "2) Rename your network (SSID):\u00a0The default network name, or SSID, often includes the router\u2019s brand or model, making it easier for hackers to identify vulnerabilities. Rename your network to something unique that doesn\u2019t reveal personal information. Avoid using names, addresses or other identifiers. Instead, opt for a neutral or creative name that\u2019s easy for you to recognize but hard for others to associate with you.",
      "3) Keep your router\u2019s firmware updated:\u00a0Router manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security flaws and enhance performance. Check your router\u2019s admin panel regularly for updates or enable automatic updates, if supported. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures you\u2019re protected against the latest threats. If your router is too old to receive updates, it might be time to upgrade to a newer, more secure model.",
      "4) Monitor network activity regularly:\u00a0Unauthorized devices on your network can slow it down and expose you to risks. Log into your router\u2019s admin settings to view all connected devices. If you see anything suspicious, disconnect it and immediately change your Wi-Fi password. You can also enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can access your network or disable features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that may leave you vulnerable.",
      "5) Enable network encryption: Use the strongest encryption protocol available for your router, preferably WPA3 or at least WPA2. Encryption scrambles the data transmitted over your network, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and decipher your information.",
      "6) Regularly reboot your router: Schedule routine reboots to clear the system memory and refresh all connections, which may disrupt potential malware.",
      "TOP ROUTERS FOR BEST SECURITY 2024",
      "Pro tip: Use strong antivirus software: To further protect your devices from malware and other threats, consider using reputable antivirus software. Antivirus programs can detect and remove malicious software, provide real-time protection and alert you to potential threats. Keeping your devices secure helps ensure your entire network remains safe from cyberattacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Cybercriminals are constantly evolving the ways they target us, which means securing just your phone or laptop isn\u2019t enough anymore. You need to be cautious with anything connected to the internet, whether it's your router, smart cameras or doorbell. However, the Broadband Genie survey reveals that only a small number of people are aware of the best cybersecurity practices when it comes to protecting their routers. As a basic rule, always remember to change default passwords and rename your router\u2019s network to ensure better security.",

During this time, an unknown hacker gained access to the platform and pulled data from provider-patient communications. ConnectOnCall helps health care providers handle after-hours communication and automate patient call tracking.",

      "Use patient portals provided by health care providers to access your medical records online. These portals often have features that allow you to track your medical history and appointments.",
      "2) Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA): Create strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, including health care portals. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code or authentication app, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Don\u2019t fall for phishing scams; use strong antivirus software: Be mindful of the information you share online and with whom you share it. Avoid providing sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or medical details, unless absolutely necessary. Verify the legitimacy of any requests for personal information. Scammers often pose as health care providers or insurance companies to trick you into revealing sensitive data by asking you to click on links in emails or messages.",

      "5) Use identity theft protection services: Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential threats. These services can help you detect and respond to identity theft more quickly. Some identity theft protection services also offer insurance and assistance with recovering from identity theft, providing additional peace of mind.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "6) Freeze your credit:\u00a0A credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name without your authorization, reducing the risk of identity theft. Contact the major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to request a credit freeze. This is often free and can be temporarily lifted when you need to apply for credit.",
      "7) Remove your personal data from the internet: After being part of a data breach, it\u2019s crucial to minimize your online presence to reduce the risk of future scams. Consider using a personal data removal service that can help you delete your information from various websites and data brokers. This can greatly diminish the chances of your data being used maliciously.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The ConnectOnCall health data breach highlights the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures within the health care sector, where the stakes are often much higher than in other industries. With over 910,000 patients affected, this incident shows the serious risks posed by cyberattacks on health care platforms. Sensitive data like medical records and Social Security numbers are permanent and can be misused for identity theft and fraud.

These apps often share user data with third parties and may request extensive permissions, including access to sensitive personal information. This can raise concerns about privacy and data security, especially if the app lacks robust safeguards. Before using a budgeting app, it\u2019s crucial to carefully review its permissions and data-sharing policies to protect your financial and personal information.",
      "Instead of relying on a budgeting app, consider utilizing your bank's online tools. Many banks offer built-in budgeting and expense-tracking features within their secure online banking platforms. These are typically more privacy-focused than third-party apps.\u00a0 Here are some examples:",

      "These bank-provided tools offer the advantage of being integrated directly with your accounts, potentially providing more accurate and up-to-date information while maintaining a higher level of privacy compared to third-party apps.",
      "If you decide to stick to a budgeting app, though, make sure to check its privacy section on the App Store or Google Play, where you can see what data it collects and shares. Then, read the app's privacy policy carefully, as tedious and often deliberately overcomplicated as that can be.",

      "Unless you go completely off the grid digitally \u2014 no internet, online accounts or smartphones \u2014 it\u2019s nearly impossible to avoid leaving a digital footprint. Most companies collect and share your personal information, which ends up in the hands of data brokers and people-search websites that aggregate and sell it to even more third parties.",
      "Data brokerage is a\u00a0$245.8 billion industry that profits off your personal information at the expense of your privacy and security. Some data brokers have even been caught\u00a0intentionally selling information to scammers. People-search sites also provide an accessible way for anyone, including fraudsters, to get their hands on your personal information.",
      "To mitigate these risks, it\u2019s crucial to periodically remove your information from these databases.

But taking just a few minutes to review your security practices can save you from a world of trouble. Don't wait until it\u2019s too late to protect yourself and your loved ones. Neglecting basic security like two-factor authentication, reusing passwords or shopping on untrustworthy websites can leave you exposed. Using finance apps that share your data, like allowing data brokers to profit off your personal information, also increases your risks of experiencing fraud and identity theft. By staying vigilant, you can protect both your finances and your loved ones.",

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 10:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A virtual private network can help ensure your information remains security and your privacy remains intact. Kurt the CyberGuy explains.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says a VPN enhances online banking security by encrypting data and protecting privacy.",
      "Have you ever felt a little uneasy while browsing the internet, wondering who might be watching your online activities?",
      "Well, let me introduce you to a handy tool that can put your mind at ease: the virtual private network, or VPN.",
      "Whether you're working from home, streaming your favorite shows or just exploring the web, a VPN can help ensure that your data stays secure and your privacy intact. So, let\u2019s dive into why having a VPN at home is a smart move.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2014 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "A VPN on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A virtual private network, or VPN, encrypts your internet traffic and reroutes it through a server in a different location than your own. VPNs make it appear that you are connecting to the internet from whichever location the server is hosted in rather than your actual location.",
      "When you first connect to a network using a VPN, your device will establish a secure connection with the VPN server, and your device's IP address will appear as the VPN server, meaning that only your internet service provider will see that you're connecting to a VPN server. Normally, when you connect to a website, the website or any online services you visit can see your device's technical information, including location-sensitive data such as IP addresses.",
      "THE BEST VPNS FOR BROWSING THE WEB IN 2024",
      "Why would you want a VPN at home?",
      "While your home internet connection is more secure than a\u00a0public Wi-Fi connection, VPNs still provide a greater sense of privacy and access to content that might be restricted due to location. Here are 10 reasons I have for getting a home VPN.",
      "Online communication can be hit or miss when it comes to security. Some messaging services, such as Whatsapp, use end-to-end device encryption, which helps keep your messages secure, but other messaging services, such as Skype, don't use end-to-end encryption. If you use a VPN with any communication apps, then all your connection and messaging data between your device and the VPN server is fully encrypted.",
      "A VPN on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Online content and services like Netflix are restricted to specific geographic regions. This content can range from news websites to video streaming platforms and social media apps. Using a VPN at home can appear to be using the internet from another location, allowing you to access restricted services.",
      "Sometimes, an internet service provider (ISP) will slow down bandwidth or certain online activities. One of the most common reasons networks do this is to manage network congestion, especially during peak hours. You might notice that your home internet connection slows down at night, when everyone is home from work, or it might slow down when summer vacation starts. Using a VPN will prevent your service provider from identifying the type of web content you are accessing, making it impossible for your ISP to slow down your traffic.",
      "A VPN also keeps your internet activity private from Wi-Fi network admins, who, if technically skilled enough, can figure out which websites you've visited. If you're worried about the Wi-Fi admin of your office, hotel, school or other public place having access to your browsing history, a VPN is the perfect solution for you. When it comes to your own home Wi-Fi network, a VPN will keep your browsing history private from other household members.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers deploy large-scale cyberattacks to observe network activity and steal your information. These attacks are particularly prevalent on public Wi-Fi networks, which often have minimal security measures, but they can also target secured networks. Using a VPN can significantly enhance your security by providing encryption for your internet traffic, making it difficult for hackers to intercept and read your data. This encryption is especially crucial when using public Wi-Fi, as it secures your information from potential eavesdroppers.",
      "Additionally, a VPN masks your real IP address with that of the VPN server, helping to protect your identity online and making it harder for attackers to target you directly. However, it is essential to understand that while a VPN adds a layer of security,\u00a0it is not a comprehensive solution against all cyber threats.",
      "A VPN does not prevent malware infections or\u00a0phishing attacks, so you must still employ\u00a0strong antivirus software and exercise caution when clicking on links or downloading files.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Furthermore, not all VPNs are created equal; some may have vulnerabilities or questionable privacy practices. It is crucial to choose a\u00a0reputable provider that uses strong encryption and has a clear no-logging policy.",
      "There's a myriad of reasons, ranging from political to economic, that countries use to justify censoring certain apps and websites. It can be incredibly frustrating for citizens and anyone traveling to that country to lose access to email, social media, news websites and other tools that keep us connected to the world around us. I've used VPNs extensively while traveling to ensure that I can always view my most important websites, no matter where I actually am. As I've mentioned, a VPN can mask your IP address and make it appear as traffic from a different country, allowing you to bypass online geographic restrictions.",
      "One of the best reasons to have a VPN at home is that it can help you save money and find better deals while online shopping. Some online retailers change their prices depending on users' locations. However, when using a VPN while shopping for plane tickets, hotels or gifts, it's possible to\u00a0find cheaper prices just by changing your location.",
      "It's no longer the work of sci-fi. We do know that governments, nearly all of them, surveil their citizens. A VPN will add a layer of privacy, making it significantly more difficult for governments to detect your web traffic. Even if you feel that you have nothing to hide, online privacy is something you should feel free to exercise.",
      "Much like governments, your ISP can surveil your online activity with ease. While most ISPs claim that they don't sell your browsing data, they are often allowed through contracts with marketing agencies to give your data away for free to advertise to you. The simplest way to hide your online activity from your ISP is to use a VPN. When using a VPN, your ISP won't be able to see which websites you visit or which apps you use.",

      "While it may seem counterintuitive, a VPN can offer faster connection speeds for online gaming. It can also help prevent your ISP from throttling bandwidth directly from gaming servers. By changing your VPN's location, you can connect to a server closer to your gaming server, which will give you better latency. This is also called ping, which determines how fast the server responds to your inputs.",

      "Tips for maximizing your VPN security",
      "To fully leverage the benefits of your VPN and enhance your online security, consider these important tips that will help protect your personal information and ensure safe browsing.",
      "1. Choose a reliable VPN:\u00a0Select a reputable VPN service with strong encryption protocols.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Always use VPN on public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Never access financial accounts on\u00a0public networks without activating your VPN first.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by\u00a0enabling 2FA.",

      "4. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create complex passwords for each of your accounts and consider using a password manager. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "5. Regularly monitor your accounts: Check your retirement accounts frequently for any suspicious activity.",
      "6. Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and apps are always\u00a0up-to-date with the latest security patches.",
      "7. Be cautious of phishing scams while using a VPN:\u00a0Even with a VPN securing your connection, phishing scams remain a significant threat to your online safety. These scams often use deceptive emails or links to steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. To protect yourself, combine the use of a VPN with\u00a0strong antivirus software that detects and blocks phishing attempts. Additionally, always scrutinize unsolicited emails, avoid clicking on suspicious links, and never provide personal information without verifying the source.\u00a0For the best protection, check out my expert reviews of the top 2024 antivirus solutions for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. Together with a VPN, this approach helps keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "His project, DartSolar, harnesses solar energy while the car is parked, potentially adding up to 20 extra miles of driving range each day without ever needing to plug in. As he gets ready to roll out the next iteration, Beta2, let\u2019s explore what makes this innovation so groundbreaking.",

      "Rooftop solar panel system (DartSolar)",
      "The concept behind DartSolar",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) often spend significant time parked in open spaces, making them ideal candidates for solar energy collection. Sadeghpour's vision is simple yet effective: why not utilize the sun's energy to charge EVs while they are stationary? This concept forms the foundation of the DartSolar project.",
      "DartSolar isn\u2019t just about innovation; it\u2019s also about practicality. Imagine a rooftop solar panel that\u2019s aerodynamic, weatherproof, theft-resistant and easy to use. It opens in just 10 seconds with the same effort required to open your car door. These panels are tough, too, built to withstand wind, rain, sand and snow, ensuring reliable performance in all conditions.",

      "Omid Sadeghpour's initial prototype, known as Beta 1, was built in collaboration with Jeran Bruce at California's Forged Makerspace. This prototype is designed with nine flexible solar panels, each rated at 175 watts, which can be deployed when the vehicle is parked. The structure is made from wood and features telescoping carbon-fiber tubes that allow for easy expansion and retraction.",
      "Weighing in at under 165 pounds, Beta 1 remains within the roof weight capacity of the Tesla Model Y and is designed to fit within a standard U.S. parking space when fully expanded.",
      "When fully deployed, Beta 1 can generate approximately 6 kWh of power per day, which translates to about 20 miles of additional driving range. When it\u2019s time to drive again, the system can be collapsed into a compact rooftop box in under a minute.",

      "TESLA SEMI'S IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE ON ICE MARKS ANOTHER MAJOR TRIUMPH",
      "Advancements with beta 2",
      "Now, let\u2019s talk about the future. Beta 2, the fifth iteration of DartSolar, takes innovation to the next level. This version swaps the wood structure for carbon fiber, cutting its height in half for better aerodynamics. The wattage capacity has also been boosted to a potential 4,000 watts, providing up to 45 miles of range per day under optimal conditions.",
      "Here\u2019s where things get exciting: Beta 2 introduces dynamic charging capabilities. This means the panels can charge the car while driving or in different configurations, like partially opened for better airflow or fully closed during high-speed travel. With a reduced drag loss of just 1%-2%, it\u2019s as efficient on the road as it is when parked.",

      "Scammers have become skilled at creating convincing fake websites.",
      "Online financial scams have become increasingly sophisticated, targeting unsuspecting individuals through various deceptive techniques. Cybercriminals exploit trust and create convincing scenarios to steal personal and financial information, often using well-known platforms like PayPal as their hunting ground.",

      "Paul's unfortunate encounter with online fraud offers several important lessons. First, scammers have become adept at creating highly convincing fake websites that can easily fool unsuspecting users. These sites often mimic legitimate platforms down to the smallest details, making it crucial to verify the authenticity of any site requesting personal information.",

      "Protecting your financial information online is crucial. Here are some important steps you can take to safeguard yourself against cyber threats:",
      "Verify the website's authenticity: Before entering any personal information online, always double-check the URL of the website you're visiting. Look for \"https://\" at the beginning of the address and a padlock icon in the address bar, which indicates a secure connection. To ensure you're on the correct site, type the web address directly into your browser instead of relying on search engine results or clicking on links from emails.",
      "Be wary of unsolicited communications:\u00a0Legitimate companies will never send unsolicited emails asking for sensitive information. Avoid clicking on links in emails claiming to be from financial institutions, as these could be phishing attempts. Hover over the links to see the actual URL before clicking, as this can help you identify suspicious or misleading addresses. If you're unsure about a communication, log in to your account directly through the official website or app to check for any notifications or requests.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Use strong authentication methods:\u00a0Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your financial accounts to add an extra layer of security. Create unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts, avoiding the temptation to reuse passwords across multiple sites. Consider using a reputable\u00a0password manager to help you generate and store strong passwords securely.",
      "Monitor your accounts regularly:\u00a0Make it a habit to check your financial accounts frequently for any unauthorized activities or suspicious transactions. Set up alerts for transactions on your credit cards and online payment accounts so you can be immediately notified of any activity on your accounts.",
      "Be cautious with personal information: Never share your passwords or answers to security questions with anyone, no matter how trustworthy they may seem. Be skeptical of any requests for personal information, especially those that create a sense of urgency. Legitimate organizations will not pressure you to provide sensitive data immediately.",
      "Use secure payment methods: When making purchases from unknown sellers, use protected payment options that offer buyer protection. Consider using credit cards for online purchases, as they often provide better fraud protection than debit cards. If a website offers multiple payment options, choose the most secure method available.",
      "Use caution with public Wi-Fi: Avoid using\u00a0public Wi-Fi networks for financial transactions, as these can be easily compromised. If you must access financial accounts while away from home, use a secure VPN connection to protect against being tracked and to identify your potential location on websites that you visit.\u00a0Many sites can read your IP address and, depending on their privacy settings, may display the city from which you are corresponding. A VPN will disguise your IP address to show an alternate location.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "President Biden's recent move to commute the sentences of 37 of 40 federal inmates on death row has been met with praise by some and criticism by others, who say it's unclear why the president made the decision in the first place.",
      "The president announced on Monday that 37 federal death-row inmates would have their sentences changed to life in prison without the possibility of parole, with the White House saying in a statement that Biden believes \"America must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level, except in cases of terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.\"",
      "\"When President Biden came into office, his Administration imposed a moratorium on federal executions, and his actions today will prevent the next Administration from carrying out the execution sentences that would not be handed down under current policy and practice,\" the White House said.",

      "John R. Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and former chief economist for the U.S. Sentencing Commission in Washington, told Fox News Digital that Biden's rationale in deciding to commute the death sentences of 37 federal death-row inmates rather than all 40 remains unclear.",
      "\"There were mass murderers that he commuted the sentence for, and yet there are other ones who killed fewer that he didn't commute the sentence for,\" Lott said. \"When I read his statement, it wasn't obvious to me what his rationale was for dividing the cases the way he did.\"",
      "\"If he thinks the death penalty is wrong, it's not exactly clear where the line was drawn.\"",
      "Lott added that the president \"could just be playing to his base\" in his decision to commute 37 sentences, but noted that victims' families have shared statements expressing how their loved ones were shown no mercy at the hands of those now receiving life sentences instead of death.",

      "Lott, however, said that death sentences often inspire criminals to plead guilty to their crimes in order to avoid death, thus allowing governments to avoid costly and emotionally taxing death-penalty trials. Dylann Roof \u2014 one of the three federal inmates Biden decided to keep on death row \u2014 initially expressed interest in pleading guilty in his federal case to avoid the death penalty, Lott noted.",
      "\"Economists have looked at this extensively and found that on average, for each execution that occurs, you'll see a reduction in the number of murders by between about eight and eighteen,\" Lott said. \"That's obviously related to the fact that [the death penalty] is a deterent for these guys.\"",

      "The Islamic Republic of Iran has continued its pursuit of obtaining a nuclear weapon by not only stockpiling enriched uranium to near-weapons grade purity, it has expanded its covert actions in developing its weaponization capabilities.",
      "According to information obtained by sources embedded in the Iranian regime and supplied to the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an opposition organization based out of D.C. and Paris, there are indications that Tehran has once again renewed efforts to advance its ability to detonate a nuclear weapon.",
      "At the head of Iran\u2019s detonators program is an organization the NCRI has dubbed METFAZ, which is the Farsi acronym for the Center for Research and Expansion of Technologies on Explosions and Impact, and its recent movements at a previously deactivated site, known as Sanjarian, has drawn immense speculation.",

      "IRAN HIDING MISSILE, DRONE PROGRAMS UNDER GUISE OF COMMERCIAL FRONT TO EVADE SANCTIONS",
      "\"Our information shows the METFAZ has expanded its activities, intensified activities, and their main focus is basically the detonation of the nuclear bomb,\" Alireza Jafarzadeh, deputy director of the NCRI in the U.S., told Fox News Digital. \"When you make a bomb, you have the fissile material at the center of it, but you need to be able to trigger it, to detonate it, and that\u2019s a sophisticated process.",
      "\"It\u2019s important to see what METFAZ does and follow their activities because that is sort of like a gauge on figuring out where the whole nuclear weapons program is,\" he added.",
      "Iran has at least a dozen sites across the country dedicated to nuclear development, weaponization, research and heavy water production, but information shared with Fox News Digital suggests that there has been an increase in covert activity in at least two of these locations, including Sanjarian, which was once one of Iran\u2019s top weaponization facilities.",
      "The Sanjarian site, located roughly 25 miles east of Tehran and once central to Iran\u2019s nuclear program under what is known as the Amad Plan, was believed to have been largely inactive between 2009 and late 2020 after stiff international pushback on Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",

      "In 2022, trees were planted along the entrance road to the compound, effectively blocking satellite imagery from monitoring vehicles stationed there, before a security gate was then believed to have been installed in May 2023, according to information also verified by the Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "Sanjarian in 2024 (Image provided by the NCRI)",
      "Now, according to details supplied by on-the-ground sources to the NCRI this month, top nuclear experts have been seen regularly visiting the site since April 2024 and are believed to be operating under the front company known as Arvin Kimia Abzaar, which claims to be affiliated with the oil and gas industry, a sector in which Iran has long attempted to conceal its activities.",

      "METFAZ falls under Iran\u2019s Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research, which is widely known to security experts as the organization spearheading Iran\u2019s nuclear development and is suspected of using the Sanjarian site for renewed research on exoloding bridgewire (EWB) detonators.",
      "Iran has previously attempted to conceal its EBW detonators program, a system first invented in the 1940s to deploy atomic warheads but which has expanded into non-military sectors, under activities relating to the oil industry.",
      "In a 2015 report, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), noted that Iran\u2019s detonator development was an \"integral part of a program to develop an implosion-type nuclear explosive device.\"",
      "It also highlighted how Iran attempted to conceal its program by alleging during a May 20, 2014, meeting that the detonator program dating back to 2000-2003 was related to Tehran\u2019s aerospace industry and was needed to \"help prevent explosive accidents\" but which the IAEA determined was \"inconsistent with the timeframe and unrelated to the detonator development program.\"",

      "The IAEA did not respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions on the NCRI\u2019s most recent findings, which were shared with the nuclear watchdog this week, and it remains unclear what advancements or research Iran continues to pursue in the detonator field.",

      "The NCRI also found that METFAZ, which operates out of a military site known as Parchin some 30 miles southeast of Tehran, has expanded its Plan 6 complex where it conducts explosive tests and production.",
      "Parchin, which is made up of several military industrial complexes, was targeted in Israel\u2019s October 2024 strikes.

      "\"The regime has used deceptive tactics to prevent any mechanism for verification, and it has yet to provide an opportunity or the means for the IAEA to have a satisfactory answer to the inquiries it has raised,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Our revelation today shows that the regime has no transparency related to its program for building an atomic bomb and is moving towards building the bomb at a rapid pace.\"",

      "Republicans are defending a slim Senate majority in 2026, but Democrats still have a tough fight ahead to take control of the chamber.",
      "Democrats need a net gain of four seats to take control of the Senate in two years. And while there are 20 Republicans up for re-election in the upcoming midterms compared to 13 Democrats, many of those Republicans are running in deep-red states.",
      "Just one GOP senator is running in a state Vice President Kamala Harris won in November, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, while two Democrats (Georgia\u2019s Jon Ossoff and Michigan\u2019s Gary Peters) are up for re-election in states President-elect Donald Trump won.",
      "This class of senators will be facing a different political environment than they did in their last races in 2020, when they were running in a presidential election year with historic turnout. And the environment could also be very different from 2014, when several of these Republicans were first elected to the Senate in a red wave. The upcoming 2026 elections could be trickier for Republicans, since the president\u2019s party historically struggles in midterms.",
      "Another factor that could shake up the Senate map: whether longtime lawmakers like Sen. Mitch McConnell, the outgoing GOP leader, decide to retire. McConnell, 82, has not yet said if he\u2019ll run for another term in ruby-red Kentucky, though he has committed to serving out his current term.",
      "As the battle for the Senate takes shape, here are the key races to watch.",
      "Top targets",
      "The core of the 2026 battleground map consists of the three senators up for re-election in states that backed the opposite party for president this\u00a0year, making them top targets heading into the midterms.",
      "Collins is the only GOP senator representing a state that Harris won in November. Collins has signaled that she intends to run for a sixth term, and she has been tough to beat in the past despite Maine\u2019s blue lean.",
      "Collins defeated former state House Speaker Sara Gideon by 9 points in 2020, even as Joe Biden won the state by 9 points, too. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who cannot run for that office again due to term limits, has not ruled out taking on Collins, according to the Portland Press Herald.",
      "On the flip side are the two Democrats up for re-election in states Trump carried in November.",
      "Peters is fresh off of two stints as head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and he is no stranger to tough races in Michigan. Trump carried the state by 1 point in November after losing it by nearly 3 points in 2020. That year, Peters also won a second term by nearly 2 points, defeating now-GOP Rep. John James.",
      "Ossoff is running for a second term in Georgia, which Trump carried by 2 points this year. Ossoff won a hotly contested Senate runoff on Jan. 5, 2021, narrowly defeating then-GOP Sen. David Perdue, who has been tapped to be Trump\u2019s ambassador to China.",
      "Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, who cannot run for governor again due to term limits, is a potential Senate candidate. Kemp told Fox News last month that he is focused on leading the Republican Governors Association but that he tries to \u201ckeep all doors open.\u201d",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., is expected to be another top Democratic target, running for re-election in a perennial battleground state Trump won by 3 points. Tillis has won his two Senate races by less than 2 points each.",
      "Outgoing Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper told WSOC-TV that a Senate run is \u201con the table,\u201d but he has not yet decided if he\u2019ll jump into the race. Democratic Rep. Wiley Nickel also told Bloomberg Government he is likely to formally announce a Senate run in February, after he did not seek re-election in his redrawn district.",
      "Primary fights",
      "Some Republicans could face primary fights against Trump-aligned challengers, as Trump\u2019s allies threaten to take on senators who do not support Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks or the president-elect\u2019s agenda.",
      "Primary speculation is already swirling around Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst as she navigates the confirmation process for Trump\u2019s defense secretary pick, Pete Hegseth. And Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, also a Trump ally, has suggested he might challenge GOP Sen. John Cornyn.",
      "One Senate Republican has already drawn a primary challenger: two-term Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy. He is one of three GOP senators left in the chamber who voted to convict Trump on impeachment charges after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.",
      "Louisiana state Treasurer John Fleming, a former congressman who served in the first Trump administration, launched a challenge against Cassidy earlier this month, citing that impeachment vote to argue that Cassidy \u201chas failed the people of Louisiana.\u201d",
      "Cassidy\u2019s main electoral challenge in the ruby-red state would be in a primary. And it remains to be seen whether Trump, who won Louisiana by 22 points in November, will try to take out Cassidy and boost a primary challenger.",
      "Other battlegrounds",
      "With Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina the only perennial battlegrounds hosting Senate races in 2026, both parties will have to reach deeper into the opposing party\u2019s territory to try and pick up more seats.",
      "National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Tim Scott, R-S.C., told Fox News that Republicans could \u201cexpand the map\u201d by targeting New Hampshire and Virginia.",
      "Scott also said Republicans could look at New Mexico and Minnesota \u201cif you\u2019re stretching,\u201d noting Trump improved his margin in those states. Harris carried New Mexico by 6 points and Minnesota by 4 points this year.",
      "Incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has yet to name a new DSCC chair, although Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., is expected to get the post, according to Axios.",
      "But Democrats could take a look at Senate seats that they also contested in 2020, like Iowa or Texas. While Trump carried both states by around 13 points this year, he won them by single digits four years ago. Both Ernst and Cornyn won re-election in 2020 by 7 and 10 points respectively, but they could face a tougher political environment in a midterm election year.",
      "Looming special elections",
      "Trump\u2019s presidency is also set to cause two resignations in the Senate, which will be filled at first by gubernatorial appointments but then by special elections in 2026.",
      "Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, will leave the Senate to become Trump\u2019s vice president, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has been tapped to be Trump\u2019s secretary of state.",
      "Ohio GOP Gov. Mike DeWine will select someone to replace Vance in the Senate, and a special election will be held in 2026 to fill the final two years of Vance\u2019s term, with several statewide and other elected officials among the possible picks.",
      "If Rubio is confirmed, GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis would also appoint a successor, and a 2026 special election would be held for the final two years of Rubio\u2019s term. DeSantis wrote in a post on X in November that he had \u201calready received strong interest from several possible candidates,\u201d and he would likely make a decision in early January.",
      "Both states have shifted significantly toward Republicans in recent elections, but Democrats could be eyeing recruits they think are capable of putting the states in play in what could be a more favorable Democratic year.",
      "In Ohio, for example, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown has not ruled out a run for Vance\u2019s seat after he lost re-election this year, when he ran ahead of Harris."

      "In a lawsuit filed in New York Supreme Court on Tuesday, Stephanie Jones and her agency Jonesworks accuse Baldoni\u2019s publicist Jennifer Abel of breach of contract, claiming she violated her employment terms by setting up a competing firm and stealing documents and clients out from under Jones. It also accuses Abel of defamation, according to a copy of the suit.",
      "Jones\u2019 suit, which was first reported by The New York Times, comes days after a separate complaint filed by Lively with the California Civil Rights Department against some of the same defendants, alleging Baldoni sexually harassed her on set and then engaged in a retaliatory campaign facilitated by Abel and crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan. Nathan is also named as a defendant in Jones\u2019 complaint, along with Baldoni and his company, Wayfarer Studios.",
      "Lively\u2019s allegations have sent shock waves across the industry. Her complaint has also put the role that crisis PR firms play in the spotlight, with many online reexamining some of the negative headlines surrounding Lively during the promotional tour for \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "Jones represented Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios from 2017 to August of this year. Abel worked for Jonesworks from 2020 to August. Several of Abel\u2019s text messages and emails, which the suit said were obtained via a subpoena of Jonesworks, were cited heavily in Lively\u2019s complaint.",
      "The film \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of the popular Colleen Hoover novel, was released in theaters in August. Lively portrays heroine Lily Bloom, while Baldoni plays her abusive romantic partner, Ryle Kincaid. Baldoni also adapted and directed the project.",

      "\u201cBehind Jones\u2019s back, they secretly coordinated with Baldoni and Wayfarer to implement an aggressive media smear campaign against Baldoni\u2019s film co-star, and then used the crisis as an opportunity to drive a wedge between Jones and Baldoni, and to publicly pin blame for this smear campaign on Jones \u2014 when Jones had no knowledge or involvement in it,\u201d the lawsuit states.",
      "Abel and Nathan \u201cleveraged their teams to create and perpetuate negative content about Lively on social media platforms such as Reddit and TikTok,\u201d according to the suit.",
      "\u201cAt the same time as Abel and Nathan were working to protect Baldoni from negative press attention, they were actively working their media contacts to plant negative stories about Jones and Jonesworks,\u201d Jones\u2019 suit states. They used \u201cmore than a dozen fake social media accounts and dark web accounts that defamed Jones and Jonesworks.\u201d",
      "Bryan Freedman, a lawyer representing Baldoni, Wayfarer, Abel and Nathan, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about Jones\u2019 suit on Tuesday.",

Freedman also referred to Lively\u2019s claims as \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "In her suit, Jones cited some text messages she said she obtained from Abel\u2019s work phone after terminating Abel in August. Some of the texts Jones included in her own suit were previously unpublished, including one allegedly sent by Abel that called Baldoni \u201cunlikeable and unrealistic as a leading man.\u201d",

      "In the wake of on-set demands from Lively asking Baldoni and Wayfarer CEO Jamey Heath to stop certain behaviors, including entering her trailer while she was in a state of undress and adding unscripted sexual scenes into the film, Jones alleged that she had originally planned to counter the emerging media narrative around tensions between the stars with \u201ca positive press strategy.\u201d",

    "summary": "Netflix will air two marquee NFL events on Christmas Day, a key test of its technological ability as it doubles down on live event programming.",
    "story": [
      "Is the king of streaming ready for some football?",
      "In a first, Netflix is set to host the NFL\u2019s two marquee Christmas Day games: the Kansas City Chiefs vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers at 1 p.m. ET, followed by the Baltimore Ravens against the Houston Texans at 4:30 p.m. Beyonc\u00e9 will headline the halftime show during the latter game, featuring her first live performance of tracks from her \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d country album.",
      "The games are a key test for the streaming giant as it doubles down on live events programming and aims to provide more than 280 million subscribers with real-time content that was once the exclusive domain of traditional television networks. But amid the hoopla, the company faces questions about whether it has the capacity to stream these events without technical glitches.",
      "The concerns were underscored during the heavily hyped boxing match between retired pro Mike Tyson and social media personality Jake Paul. Netflix called the Nov. 15 fight the most-streamed sporting event ever, peaking at 65 million concurrent streams. But many viewers were frustrated by buffering issues during the livestream.",
      "\u201cGlitchy is a generous way of describing it,\u201d said Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive.",
      "Similarly, the streamer\u2019s \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d reunion special in April 2023 was delayed after what one of the company\u2019s top executives described as a technical \u201cbug\u201d that had been accidentally introduced in an effort to improve live broadcasting after it aired a Chris Rock stand-up comedy special the previous month.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t meet the standard that we expect from ourselves to serve our members,\u201d Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said on an earnings call last year.",
      "In the run-up to the big holiday NFL games, Netflix said it studied issues from previous live events and made necessary adjustments. The tweaks include leaning on third-party providers such as Charter Communications and Comcast, which are giving Netflix extra capacity, according to sources familiar with the matter. (Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)",
      "The media operation at the NFL, which entered into a three-year deal with Netflix to broadcast some games, feels confident about the streaming platform\u2019s bandwidth.",
      "\u201cI think the evolution of the medium is getting there,\u201d Brian Rolapp, the league\u2019s chief media and business officer, told CNBC. \u201cAnd I think they\u2019re taking all the necessary steps to have a great Christmas Day.\u201d",
      "Netflix is not the only major streaming service that has pushed more deeply into high-profile events that were once carried on broadcast networks or cable channels.",
      "Amazon Prime Video holds the exclusive streaming rights for the NFL\u2019s \u201cThursday Night Football.\u201d Disney+ simulcasts sporting events through its ESPN tile, and Warner Bros.\u2019 Max app plays CNN news broadcasts and NBA games that used to run strictly on TNT. Peacock, the platform owned and operated by NBCUniversal, drew a sizable audience this summer as the streaming home of the Paris Olympics.",
      "Netflix has more high-profile live events on the calendar, including weekly World Wrestling Entertainment \u201cRaw\u201d shows that start streaming in less than two weeks. Then, in 2027 and 2031, Netflix will be home to the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup. Netflix has also shown interest in livestreaming Hollywood awards shows; the 30th Screen Actors Guild Awards aired on the platform in late February.",
      "\u201cI think that everyone \u2026 is going to have to get used to finding their content across multiple different distribution platforms,\u201d said Crakes, the former Fox Sports executive."

      "Congress passed the measure with unanimous support.",
      "Although the bird of prey is at the center of the Great Seal\u00a0of the United States, it was never formally recognized as the country's official bird. Some of the Founding Fathers \u2014 Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson \u2014 were tasked with creating a national seal but simply couldn't come to an agreement.",
      "In 1782, a version of the seal with a bald eagle was submitted by Secretary of the Continental Congress Charles Thomson and approved. Most Americans are familiar with the seal's eagle carrying a flag-emblazoned shield holding an olive branch in one talon and arrows in the other.",
      "Franklin was historically against the decision, arguing in a letter to his daughter that the bald eagle was \"a bird of bad moral character.\"",
      "Either way, the U.S. has not had an official bird in the almost 250 years since its founding.",
      "Minnesota resident Preston Cook has long hoped that the eagle would ascend into the U.S. code, even writing a draft a bill and sending it to lawmakers.",
      "Cook described himself as having a lifelong obsession with the bald eagle, and took it upon himself to push for a change when discovering that there was no official U.S. bird. He wrote a simple piece of legislation that would change the code to say that, \u201cThe bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is the national bird.\u201d",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., then led a bipartisan group who brought it to the Senate floor in July. It passed unanimously before sailing through the House last week with no opposition.",

    "summary": "In 1925, Anatol Josepho invented the automated photo booth in New York City, originally calling it a photomaton.",
    "story": [
      "In 1925, Anatol Josepho invented the automated photo booth in New York City, originally calling it a photomaton. Nearly a century later, historians say only 200 working analog photo booths are left. One of them has made its way to downtown Manhattan.",
      "After having traveled to Paris and seen street-accessible analog photo booths, Zo\u00eb Lazerson, 27, and Brandon Minton, 25, questioned why there are so few booths available in their home city, New York.",
      "\u201cIt is the earliest selfie,\u201d Lazerson said.",
      "Determined to share their love of analog, the couple bought a photo booth from an owner in St. Louis. After some research, they committed to a 30-hour round-trip drive to transport it back to the Lower East Side.",
      "The investment proved to be worth it. Their photo booth, dubbed \u201cOld Friend,\u201d has been a success, getting support from a younger generation eager to be captured in the moment by the century-old technology.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s something about having a physical photo in your hand,\u201d said Marlon, a customer at the booth on a sunny winter day.",
      "On average, the booth goes through 400 to 700 photo strips a day. Each session costs $8. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the line up to an hour and a half,\u201d Lazerson said.",
      "While the analog booth has proven successful as a business venture, keeping it running poses unique challenges. Analog photo booths require regular maintenance, and often the technology required to keep them functioning involves pieces that are no longer manufactured.",
      "Meags Fitzgerald, 37, a photo booth historian, is an active member of a tightly knit 50-person community of booth technicians, owners, collectors and enthusiasts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a 70-year-old technology in most cases, in some cases older, and the parts are brittle and can break,\u201d she said.",
      "When digital technology came about, Fitzgerald said, many companies no longer saw the use in putting up with the hassle of keeping analog booths alive, ultimately replacing analog chemistry tanks with instant digital printouts.",
      "\u201cIn the early digital era, kind of very late \u201990s or early 2000s, these major photo booth companies were jumping at the gun to switch out these analog machines and replace them with digital ones,\u201d she said.",
      "Some booths were effectively zombified, maintaining their retro look on the exterior but with replaced digital parts inside. Others were trashed entirely and ended up in landfills. \u201cWith that, a lot of knowledge of how to service the photo booths died,\u201d Fitzgerald said.",
      "Bre Conley, 41, understands the complicated nature of photo booths well. Conley, a former wedding photographer, owns about 50 photo booths, 20 of which operate across seven states while she works to restore and place the rest.",
      "\u201cMy whole goal was really to get as many booths as I could and put them in places where anybody could use them,\u201d she said. Conley and other enthusiasts have compiled a list of every operating analog photo booth in existence \u2014 a tally of about 200.",
      "Much like Lazerson and Minton, Conley has run into challenges. Her most unexpected one: finding the right paper.",
      "The specific type of paper required for analog photo booths is made in Russia. And when the Russia-Ukraine war began, booth owners weren\u2019t sure how they\u2019d continue to operate.",
      "\u201cNo shipments from Russia were allowed into the U.S., and so we were cut off from the supply, and a lot of photo booth technicians went under,\u201d Conley said.",
      "She wasn\u2019t willing to let the booths go down without a fight. Conley wrote to film labs and scoured the globe for someone willing to make the right paper. After having tested various types, she found a brand that would work but required hand cutting. With a surge in demand for booths and paper, the company now provides precut rolls of its paper.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely an endless battle,\u201d she said.",
      "But the fight to maintain the old machines is worth it, analog photo booth enthusiasts and owners agree, if only for the unique physical keepsake.",
      "\u201cPhoto booths capture time and a memory that they can cherish and keep forever,\u201d Conley said.",
      "Said Lazerson, \u201cYou have a private moment with yourself where you go in with friends or family, and it\u2019s that connectedness that I think people are seeking.\u201d"

      "The Justice Department found that two Tennessee organizations discriminated against a lawyer who was denied his law license for nearly three years and forced to pay thousands of dollars for evaluations because he was using a medication to treat his opioid use disorder.",
      "The findings, published last Tuesday in a letter to the organizations \u2014 the Tennessee Board of Law Examiners and the Tennessee Lawyers Assistance Program \u2014 build on the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to protect the millions of people in recovery from opioid addiction from discrimination. It is its third such case about employment and licensing and the first related to the legal profession.",
      "The detailed public letter lays out how the organizations together violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, which protects people with substance use disorder, when they \u201cforced him to choose between his law license or continued treatment as prescribed as necessary by his treating physician.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department letter detailed the organizations\u2019 \u201cburdensome\u201d actions against the lawyer based on \u201cspeculation and stigma.\u201d They included requiring him to undergo psychological and physical evaluations at his own expense, attend a treatment program and stop using\u00a0buprenorphine, a Food and Drug Administration-approved medication his doctor prescribed to treat opioid use disorder.",
      "The lawyer, referred to in the letter by his initials, D.S., is Derek Scott, whose battle for his law license was chronicled by NBC News in March. Scott confirmed that D.S. referred to him and that he worked closely with Justice Department investigators.",
      "The Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "\"This is a powerful finding by the Department of Justice that applies beyond admission to practice law in Tennessee, since there are similar licensing restrictions in other states and for other professions,\u201d said David Sinkman, a former federal prosecutor, now an attorney with civil rights law firm Kaplan & Grady, who specializes in substance use discrimination cases but did not work with Scott.",
      "The restrictions imposed on people like Scott, the investigation by the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee concluded, \u201cdo not serve the goal of ensuring fitness to practice law\u201d and \u201care in fact counterproductive to ensuring that attorneys are fit to practice and violate the Americans With Disabilities Act.\u201d",
      "Scott, who first passed the bar exam in 2021, said in an interview that he felt \u201cvalidated\u201d by the findings. \u201cI felt like they had put up an obstacle that they knew I couldn\u2019t overcome,\u201d he said.",
      "The requirements were dropped in December 2023, after the Justice Department and NBC News began investigating his case. He was sworn into the Tennessee bar in January and now works as a lawyer, primarily in criminal defense, while he continues to take his medication.",
      "\u201cIt makes me feel good that if there are other people out there, they can see this,\u201d he said. \u201cI wished that when I started out, when I first passed the bar exam, there was a case like this I could have pointed to.\u201d",
      "In its letter, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office issued five recommendations for the Tennessee legal organizations to promptly implement to comply with the law. They included not prohibiting or restricting bar applicants and attorneys from taking medication to treat opioid use disorder and ending the practice of inquiring into applicants\u2019 diagnoses of, or treatment for, mental health or substance use disorders.",
      "It also warned of \u201cappropriate action\u201d if the two organizations did not enter into voluntary compliance negotiations. In other cases, the Justice Department has sued entities that did not comply with its recommended reforms.",
      "Both the Tennessee Board of Law Examiners and the Lawyers Assistance Program declined to comment on the findings.",
      "\u2018Burdensome\u2019",
      "Scott always dreamed of being a lawyer, but it seemed out of reach after he began using opioids in the 1990s. Like millions of other people, his dependence on them soon spiraled into addiction.",
      "More than 9 million adults in the U.S. require treatment for opioid use disorder, according to a recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, but only 25% are able to access federally approved medications like methadone and buprenorphine.

      "After having struggled for years, Scott was prescribed buprenorphine in 2011. He now credits it with giving him his life back. He enrolled in college, then law school, interned with a state appellate judge and thought he had finally achieved his dream when he passed the bar exam in 2021.",
      "The discrimination started after Scott disclosed his use of the medication in an interview for his license approval, according to the Justice Department. The Tennessee Lawyers Assistance Program, which helps attorneys with substance use issues, required him to undergo an evaluation at an out-of-state clinic. Scott paid thousands of dollars for the evaluation, which determined that he should submit to state monitoring for five years, attend an inpatient treatment program for at least six months and \"detox\" off of buprenorphine. The cost of the treatment, he was informed, could be as much as $30,000.",
      "Scott was allowed to seek a second opinion from an in-state clinic. But it, too, recommended he stop using his medication. Scott\u2019s longtime doctor \u201cemphatically\u201d disagreed with the recommendations, according to the Justice Department letter and records reviewed by NBC News.",

Jaworski, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, \u201cthey nonetheless disapproved of his use of buprenorphine based on their own, unfounded stereotypes about the medication.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department also found discrimination occurred in a second case when the Tennessee organizations imposed a similar pattern of onerous requirements on another lawyer, identified as C.B., who had undergone addiction treatment more than 10 years before he passed the bar exam.",

      "He was ultimately allowed to get his law license but with strict conditions, including that he submit to random drug testing, provide all records of his mental health treatment and attend a four-day-a-week outpatient drug treatment program. He lost his job after he told his employer about the drug treatment program requirement, according to the Justice Department findings. That was not all he lost.",
      "His therapist refused to send detailed treatment records to the lawyers assistance program and instead asked to send only attendance records. When the program insisted, the therapist resigned from treating him.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 10:48:24 GMT",
    "summary": "When a Saudi Arabian national was accused of ramming a car into a German Christmas market, members of the frequently anti-Muslim European far right said it proved their point.",
    "story": [
      "When a Saudi Arabian national was accused of ramming a car into a German Christmas market, members of the frequently anti-Muslim European far right said it proved their point. The deadly incident in Magdeburg was another example of Islamist terrorism, they said \u2014 and a result of the mass immigration they so vehemently oppose.",
      "Except it wasn\u2019t that simple.",
      "The suspect, Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, 50, was in fact scathingly critical of Islam and immigration, according to his past posts on X. He aligned himself with the far-right, anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is endorsed by Musk and monitored by German intelligence agencies for suspected extremism. While authorities say the motive is not yet clear, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the suspect \u201cwas obviously Islamophobic.\u201d",
      "Al-Abdulmohsen\u2019s complex worldview, in which he criticized the Saudi Arabian government but also Germany\u2019s alleged failure to protect Saudi immigrants from the Middle Eastern kingdom\u2019s repression, has muddied attempts to use his alleged killing of five people and injuring 200 others as an anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim cautionary tale. It comes at a time when immigration is the most polarizing issue in Europe, where far-right parties are surging on a wave of discontent, and immigrants are blamed for job scarcity, housing shortages and cultural changes.",
      "There has been \u201czero\u201d contrition from those on the right who sought to capitalize on the incident, said Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group focused on radical ideologies.",
      "Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, who has backed far-right figures in Europe, wrote on X that the \u201clegacy media lies again\u201d when news outlets, including NBC News, reported that officials described the suspect as Islamophobic.",
      "Other figures who were quick to interpret the attack have since kept quiet.",
      "\u201cThey despise our values,\u201d Dutch anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders posted Friday on X. \u201cThis is our land, our freedom, our life. And we\u2019ll defend it and never surrender.\u201d",
      "However, it later emerged that the suspect was a fan of Wilders, having previously called him \u201ca true hero\u201d on X. Wilders has not posted about it since, as of 7 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, meanwhile, did continue to comment but instead focused on the suspect\u2019s immigrant background rather than his political and religious beliefs. On Monday night during a rally in Magdeburg\u2019s cathedral square she called for change \u201cso we can finally live once again in security,\u201d Reuters reported.\u00a0 Members of the crowd shouted \u201cdeport them\u201d punctuated her speech.",
      "Al-Abdulmohsen entered Germany in 2006 \u2014 almost a decade before then-Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s \u201copen-door policy\u201d that saw 1 million asylum-seekers enter the country and, critics say, foment much of the political disquiet experienced today.",
      "\u201cWhen everyone, including myself, thought this was an Islamic State attack, these accounts were all posting Islamophobic stuff, then a couple of hours later, when it turned out this guy is Islamophobic himself, these right-wing social media feeds seamlessly switched to migration,\u201d Schindler said.",
      "Other organizations the suspect previously interacted with are now trying to distance themselves.",
      "An ultra-conservative American blog called the RAIR Foundation USA interviewed al-Abdulmohsen just eight days beforehand, profiling him as a former Muslim whistleblower \u201cexposing\u201d Germany\u2019s attempts to \u201cIslamize the West.\u201d",
      "After the attack, the foundation updated its interview page.",
      "\u201cIf these reports are accurate, it appears we and other media outlets \u2026 were misled regarding his true intentions,\u201d it stated.",
      "Meanwhile, far-right X account Radio Genoa shared a video of his arrest and described him as an \u201cArab Islamic terrorist.\u201d This, despite some commenters noting that al-Abdulmohsen himself had regularly reposted Radio Genoa\u2019s own racially charged criticisms of Islam and immigration.",
      "Musk\u2019s comment deriding the media\u2019s reporting of the suspect\u2019s past and beliefs came just hours after the South African-born billionaire doubled down on his support for the AfD party. This support comes amid a series of other positive comments from Musk boosting parties on the populist and nationalist right, having successfully backed President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s win in the United States last month.",
      "It\u2019s not only this that\u2019s alarming more mainstream European officials, but also what they see as a lack of regulation on Musk\u2019s X platform, which the suspect allegedly used to issue threats ahead of Friday.",
      "These kinds of \u201cweirdo, individual, radical, conspiratorial worldviews\u201d are \u201ca phenomenon that has been rising steadily since the coronavirus, since we all moved our lives online and on social media,\u201d Schindler said.",
      "He said this does not absolve German authorities, who were given an unspecified warning about al-Abdulmohsen last year. Musk posted that he \u201cshould never have been allowed to enter Germany\u201d and \u201cshould have been extradited.\u201d",
      "NBC News emailed X requesting comment about the criticism of Musk\u2019s remarks, as well as accusations that X failed to act on violent posts from the suspect, but the company did not respond.",
      "The competing narratives over al-Abdulmohsen\u2019s acts and beliefs look set to continue this week, with the AfD holding a memorial service for the victims, which some critics have derided as insensitive political opportunism.",
      "\u201cA bloody act like the one that occurred yesterday in #Magdeburg must never be repeated!\u201d the local AfD X account posted. \u201cLet us ensure that Magdeburg and Saxony-Anhalt become a place of carefree coexistence again.\u201d"

      "Hong Kong has struggled to attract tourists in their previous numbers after three years of pandemic border restrictions and a crackdown on dissent following 2019 antigovernment protests tarnished the city\u2019s international image.",
      "Hong Kong currently has six pandas. Its reigning pair, Ying Ying and Le Le, had twins in August, when Ying Ying become the world\u2019s oldest first-time panda mother after years of failed breeding efforts. The cubs could make their public debut in February.",

      "That is partly because tourism, a pillar of the Hong Kong economy, has failed to rebound.",
      "From January through October of this year, the city received almost 37 million visitors, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, an increase of 37% compared with the same period last year.

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated his pledge to \"vigorously pursue\" the death penalty, taking aim at President Joe Biden's decision to commute the sentences of nearly all federal death row prisoners.",
      "Trump also added to the backlash by some against Biden's unprecedented move, which has stirred up both criticism and praise.",
      "\"Makes no sense,\" Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social. \"Relatives and friends are further devastated. They can't believe this is happening!\"",
      "\"As soon as I am inaugurated, I will direct the Justice Department to vigorously pursue the death penalty to protect American families and children from violent rapists, murderers, and monsters,\" he continued. \"We will be a Nation of Law and Order again!\"",
      "Biden announced on Monday that he will commute the sentences of 37 of the 40 federal inmates on death row to life sentences without the possibility of parole, saying he was \"guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender.\"",
      "The action had been speculated for weeks as a broad coalition of criminal justice advocacy groups, former prosecutors and business leaders wrote letters to the White House asking for him to commute the sentences ahead of Trump's taking office. Pope Francis this month also appealed to Biden, a Catholic, to commute the sentences; Biden is scheduled to meet with the pontiff next month in the last days of his presidency.",
      "In a statement Monday, the president noted that the commutations are consistent with a moratorium on executions imposed by his administration after he took office, and that \"in good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.\"",
      "But Biden also made a point to decline the commutation of sentences of three federal death row inmates involved in mass killings: Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 people in the\u00a0Tree of Life Synagogue\u00a0shooting in Pittsburgh in 2018; Dylann Roof, who gunned down nine people at a\u00a0historically Black church\u00a0in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015; and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who\u00a0carried out a bombing attack at the Boston Marathon\u00a0in 2013.",
      "Despite sparing the lives of the other 37 inmates, Biden added: \"Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss.\"",
      "Trump campaigned on expanding the federal death penalty following his first term, during which his Justice Department put 13 federal inmates to death \u2014 a high that had not been seen since Grover Cleveland's presidency in the late 1800s.",
      "Trump has since said he would like to expand capital punishment to include child rapists,\u00a0migrants who kill U.S. citizens\u00a0and law enforcement officers, and those convicted of drug and human trafficking. It's unclear how the president-elect would do so, and legal experts argue it would require congressional support and face immense constitutional challenges.",
      "Still, anti-death penalty advocates have said, they are taking Trump's statements seriously.",
      "Biden, meanwhile, is contending with criticism for his death row commutations, not only from his political adversaries but law enforcement groups and some families of victims.",
      "\"We thought the timing was despicable,\" Tim Timmerman, whose 19-year-old daughter, Rachel, was killed in 1997, told NBC affiliate WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids, Michigan.",
      "His daughter's convicted killer, Marvin Gabrion, is also accused of murdering Rachel Timmerman's infant daughter, whose body was never found, and is the prime suspect in three other deaths. Gabrion is now 71.",
      "\"Where's the justice in just giving him a prison bed to die comfortably in?\u201d Timmerman said, adding, \"It wasn't me that gave Gabrion the death penalty. It was the jury, and I always think it's important to point that out \u2014 that the jury are the people who sentenced Gabrion to the death penalty.\"",
      "The daughter of Donna Major, one of two South Carolina bank employees killed by federal death row inmate Brandon Council in 2017, slammed Council's commutation as being unfair and an \"abuse of power.\"",
      "\"My mom's murder is being used as a political game piece by a president who isn't even fit for office,\" Heather Turner posted Tuesday on Facebook. \"I stand by my stance that Joe Biden has blood on his hands.\"",
      "While Biden is being lauded by anti-death penalty groups who have long maintained that the death penalty process is tainted, in part, because of racial disparities\u00a0among who is sentenced to death and executed,\u00a0some also believe he did not go far enough by failing to commute all federal death row inmates as well as the four inmates on U.S. military death row.",
      "The Rev. Sharon Risher, the board chair of Death Penalty Action whose mother, Ethel Lance, and cousins, Tywanza Sanders and Susie Jackson, were among those killed in the 2015 Charleston shooting, said in a statement that \"politics has gotten in the way of mercy.\"",
      "\"You can't rank victims, Mr. President. I am begging you to finish the job, not only with the three men left on federal death row, but also with those on the military death row,\" Risher said. \"There's still time.\""

      "\u201cI\u2019m actually very optimistic,\u201d\u00a0Bezos said\u00a0of a second Trump presidency in a Dec. 4 interview at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook conference. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful. He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. And my point of view, if I can help him do that, I\u2019m going to help him. Because we do have too much regulation in this country.\u201d",
      "The comments came in the wake of a scandal at The Washington Post in October, when the paper reported that\u00a0Bezos decided\u00a0not to publish its editorial board\u2019s endorsement of Vice President\u00a0Kamala Harris\u00a0over Trump. Bezos in an\u00a0op-ed\u00a0defended the paper\u2019s decision to no longer endorse presidential candidates, but the reversal spurred an exodus of subscribers and prompted numerous staffers to resign in protest.",
      "Nowhere is Trump\u2019s newfound friendliness with the tech world more pronounced than in his blossoming relationship with Tesla and SpaceX CEO\u00a0Elon Musk, who spent more than $250 million helping elect Trump.",
      "Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, has frequently appeared by Trump\u2019s side before and after his election victory, and has reportedly been involved in all aspects of Trump\u2019s transition planning. He and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy have been tapped to lead an advisory group tasked with cutting government costs.",
      "This could put OpenAI\u2019s Altman, who is currently\u00a0embroiled\u00a0in a\u00a0breach-of-contract lawsuit\u00a0brought by Musk, in an awkward position.",
      "Along with his million-dollar inaugural donation, Altman heaped praise on Trump earlier this month. \u201cPresident Trump will lead our country into the age of AI, and I am eager to support his efforts to ensure America stays ahead,\u201d he said.",
      "Craig Holman, government affairs lobbyist for the progressive nonprofit Public Citizen, told CNBC that these figures \u201cvery much fear that Donald Trump may take retribution against them.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019re throwing money\u201d at his feet \u201cin order to curry favor,\u201d Holman said.'",
      "'Cesspool'",
      "Four days after the presidential election, Trump announced the formation of the \u201cTrump Vance Inaugural Committee, Inc.,\u201d a 501(c)(4) nonprofit. It is co-chaired by real estate investor Steve Witkoff and former Republican Sen.\u00a0Kelly Loeffler\u00a0of Georgia, who is also Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Small Business Administration.",
      "Reince Priebus, who was one of Trump\u2019s White House chiefs of staff during his first term, said in an\u00a0X post\u00a0that he has been tapped to serve as the\u00a0committee\u2019s finance chair.",
      "Priebus also shared a screenshot of an invitation that listed the names of other finance chairs. They include Miriam Adelson, the GOP megadonor who spent\u00a0$100 million this year\u00a0on a pro-Trump super PAC, and billionaire Trump donor\u00a0Diane Hendricks.",
      "Inaugural committees are required to publicly disclose the names of donors who give $200 or more, but those filings aren\u2019t due until 90 days after the inaugural ceremony.",
      "If the committee has a surplus after all the festivities, finding out just how much is left can be a challenge.",
      "Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration was a smaller affair than Obama\u2019s in 2009, although Trump raised more than twice as much money for his as Obama had. As a result, Trump\u2019s committee was widely expected to have tens of millions of dollars left over after it paid for balls and hotels.",
      "But years after the fact, it was\u00a0unclear what happened\u00a0to much of that money.",
      "Federal filings show that roughly a quarter of all the funds raised, $26 million, were paid to a\u00a0newly created firm\u00a0that was run by an advisor to first lady Melania Trump.",
      "\u201cWe take a look through the history of the financing of inaugurations, and clearly it comes from very large donors, wealthy special interests and corporations, almost all of whom have business pending before the federal government,\u201d said Holman, of Public Citizen.",

    "summary": "Morning in America could, someday soon, be earlier than ever imagined.",
    "story": [
      "Morning in America could, someday soon, be earlier than ever imagined.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump vowed to end daylight saving time, a surprising pledge that, if carried through, would dramatically alter U.S. life in spring and summer months, when Americans revel in sunshine well into traditional nighttime hours.",
      "Daylight saving time tends to push sunshine to later hours, making for gloriously long, bright days in spring and summer months. Standard time brings more sunshine to earlier hours, insuring that children are not trudging to school in cold-weather darkness.",
      "Trump\u2019s proposed sunset of daylight saving time, a practice long believed to be supported by U.S. business interests, stunned the medical community that\u2019s been pushing for years to make standard time full time. Opponents of daylight saving say it can pose a risk of  mood disorders, adverse cardiovascular events and car crashes.",
      "University of California San Francisco neurologist and sleep expert Dr. Kin Yuen said she and her peer group of standard time backers still are not entirely confident in Trump\u2019s pledge even though the president-elect's Truth Social post clearly spelled out his desire to end daylight saving time.",
      "\"I think we were all rather incredulous,\" Yuen told NBC News this week, days after Trump's post. \"So yeah, we're elated. We're catching this wave that'll hopefully get more attention and point out the health benefits of adopting permanent standard time.\"",
      "The manner in which Americans adjust their clocks twice a year is outlined in the Uniform Time Act of 1966, which set parameters for daylight saving time.",
      "America most recently fell back into standard time on Nov. 7 this year.",
      "During standard time in fall and winter months, Americans enjoy about 9 to 11 hours of sunshine a day, generally starting between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.",
      "The nation springs forward to daylight saving next on March 9, 2025, ushering in spring and summer with 11 to 15 hours of daily sunshine that can often start between 5:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m.",
      "\"There is a momentum to not have to change the clocks anymore,\" said Dr. Nathaniel Watson, a long-time advocate of permanent standard time and neurologist at the University of Washington Medicine Sleep Center.",
      "\"But there's this conflation of, 'Let's not change clocks and the only way to do that is go to permanent daylight savings time,' which is just not the case. It should just be standard time.\"",
      "If America were to stay with standard time year-round, then sunshine during warm-weather months would hit bedroom curtains at unaccustomed early hours, perhaps between 4:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m.",
      "And on the back end of summer days, the sun would set at earlier hours under standard time.",
      "During summer months, baseball games that start at 7 p.m. can often absorb several innings of sunshine and twilight under daylight saving time. But those same summer-night games, if played in standard time, might only yield an inning or two of fading sunshine before stadium lights take full effect.",
      "The American Academy of Sleep Medicine formally endorsed year-round standard time in 2020 and the American Academy of Neurology\u00a0joined on to that position in 2023.",
      "The human body functions well for 16 waking hours a day with activities best planned around \"solar noon\" \u2014 when the sun is at its highest point in the sky, doctors backing universal standard time have said.",
      "For most of standard time months, solar noon comes close to 12 p.m. on the wall clock. But during daylight saving months, that midpoint usually comes after 1 p.m.",
      "And employees and students who have a 9-to-5 schedule will now get up an hour earlier than their bodies would want to in relation to solar noon.",
      "\"So you are forcing your body to get up at a time much earlier. You're basically tricking your body into saying, 'Get up an hour earlier for work and school,' which is why a lot of people hate mornings,\" said Dr. Karin Johnson, a neurologist and sleep expert at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts.",
      "\"So if you were on daylight savings time [year-round], it would  makes us hate those mornings even more.\"",
      "For anyone concerned about the sun peeking through window shades just a few hours after stumbling home from their local bar, Johnson said that inconvenience is a small price to pay to be in better sync with circadian rhythm.",
      "\"Do we need 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. sunrises? No, none of us would like that,\" she said. \"But you can put your face down and sleep through that. What we do need is for the sun to be in alignment with our bodies [under standard time].\"",
      "Trump's announcement was also surprising because it appears to conflict with popular sentiment and leaders of his own party.",
      "The Senate two years ago overwhelmingly passed legislation to make daylight saving year-round, though the bill stalled out from there.",
      "Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Trump's pick to lead the State Department, was one of the bill's sponsors and has been a vocal supporter of daylight saving time.",
      "The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHF), which is funded by insurance companies,\u00a0has long advocated for year-round daylight saving time.",
      "The group has said lives are saved when there's better visibility in after-work and early-evening driving hours.",
      "\"We know there\u2019s a strong relationship between increased darkness and fatal crashes, especially when it comes to pedestrian and bicyclists,\" IIHF spokesperson  Joseph Young said in a statement this week.",
      "\"Leaving daylight saving time behind would result in earlier sunsets during the summer months, which would very likely result in more fatalities involving these road users.\"",
      "Should America ever flip the switch to turn off daylight saving time,  widespread infrastructure upgrades would be necessary, according to the IIHF.",
      "\"If we do see daylight saving time come to an end, communities will need to think even harder about how to improve safety for those on foot,\" Young said. \"Better lighting and infrastructure, lower vehicle speeds, and other changes that are already badly needed will become even more crucial.\"",
      "Some business interests have also advocated for daylight saving time, believing it could lead to more after-work commerce if it's not too dark.",
      "A representative for Rubio could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday, and a spokesperson for the National Retail Federation said her group has no formal position on daylight saving time.",
      "What little polling on daylight saving versus standard time has been conducted over the years seems to slightly favor daylight saving.",
      "YouGov posed the question in March 2023 and 50% of respondents said they would support permanent daylight saving time, while only 31% said they'd want year-round standard time.",
      "\"The marketing department of daylight savings time, which of course is highly connected with industries, did a much better job than we have,\" said Yuen, of UCSF.",
      "\"We naturally have more sunlight [in daylight saving months]. Whether we had daylight saving time or not, we just have longer days. And I think that we need to do a better marketing job the other way around and remind people of sitting in the dark at school in winter.\"",
      "The U.S. briefly adopted year-round\u00a0daylight saving in 1974-75, in hopes of pushing more daylight into later hours and cutting energy use during the OPEC oil embargo. But using daylight saving time in winter was wildly unpopular, with children hiking to school in darkness, and it was quickly ended.",
      "Johnson said she\u2019s convinced poll respondents who oppose permanent standard time are conflating daylight saving with the good times of spring break and summer vacations \u2014 and forgetting about the rejection of year-round daylight saving time in 1974.",
      "\"There are huge (emotional) connections between summer and daylight savings time,\" Johnson said. \"And yes, we like it when it's warm and the days are longer. But we've tried permanent daylight savings before, the last in 1974, and it didn't work.\"",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., invoked the bad memories of 1974 and said he\u2019d be willing to help Trump push for year-round standard time.",
      "\"Congress once made Daylight Saving Time permanent. It was so unpopular that Congress repealed it less than a year later,\" he said in a statement. \"The only sensible and durable way to stop the biannual time change is to make Standard Time permanent.\"",
      "The biggest response in that 2003 YouGov poll appeared to come from people who don't want to change their clocks in either direction, as 62% respondents said they simply wanted the elimination of either standard or daylight saving time, while 31% said they were OK with the status quo of both."

      "Either way, the U.S. has not had an official bird in the almost 250 years since its founding.",
      "Minnesota resident Preston Cook has long hoped that the eagle would ascend into the U.S. code, even writing a draft a bill and sending it to lawmakers.",
      "Cook described himself as having a lifelong obsession with the bald eagle, and took it upon himself to push for a change when discovering that there was no official U.S. bird. He wrote a simple piece of legislation that would change the code to say that, \u201cThe bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is the national bird.\u201d",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., then led a bipartisan group who brought it to the Senate floor in July. It passed unanimously before sailing through the House last week with no opposition.",
      "Cook told NBC News earlier this month that this is one overlooked piece of history he felt compelled to fix.",

It also accuses Abel of defamation, according to a copy of the suit.",
      "Jones\u2019 suit, which was first reported by The New York Times, comes days after a separate complaint filed by Lively with the California Civil Rights Department against some of the same defendants, alleging Baldoni sexually harassed her on set and then engaged in a retaliatory campaign facilitated by Abel and crisis communications representative Melissa Nathan. Nathan is also named as a defendant in Jones\u2019 complaint, along with Baldoni and his company, Wayfarer Studios.",
      "Lively\u2019s allegations have sent shock waves across the industry. Her complaint has also put the role that crisis PR firms play in the spotlight, with many online reexamining some of the negative headlines surrounding Lively during the promotional tour for \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "Jones represented Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios from 2017 to August of this year. Abel worked for Jonesworks from 2020 to August. Several of Abel\u2019s text messages and emails, which the suit said were obtained via a subpoena of Jonesworks, were cited heavily in Lively\u2019s complaint.",
      "The film \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of the popular Colleen Hoover novel, was released in theaters in August. Lively portrays heroine Lily Bloom, while Baldoni plays her abusive romantic partner, Ryle Kincaid. Baldoni also adapted and directed the project.",

      "\u201cBehind Jones\u2019s back, they secretly coordinated with Baldoni and Wayfarer to implement an aggressive media smear campaign against Baldoni\u2019s film co-star, and then used the crisis as an opportunity to drive a wedge between Jones and Baldoni, and to publicly pin blame for this smear campaign on Jones \u2014 when Jones had no knowledge or involvement in it,\u201d the lawsuit states.",

Freedman also referred to Lively\u2019s claims as \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "In her suit, Jones cited some text messages she said she obtained from Abel\u2019s work phone after terminating Abel in August. Some of the texts Jones included in her own suit were previously unpublished, including one allegedly sent by Abel that called Baldoni \u201cunlikeable and unrealistic as a leading man.\u201d",

      "In the wake of on-set demands from Lively asking Baldoni and Wayfarer CEO Jamey Heath to stop certain behaviors, including entering her trailer while she was in a state of undress and adding unscripted sexual scenes into the film, Jones alleged that she had originally planned to counter the emerging media narrative around tensions between the stars with \u201ca positive press strategy.\u201d",

These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloan with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",

      "The film \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d an adaptation of the popular Colleen Hoover novel, was released in theaters in August. Lively portrays heroine Lily Bloom, while Baldoni plays her abusive romantic partner, Ryle Kincaid. Baldoni also adapted and directed the project.",
      "According to Jones\u2019 suit, in August Baldoni \u201cbegan to fear that the increased attention being paid to him and the Film would cause reports of allegations about his on-set misbehavior to come out.\u201d Nathan and Abel subsequently began \u201cto formulate a no-holds-barred strategy to discredit and suppress any potential revelations about Baldoni\u2019s on-set behavior\u201d without Jones\u2019 knowledge or approval, the suit alleges.",
      "\u201cBehind Jones\u2019s back, they secretly coordinated with Baldoni and Wayfarer to implement an aggressive media smear campaign against Baldoni\u2019s film co-star, and then used the crisis as an opportunity to drive a wedge between Jones and Baldoni, and to publicly pin blame for this smear campaign on Jones \u2014 when Jones had no knowledge or involvement in it,\u201d the lawsuit states.",
      "Abel and Nathan \u201cleveraged their teams to create and perpetuate negative content about Lively on social media platforms such as Reddit and TikTok,\u201d according to the suit.",
      "\u201cAt the same time as Abel and Nathan were working to protect Baldoni from negative press attention, they were actively working their media contacts to plant negative stories about Jones and Jonesworks,\u201d Jones\u2019 suit states. They used \u201cmore than a dozen fake social media accounts and dark web accounts that defamed Jones and Jonesworks.\u201d",
      "Bryan Freedman, a lawyer representing Baldoni, Wayfarer, Abel and Nathan, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about Jones\u2019 suit on Tuesday.",
      "In a previous response to Lively\u2019s complaint, Freedman wrote that Nathan\u2019s company, The Agency Group PR, \u201coperated as any crisis management firm would when hired by a client experiencing threats by two extremely powerful people with unlimited resources,\u201d referring to Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds. Freedman also referred to Lively\u2019s claims as \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "In her suit, Jones cited some text messages she said she obtained from Abel\u2019s work phone after terminating Abel in August. Some of the texts Jones included in her own suit were previously unpublished, including one allegedly sent by Abel that called Baldoni \u201cunlikeable and unrealistic as a leading man.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t stand him. He\u2019s so pompous. A men\u2019s retreat during release, is he crazy?!\u201d one of the texts from Abel\u2019s phone said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t need a retreat. He needs to be humbled.\u201d",
      "In the wake of on-set demands from Lively asking Baldoni and Wayfarer CEO Jamey Heath to stop\u00a0certain behaviors, including entering her trailer while she was in a state of undress and adding unscripted sexual scenes into the film, Jones alleged that she had originally planned to counter the emerging media narrative around tensions between the stars with \u201ca positive press strategy.\u201d",
      "Instead, Jones alleges that Abel and Nathan implemented \u201can aggressive media smear campaign\u201d against her and Lively at the same time on behalf of Baldoni and Wayfarer, amid their own plans to establish a competing PR business.",
      "Jones\u2019 \u201clawsuit seeks to finally put a stop to their continued misconduct and to compensate Jones and Jonesworks for the damage Defendants\u2019 conduct and scheme has inflicted,\u201d it states. She is requesting a jury trial.",
      "In the days since Lively\u2019s complaint was filed, many in Hollywood \u2014 including the actors\u2019 union SAG-AFTRA and Sony Pictures Entertainment, the studio behind \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d \u2014 have\u00a0issued their support for Lively.",
      "Baldoni was dropped by his talent agency WME. He has not publicly addressed Lively\u2019s complaint or Jones\u2019 lawsuit.",

      "\"Home Alone\" director Chris Columbus nearly helmed another iconic Christmas movie, but he said that a \"surreal\" pair of meetings with star Chevy Chase made him quit the film.",
      "Columbus, 66, shared in an interview with Vanity Fair that he had originally signed on to direct \"Christmas Vacation,\" but he and Chase ended up getting along about as well as Clark Griswold and Uncle Lewis.",
      "\"I was signed on \u2026 and\u00a0then\u00a0I met Chevy Chase,\" Columbus said. \"Even given my situation at the time, where I desperately needed to make a film, I realized I couldn\u2019t work with the guy.",
      "\u201cTale as old as time!\u201d he continued. \u201cI was one of the many who couldn\u2019t work with him. And I called John and I said, \u2018This is really hard for me, but I can\u2019t do this movie with Chevy Chase.\u2019\u201d",
      "TODAY.com reached out to Chase for comment but did not immediately hear back.",
      "Columbus said he and legendary producer John Hughes had the same agent, which resulted in Columbus being sent the script for \"Christmas Vacation.\"",
      "The director had begun shooting exterior shots in Chicago for the 1989 movie when he had meetings with Chase that derailed his participation.",
      "\"My first meeting with him, I sat down with him,\" Columbus said. \"It was just the two of us. He\u00a0had\u00a0to know I was directing the movie. I talked about how I saw the movie, how I wanted to make the movie. He didn\u2019t say anything. I went through about a half hour of talking. He didn\u2019t say\u00a0a word.\u00a0And then he stops and he says\u2014and this makes no sense to any human being on the planet, but I\u2019m telling you. I probably have\u00a0never\u00a0told this story.",
      "\"Forty minutes into the meeting, he says, 'Wait a second. You\u2019re the director?' And I said, 'Yeah\u2026I\u2019m directing the film.' And he said to me the most surreal, bizarre thing. I still haven\u2019t been able to make any sense out of it. He said, 'Oh, I thought you were a drummer.' I said, 'Uhh, okay. Let\u2019s start talking about the film again.' After about 30 seconds, he said, 'I got to go.'\"",
      "Columbus said Chase met with Hughes, and they set up a second meeting at dinner with Hughes in attendance.",
      "\"I was basically nonexistent,\" Columbus said. \"It was Chevy and Hughes, and they talked about everything except 'Christmas Vacation.' We spent two hours together, and I left the dinner and I thought, 'There\u2019s no way I can make a movie with this guy. First of all, he\u2019s not engaged. He\u2019s treating me like s---. I don\u2019t need this. I\u2019d rather not work again. I\u2019d rather write.'\"",
      "The interaction has left Columbus puzzled nearly 40 years later.",
      "\"I guess that sense of humor was funny in the early \u201970s,\" he said. \"It\u2019s so surreal \u2026 Who says anything like that to anybody? It makes no sense. So to tell that story almost makes no sense, but it actually happened. I thought, 'This was how we\u2019re going to work together? I\u2019m going to be on set and he\u2019s not listening.'",
      "\"I called John and said, 'I can\u2019t do this,'\" he continued. \"'John, I need this job desperately, but I know I will not make a good movie with this guy and I will let you down.' And he said, 'I understand. Completely understand.'\"",
      "Jeremiah S. Chechik ended up directing \"Christmas Vacation,\" which was the third edition of the \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" series, all of them starring Chase.",
      "However, leaving \"Christmas Vacation\" led Columbus right to another holiday classic.",
      "\"The next weekend, I got\u00a0another\u00a0script from John\u2014and it\u2019s\u00a0'Home Alone,'\" he said. \"'Home Alone,' for me, was even more personal, a better script. And I thought, I can really do something with this, and I don\u2019t have to deal with Chevy Chase. That was it.\"",
      "Columbus went on to direct \"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,\" \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" and a pair of \"Harry Potter\" blockbuster movies. He is a producer on the upcoming vampire film \"Nosferatu,\" a remake of the 1922 silent classic of the same name."

      "How Marc Chalamet and Nicole Flender met",
      "The couple haven\u2019t publicly shared their love story or even details about their wedding, but their son once offered up a hint at how his parents came into each other\u2019s lives.",
      "When promoting his work in Wes Anderson\u2019s 2021 dramedy, \u201cThe French Dispatch,\u201d to RSNG.com, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet compared the movie's plot to his parents\u2019 early days together.",
      "\u201cI loved \u2018The French Dispatch\u2019 because it really reminded me of my father\u2019s heritage and how he met my mother,\u201d he said of the film that revolves around the final days of a French news bureau. \u201cMy father was on a business trip to New York while he was working as a journalist for Le Parisien, the French newspaper. Now, he works at the United Nations. My mother was a dancer when she met my father, and now she\u2019s working in real estate.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just like the movie, but he added, \u201cYou could see the parallels.\u201d",
      "They have another child in showbiz",
      "A star was born to Chalamet and Flender on Dec. 27, 1995 when they welcomed Timoth\u00e9e to the world, but he isn\u2019t the only famous face in the family.",
      "He has a sister named Pauline Chalamet, who\u2019s three years older than him and a star in her own right.",
      "Pauline\u2019s credits include the 2020 Judd Apatow film \u201cThe King of Staten Island\u201d and the Mindy Kaling-created Max series \u201cThe Sex Lives of College Girls.\u201d",
      "They didn\u2019t name their son \u2018Tim-oh-thee\u2019",
      "While \u201cTimoth\u00e9e\u201d doesn\u2019t look like a typical Hollywood name, it certainly sounds like one when people pronounce it the same way they would \u201cTimothy.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s just one problem: That isn\u2019t how it is meant to be said.",
      "Like his father, the actor\u2019s name is French.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s \u2018Tim-oh-tay,\u2019\u201d Chalamet explained during a visit to \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d \u201cBut I would not oblige you to say it like that. It can be Timothy or Timmy or Doug or Alan. My parents cursed me with that.\u201d",
      "Mom 'planted seeds' for her kids\u2019 careers",
      "Flender attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, better known as the school that inspired the film and television series \u201cFame, and both of her children followed in her footsteps at the acclaimed institution.",
      "But school was just one way she hoped to lead them to their callings.",
      "\u201cI took them to see many different plays and musicals when they were growing up, and I think seeing certain performances influenced them,\u201d she told The Guardian. \u201cThe productions they\u2019ve seen, and even growing up in New York, has informed who they are today.\u201d",
      "Although she told the publication she \u201cplanted seeds, and our lifestyle really inspired those interests,\u201d she added that her kids \u201calways had control of their careers.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was encouraging, you know, but I wasn\u2019t like \u2018you better get this job,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "His parents\u2019 favorite role",
      "He\u2019s played the chosen one of Arrakis, the swoon-worthy boy-next-door and one of pop culture\u2019s greatest performers, but when it comes to the part his parents are most proud of, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet points to his work in the 2023 musical \u201cWonka.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is my mom and dad\u2019s favorite project I\u2019ve ever been in,\u201d he told USA Today. \u201cThey\u2019re thrilled. Ten years ago, this is what I thought I\u2019d be in, tone-wise. My mom has been encouraging me to do a play for the last 10, 12 years. And my dad, too, he goes, \u2018Wow. There\u2019s a smile on your face, finally.\u2019\u201d",

      "His mom is his red carpet plus-one",
      "From the Golden Globes to the Oscars, and at several awards season stops in between, Timoth\u00e9e has been seen alongside one reliable red carpet date again and again: his mother.",
      "\u201cI love being with my son,\u201d Flender noted in an interview with The Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s as if we\u2019re going to a party and he\u2019s introducing me to some of his friends, his colleagues. Timmy is very personable.\u201d"

In the complaint, Lively accuses Baldoni of sexual harassment and partaking in a smear campaign with intention to harm her reputation.",
      "In a statement provided exclusively to TODAY.com, Slate said she stands by her \u201cloyal friend\u201d and \u201ctrusted source of emotional support.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs Blake Lively\u2019s castmate and friend, I voice my support as she takes action against those reported to have planned and carried out an attack on her reputation,\u201d Slate said. \u201cBlake is a leader, loyal friend and a trusted source of emotional support for me and so many who know and love her.\u201d",
      "She continued: \u201cWhat has been revealed about the attack on Blake is terribly dark, disturbing, and wholly threatening. I commend my friend, I admire her bravery, and I stand by her side.\u201d",

      "In the complaint filed Dec. 20, Lively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment while filming \u201cIt Ends with Us.\u201d She also said Baldoni retaliated and participated in a PR campaign to ruin her reputation ahead of the film\u2019s Aug. 9 release. Lively was the focus of a swell of criticism on social media around the time \u201cIt Ends with Us\u201d released.",
      "Also named in the complaint is Jamey Heath, the lead producer on \u201cIt Ends with Us\u201d and the CEO of the film\u2019s production company, Wayfarer Studios, which was co-founded by Baldoni.

They are accused by Lively of envisioning and executing the PR campaign.",
      "\u201cI hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted,\u201d Lively said in a Dec. 21 statement to TODAY.com.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and all its representatives, said in a statement to TODAY.com on Dec. 21 that Lively\u2019s allegations are \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious\u201d and \u201cyet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation.\u201d",
      "Freedman also issued a statement on behalf of The Agency Group, saying in part: \u201cThe standard scenario planning TAG PR drafted proved unnecessary as audiences found Lively\u2019s own actions, interviews and marketing during the promotional tour distasteful, and responded organically to that which the media themselves picked up on.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Abel for comment.",
      "\u201cIt Ends with Us,\u201d based on Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 book of the same name, follows a woman named Lily (Lively), who finds that her relationship with husband Ryle (Baldoni) is repeating a cycle of domestic abuse that she witnessed with her own parents.",

      "The book and film have both been enveloped in controversy after some said the plot romanticized domestic abuse. Also, ahead of the film\u2019s release, fans started to speculate about possible tension between Lively and Baldoni when they didn\u2019t appear together to promote the movie."

    "summary": "Netflix\u2019s new film, \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d starring Ryan Destiny, is based on the story of professional boxer Claressa Shields. Here's what to know about the true story.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon MGM Studios' new film, \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d starring Ryan Destiny, tells the story of professional boxer Claressa Shields and how she overcame all odds to be one of the greatest female boxers alive.",
      "Though Shields accomplished much in her life, including becoming the \"first American boxer (male or female) ever to win gold in back-to-back Olympic Games,\" her road to victory was anything but easy.",
      "She grew up in poverty in Flint, Michigan to a mother who battled alcoholism and a father who was in jail during the early years of her life. At age 11, Shields started boxing with the help of her coach Jason Crutchfield, played by Brian Tyree Henry in the film, and that helped her deal with a lot of anger she had while growing up.",
      "\"I was molested and raped. But I channeled all the anger from that into boxing, and I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m so successful at it,\" she told ESPN of her childhood. \"Boxing really helped with that. It calmed me down a lot and gave me discipline and structure.\"",
      "Thanks to boxing, Shields found a way out of her tumultuous home life and was able to create a name for herself in the sports world.",
      "Scroll below to learn all about Shields and how close the film, \"The Fire Inside,\" is to her real life.",
      "Who is Claressa \u2018T-Rex\u2019 Shields?",
      "Claressa Shields, aka T-Rex, is an American professional boxer from Flint, Michigan. In 2012, Shields headed to the Olympics at 17 years old and became the first American woman to win gold in boxing. Then, four years later at the 2016 Olympics, she did it again when she secured her second gold medal.",
      "Now at age 29, Shields holds the title as being the first American boxer ever to win gold in back-to-back Olympic Games.",
      "Not to mention, she's also a three-time undisputed champ. The only fight that Shields ever lost in her boxing career was against British World Champion Savannah Marshall just months before the 2012 Olympic Games, per the Olympics. However, she avenged herself in 2022 when the two went head-to-head in London for the middleweight champion title.",
      "In an interview with ESPN, Shields explained how she got her nickname \"T-Rex.\" She said she got the moniker as a child when she was \"very skinny\" and had \"short arms.\"",
      "What happened to Claressa Shields after the Olympics?",
      "Shields' life did not change much after she brought home a gold medal in boxing at the 2012 Olympics. That was the same year that women\u2019s boxing became an official Olympic sport.",
      "The self-proclaimed GWOAT (Greatest Woman of All Time) returned home to Flint, Michigan, with no endorsement deals whatsoever.",
      "In the movie, it's said that Shields was still living on her coach's couch after she had just made history at the Olympics.",
      "In an interview with NPR, Shields said that the public wasn't comfortable with her image and she was advised to stop boasting about how she likes to beat people up in her interviews.",
      "\u201cThey had this weird definition of what a strong woman was. For some reason, that definition was pretty, non-sweaty and not as muscular. And one, I\u2019m very pretty. I think I\u2019m fine! I\u2019m gorgeous!\u201d said with a grin.",
      "\u201cBut the fact of it is,\u201d she continued, \u201cwhen [I\u2019m] boxing, I look so strong and I\u2019m punching so hard and I\u2019m punching so fast, and [I] make people feel intimidated. I think that now people are starting to embrace that. The definition of a strong woman is\u00a0Laila Ali.\u00a0Lucia Rijker. Serena Williams. Claressa Shields.\u201d",
      "Shields told Entertainment Weekly that it was hard for her to see other people get brand deals who didn't win gold medals. She explained that it was also difficult to see brands flock to her friends like Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky and then offer her nothing.",
      "\"I felt like my gold medal weighed less than theirs. So to be a 17-year-old going through that and also be in Flint where everybody\u2019s saying, 'They played you, they dissed you, your gold medal didn\u2019t mean anything, you\u2019re not getting what you deserve' \u2014 to hear that for so many years and then go back and do it again was like, 'Oh, man,'\" she said.",
      "How accurate is \u2018The Fire Inside\u2019?",
      "\"The Fire Inside\" is loosely based on Shields' life so all events in the film are not exactly true. For instance, the movie portrays Shields as a fighter who wanted to win gold at the 2012 Olympics. However, in an interview with ESPN, she said she heavily contemplated whether or not she wanted to come in first.",
      "After she lost her fight against Marshall at the 2012 AIBA world championships in China, Shields said she noticed that the dynamic around her started to change from people believing in her to having doubts about her talents. She said they didn't change their tune until she made it all the way to the finals in the 2012 Olympics.",
      "\"I really hated the fake vibes. I felt it from my Olympic teammates, some of the coaches and from people at home also,\" she said.",
      "Shields couldn't help but think about what her life would be like if she took home silver instead of gold.",
      "\"As I was walking to the ring for my final fight at the Olympics, I was telling myself, 'If you get silver, maybe you won\u2019t have so many fakers and doubters and all this weird stuff around that you don\u2019t want. But if you get gold, it\u2019s going to be all of these people that are gonna come into your life. All these new cousins and all this new stuff,\" she said.",
      "\"I had to make a decision on whether or not I wanted to get gold or silver because the power was in my hands,\" Shields continued. \"Then right before I got into the ring, I took a deep breath and I was like, 'You know what? I\u2019m gonna go ahead and get this gold medal, and however my life changes after this, I\u2019m just going to accept it and deal with it the best way I can. There is no way I\u2019m about to miss out on this opportunity because I\u2019m scared of how many fake people will come around.\u201d",
      "Shields added that people still walk up to her to this day and tell her that they lost money betting against her in the finals.",
      "Was Claressa Shields involved in the \u2018The Fire Inside\u2019?",
      "Yes, Shields served as an executive producer in \"The Fire Inside\" and she told Entertainment Weekly that she had \"a lot of input\" in how the film was made.",
      "\"Before Barry (Jenkins) wrote the script, we met in person and talked for almost five hours. I let him speak first about what he thought my story was, and when he got done talking, I said, 'Well, you had a few key parts, but this is what I want to tell, what I want them to understand about me,\" she said. \"When he wrote his script a few months later and sent it to me, he got it just right.\"",
      "Shields also hailed Destiny's acting in the film and said she did a \"great job\" playing her in \"The Fire Inside.\"",
      "\"I cry every time I watch the movie,\" Shields said.",
      "What is Claressa Shields doing now?",
      "After the 2016 Olympics, Shields went pro and became a five weight world champion. She reminded ESPN of her accolades when it left her off a list of \"trailblazing\" female athletes that aired on the channel.",
      "In response, Shields took to X to share the ESPN graphic along with a picture of herself holding her championship belts.",
      "In the caption, she wrote, \"Wow @espn. Y\u2019all have really lost yall mind!!!!! Do I have to run my resume down to y\u2019all!!! 2x Olympic champ, 3x Undisputed champ, 5 weight world champion, 15x world champ. WOMENS BOXING TRAIL BLAZER.\"",
      "Shields has since gotten involved in the Mixed Martial Arts scene. In 2021, she made her MMA debut in a fight that she won against Brittney Elkin.",
      "When asked why she wanted to do MMA, Shields told Yahoo Sports in 2021 that she felt like she \"never got her just due in boxing.\" At the time, Shields was a 12-time world champion. She is now a 15-time world champ.",
      "\"You think about becoming a 22-time world champion. It's very easy for myself to do, but it was like, 'What would that do for me? Would that make me a bigger star? Would that make me a household name? Or would that make me a millionaire?'\" she said. \"And the truth is no. It wouldn't open up any more doors to me than what has already been opened.\"",
      "\"I would have to keep fighting this war of equal pay and equal opportunity and getting women equal fight time,\" she continued. \"It just got to a place where I was like, you know what, I've been working so hard and boxing for so many years that if I'm going to work hard at something then at least let me reap what I sow.\""

    "story": [
      "There\u2019s one dessert that\u2019s the talk of Tinseltown around the holidays: the so-called \u201cTom Cruise cake.\u201d",
      "The white chocolate coconut Bundt cake from the family-owned Doan\u2019s Bakery in Woodland Hills, California got its nickname because the \u201cMission Impossible\u201d star famously gifts the dessert to his Hollywood friends at the end of every year.",
      "In 2018, Cruise said on \u201cThe Late Late Show with James Corden\u201c that he likes to send cakes to people because he doesn\u2019t consume sugar while training.",
      "So, instead of treating himself during the holidays, he treats his costars and colleagues to the coconut cake with chunks of white chocolate covered in cream cheese frosting and toasted coconut shavings.",
      "Who has received the Tom Cruise cake?",
      "Cruise\u2019s gift list reads like an awards show roll call: Renee Zellweger, Graham Norton, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Henry Cavill, Kirsten Dunst, Cobie Smulders, Jimmy Fallon, Jon Hamm and Angela Bassett are just a small selection of folks who have spoken publicly about receiving the cake.",
      "Brooke Shields famously spoke about being removed from the list for reasons unknown to her, and Tom Hanks said his ideal \u201clast meal\u201d would include the cake.",
      "This year is no different: On Dec. 13, Cruise\u2019s \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d costar Glen Powell shared a photo of the cake on his Instagram story, writing, \u201cThe Cruise Cake has arrived.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rich,\u201d Canal says in the video. \u201cLike Tom Cruise.\u201d",
      "The pastry is so famous, it was immortalized in HBO comedy series \u201cHacks.\u201d\u00a0 In the Season 3 premiere, fictional superstar comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) is lucky enough to be sent one of the cakes, which is immediately clocked by her protege Ava (Hannah Einbinder).",
      "Where does the Tom Cruise cake come from?",
      "The cake was invented by Karen Doan, who established Doan\u2019s Bakery in 1983 by baking desserts for restaurants, coffee houses, caterers and private events. According to the bakery\u2019s website, 25 years ago, Karen, her son Eric and his wife Carrie opened the bakery to the public. Karen died in 2023, and Eric now runs the bakery.",

      "Alexis says that Cruise orders around 300 to 400 cakes from the bakery every year, adding that the bakery doesn\u2019t ship them out, so they\u2019re unaware who in Hollywood is actually receiving them.",
      "How to get the cake for yourself",
      "Doan\u2019s Bakery also sells the dessert through Goldbelly for $129.95 including shipping. Alexis says if you pick it up in person, the cake, which has 12 to 16 servings, costs $59.",
      "The bakery also sells a medium size that serves six to eight people for $39 and an individual portion for $9.",
      "Although there\u2019s a markup on Goldbelly, it\u2019s proven super popular there and is sold out through late-February. The bakery ships out roughly 50 cakes per day, five days a week through the online marketplace.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most loved cakes on our site and we\u2019re thrilled to bring the magic of their white chocolate coconut cake to the world,\u201d Joe Ariel, founder and CEO of Goldbelly, tells TODAY.com. \u201cNow you no longer need to be a celebrity to order or gift someone the famous \u2018Tom Cruise Cake.\u2019\u201d",
      "If you want a celebrity coconut cake and can\u2019t wait until after Valentine\u2019s Day, Ina Garten has a get-it-sooner alternative on Goldbelly. Her coconut layer cake has a hint of almond and is layered with cream cheese icing and coated in shredded coconut, and will arrive at your door before the ball drops, for $99.95.",
      "Why does Tom Cruise love this cake?",
      "In a 2021 interview with Spectrum News, Karen recounts the story of how Cruise came to order so many cakes from their family-run business. As the story goes, Diane Keaton introduced the cake to Katie Holmes during the filming of \u201cMad Money\u201d in 2008. Holmes was married to Cruise at the time.",
      "\u201cSo when Tom and Katie had a big party at their new home in Beverly Hills, we did all the cakes,\u201d Karen said. \u201cThey loved it.\u201d",
      "Ever since then, Cruise has given the cake out every year \u2014 and word gets around.",
      "\u201cPeople do call it that,\u201d Alexis says, adding that while people come in asking for the Tom Cruise cake, they take special care to not advertise it that way. \u201cWe can\u2019t control what they call it, but out of respect for him, we just call it the White Chocolate Coconut Cake. We don\u2019t want to use him as publicity.\u201d",
      "How does it taste?",
      "On Dec. 13, the TODAY anchors tried the iconic cake for themselves. During PopStart, TODAY cohost Carson Daly served up the treat, which is known to be moist, buttery and coconutty, to the group.",
      "\u201cHow did you get this?\u201d Al Roker asked Carson, who replied that he got the cake from Goldbelly \u2014 not from Cruise (this year, at least).",
      "\u201cMmm,\u201d Hoda Kotb says while taking multiple bites of cake. \u201cI love it. Wow.\u201d",
      "The hosts all seemed to enjoy their slices, and Al said, \u201cThat\u2019s good cake.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "How far would a person go to escape oppression? One group of Cuban punk rock teens in the \u201890s deliberately injected themselves with HIV in order to live more freely.",
      "Their story is loosely told in \u201cLos Frikis,\u201d or \u201cThe Freaks,\u201d a drama in theaters Dec. 25, starring Adria Arjona, H\u00e9ctor Medina and\u00a0newcomer Eros de la Puente. Written and directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, creators of \u201cThe Peanut Butter Falcon,\u201d the Spanish-language film begins with the following message:",
      "\u201cIn 1961, Fidel Castro outlawed rock music in Cuba. For decades, only the boldest performers played \u2018the music of the enemy\u2019 in secret. The most extreme members of this movement became known as Los Frikis.\u201d",
      "Inspired by true events, \u201cLos Frikis\u201d tells the coming-of-age story of Gustavo (de la Puente), who idolizes his older brother Paco (Medina) and his rock music-loving friends. Poor and starving during a period of scarcity in Cuba, Paco and his friends inject themselves with HIV so they can be sent to a government-run sanitarium where they can have full meals, freedom and listen to and play rock \u2019n\u2019 roll.",
      "\u201c(There) they experience freedom and joy and a full belly for the first time in their lifetime,\u201d Arjona tells TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s a joyful, beautiful ride of these two brothers coming together. It\u2019s a coming-of-age story. It\u2019s funny, and it\u2019s incredibly, incredibly heartbreaking as well.\u201d",
      "Miller, along with producer Phil Lord and actors Adria Arjona, H\u00e9ctor Medina and\u00a0Eros de la Puente, break down the incredible story of resilience and endurance told in \u201cLos Frikis.\u201d",
      "A harrowing time in Cuba",
      "In 1989, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba\u2019s economy took a turn for the worse. The country entered its decadeslong depression known as the \u201cSpecial Period,\u201d when food and fuel shortages affected the population.",
      "\u201cLos Frikis\u201d shows the struggles that many people faced at that time and the extreme measures they took to survive. Early on there's a scene where Paco makes his brother catch and kill a cat so they can eat it. Gustavo doesn\u2019t have the stomach to do it.",
      "\u201cYou have to learn how to take care of yourself, OK!\u201d Paco sternly tells his brother. \u201cWake up! We live in Cuba!\u201d",
      "A 1989 New York Times article wrote about \u201cstarvation in Cuba,\u201d where it said \u201ccats and dogs there, and even iguanas and snakes, have been eaten.\u201d",
      "At the same time, as the AIDS epidemic spread in the '80s, HIV testing began in Cuba in 1986, according to The New York Times. Cuba took strict measures to combat the spread by frequently testing people for HIV and offering free basic health care, as well as forcing people who tested positive to quarantine in the sanitariums.",
      "The self-infected Frikis knew that if they were sent to the sanitariums they would be provided with food, shelter and the freedom to listen and play their music.",
      "\u201cThe thing that we were trying to do was make sure that it wasn\u2019t sensationalizing (people injecting themselves with HIV) and presenting what was happening in a matter of fact, letting the story tell you what was going on without trying to push it,\u201d producer Chris Miller tells TODAY.com. \u201cBecause what really happened is so outrageous, you don\u2019t need to do anything extra to make it seem outrageous. So it was really about trying to underplay it as much as possible.\u201d",
      "While the sanitariums kept people infected with the disease away from their families, people formed lifelong friendships and the places kept the spread to a minimum.",
      "According to a 2007 study, Cuba had one of the world\u2019s smallest HIV epidemics. Its infection rate was 0.1 %, the lowest HIV prevalence in the Caribbean, per the study. In 2015, Cuba became the first country to receive validation from the World Health Organization that it had eliminated mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis.",
      "Who were 'Los Frikis'?",
      "Los Frikis were a group of punk rockers who rejected communist Cuba, loved rock music (which was banned by Fidel Castro) and the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll style. They also were outcasts, many of whom were of the LGBTQ community.",
      "Niurka Fuentes' late husband, Papo La Bala, was one of the first Frikis, and injected himself with the virus. She told Vice in 2017, \u201cHe knew that he would meet other people like him in there, the police would leave him alone, and he would be able to live his life in peace.\u201d",
      "Papo La Bala was quoted as saying, per the metal music magazine Metal Hammer, \u201cI gave myself AIDS \u2014 and many others like me \u2014 because we were the most persecuted class in the entire country. The police fell hardest on us. All the laws were against us. It was a level of discrimination completely without democracy.\u201d",
      "Another Friki, Yoandra Cardoso, also told Vice, \u201cYou could hear rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and\u00a0heavy metal coming from every house. When the sanatorium first opened, it was 100\u00a0percent Frikis \u2026 we were all here together.\u201d",
      "At the time, there wasn\u2019t much information about HIV and AIDS. Cuba would seek cures and treatment. Patients at sanitariums could volunteer to be the test subjects, which is depicted in \u201cLos Frikis.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it was very important for this movie to make sure that people know how desperate you actually have to be in order to make that choice,\u201d de la Puente, who was born in Cuba, tells TODAY.com.",
      "Growing up in Cuba, Medina was very aware of the Frikis and even knew some of them.",
      "\u201cI spoke with a drummer who was in a band in Cuba,\u201d the 35-year-old says in Spanish about his research. \u201cHe told me about his friendships, that period, how they would try to find phone cords to use as guitar strings ... It was very interesting how they would find ways to play music.\u201d",
      "He also spoke with a medical professional who worked at Los Cocos, a sanitarium southwest of Havana, who recalled seeing his patient-turned-friends die of AIDS.",
      "The message behind 'Los Frikis'",
      "Producer Phil Lord wanted the movie to speak of the current moment but go beyond politics.",
      "\u201cWe wanted it to be something universal about how you find your freedom, who you find it with, how you stay together under adversity, how families carry on in adverse circumstances,\u201d the Cuban American filmmaker tells TODAY.com. \u201c(It\u2019s) the story of these two brothers... it was going to be funny and warm, even though, ostensibly, the topic is devastating.\u201d",
      "Producer Chris Miller adds that the movie is about \u201cfinding hope in a hopeless situation.\u201d",
      "For the actors, de la Puente says that what resonates with audiences is \u201cel esp\u00edritu Friki.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Freaky spirit, the spirit of rebellion that the film shows, to sit in a reality that is not enough,\u201d he says. \u201cThe spirit of, \u2018I will get out and I will do what I want because I deserve it. I want to find happiness, I want to find friendship and connections.\u2019\u201d",

      "The \u201cAbbott Elementary\u201d star and creator appeared in a similar sketch called \u201cTraffic Altercation,\u201d wherein she and Mikey Day engaged in some animated and often inappropriate gesturing while they were stuck in a traffic jam on the highway.",
      "This time, Short competed with Day for a parking lot spot at a mall on the afternoon of Christmas Eve.",
      "At the beginning of their exchange, the men try to reasonably communicate their ownership over the spot, with Day insisting that the spot was his with some simple gesturing, while Short claimed that his blinker was on, as conveyed by his aggressive blinking.",
      "Tensions escalated from there, with Day claiming that he reached the spot first, to which Short accused him of being blind. The sketch continued to take dark and inappropriate turns as their argument over the parking spot continued without resolution. At one point, Day\u2019s daughter, portrayed by Chloe Fineman, got involved, albeit with some NSFW gestures.",
      "Day accused Short of being a liar after sharing that he was handicapped due to his high blood pressure, using his hand to gesture his nose growing \u00e0 la Pinocchio. Short responded by claiming he would never lie because he was a \u201csuper Christian\u201d as represented by him doing his best Superman stance and then holding his arms out as if he were on the cross.",
      "Eventually, Short said that if Day wouldn\u2019t listen to him, then maybe he would listen to his wife, portrayed by Melissa McCarthy. Though Day initially didn\u2019t see Short\u2019s wife, McCarthy came in hot on the scene and started to bang on the passenger side window.",
      "\u201cDrive away right now or I will kill you, now,\u201d she threatened the father-daughter duo. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll make your dumb daughter watch.\u201d",
      "After the threats intensified, McCarthy paused to take a sip of an iced coffee before promptly spitting it back out onto the window.",
      "Day and Fineman could barely keep it together as McCarthy used her chest to wipe off the beverage from the window, pausing every few seconds to glare at them before pressing her chest against the window again. At one point, she even licked a line clean off the window so she could get a better look at the duo before creeping away.",
      "That was the final straw in the argument as Day ultimately surrendered the spot to Short who seemed overjoyed by the win.",
      "McCarthy wasn\u2019t the only celebrity cameo during last night\u2019s episode.",

      "Lively accused Baldoni, the film\u2019s director, of sexual harassment, hostile work environment and trying to tarnish her reputation in an undated complaint filed with the California Civil Rights Department.",
      "The complaint stated that Baldoni retained prominent PR crisis manager Melissa Nathan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the same woman\u00a0Johnny Depp hired\u00a0during his\u00a0high profile trial defamation trial\u00a0against Heard, his former wife.",
      "In an exclusive statement shared with NBC News, Heard, who now lives in Spain, said: \u201cSocial media is the absolute personification of the classic saying \u2018A lie travels halfway around the world before truth can get its boots on.\u2019 I saw this firsthand and up close. It\u2019s as horrifying as it is destructive.\u201d",
      "In that case, a jury unanimously found that Heard had defamed Depp, and he was awarded $5 million in punitive damages and $10 million in compensatory damages. Heard was also awarded $2 million in compensatory damages in her counterclaim, but nothing in punitive damages.",
      "At the time, Depp said \u201cthe jury gave me my life back,\u201d but Heard said the decision \u201csets back the clock to a time when a woman who spoke up and spoke out could be publicly shamed and humiliated.\u201d",
      "According to Lively\u2019s complaint, Baldoni hired a crisis communications team to launch a \u201cretaliatory social manipulation campaign\u201d against Lively during the film\u2019s promotion aimed at destroying her reputation.",

      "The film\u2019s promotion made headlines at the time because the two stars appeared to avoid each other as rumors swirled on social media that they did not get along on set.",
      "Fans also noticed that Baldoni was doing press separately from his co-stars, and that some of the film\u2019s stars, including Lively and Jenny Slate, did not follow him on Instagram.",
      "Bryan Freedman, who is representing Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and all its representatives, called the allegations in Lively\u2019s complaint \u201ccategorically false.\u201d",
      "He said Wayfarer hired a crisis communications team because Lively allegedly threatened not to show up to set during filming and threatened not to promote the film.",

      "Why fans believe there\u2019s drama between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively",
      "Online, the volume of a single question surrounding the \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d rollout has gone steadily up in the week leading up to the release: Why hasn\u2019t star and director Baldoni been pictured with the rest of the cast?",
      "People on social media have dissected cast appearances and events. At the New York movie premiere Aug. 6, Lively was photographed with an ensemble, including her husband, Ryan Reynolds, and his \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d co-star Hugh Jackman. She also posed with \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d co-stars Brandon Sklenar and Jenny Slate. Baldoni appeared only with his wife, Emily Baldoni, or alone.",
      "Fans also noticed that Lively and Hoover do not follow Baldoni on Instagram, but they follow each other and other cast members like Sklenar and Slate.",
      "Since then, fans have began to speculate about possible tension between Baldoni and Lively. Baldoni did not partake in many group engagements with the cast to promote the film, often doing interviews solo, while Lively was paired with one or more other cast members. Fans on TikTok and YouTube were quick to note Baldoni\u2019s noticeable absence from Vanity Fair\u2019s interview with Lively and five other central actors in the film.",
      "This is part of a trend of fans close-reading press tours by analyzing interviews, red carpet interactions, body language and more for insight into cast dynamics. \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d press tour in 2023, for example, was clouded by rumors of a rift between star Taraji P. Henson and executive producer Oprah Winfrey, which they both denied. \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling,\u201d from 2022, was similarly overshadowed by a rumored feud between the cast and the relationship between a star (Harry Styles) and director (Olivia Wilde).",
      "What have \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 cast members said about an alleged feud?",
      "On Aug. 20, Sklenar became the first cast member to address any perceived iciness.",
      "\u201cColleen and the women of this cast stand for hope, perseverance, and for women choosing a better life for themselves,\u201d he wrote on Instagram in part. \u201cVilifying the women who put so much of their heart and soul into making this film because they believe so strong in its message seems counterproductive and detracts from what this film is about. It is, in fact, the opposite of the point. What may or may not have happened behind the scenes does not and hopefully should not detract from what our intentions were in making this film. It\u2019s been disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected online.\u201d",
      "Lively and Baldoni have not commented, though Baldoni has spoken highly about Lively and the contributions she made on the film.",
      "During a TODAY appearance Aug. 8, Baldoni said of the movie star: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know how smart and creative she really is. I think she\u2019s best known as an actress and of course she\u2019s a fashion icon, but she\u2019s so much more than that. She\u2019s dynamic, creative. She had her hands in every part of this production and everything she touched, she made better.\u201d",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com that took place after his broadcast appearance, Baldoni spoke to the extent of Lively impact on the movie, along with her husband\u2019s.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t summarize Blake\u2019s contribution in a sentence, because her energy and imprint is all over the movie and really, really made the film better, and from beginning to end,\u201d he said. \u201cRyan (Reynolds) was so generous ... he\u2019s a creative genius, that guy. So, you know, his gift is levity, and her gift is levity.\u201d",
      "Baldoni had also suggested Lively direct the sequel to \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there are better people for that one,\u201d Baldoni told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d when asked if he\u2019d be interested in heading the next movie. \u201cI think Blake Lively is ready to direct. That\u2019s what I think.\u201d",
      "As for Lively, she has not mentioned Baldoni in interviews, though she has been open about her creative touches seen in \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d In an interview with Hits Radio UK on Aug. 11, said she and people involved in the film disagreed over featuring Lana Del Ray\u2019s song \u201cCherry.\u201d Lively was strongly for it, while others were against it \u2014 though she added, \u201cI\u2019m not supposed to be talking about this.\u201d",
      "Lively on TODAY said she sourced her character Lily\u2019s clothes from her own wardrobe, as well from her friend Gigi Hadid\u2019s and Reynolds\u2019. And in an interview with E! News on the red carpet, Lively revealed her husband wrote the rooftop scene, where Ryle and Lily first meet.",
      "Why did Blake Lively sue Justin Baldoni?",
      "In December 2024, over four months after \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d premiered, Lively filed a complaint against Baldoni for sexual harassment.",
      "Lively claimed in her complaint, which was obtained by TODAY.com, that she experienced sexual harassment in addition to retaliation, breach of contract, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and more.",
      "In the complaint, Baldoni and Jamey Heath, the CEO of Wayfarer Studios and producer on the film, were said to have engaged in \u201cinappropriate and unwelcome behavior\u201d toward Lively and other individuals on the set of the film.",
      "These claims included ignoring industry safeguards for filming intimate scenes, adding in \u201cgratuitous sexual content,\u201d discussing personal sexual experiences, and objectifying women, including Lively.",
      "The complaint also noted that Baldoni and his team proceeded to \u201cformulate a retaliatory plan\u201d due to knowledge the Wayfarer Studios had of the HR complaints made against the actor and Heath\u2019s behavior. It also stated that Baldoni retaliated because the complaints \u201cthreatened his feminist brand.\u201d",
      "Lively claimed in her complaint that due to an \u201cincrease in negative media articles and social media coverage,\u201d she, her family and her businesses all \u201csuffered\u201d and were \u201csubstantially harmed\u201d by Wayfarer Studios\u2019 actions.",
      "\u201cThe emotional impact on Ms. Lively has been extreme, not only affecting her, but her family, including her husband and four children,\u201d the complaint read in part. \u201cThere are days when she has struggled to get out of bed, and she frequently chooses not to venture outside in public.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, responded to the complaint in a statement to TODAY.com, sharing that they were \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "Does \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 romanticize abuse?",
      "While current chatter around \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d surrounds the cast, the story itself has generated controversy. Previously, discourse revolved around its delivery of a heavy subject matter.",
      "Hoover has shared publicly that the story was inspired by her mom, who left her abusive husband (and Hoover\u2019s biological father) when Hoover was 2.",
      "A common criticism of the book was that it romanticized abuse.\u00a0An op-ed published to a domestic shelters non-profit said the BookTok favorite \u201cfeeds into the very structures of toxic masculinity that it purports to combat\u201d by \u201cromanticizing red flags\u201d and glorifies a \u201ccharismatic-but-dangerous man.\u201d",
      "Speaking to TODAY.com, Baldoni said he and screenwriter Christy Hall made a concerted effort to take criticism into account \u201cfrom the very beginning.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe talked about the criticism. We talked about why that happened. We talked about what we can do to protect the movie from that criticism, and how we can make sure that we inject as much truth into it, so that people can be seen and never feel like their stories are being exploited,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said he \u201ccompletely understands\u201d the criticism.",
      "\u201cI want to validate and support anybody and everybody who\u2019s come out against the book, because the last thing we need is to romanticize something that is such a real experience for so many people\u201d",
      "Baldoni took input from the domestic violence organization No More while making the film and also attended a support group for perpetrators to try to better understand their psychology.",
      "As a result of their effort, the movie changes one of the most controversial plot points from the book: the end of Lily and Ryle\u2019s relationship.",
      "In the book, although Lily leaves Ryle, he stays part of their daughter\u2019s life and watches her unsupervised for days on end. In the movie, Ryle isn\u2019t seen on screen after their daughter is born at the hospital.",
      "Baldoni told The Wrap the script\u2019s original draft had a scene that involved Ryle dropping off their child and having a short conversation with Lily.",
      "\u201cIt was written in a way that showed that they\u2019ve overcome a lot over the last two years. And I wasn\u2019t fully comfortable with it.\u201d",
      "Does the movie\u2019s marketing match its tone?",
      "Some are saying the movie\u2019s packaging is discordant with its subject matter.",
      "\u201cIf you just watch the trailer for this movie \u2026 it looks like a romance,\u201d as pop culture TikToker Jess Spoll said.",
      "The poster sees Lily smiling and surrounded by flowers. The original cover art for the movie took on a different tone. In it, Lily and Ryle stand close together in an embrace. Lily\u2019s face is in focus and she appears to wear an ambiguous impression.",
      "A post shared by It Ends With Us (@itendswithusmovie)",
      "Readers of the book often experienced a similar surprise, like this TikTok points to: \u201cReading \u2018It Ends with Us\u2019 thinking it is a cute romance,\u201d the text reads \u2014 before things change, and the true nature of Lily and Ryle\u2019s relationship emerges.",
      "Since the film's release, people started taking issue with Lively\u2019s promotion of the film.",
      "\u201cJustin is promoting the movie as it is, which is about DV (domestic violence), it\u2019s a very heavy topic, it\u2019s what the book focuses on,\u201d Meredith Mansfield says in a now-viral TikTok video. \u201cWhereas Blake and everybody else are promoting it like a rom-com and that\u2019s rubbing a lot of people the wrong way.\u201d",
      "Mansfield cited an interview with Lively where she suggested people \u201cgrab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see\u201d the film.",
      "In another viral video, TikToker Ashley Paige, who goes by @livingsingle and says she\u2019s a survivor of domestic abuse, addressed Lively in a 5-minute-long video.",
      "\u201cIn this video, you represented us... it\u2019s your job, right?\u201d she said, going on to cite domestic violence statistics in the United States.",
      "\u201cAnd you have the audacity to show up to the premiere and tell your audience and have influencers promote it like it\u2019s the sequel to \u2018Barbie,\u2019\u201d Paige said. \u201cYou could\u2019ve gone about this so differently, in such a respectful, tactful, gentle, understanding, advocacy-bringing awareness manner.\u201d",
      "Paige seemed to be responding, at least in part, to an Aug. 9 interview Lively did with the BBC where she said that \u201cwhat\u2019s important about the film\u201d is that her character Lily is \u201cnot just a victim.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile those are huge things to be, she\u2019s not defined by something that someone else did to her or an event that happened to her, even if it\u2019s multiple events,\u201d Lively said. \u201cShe defines herself and I think that\u2019s deeply empowering to remind people that no one else can define you. No experience can define you, you define you.\u201d",
      "How have cast members reacted to marketing criticism?",
      "Sklenar also addressed criticism surrounding promotion of the movie in his Aug. 20 Instagram post:",
      "\u201cTrust me when I tell you, there isn\u2019t a single person involved in the making of this film that was not aware of the responsibility we had in making this. A responsibility to all the women who have experienced generational trauma \u2014 domestic abuse \u2014 or struggle with looking in the mirror and loving who they see. This movie is a harsh reality check for the men who need to get their s\u2014 together and take responsibility for themselves and their actions.\u201d",
      "Lively nor Baldoni have spoken out directly, though Lively on her Instagram story Aug. 13 thanked viewers for seeing the movie and \u201cgetting a message so important out there to the masses.\u201d",
      "In a second post on her Instagram story that same day, she shared the link and phone number to the National Domestic Violence Hotline with the following caption:",
      "\u201c1 in 4 women aged 18 and older in the US alone have been the victim of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. Intimate partner violence affects all genders, including more than 12 million people every year in the United States.\u201d",
      "What happened with the coloring book?",
      "\ufeffIn 2023, Hoover announced \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d was becoming a coloring book, a move that was immediately criticized by fans who said the medium didn\u2019t fit the tone. A day later, plans for the book were canceled, and Hoover acknowledged fan feedback.",
      "\u201cThe coloring book was developed with Lily\u2019s strength in mind, but I can absolutely see how this was tone-deaf,\u201d Hoover wrote in part.",
      "Merch related to the book has continued, however. In April 2024, Hoover released a line of long-lasting nail polish and press-ons with Olive and June. Colors are named after the book\u2019s characters, as well as other books of hers (though there isn\u2019t a Ryle nail polish).",
      "Lively also launched in tandem with the movie\u2019s release a new product: her hair care line at Target.",
      "The characters\u2019 ages",
      "When the casting was announced in 2023, fans of the book immediately took issue with Lively and Baldoni portraying the main characters.",
      "At 36, Lively is older than the book\u2019s version of Lily, who is written to be 23. Ryle is about 30.",
      "Hoover told TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager in 2023 that she made a \u201cmistake\u201d with the characters\u2019 ages in the book and that both should be older, especially given Ryle is a neurosurgeon.",
      "\u201cAs an author, we make mistakes,\u201d she explained in her interview. \u201cThere\u2019s no 28-year-old neurosurgeons, you know? You go to school for 15 years. And so to make corrections to what I messed up in the book, we aged the characters up somewhat.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Blake Lively has filed a sexual harassment complaint against her \u201cIt Ends with Us\u201d costar and director Justin Baldoni.",
      "Lively alleges in an 80-page complaint, filed Dec. 20 and obtained by TODAY.com, that Baldoni created a hostile workplace on the movie's set. The document states the actor later participated in \u201castroturfing\u201d \u2014 defined in the complaint as the deceptive practice of orchestrating a smear campaign under the guise of the public \u2014 as well as a coordinated PR effort to \"destroy\" her reputation.",
      "Baldoni\u2019s lawyer, Bryan Freedman, responded to Lively\u2019s claims in a statement to TODAY.com, calling them \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious.\u201d",
      "In her complaint, Lively claims that filming \u201cIt Ends with Us\u201d became so uncomfortable that an \u201call hands\u201d meeting, which included her husband, Ryan Reynolds, was held to address Baldoni and producer Jamey Heath\u2019s alleged \u201cinappropriate conduct.\u201d",
      "During the meeting, according to the complaint, Baldoni and Heath were asked to stop showing nude videos and images of women to Lively and others and to stop discussing their past \u201cpornography addiction\u201d as well as their \u201cpersonal experiences of sex\u201d in front of her and others.",
      "Lively also requested that Baldoni and Heath stop describing their own \u201cgenitalia\u201d in front of others.",
      "The complaint goes on to allege that Lively issued a demand \u2014 which Sony Pictures, the film\u2019s distributor, reportedly approved at the time \u2014 asking that no additional sex scenes or \u201con camera climaxing\u201d beyond what she had previously approved of be added to the film, among other requests regarding the movie\u2019s scenes depicting intimacy.",
      "During the meeting, the complaint says Lively also addressed other issues on the movie\u2019s set and made a request to Baldoni to stop saying he was \u201cspeaking to\u201d her late father, actor Ernie Lively, and for him to stop \u201cpressing\u201d her to discuss her religious beliefs.",
      "Lively\u2019s complaint also notes that after the movie was released, Baldoni engaged in a \u201csocial manipulation\u201d campaign to \u201cdestroy\u201d her reputation that caused her and her family \u201csevere emotional distress.\u201d",
      "Lively\u2019s suit also included numerous excerpts of texts and emails from Baldoni\u2019s team, which were obtained through a subpoena that she claims detailed a plan to harm Lively\u2019s reputation.",
      "In a statement to TODAY.com, Lively said, \u201cI hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\u201d",
      "Lively\u2019s complaint comes months after rumors of a behind-the-scenes feud between Lively and Baldoni began during promotion of \u201cIt Ends with Us.\u201d",
      "In a statement to TODAY.com, Freedman, the attorney for Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and all its representatives, called Lively\u2019s lawsuit a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d to repair her reputation.",
      "\u201cIt is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions,\u201d Freedman said in the statement.",
      "\u201cThese claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media,\u201d Freedman\u2019s statement continued.",
      "\u201cWayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.",
      "Baldoni\u2019s attorneys claim that Lively\u2019s team allegedly made up stories about Baldoni to the press before the marketing of the film had even begun.",
      "\u201cWhich was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address,\u201d the statement reads.",
      "\u201cThe representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals,\u201d the statement concluded.",
      "TODAY.com has also reached out to attorneys for Lively and Sony Pictures, who distributed the film, for comment about Baldoni\u2019s response to the complaint.",
      "Rumors of tensions between Lively and Baldoni emerged during promotion of \u201cIt Ends with Us,\u201d which was released in theaters in August 2024.",
      "The movie, which is based on Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 novel of the same name, tells the story of Lily Bloom, a florist (Lively), who falls for a charming neurosurgeon named Ryle (Baldoni) only to find herself trapped in an abusive relationship.",
      "On Dec. 21, Hoover shared a picture of herself hugging Lively to her Instagram story, tagging the actor and seemingly addressing the allegations.",
      "She wrote, \u201c@blakelively, you have been nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patience since the day we met. Thank you for being exactly the human that you are. Never change. Never wilt.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com has also reached out to Hoover for comment.",
      "After social media users noted that Baldoni did not pose with Lively \u2014 or any of the movie\u2019s other stars \u2014 at the film\u2019s Aug. 6 premiere in New York, rumors of tensions among the cast circulated online.",
      "The chatter escalated when fans noticed that Lively and author Hoover followed each other and other cast members \u2014 but not Baldoni \u2014 on Instagram.",
      "Baldoni also didn\u2019t participate in group promotional events with the movie\u2019s actors, opting instead to do his interviews with the media alone. Meanwhile, Lively often joined other cast members to speak to the media, including a high-profile Vanity Fair interview that featured Lively and five other actors from the film \u2014 but not Baldoni.",
      "Lively and Baldoni never publicly commented about their alleged feud, and Baldoni notably praised Lively during an Aug. 8 appearance on TODAY for her \u201csmart and creative\u201d contributions to his film.",
      "Baldoni had also suggested Lively direct the sequel to \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there are better people for that one,\u201d Baldoni told \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d when asked if he\u2019d be interested in helming the next movie. \u201cI think Blake Lively is ready to direct. That\u2019s what I think.\u201d",
      "However, as rumors of the rift between the pair escalated, Lively began facing a public backlash online from those who criticized her behavior during promotional interviews about the movie, claiming it was at odds with the film\u2019s serious subject matter.",
      "The former \u201cGossip Girl\u201d star also faced criticism online for launching a new hair care line while promoting the film.",
      "Meanwhile, author Hoover came under fire from online critics who accused her of romanticizing domestic violence in her book.",
      "Brandon Sklenar, who plays Atlas, the former high school boyfriend of Blake Lively\u2019s character, Lily, commented on the multiple controversies surrounding the film in a lengthy statement on Instagram Aug. 20. In his statement, he defended Lively, Hoover and other women involved in the film from online attacks.",
      "In his message, Sklenar wrote that whatever \u201cmay or may not have happened behind the scenes\u201d during shooting of the movie, \u201cshould not detract from what our intentions were in making this film.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected online,\u201d he wrote."

      "When a Saudi Arabian national was accused of ramming a car into a German Christmas market, members of the frequently anti-Muslim European far right said it proved their point. The deadly incident in Magdeburg was another example of Islamist terrorism, they said \u2014 and a result of the mass immigration they so vehemently oppose.",
      "Except it wasn\u2019t that simple.",
      "The suspect, Taleb al-Abdulmohsen, 50, was in fact scathingly critical of Islam and immigration, according to his past posts on X. He aligned himself with the far-right, anti-immigration party Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is endorsed by Musk and monitored by German intelligence agencies for suspected extremism. While authorities say the motive is not yet clear, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the suspect \u201cwas obviously Islamophobic.\u201d",
      "Al-Abdulmohsen\u2019s complex worldview, in which he criticized the Saudi Arabian government but also Germany\u2019s alleged failure to protect Saudi immigrants from the Middle Eastern kingdom\u2019s repression, has muddied attempts to use his alleged killing of five people and injuring 200 others as an anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim cautionary tale. It comes at a time when immigration is the most polarizing issue in Europe, where far-right parties are surging on a wave of discontent, and immigrants are blamed for job scarcity, housing shortages and cultural changes.",
      "There has been \u201czero\u201d contrition from those on the right who sought to capitalize on the incident, said Hans-Jakob Schindler, the senior director of the Counter Extremism Project, a nonprofit international group focused on radical ideologies.",
      "Billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk, who has backed far-right figures in Europe, wrote on X that the \u201clegacy media lies again\u201d when news outlets, including NBC News, reported that officials described the suspect as Islamophobic.",
      "Other figures who were quick to interpret the attack have since kept quiet.",
      "\u201cThey despise our values,\u201d Dutch anti-Islam leader Geert Wilders posted Friday on X. \u201cThis is our land, our freedom, our life. And we\u2019ll defend it and never surrender.\u201d",
      "However, it later emerged that the suspect was a fan of Wilders, having previously called him \u201ca true hero\u201d on X. Wilders has not posted about it since, as of 7 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, meanwhile, did continue to comment but instead focused on the suspect\u2019s immigrant background rather than his political and religious beliefs. On Monday night during a rally in Magdeburg\u2019s cathedral square she called for change \u201cso we can finally live once again in security,\u201d Reuters reported.\u00a0 Members of the crowd shouted \u201cdeport them\u201d punctuated her speech.",
      "Al-Abdulmohsen entered Germany in 2006 \u2014 almost a decade before then-Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s \u201copen-door policy\u201d that saw 1 million asylum-seekers enter the country and, critics say, foment much of the political disquiet experienced today.",
      "\u201cWhen everyone, including myself, thought this was an Islamic State attack, these accounts were all posting Islamophobic stuff, then a couple of hours later, when it turned out this guy is Islamophobic himself, these right-wing social media feeds seamlessly switched to migration,\u201d Schindler said.",
      "Other organizations the suspect previously interacted with are now trying to distance themselves.",
      "An ultra-conservative American blog called the RAIR Foundation USA interviewed al-Abdulmohsen just eight days beforehand, profiling him as a former Muslim whistleblower \u201cexposing\u201d Germany\u2019s attempts to \u201cIslamize the West.\u201d",
      "After the attack, the foundation updated its interview page.",
      "\u201cIf these reports are accurate, it appears we and other media outlets \u2026 were misled regarding his true intentions,\u201d it stated.",
      "Meanwhile, far-right X account Radio Genoa shared a video of his arrest and described him as an \u201cArab Islamic terrorist.\u201d This, despite some commenters noting that al-Abdulmohsen himself had regularly reposted Radio Genoa\u2019s own racially charged criticisms of Islam and immigration.",
      "Musk\u2019s comment deriding the media\u2019s reporting of the suspect\u2019s past and beliefs came just hours after the South African-born billionaire doubled down on his support for the AfD party. This support comes amid a series of other positive comments from Musk boosting parties on the populist and nationalist right, having successfully backed President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s win in the United States last month.",
      "It\u2019s not only this that\u2019s alarming more mainstream European officials, but also what they see as a lack of regulation on Musk\u2019s X platform, which the suspect allegedly used to issue threats ahead of Friday.",
      "These kinds of \u201cweirdo, individual, radical, conspiratorial worldviews\u201d are \u201ca phenomenon that has been rising steadily since the coronavirus, since we all moved our lives online and on social media,\u201d Schindler said.",

      "The Biden administration has also said it is weighing whether to remove HTS from its list of terrorist organizations, but that will depend on whether it views al-Sharaa and his new leadership group as one that it can engage with.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re watching what they do now,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday last week. \u201cThey want to be inclusive in dealing with other groups inside Syria, making clear that they respect women and minorities as they establish interim governing authorities\u2014and making clear that Syria won\u2019t be used as a base for terrorist groups.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Israel\u2019s defense minister has confirmed that\u00a0Israel assassinated Hamas\u2019 top leader last summer\u00a0and is threatening to take similar action against the leadership of the Houthi rebel group in Yemen.",
      "The comments by Israel Katz appeared to mark the first time that Israel has acknowledged killing\u00a0Ismail Haniyeh, who died in an explosion in Iran in July. Israel was widely believed to be behind the blast and leaders have previously hinted at its involvement.",
      "In a speech Monday, Katz said the Houthis would meet a similar fate as the other members of\u00a0an Iranian-led alliance in the region, including Haniyeh. He also noted that Israel has killed other leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah, helped topple Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad and destroyed Iran\u2019s anti-aircraft systems.",
      "\u201cWe will strike (the Houthis\u2019) strategic infrastructure and cut off the head of the leadership,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cJust like we did to Haniyeh, Sinwar and Nasrallah in Tehran, Gaza and Lebanon, we will do in Hodeida and Sanaa,\u201d he said, referring to Hamas and Hezbollah leaders killed in previous Israeli attacks.",
      "The Iranian-backed Houthis have launched scores of missiles and drones at Israel throughout the war, including a missile that landed in Tel Aviv on Saturday and wounded at least 16 people.",
      "Israel has carried out three sets of airstrikes in Yemen during the war and vowed to step up the pressure on the rebel group until the missile attacks stop."

      "\u201cIn the north of the Strip in particular, the recent military offensive is a clear illustration of the brutal war the Israeli forces are waging on Gaza, and we are witnessing clear signs of ethnic cleansing as Palestinian life is being wiped off the area,\u201d it said.",

    "summary": "As a former Al Qaeda fighter with a U.S. bounty on his head, experts say Abu Mohammad al-Jolani's first challenge has been proving to the world that he himself is a changed man.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. diplomats arrived in Damascus on Friday,\u00a0Syria's de facto new leader\u00a0Ahmed al-Sharaa will likely have greeted them\u00a0with a clear message: Under his rule, there will be no threat to the West.",
      "Sharaa, who has dropped his nom de guerre of Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has been pushing this line in meetings with Western diplomats and the media since rebel forces, led by his Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group, or HTS, toppled the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. As his new administration takes charge, he has also called for the United States and other countries to drop sanctions against Syria.",
      "\u201cNow, after all that has happened, sanctions must be lifted because they were targeted at the old regime,\u201d Sharaa, dressed in a smart suit and a white shirt, told the BBC in an interview earlier this week, having abandoned the camouflage military fatigues and turban he once wore as a jihadist leader.",
      "\u201cThe victim and the oppressor should not be treated in the same way,\u201d he added.",
      "He has also attempted to move away from his past as a jihadist leader with links to both the Islamic State terrorist group and Al Qaeda.",
      "Striking a more moderate tone, Sharaa has vowed to usher in an era of change driven by a vision of an inclusive Syria in which the country\u2019s many religious and ethnic groups will be represented.",
      "But with a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head and as the current leader of a group that has been designated a terrorist organization by Washington and others, he faces an uphill battle to convince people that he is a changed man.",
      "Sharaa has \u201cbeen embracing a more conventional image,\u201d Joze Pelayo, an associate director at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, told NBC News. \u201cBut I think he needs to walk the talk for that recognition and for that approval to remain sustainable.\u201d",
      "Sharaa has also attempted to present HTS as more moderate, insisting in his BBC interview that it should not be considered a terrorist group because it does not target civilians or civilian areas.",
      "Unlike the Taliban in Afghanistan, which barred women from higher education, public spaces like parks and most jobs, the BBC reported that Sharaa said he would be much more inclusive and had pointed to HTS' record in regions it has governed in recent years, particularly in the city of Idlib in Syria\u2019s northwest.",
      "There, he said, universities had been teaching \u201cfor more than eight years,\u201d adding, \u201cI think the percentage of women in universities is more than 60%.\u201d",
      "Sharaa also promised that a Syrian committee of legal experts would be formed to write a new constitution for the country. \u201cThey will decide. And any ruler or president will have to follow the law,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s saying all of the things that I think Washington and Europe want to hear in terms of a transition leading to a government that\u2019s inclusive and reflective of the will of all Syrians,\u201d said Dana Stroul, a former senior Defense Department official who served in the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is, how long that will hold? Will he walk the walk and not just talk the talk? And if he doesn\u2019t win in the elections, will he peacefully stand aside for whoever does win? I think those are big questions,\" added Stroul, who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",
      "The Biden administration has said it is weighing whether to remove HTS from its list of terrorist organizations \u2014 but that will depend on whether it views Sharaa and his new leadership group as one that it can engage with.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re watching what they do now and certainly making clear that they want to be inclusive in dealing with other groups inside Syria, making clear that they respect women and minorities as they stand up interim governing authorities \u2014 making clear that Syria won\u2019t be used as a base for terrorist groups,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at a briefing Tuesday.",
      "But while many are wary of Sharaa's transformation, throughout Syria's civil war he carved out his own path during his rise to power, defying ISIS and Al Qaeda along the way.",
      "Born in Syria in 1982, he was among the foreign fighters to cross into Iraq to fight against U.S. forces after they invaded the country in 2003 and was detained by the American military, according to The Associated Press."

      "The U.S. delegation, led by Barbara Leaf, the senior State Department official for the Middle East, is expected to meet with members of the Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) rebel group, according to a State Department spokesperson.\u00a0The group is acting as the de facto government in Syria.",
      "Those discussions are expected to focus on expectations for a transition to an inclusive Syrian government and the \u201chope to uncover information about the fate of Austin Tice, Majd Kamalmaz, and other American citizens who disappeared under the Assad regime,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Roger Carstens, the special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, who traveled to Damascus in 2020\u00a0for secret negotiations about Tice during the first Trump administration, is also a part of the delegation.",
      "In addition to HTS, the diplomats will meet with members of civil society, activists, members of different communities and other Syrians \u201cabout their vision for the future of their country and how the United States can help support them,\u201d the spokesperson said.",
      "Daniel Rubinstein, a senior adviser for the State Department\u2019s Middle East bureau, will lead the department\u2019s diplomatic engagement on Syria, according to the spokesperson, and will \u201cengage directly with the Syrian people and key parties in Syria and coordinate with allies and partners.\u201d",
      "Since Assad's ouster, the Biden administration has come under increasing pressure to put U.S. personnel on the ground to participate in the search for Tice, who was abducted in Syria 12 years ago.",

      "HTS remains a U.S.-designated terrorist group with a $10 million bounty on\u00a0Jolani. The sanctions do not prevent the U.S. delegation from meeting or speaking with HTS, but it restricts the provision of material support creating complications for humanitarian aid groups working to assist both the refugees flooding back to their home country and those displaced within it for the last decade.",
      "The Biden administration is exploring removing HTS from its terrorist list, NBC News has reported, but the administration has also laid out a list of conditions it must meet before the United States would formally recognize the Syrian government.",
      "\u201cOur view is that when whatever government arises out of this transition, it needs to be inclusive, it needs to protect the rights of all Syrians, including women and minorities, like all governments, it needs to preserve critical state institutions and deliver essential services,\u201d deputy State Department spokesperson Vedant Patel said Thursday. \u201cAnd perhaps most important, we want to see a Syria that does not pose a threat to its neighbors or the regions or being a place that\u2019s going to serve as a base for terrorism or allying with groups like ISIS.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 19 Dec 2024 10:10:14 GMT",
    "summary": "A landmark mass rape trial in France has exposed abuse orchestrated by the victim's husband, and a culture that many activists say is sexist, tolerant of violence toward women and resistant to change.",
    "story": [
      "PARIS \u2014 When France\u2019s landmark mass rape trial began Sept. 2, the woman at its center appeared to shrink as she arrived at the stark courthouse in Avignon, her face hidden behind dark sunglasses and surrounded by a cordon of lawyers and loved ones.",
      "Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, 72, eventually found her voice, bringing into the light not only the inconceivable abuse orchestrated by her husband, who was on Thursday sentenced to 20 years for drugging her and inviting dozens of men to rape her while she was unconscious, but a culture that many activists have called sexist, tolerant of violence toward women and resistant to change.",
      "Another 46 other men were found guilty of rape, two of attempted rape and two guilty of sexual assault. They ranged in age from 26 to 74 and were handed sentences from three to 13 years.",
      "Many here say France will never be the same. How could it be, they ask, after so many supposedly ordinary men \u2014 among them a firefighter, a nurse, a journalist and a retired sports coach \u2014 were recorded committing unspeakable acts on a snoring grandmother.",
      "\u201cIt brings us back to the idea of who we are as a society, for normal men to commit acts that are totally transgressive and criminal,\u201d said feminist, lawyer and author Anne Bouillon. With domestic violence complaints in France doubling since 2016, she said, the Pelicot case highlights the fact that women are most at risk at home, threatened by partners.",
      "For Blandine Deverlanges, a high school teacher and founder of the feminist group Les Amazones d\u2019Avignon and a steady presence at the courthouse, the case has tapped a vein.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of anger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much larger than the issue of rape. It\u2019s a question of listening to what women have to say.\u201d",
      "Several feminists wondered whether France is in a second wave of the #MeToo movement, which rippled through the film industry here after Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s takedown in 2017 but failed to land the same punch on a broader spectrum as in the United States and other countries. France has a history of defending bold-faced men who act badly, such as exiled film director Roman Polanski. Famous French women like the actress Catherine Deneuve didn\u2019t help the cause by signing a letter that denounced sexual \u201cpuritanism\u201d and defended\u00a0men\u2019s \u201cfreedom to pester\u201d women.",
      "But women say the climate feels different this time. Last week, in another closely watched trial seen as France\u2019s first major #MeToo case, Christophe Ruggia, a little-known film director, was charged with isolating and repeatedly sexually assaulting rising star Ad\u00e8le Haenel, beginning when she was 12 and he was 36.  Haenel, now 35, eventually left the industry and denounced adults who failed to help her. He denies the charges; a verdict is expected in February.",
      "With tempers running high over the Pelicot case, activists are hoping to mobilize that outrage into an effort not only to help victims of sexual assault, but also to transform a society in which 75% of women say they are not treated equally, according to a 2024 government study.",
      "\u201cIn France, we haven\u2019t paid much attention to sexual violence,\u201d said Muriel R\u00e9us, a radio host who started the organization Femmes Avec to help victims of domestic violence and sexual assault navigate the justice system.",
      "Last year, 230,000 women reported they had been victims of sexual violence.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the equivalent of the population of Lille,\u201d R\u00e9us noted, citing the city on the northern border with Belgium.",
      "Much of the discussion has focused on the wording of France\u2019s rape law, which some feminist lawyers say is vague, particularly in cases in which a victim is intoxicated or, like Pelicot, subjected to being drugged,\u00a0known as \u201cchemical submission.\u201d",
      "Dominique Pelicot has admitted crushing large doses of sleeping pills and anti-anxiety medication into his wife\u2019s food and drink. She would discover the truth only in November 2020, weeks after police arrested her husband after he was caught recording up the skirts of women in a supermarket.",
      "Rape is defined under French law as an \u201cact of sexual penetration\u201d committed \u201cby violence, coercion, threat or surprise.\u201d Defense lawyers have insisted that their clients did not intend to commit rape because Dominique Pelicot invited them into the family home, and gave them careful instructions on what he wanted them to do to his wife.",
      "\u201cThis is not American law. In France, you don\u2019t need to have obtained the victim\u2019s consent necessarily to ensure that it\u2019s not rape,\u201d said lawyer Guillaume de Palma, who represents several of the defendants.",
      "\u201cWe have a real problem with French law,\u201d said Magali Lafourcade, secretary general of the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights. \u201cThere are a huge number of situations which are not rape under French law [but] which are rape in the eyes of the victim.\u201d",
      "She said most European countries have adapted their laws and procedures to streamline rape investigations and help victims.",
      "Lafourcade, a veteran magistrate with experience investigating sexual assault cases, was among 500 activists who signed an open letter calling for a consent provision to be added to the law.",
      "But other activists and lawyers say the law is sufficient, with consent implied. Anything more explicit, they say, would force the victim to prove a lack of consent.",
      "Opposing camps do agree on one point: France must overhaul a system that makes it difficult to report sexual violence. From making a police report to following up with a timely medical exam, they agree that it is often a luck of the draw whether a police officer will follow proper procedure or a hospital or an emergency room nurse will agree to take essential DNA samples.",
      "Aurore Hendrickx, 26, a Paris event planner, said she has a few friends who have been sexually assaulted and tried without success to file reports with the police.",
      "\u201cMost of the time, they were almost laughing at them,\u201d she said of the police response, adding that a stunning 90% of her friends have been sexually assaulted or raped. One friend was almost killed by a violent partner.",
      "If police give victims the brush-off, it is often no better at hospitals, where traumatized women are often turned away, advocates say.",
      "Filmmaker Linda Bendali, who has researched cases of chemical submission \u2014 sometimes called date rape \u2014 said a friend\u2019s 23-year-old daughter woke up naked in a strange man\u2019s bed last March with no idea how she got there. Her last memory was sipping a drink in a Paris bar.",
      "\u201cI called the hospital and told them they could see her now. They said, \u2018No, come back tomorrow,\u2019\u201d Bendali said, fuming, adding that she \u201cpushed hard\u201d to demand they take timely blood and hair samples, essential to prove whether the victim had ingested drugs.",
      "While the victim is awaiting a court date, that is a rare occurrence. Only 6% of rape complaints are investigated in France. After that, a trial is conducted behind closed doors \u2014 a process that feminist historian Christelle Taraud called \u201ctruly horrible for the victim,\u201d who is often treated badly by the defense lawyers, with no public accountability.",
      "Taraud called it an \u201celectric shock\u201d when a judge reluctantly approved Pelicot\u2019s demand to keep her trial open, even when intimate videos of her were aired. Finally, Taraud said, the public got to hear and see evidence of the horrific violence inflicted on Pelicot, whose show of strength has made her an international icon.",
      "\u201cThey treated her like a piece of meat,\u201d Taraud said.",
      "In testimony that left many spectators speechless, some of the men appeared to be acting out porn film fantasies. One of them, a former firefighter busted with thousands of images of child pornography, gave a thumbs up to the camera during the assault.",
      "The defendants, who met Dominique Pelicot in a now-defunct online chat room called \u201cwithout her knowledge,\u201d told the five-judge panel that they believed the prone woman was a willing participant. Though her lolling head would seem to indicate otherwise, they called the petite woman, often dressed in lingerie, a swinger acting out a \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d fantasy.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a rapist, like the others in this room,\u201d Dominique Pelicot said at the start of the trial. Slumped in a glass box, he was separated from the other defendants.",
      "Dominique Pelicot\u2019s cache of 20,000 photos and videos included snaps of his daughter, Caroline Darian, naked in bed. While he has insisted that he did not abuse her, Darian, whose book, \u201cI\u2019ll Never Call Him Dad Again,\u201d will be published in English next month, told the court that she\u2019ll never know what really happened. \u201cDid he also drug me?\u201d she wondered. \u201cWorse still, did he abuse me?\u201d",
      "In her final statement to the court, Pelicot made it clear that she is hoping her humiliation won\u2019t be in vain.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time that the macho, patriarchal society that trivializes rape changes,\u201d she said.",
      "The \u201cGis\u00e8le effect\u201d extends beyond Avignon, where the retired logistics manager is applauded and handed bouquets of flowers. Schoolgirls call her name. Strangers send gifts. In a phenomenon that must be deeply satisfying to the woman who wanted \u201cshame to change sides,\u201d activists say women who hadn\u2019t dared speak about domestic violence and sexual assault credit Pelicot with giving them courage to share their stories.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s totally because of Gis\u00e8le that I have the strength to talk about it,\u201d said Latika, 33, who is still recovering from trauma four years after divorcing a violent husband.",
      "The beatings she said she endured were only part of the story. Latika said she learned the man she met at age 17, the father of her children, had been feeding her drugs for years. Like Pelicot, there were signs something was off, but she didn\u2019t connect the dots. \u201cOne night I didn\u2019t drink all of my tea,\u201d she said, and she awoke to find her husband raping her.",
      "NBC News has not been able to independently corroborate her allegations.",
      "Latika has found solace as part of an \u201cequine therapy\u201d program at Lucky Horse, a 25-acre ranch nestled in the foothills of Mount Ventoux in the picture-postcard village of Mazan, about a mile from the former Pelicot home.",
      "Marion Vogel opened the ranch with her husband, a psychotherapist who has worked with domestic violence survivors, to help women develop \u201clife skills\u201d by working with animals. They ride horses without saddles and stirrups \u201cto connect body to body.\u201d They learn to trust themselves.",
      "First up for Latika was overcoming her fear of horses. She spent half a year building up her confidence tending to an adorable Shetland pony before graduating up to Z\u00e9phyr, a sleek champagne quarter horse with a white slash between his eyes who is now her favorite.",
      "She brushes Z\u00e9phyr\u2019s silky mane and takes him for rides in the same lanes and fields where, Vogel noted, Pelicot used to take long walks.",
      "Like Pelicot, Vogel said, these women \u201call have something to fight for.\u201d"

      "A baby mammoth that lay almost perfectly preserved for 50,000 years in the now-melting permafrost of eastern Siberia\u00a0has been unveiled by a team of scientists.",
      "The mammoth was a \u201cunique research find\u201d with scientists \u201call surprised by its exceptional preservation,\u201d said Anatoly Nikolaev, rector of the Lazarev Mammoth Museum Laboratory at the North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk, eastern Siberia. The body showed no signs of damage to the head, trunk, ears and mouth, he said.",
      "\u201cYana is definitely the best-preserved in the world,\u201d the NEFU scientists stated in a press release on Monday.",
      "The carcass of the baby mammoth, dubbed \u201cYana\u201d after the Yana River basin where it was found in eastern Siberia, Russia, was unveiled by researchers on Monday. It was only the seventh baby mammoth carcass discovered globally \u2014 six in Russia and one in Canada.",
      "The mammoth is 4 feet tall, weighs about 400 pounds and is less than 6.6 feet long, according to the press release.",

      "The mammoth is estimated to have been about one year old when it died, according to the press release. However, scientists at the Lazarev Mammoth Museum Laboratory, which specializes in the study of mammoths and their Ice Age environment, is conducting further tests to confirm exactly how old the animal was when it died.",
      "According to their website, they are collaborating with genetic researchers from other regions of the Russian Federation to uncover more about Yana\u2019s life and environment.",
      "Russia\u2019s permafrost, now thawing due to climate change, has uncovered several incredible prehistoric discoveries in recent years.",
      "In 2020, scientists in the Yakutia, the north-eastern part of Siberia, unearthed part of a mummified sabre-tooth cat estimated to be approximately 32,000 years old.",
      "The following year, in 2021, researchers discovered the remains of a 44,000-year-old wolf in the same region."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 In Hong Kong, it\u2019s pandas, pandas, everywhere.",
      "About 2,500 giant panda sculptures are on display around Hong Kong as the Chinese territory hopes to capitalize on its growing panda population to regain its position as one of the top travel destinations in Asia.",
      "Hong Kong has struggled to attract tourists in their previous numbers after three years of pandemic border restrictions and a crackdown on dissent following 2019 antigovernment protests tarnished the city\u2019s international image.",
      "Hong Kong currently has six pandas. Its reigning pair, Ying Ying and Le Le, had twins in August, when Ying Ying become the world\u2019s oldest first-time panda mother after years of failed breeding efforts. The cubs could make their public debut in February.",
      "In September, Hong Kong also welcomed a pair of 5-year-old pandas that were sent by Beijing, giving it the largest population of giant pandas outside mainland China.",
      "The panda windfall has inspired Hong Kong officials to talk about a \u201cpanda economy,\u201d encouraging restaurants and businesses to launch panda-themed products.",
      "At a Dec. 7 ceremony introducing the two Beijing-gifted bears to the public, Hong Kong\u2019s leader, John Lee, said there was a \u201ccraze for giant pandas\u201d in the city.",
      "The ceremony at Ocean Park, an animal theme park that has been struggling financially, was attended by top mainland Chinese and local officials.",
      "Hong Kong\u2019s economy is closely intertwined with China\u2019s, and the recent slowdown in the mainland has been strongly felt here. Last month, Hong Kong\u2019s economic growth forecast for 2024 was downgraded to 2.5%, down from 3.2% last year.",
      "That is partly because tourism, a pillar of the Hong Kong economy, has failed to rebound.",
      "From January through October of this year, the city received almost 37 million visitors, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, an increase of 37% compared with the same period last year. But that is still well below the more than 50 million visitors Hong Kong received from January to October of 2019, a period that includes the start of the protests. (Lee fired his tourism secretary this month.)",
      "Mainland China continues to be the main source of tourists, accounting for more than 75% in October. But China\u2019s economic malaise has curtailed spending in Hong Kong by mainland Chinese visitors, many of whom make day trips from the city of Shenzhen across the border.",
      "Other ideas for revitalizing Hong Kong, such as the \u201cmega-event economy,\u201d have hit roadblocks as political sensitivities remain high. In February, the public was outraged when soccer star Lionel Messi failed to play in a heavily promoted exhibition game. Though Messi said he was too injured to play, fans and even government officials accused him of having \u201cpolitical motives.\u201d",
      "There are hopes that the panda campaign will go better.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a sight to see for first-time tourists like me,\u201d said Carol Lee Furiate, a visitor from California who had been to Hong Kong before but not the Big Buddha, a 112-foot bronze monument where about 70 panda sculptures are on display this month in the surrounding village and the cable car leading up to it.",
      "Even for visitors enjoying the panda exhibition at the Big Buddha, however, there was skepticism as to how much impact such events would have on the local economy.",
      "\u201cAfter taking pictures, people will leave. Will they stay here to eat or shop? Probably not,\u201d said Margaret Koon, a Hong Kong resident visiting the Big Buddha.",
      "Donald Low, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said the pandas would not be a big draw for international tourists because they are \u201cnot something that\u2019s part of the Hong Kong identity.\u201d Mainland Chinese tourists, meanwhile, can see plenty of pandas at home.",
      "Hong Kong should be trying to differentiate itself from other Chinese cities, Low said, and focusing on what makes it unique.",
      "He said global tourism is also moving away from high-end dining and shopping and tourist attractions and toward \u201cexperiencing the city as locals would.\u201d",
      "\u201cHong Kong has a lot to offer in terms of varied, diverse urban experiences,\u201d he said, adding that the city is \u201cvisually very stunning\u201d and complex.",
      "\u201cI think people who visit want to soak in that complexity,\u201d he said."

      "The war that followed the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 and saw 250 taken hostage has decimated Gaza. Israeli forces have since killed some 45,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, and destroyed much of the enclave\u2019s health system.",

      "Duggan\u2019s lawyers have argued in court there is no evidence the Chinese pilots he trained were military, and he was no longer a U.S. citizen at the time of the alleged offences. He renounced his U.S. citizenship in 2016 at the U.S. embassy in Beijing, backdated to 2012 on a certificate, they said.",

      "An indictment unsealed by the District of Columbia court showed Duggan faces four charges, and alleges he traveled between Australia, the U.S., China and South Africa between 2009 and 2012, when he was contracted by a Chinese national to provide services to a Chinese state-owned company, including evaluations of Chinese military pilot trainees and instruction on landing on aircraft carriers.",
