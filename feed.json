      "\u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\" is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a new 4K restoration and a theatrical re-release",
      "Jack Nicholson did not want to go to the Oscars. It was 1976 and he was nominated for best actor in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d The Milo\u0161 Forman film, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a nationwide theatrical re-release on July 13 and July 16, had become a bit of a sensation \u2014 the second highest grossing picture of 1975, behind \u201cJaws,\u201d and had received nine Oscar nominations.",
      "But Nicholson wasn\u2019t feeling optimistic. In five years, he\u2019d already been nominated five times. He\u2019d also lost five times. And he told his producer, Michael Douglas, that he couldn\u2019t go through it again.",
      "\u201cI remember how hard I had to persuade Jack to come to the ceremony. He was so reluctant, but we got him there,\u201d Douglas said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd then of course we lost the first four awards. Jack was sitting right in front of me and sort of leaned back and said \u2019Oh, Mikey D, Mikey D, I told you, man.\u2019 I just said, \u2018Hang in there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Douglas, of course, was right. \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d would go on to sweep the \u201cbig five\u201d \u2014 screenplay, director, actor, actress and picture \u2014 the first film to do so in 41 years, (\u201cIt Happened One Night,\u201d in 1934) which only \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d has done since. That night was one of many vindicating moments for a film that no one wanted to make or distribute that has quite literally stood the test of time.",
      "\u201cThis is my first 50th anniversary,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first movie I ever produced. To have a movie that\u2019s so lasting, that people get a lot out of, it\u2019s a wonderful feeling. It\u2019s bringing back a lot of great memories.\u201d",
      "The film adaption of Ken Kesey\u2019s countercultural novel was a defining moment for Douglas, a son of Hollywood who was stuck in television and got a lifeline to film when his father, Kirk Douglas, gave him the rights to the book, and many of the then-unknown cast like Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd.",
      "DeVito was actually the first person officially cast. Douglas, who\u2019d known him for nearly 10 years, brought Forman to see him play Martini on stage.",
      "\u201cMilo\u0161 said, \u2018Yes! Danny! Perfect! Cast!\u2019 Douglas said in his best Czech accent. \u201cIt was a big moment for Danny. But I always knew how talented he was.\u201d",
      "Though the film's themes are challenging, unlike many of its New Hollywood contemporaries it wasn\u2019t a tortured shoot by any stretch. They had their annoyances (like Forman refusing to show the cast dailies) and more serious trials (they found out halfway through production that William Redfield was dying of leukemia), but for the most part it was fun.",
      "\u201cWe were very serious about the work, because Milo\u0161 was very serious. And we had the material, Kesey\u2019s work, and the reverence for that. We were not frivolous about it. But we did have a ball doing it,\u201d DeVito said, laughing.",
      "Part of that is because they filmed on location at a real state hospital in Salem, Oregon. Everyone stayed in the same motel and would board the same bus in the morning to get to set. It would have been hard not to bond and even harder if they hadn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cThere was full commitment,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThat comes when you don\u2019t go home at night to your own lives. We stopped for lunch on the first day and I saw Jack kind of push his tray away and go outside to get some air. I said, \u2018Jack, you OK?\u2019 He said, \u2019Who are these guys? Nobody breaks character! It\u2019s lunch time and they\u2019re all acting the same way!'\u201d",
      "Not disproving Nicholson\u2019s point, DeVito remembers he and the cast even asked if they could just sleep in the hospital.",
      "\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let us,\u201d DeVito said. \u201cThe floor above us had some seriously disturbed people who had committed murder.\u201d",
      "The film will be in theaters again on July 13 and July 16 from Fathom Entertainment. It\u2019s a new 4K restoration from the Academy Film Archive and Teatro Della Pace Films with an introduction by Leonard Maltin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gorgeous print and reminds me how good the sound was,\u201d Douglas said.",
      "DeVito thinks it, \u201cholds up in a really big way, because Milo\u0161 really was paying attention to all great things in the screenplay and the story originally.\u201d",
      "Besides the shock of \u201choly Toledo, am I that old?\u201d DeVito said that it was a treasure to be part of \u2014 and he continues to see his old friends, including Douglas, Lloyd and, of course, Nicholson, who played the protagonist, R.P. McMurphy.",
      "One person Douglas thinks hasn\u2019t gotten the proper attention for his contributions to \u201cCuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d is producer Saul Zaentz, who died in 2014. His music company, Fantasy Records who had Creedence Clearwater Revival, funded the endeavor which started at a $1.6 million budget and ballooned to $4 million by the end. He was a gambler, Douglas said, and it paid off.",
      "And whatever sour grapes might have existed between Douglas and his father, who played R.P. McMurphy on Broadway and dreamt of doing so on film, were perhaps over-exaggerated. It was ultimately important for their relationship.",
      "\u201cMcMurphy is as good a part as any actor is going to get, and I\u2019m now far enough in my career to understand maybe you have four, maybe five good parts, really great parts. I\u2019m sure for dad that was one of them,\u201d Douglas said.",
      "\u201cTo not be able to see it through was probably disappointing on one side. On the other, the fact that his son did it and the picture turned out so good? Thank God the picture turned out. It would have been a disaster if it hadn\u2019t.\"",
      "Douglas added: \u201cIt was a fairy tale from beginning to end. I doubt anything else really came close to it. Even my Oscar for best actor years later didn\u2019t really surpass that moment very early in my career.\u201d",

      "Forty years ago, the legendary Live Aid concerts simulcast from Philadelphia and London aimed to do a lot of good",
      "NEW YORK -- Forty years ago, the legendary Live Aid concerts aimed to do a lot of good \u2014 helping to raise over $100 million for famine relief in Ethiopia and inspiring worldwide awareness for a cause it might otherwise have ignored.",
      "Simulcast from Philadelphia and London on July 13, 1985, Live Aid was the most ambitious global television event of its time: 16 hours of live music in two different continents featuring Queen, The Who, a Led Zeppelin reunion and more.",
      "A lot has changed in the years since. \u201cLive Aid, '85 to now, is the same distance as the Second World War from Live Aid,\u201d notes Rick Springfield, laughingly. \u201cThat\u2019s how long ago it was.\u201d",
      "Artists who performed at Live Aid \u2014 Springfield, organizer Bob Geldof, Hall and Oates' John Oates and Judas Priest's Rob Halford \u2014 reflected on the event and its impact in interviews with The Associated Press ahead of the 40th anniversary on Sunday.",
      "Here's what they had to say:",
      "At John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, Springfield performed between Run-DMC and REO Speedwagon \u2014 just a taste of the diversity of performers featured on the transnational lineup. \u201cRun-DMC, I remember thinking, \u2018What is this? Three guys talking over a record player. What is that? Little did I know that it was about to change the whole game,\u201d he says, laughing. He remembers playing an electric set \u2014 no \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl,\u201d because \u201cback then, it was just my first hit. ... It hadn't gone on to become this cultural thing.\"",
      "Hall and Oates' John Oates had a different experience. His band also played in Philly \u2014 their hometown \u2014 and in 1985, his band was one of the biggest on the planet. They played near the end of the night, joined by the Temptations' Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin and remained on stage to back the Rolling Stones' dynamic frontman Mick Jagger. The British rockstar had a trick up his sleeve.",
      "\u201cHe didn't tell us that he was bringing Tina Turner out,\u201d Oates says. \u201cWe had rehearsed a certain amount of songs with him. But then when he brought her out, it just jacked up the level of energy like you can\u2019t believe.\u201d",
      "Judas Priest singer Rob Halford counts \u201cMike and Tina, of course,\u201d as one of his Philly Live Aid highlights. \u201cLed Zeppelin, too.\u201d",
      "But most exciting of all for the heavy metal frontman? Meeting folk hero Joan Baez. The band had previously covered her classic \u201cDiamonds and Rust.\"",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God, she\u2019s gonna come and kick me in the ass for wrecking her beautiful song,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe gives me a quick hug and goes, \u2018The reason I\u2019m here is because my son said to me, if you see Rob Halford from Judas Priest at the Live Aid Show in Philadelphia, will you tell him from me that I prefer Judas Priest\u2019s version to my mom\u2019s version?' ... It was a display of such kindness.\"",
      "Twenty years after Live Aid, Geldof organized Live 8 \u2014 an even larger undertaking in the new internet era, with 10 concerts happening simultaneously and across the globe.",
      "If the trend were to continue, there should be another event taking place this year. Notably, there isn't.",
      "Geldof says that's because there couldn't be a Live Aid-type event in 2025. He cites social media as a cause. In his view, algorithmic fracturing has made it impossible to create monolithic musical and activistic moments. Instead, he views the current media landscape as bolstering \"an echo chamber of your own prejudices.\u201d",
      "For something like Live Aid to work, \u201cYou need rock \u2018n\u2019 roll as a creature of a social, economic and technological movement,\" he says. \u201cAnd I think the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll age is over. ... It did determine how young people articulated change and the desire for it. ... That isn't the case anymore.\u201d",
      "Springfield agrees. \u201cI think we are too divided,\u201d he says. He believes the world wouldn't be able to agree on a single cause to support, or even which musicians to back. \u201cYou could never do a thing with the size of Live Aid unless it was some kind of universal thing of, \u2018Let\u2019s bring everybody together.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cNever say never, but I highly doubt it,\u201d says Oates. \u201cThe landscape of music and entertainment in general has changed so drastically.\"",
      "He points to \u201cWe Are The World,\u201d the 1985 charity single for African famine relief that included the voices of Michael Jackson, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Paul Simon and many more, as an example. \u201cThe idea of that happening with the stars of today all in one place, I can\u2019t even imagine that. And plus, who would they be? ... How many songs are released every day?\u201d",
      "Halford echoes the other's sentiments. There's an undeniable \u201cextremism in the world right now,\u201d he says, that would make a Live Aid event challenging to pull off in 2025. But he doesn't think it's impossible. He uses January's Fire Aid \u2014 the LA wildfire benefit concert featuring Billie Eilish, Stevie Wonder and a Nirvana reunion \u2014 as a recent example.",
      "\u201cThere will always be empathy from people,\u201d and in the right hands, maybe another event like Live Aid could take place. \u201cIt was a tremendously beautiful, humanitarian example ... that provided us opportunity to do something ourselves to help.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Former \u201cLove Island USA\u201d contestant Cierra Ortega apologized Wednesday for resurfaced posts where she used a racial slur against Asian people.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained the slur.",
      "Ortega addressed the entire Asian community in her nearly five minute TikTok video and said she is \u201cdeeply, truly, honestly so sorry.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not an apology video. This is an accountability video,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "\u201cI had no idea that the word held as much pain, as much harm, and came with the history that it did, or I never would have used it,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cI had no ill intention when I was using it, but that\u2019s absolutely no excuse because intent doesn\u2019t excuse ignorance.\u201d",
      "Ortega, who has been back in the United States for about 48 hours, said she has struggled most with the backlash experienced by her family, who she said doesn't feel safe in their own home, and have had immigration authorities called on them.",
      "\u201cThere's no need to fight hate with hate. I don't think that that's justice,\" Ortega said. \"And if you want to know that you're heard and that I'm sorry and that I will move differently, I promise you, that's what will happen.\u201d",
      "Ortega\u2019s removal from the villa was announced early in Sunday\u2019s episode. Host Iain Stirling said she had left \u201cdue to a personal situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI completely agree with the network\u2019s decision to remove me from the villa. I think that this is something that deserved punishment and the punishment has absolutely been received,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "Her video made no mention of her \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Nic Vansteenberghe. He remained in the villa single when Ortega left, ultimately recoupling with fellow islander Orlandria Carthen in the same episode. The couple is still in competition as of Tuesday\u2019s episode.",
      "Ortega said she was unaware she was using a racial slur until a follower pointed it out after she posted an Instagram story in 2024 that used the term. It was one of the posts that resurfaced during her time in the villa.",
      "At this point, Ortega said \u201cthe word was immediately removed from my vocabulary.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know that moving forward, my actions and how I decide to live my life from here on out is gonna speak louder than any apology ever could,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "Ortega\u2019s departure from the villa followed Yulissa Escobar, who left the villa last month in the second episode after clips of her using racist language resurfaced online. Her departure was also not explained in the show.",
      "A spokesperson for the show declined to comment Monday.",
      "Escobar, who initially issued an apology on her Instagram story shortly after she departed the villa, took to TikTok a day after Ortega left to ask viewers to stop cyberbullying contestants.",
      "\u201cI know what I said was wrong. I know what Cierra said was wrong, and I know it hurt communities,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cAll I ask you guys is instead of threatening her and her family, try to educate us, her, me.\u201d",
      "Escobar said she was \u201chonestly scared to come home,\u201d when she first got her phone back after exiting the villa and saw the messages she had received.",
      "\u201cI was like, is something going to happen to me? Like, is somebody going to do something to me? Because it was just a lot to take in and even my family was worried,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to take that when you\u2019re getting all these threats online.\u201d",
      "The show, which strips contestants of their phones or access to the outside world, has previously asked fans to avoid cyberbullying contestants. Host Ariana Madix called for fans to stop doxxing and harassing the show\u2019s stars in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d is an American spin-off of the original U.K. series and is airing its seventh season. The show airs daily except Wednesdays and brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",

He's already dropped \u201cBundle by Bundle,\u201d \u201cUpdate,\u201d which features an interpolation of Soul II Soul\u2019s classic \u201cBack To Life,\u201d \u201cSweet Love\u201d and \u201cTaTaTa\u201d featuring Scott.",

Regions in Africa and the Middle East reached double-digit gains in music revenue last year, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. In 2023, the group reported that sub-Saharan Africa was the fastest-growing music industry, with artists like Burna, Davido and Wizkid leading the way, along with Tyla, who\u2019s spread South Africa\u2019s Amapino sound.",

But now, it\u2019s to the point where even that: if I don\u2019t vote, because I don\u2019t say I\u2019ll vote for this person or vote for that person, it\u2019s a problem.\u201d",
      "But that weight of responsibility isn\u2019t felt on his eighth studio album. \u201cDem Dey,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek bop referencing his gossipy social media scandal with a Nigerian influencer which amused fans, is sure to crowd dance floors, while he and Jagger formed a dynamic duo on the Afrobeat-rock hybrid \u201cEmpty Chairs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how I see the future of our music \u2026 music that\u2019s supposed to last, music that you can perform forever,\u201d said Burna, who collaborated with the 81-year-old by trading ideas through WhatsApp after being connected by supermodel Naomi Campbell. \u201cThat\u2019s where I want to be when I\u2019m that age.\u201d",
      "For his country-infused \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d with Shaboozey, the pair plead for second chances after souring relationships.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s an Igbo boy from the eastern part of Nigeria who comes to America as a young guy,\u201d said Burna of the \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy)\u201d singer. \u201cHe\u2019s flourishing in the country world. If I\u2019m not proud of that, then I don\u2019t think I can be proud of anything in life.\u201d",
      "The Afrobeats superstar, currently featured on the soundtrack for the blockbuster \u201cF1\" movie starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris, hopes the genre continues to thrive and not become a fad. But while the female artists are united, the top men have experienced friction in the past.",
      "\u201cWe need to figure how to make our diversities into an advantage instead of a disadvantage, and that goes across \u2014 not just for Nigeria,\" said Burna, whose grandfather managed Afrobeat icon Fela Kuti. \"It goes for everything Black and African, because the only thing we always lack is strong organization.\u201d",
      "While some artists have expressed ideas on unification, Burna Boy is cautious.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about uniting ... We\u2019re talking about people who actually can help matters,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss with people that it\u2019s just going to end up a discussion, and there\u2019s not going to be any action.\u201d",

      "\"That note was never supposed to be public,\u201d a smiling Fritz said after his 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) win over Karen Khachanov set up a semifinal meeting with two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.",

      "It's the first time Fritz has reached the last four at Wimbledon. He's won two grass-court titles this season \u2014 Stuttgart and Eastbourne \u2014 and was happy he wouldn't be facing Alcaraz on clay, which would be \u201can absolute nightmare.\u201d",

      "Chanel has marked 110 years of its haute couture by recreating its atelier inside the freshly restored Grand Palais for Paris Couture Week",
      "PARIS -- Only Chanel would call its legendary Rue Cambon salon \u201ctoo small\u201d \u2014 then rebuild it, supersized, in a palace.",
      "On Tuesday, as the house marked 110 years of its haute couture \u2014 a century and more of Coco Chanel\u2019s revolution in how women dress \u2014 it blew up its atelier as a giant set inside the freshly restored Grand Palais, turning intimacy into spectacle for a nature-drenched show at Paris Couture Week.",
      "Chanel, whose founder banished corsets and reimagined luxury as liberation, showed just how far that legacy stretches: from the tiny salons of 1915 to its modern colossus.",
      "It was a flex only a handful of luxury giants could pull off \u2014 and perhaps, as one front-row guest suggested, a dazzling distraction as the fashion world counts down to the debut of Chanel's new designer Matthieu Blazy.",
      "Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Naomi Campbell and the house\u2019s tightest VIP circle scaled gilded steps, sweating past marble and gold, to enter the reconstructed atelier. The set by Willo Perron was classic Chanel: intimate yet monumental, old world yet futuristic.",
      "\u201cIt just felt special,\u201d Campbell said, \u201clike stepping into a memory and something completely new. There\u2019s warmth, intimacy, nostalgia. Chanel can recreate anything, and it works.\"",
      "More drama unfolded on the runway. This was couture as nature fantasy, filtered through the Chanel prism. Menswear tailoring added swing to sculpted jackets and coatdresses, while mohair suits in deep greens and plums channeled autumn\u2019s hush. Boucl\u00e9 tweeds mimicked sheepskin; feathers and tweed created illusionary faux fur.",
      "Gold-sprayed wheat ears \u2014 the house symbol of abundance \u2014 were everywhere: stitched into flounces, embroidered on necklines, set on every guest\u2019s seat. The theme may have been country, but make no mistake: This was as close as Chanel gets to \u201croughing it.\u201d",
      "Technique dazzled at every turn: jewel-buttons, embroidered florals and a finale of lam\u00e9 so luminous it mimicked sunlight on harvest fields. The studio team, holding the fort after Virginie Viard\u2019s abrupt and unceremonious exit last year, anchored the show in classic codes but played with wit and lightness.",
      "That obsessive handwork matters \u2014 not just for tradition, but for business. Chanel is fashion\u2019s juggernaut: Privately held, the brand reported $18.7\u202fbillion in revenue for 2024, cementing its status as one of the world\u2019s most powerful luxury houses. Couture may be the crown, but its influence drives global sales in fragrance, bags and jewelry, making it the envy of rivals.",
      "Change is always looming at Chanel. For more than 30 years, Karl Lagerfeld transformed the brand from Parisian legend to pop phenomenon, staging ever-grander spectacles at the Grand Palais. After his death in 2019, Viard, his longtime deputy, guided Chanel into a softer, more discreet era.",
      "Now the industry is holding its breath for Blazy, a Belgian talent with stints at Margiela, Celine and most recently Bottega Veneta, where he won fans for his blend of innovation and reverence for craft.",
      "Campbell said of Blazy, whom she knows personally: \u201cHe\u2019s focused, open-minded \u2014 he\u2019ll bring something special.\u201d",
      "Tuesday\u2019s show unfolded inside the Grand Palais' newly restored Salon d\u2019Honneur, its gold and stone revealed after a 600-million-euro, multi-year restoration co-funded by Chanel. It\u2019s more than a venue; it\u2019s an advertisement of the house\u2019s power and commitment to Parisian heritage.",

      "Local leaders in Iseltwald and tourism officials insist the village's 406 inhabitants aren\u2019t getting rich off the influx of visitors, who pay 5 Swiss francs ($6.30) to access the dock. In 2024, entries brought in nearly 245,000 francs ($307,000), while a one-franc public pay toilet collected about 58,000 francs more, said village clerk Gabriela Blatter.",
      "Proceeds have gone mostly to garbage disposal, restroom cleaning, additional work hours and custodial staff hires, she said.",
      "Titia Weiland, manager of the B\u00f6nigen-Iseltwald Tourism agency, said the funds go right back to village upkeep: \u201cIt\u2019s not correct to read it as \u2018the community gets rich\u2019,\u201d alluding to some comments along those lines in the media and online.",
      "The village, situated along a small peninsula that juts out into Lake Brienz, features majestic views of Alpine peaks over the water.",
      "An episode in early 2020 of the cross-border Korean love story spotlighted the dock as a romantic getaway. That sparked online hype among fans of the series across Asia and beyond, which hasn\u2019t let up, fueling the rush of tourism to Iseltwald.",
      "The continued influx has exposed growing pains for the Swiss village, like those faced by other tourist hotspots that get too much of a good thing.",
      "Part of the problem is infrastructure: Iseltwald has three hotels and four restaurants, not enough for about 1,000 visitors who arrive by tour bus, public bus and car each day on average, according to Blatter. The village is revamping a parking lot to help cope with the strain, and the only village store now operates 7 days a week. Previously, it was open Monday to Friday.",
      "\u201cThere were always tourists in Iseltwald. We are happy with them. The problem is that the tourists don\u2019t understand what\u2019s private and what\u2019s public,\" Blatter said, adding that some traipse through private yards and gardens. \u201cThey go everywhere.\u201d",
      "For months, fans of the series could visit the dock for free until the turnstile was put up in 2023 to help offset costs incurred by the local government.",
      "Not long ago, Weiland said, \u201cwe were wishing for more tourists in Iseltwald: In some ways, we are thankful ... but it can be extreme.\u201d Villagers who hosted the crews for on-site filming at the dock had no idea the series would become such a runaway success, she said.",
      "The village has a website devoted to the \u201cfilming location\" of the series that lists transportation options and entreats visitors to respect the dock, refrain from littering, and consider the \u201cquiet atmosphere of this authentic Swiss village\u201d by keeping noise down and avoiding private property.",
      "\u201cEnjoy your stay in beautiful Iseltwald and take with you memories to your home country!\u201d the site says.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Cierra Ortega, a contestant of this summer's \u201cLove Island USA\u201d left the villa just a week before the finale of the hit reality series is set to air on Peacock.",
      "Her departure, announced Sunday, followed weeks of uproar from viewers after old posts from Ortega resurfaced that contained a racial slur against Asian people. The show's narrator, Iain Stirling, announced Ortega had departed \u201cdue to a personal situation\u201d early in Sunday's episode.",
      "Ortega becomes the second contestant this season to depart the show amid controversy due to past social media posts. Yulissa Escobar abruptly exited last month in the second episode after clips of her using racist language resurfaced online. Her departure was also not explained in the show.",
      "A spokesperson for the show declined to comment Monday.",
      "Ortega's family posted to her Instagram story Sunday evening following the announcement of her departure, asking the public \u201cfor compassion. For patience. For basic human decency.",
      "\u201cWhile Cierra is not in the villa anymore, she is still away. She hasn't had the chance to process any of this or speak for herself,\" her family wrote. \"But we know our daughter. We know her heart. And when she returns, we believe she'll face this with honesty, growth, and grace.\u201d",
      "Her family said they, along with Ortega\u2019s friends and online supporters, have received threats, attacks and cruel messages on social media, noting that \u201cno one deserve that kind of hate, no matter what mistakes they\u2019ve made.\u201d",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d is an American spin-off of the original U.K. series and is airing its seventh season. The show airs daily except Wednesdays and brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "Couples undergo challenges and are encouraged test their romantic connections as new contestants are introduced. Islanders are routinely \u201cdumped\u201d from the villa throughout the series as stronger couples form. The winning couple receives $100,000.",
      "The show, which strips contestants of their phones or access to the outside world, has previously asked fans to avoid cyberbullying contestants. Host Ariana Madix called for fans to stop doxxing and harassing the show\u2019s stars in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Ortega entered the villa at the end of the first episode as a bombshell, one of the first in a steady stream of new contestants who come in after the show began, often expected to disrupt existing couples and create new relationship dynamics.",
      "Ortega quickly coupled up with Nic Vansteenberghe, whom she remained with up until her departure. Her exit broke up one of the few consistent couples of the season. The couple had just announced a few episodes prior they were \u201cclosed off,\u201d a popular \u201cLove Island\u201d phrase to indicate neither contestant was interested in exploring a connection with any other islander.",
      "\u201cBefore Cierra had left, my mind was clear. I knew what the future would look like, and now, I'm lost,\u201d Vansteenberghe said during Sunday's episode.",
      "Vansteenberghe stayed on the show as a single islander after Ortega left, and he ultimately re-coupled with fellow contestant Olandria Carthen before the end of the episode.",
      "Belle-A Walker, a contestant who was dumped earlier this season, took to Instagram to express heartbreak over Ortega's resurfaced posts. Walker, who is Asian American, said she is \u201cdeeply appreciative\u201d of the show's producers \u201cfor taking a stand and making it clear that racism of any kind is not tolerated.\u201d",
      "\u201cAsian hate is oftentimes overlooked and dismissed. But being a first-generation American, I have personally witnessed and experienced how real and hurtful comments like these are,\" Walker wrote on her Instagram story page. \"It is my hope that this situation can help shed light on how big of an issue anti-Asian hate really is.\u201d",

      "Monday\u2019s collection at Paris Couture Week, \u201cSympoiesis,\u201d felt like the culmination of her restless experimentation: A show that dared to imagine clothing as both organism and artifact.",
      "In a shadowy Paris venue, Van Herpen sent out a series of gossamer gowns spun from alternative fibers so fine and insubstantial that they seemed conjured from air itself.",
      "At the collection\u2019s heart, a luminous \u201cliving dress,\u201d animated by millions of bioluminescent algae, quietly stole the scene.",
      "The algae, thriving within a custom-molded nutrient matrix, glimmered in electric blue as if stitched from the deep sea \u2014 offering an eerie, captivating spectacle that went beyond mere artifice.",
      "Elsewhere, Van Herpen introduced wedding gowns crafted from lab-grown bio-protein, a futuristic Japanese fiber that\u2019s biodegradable and endlessly recyclable \u2014 a glimpse of a fashion industry reimagined for a new era.",
      "If the show dazzled, it also underscored a rare feat in modern couture: Independence.",
      "In a world where most designers rely on billion-dollar groups to bankroll their dreams, Van Herpen stands nearly alone, thriving outside the grip of giants like LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering.",
      "Her creations have become magnets for pop royalty and rule-breakers: Lady Gaga, Beyonc\u00e9, Bj\u00f6rk, Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman have all worn her sculptural gowns on the world\u2019s biggest stages.",

      "In a world obsessed with spectacle, Van Herpen continues to ask not only what we wear, but how we care for the world that makes it possible.",

      "Paris Couture Week begins with a striking moment as Cardi B appears in a custom Schiaparelli gown, holding a live crow",
      "PARIS -- Paris couture week opened not with sequins or red carpet pageantry, but Cardi B 's crow moment.",
      "Wrapped in a custom Schiaparelli gown of graphic fringe, the U.S. rapper stood beneath the gilded columns of the Petit Palais, holding a live crow on her arm.",
      "Her avian plus one squawked, glared, and nearly lunged \u2014 setting the tone for a show that soared straight into the surreal.",
      "It was a fitting image for Schiaparelli. Elsa Schiaparelli, the house\u2019s founder, built her legend in the 1930s by weaving the unexpected \u2014 lobster dresses, shoe hats, and, yes, animals \u2014 into the heart of high fashion.",
      "That legacy pulsed through Daniel Roseberry\u2019s Fall 2025 collection, a spectacle in pure black and white, staged as if the city itself had been drained of color, leaving only stark contrast and raw emotion.",
      "Inside, the mood was cinematic \u2014 gowns and jackets defined by intensity and ease, with the waist and hips shaped through unexpected techniques. Hints of disco sheen flickered like film across the runway.",
      "But if the house has been criticized in the past for relying on extreme corsetry and body manipulation, this season marked a shift. Roseberry, perhaps heeding the critics, abandoned his signature corset silhouette. In its place: a freer, more elastic exploration of the body, echoing Schiaparelli\u2019s own restless spirit.",
      "Roseberry said the collection was inspired by the moment in 1940, when Elsa Schiaparelli fled Nazi-occupied Paris for New York \u2014 a period \u201cwhen life and art was on the precipice: to the sunset of elegance, and to the end of the world as we knew it.\u201d",
      "Here, that tension was alive in every look: archival codes reimagined, but with a restless push toward the future. Dresses undulated like car bodies, hips arced in impossibly engineered shapes, ribbons from antique Lyon couture fluttered as kinetic sculptures.",
      "Yet the show was more than spectacle. This was couture at its most essential \u2014 an ideas factory for the entire fashion industry, unfettered by trends.",
      "\u201cChanel was interested in how clothes could be of practical use to women; Elsa was interested in what fashion could be,\u201d Roseberry added.",
      "It is this what-if energy, the transformation of memory, myth, and sheer technique into something never seen before, that keeps couture vital, even as the world rushes toward AI and disposable fast fashion.",
      "The setting only heightened the effect. The Petit Palais is currently home to an exhibit on Charles Worth, the 19th-century Englishman who invented haute couture by bringing artistry and handcraft to Paris. The symmetry was irresistible: in these halls, Schiaparelli\u2019s past collided with fashion\u2019s future, reminding all why couture matters: not as museum piece, but as living laboratory for risk, reinvention, and radical beauty.",
      "A decade after its relaunch, Schiaparelli has found commercial traction and become a fixture on the world\u2019s red carpets, a rare feat in today\u2019s luxury market. But above all, the brand\u2019s power lies in its ability to surprise. On opening day, as Cardi B\u2019s crow threatened to take flight, Schiaparelli proved that in Paris, fashion\u2019s most potent magic is still the unexpected.",

The new film received mixed reviews from critics, carrying a 51% on Rotten Tomatoes, and B CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences.",
      "Factors like the holiday weekend, inflation and post-COVID moviegoing realities make it difficult to fairly compare the \u201cRebirth\u201d launch to the other films in the \u201cJurassic World\u201d franchise, the first of which opened to $208 million domestically in 2015. The other two, \u201cFallen Kingdom\u201d and \u201cDominion\u201d opened to $148 million and $145 million respectively.",

It cost a reported $180 million net to produce, not including marketing and promotion costs.",
      "The campaign was far reaching, including a global press tour, with stops everywhere from London to Seoul, integrated marketing across NBC Universal platforms and brand tie-ins with everything from Jeep and 7-11 to Johansson\u2019s skincare line.",
      "No major new films dared go up against the dinosaurs, who left last week\u2019s champion, the Brad Pitt racing movie \u201cF1,\u201d in the dust. \u201cF1\u201d fell a modest 54% in its second weekend with $26.1 million, helping bring its domestic total to $109.5 million.

      "When they eventually found Dr. Claudette Yam\u00e9ogo, Burkina Faso\u2019s only pediatric ophthalmologist, the injury had become too difficult to treat.",
      "\u201cThe trauma has become severe,\u201d Yam\u00e9ogo said of Diallo\u2019s condition as she attended to him recently at the Sanou Sourou University Hospital in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. \u201cCases like (Diallo\u2019s) must be treated within the first six hours, but I\u2019m seeing him two weeks later, and it\u2019s already too late.\u201d",

      "Late intervention can significantly alter a child\u2019s future, the organization said, with many such cases in less developed countries.",
      "In Burkina Faso, an estimated 70% of the population lives in rural areas. And yet ophthalmologists are concentrated in the capital, Ouagadougou, and other main cities, making them unreachable for many.",
      "While more than 2,000 ophthalmology procedures were performed in Burkina Faso\u2019s western Hauts-Bassins region in 2024, only 52 of those were carried out in its more rural areas, according to the Ministry of Health. Most procedures were done in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso\u2019s second city.",

      "To visit Yam\u00e9ogo\u2019s hospital from the village where they are sheltering, they had to travel about 40 kilometers (21 miles) on a motorcycle to Bobo-Dioulasso, spending 7,500 francs ($13) on transport, a high price for a small-scale farming family.",
      "At least 70% of the trauma cases in children treated at the hospital come from rural areas where the risk of exposure \u2014 from conflict or from play \u2014 is higher, Yam\u00e9ogo said.",
      "Examining and treating a child is a delicate practice that requires a lot of time, something many families can\u2019t afford. Many must return home to earn money for the treatment.",
      "As she treated Diallo, Yam\u00e9ogo noticed that the boy associated a drawing of an apple with a pepper, making her wonder: Is it that he can\u2019t see it, or that he doesn\u2019t know what an apple is? The fruit doesn't grow in the region where he lives.",

      "Yameogo\u2019s work has had a \"very positive impact on training future pediatricians and on the quality of ophthalmology services,\u201d said Jean Diallo, president of the Burkinab\u00e8 Society of Ophthalmology.",
      "\u201cA child\u2019s eye is not the same as that of an adult, which is why we need specialists to treat problems early so the child can develop properly,\u201d Diallo said.",
      "He cited retinoblastoma, a retinal cancer mostly affecting young children, and congenital cataracts, eye diseases that can be cured if diagnosed early. Pediatricians won\u2019t necessarily detect them.",
      "During another consultation, Yam\u00e9ogo told the family of 5-year-old Fatao Traor\u00e9 that he would need cornea surgery as a result of an injury sustained while playing with a stick.",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel a pinch in my heart,\u201d Yam\u00e9ogo said as she examined the boy after they arrived from their farm on the outskirts of Bobo-Dioulasso. \u201cHis iris has detached from his cornea, so he needs to be hospitalized.\u201d",
      "The father, looking overwhelmed, sighed, unsure of where the money for the child's surgery would come. On paper, Burkina Faso's government covers the cost of medications and care for children under 5, but often no drugs are available in hospitals, meaning families must buy them elsewhere.",
      "A surgery like the one for Traor\u00e9 can cost 100,000 CFA ($179), several months' income for the family.",

      "APEX, N.C. -- North Carolina\u2019s first standalone children\u2019s hospital will be built in a bedroom community near the state capital, the project\u2019s health systems announced Thursday, creating a campus estimated to bring 8,000 jobs to the area.",
      "UNC Health and Duke Health announced in January an agreement to jointly build the proposed 500-bed pediatric hospital and linked facilities in the state\u2019s Research Triangle region, which includes Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill.",
      "At that time, the specific location wasn't finalized. But leaders of the health systems said Thursday that the \u201cNorth Carolina Children's\u201d project will be constructed about 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) southwest of downtown Raleigh in Apex, a town of 77,000 already surging in population thanks to the region's strong technology economy.",
      "The 230-acre (93.1-hectare) campus will also include a children\u2019s outpatient care center, over 100 behavioral health beds and a research and education center operated by Duke University and University of North Carolina medical schools.",
      "The campus is poised to be integrated into a long-discussed mixed-use development location called Veridea that will include thousands of new homes, retail, dining, office and research space, as well as a new Wake Technical Community College campus.",
      "\u201cThis campus will create a brighter, healthier future for generations of children and adolescents across North Carolina and the Southeast, and we\u2019re thrilled to have Apex as our home and partner,\" UNC Heatlh CEO Dr. Wesley Burks said in a news release.",
      "A groundbreaking for the hospital campus is now expected in 2027, with construction anticipated to take six years. North Carolina Children\u2019s Health also issued on Thursday a request for information from potential design and construction contractors for the project.",
      "There are children\u2019s hospitals already in North Carolina, including those operated by the University of North Carolina and Duke University health systems that are attached to their main campuses in the Triangle.",
      "The Apex location \u201cwill ensure that the Triangle remains a hub and a destination for the best pediatric scientists, teachers and clinicians \u2014 convenient to both medical school campuses,\u201d said Dr. Mary Klotman, dean of the Duke University medical school and a Duke Health executive.",
      "The health systems have said the hospital campus project could cost from $2 billion to $3 billion, with a massive private fundraising effort ahead.",
      "The project has already received $320 million from state legislators. The next state budget, still being negotiated by House and Senate Republicans that ultimately would head to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's desk, also could contain more project funds.",
      "Stein said in an interview Thursday that beyond the economic opportunity the project will spark, \u201cI\u2019m really excited about what the children\u2019s hospital means for children of North Carolina who are sick and in need of the best, most sophisticated, advanced medical interventions to live long, healthy lives.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have linked last week\u2019s European heat wave to human-caused climate change and estimate that climate change was responsible for 1,500 deaths",
      "WASHINGTON -- Human-caused climate change is responsible for killing about 1,500 people in last week's European heat wave, a first-of-its-kind rapid study found.",
      "Those 1,500 people \u201chave only died because of climate change, so they would not have died if it would not have been for our burning of oil, coal and gas in the last century,\u201d said study co-author Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College in London.",
      "Scientists at Imperial and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used peer-reviewed techniques to calculate that about 2,300 people in 12 cities likely died from the heat in last week's bout of high temperatures, with nearly two-thirds of them dying because of the extra degrees that climate change added to the natural summer warmth.",
      "Past rapid attribution studies have not gone beyond evaluating climate change's role in meteorological effects such as extra heat, flooding or drought. This study goes a step further in directly connecting coal, oil and natural gas use to people dying.",
      "\u201cHeat waves are silent killers and their health impact is very hard to measure,\u2033 said co-author Gary Konstantinoudis, a biostatistician at Imperial College. \u201dPeople do not understand the actual mortality toll of heat waves and this is because (doctors, hospitals and governments) do not report heat as an underlying cause of death\u201d and instead attribute it to heart or lung or other organ problems.",
      "Of the 1,500 deaths attributed to climate change, the study found more than 1,100 were people 75 or older.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s summer, so it\u2019s sometimes hot,\" study lead author Ben Clarke of Imperial College said in a Tuesday news conference. \u201dThe influence of climate change has pushed it up by several degrees and what that does is it brings certain groups of people more into dangerous territory and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. That\u2019s what we really want to highlight here. For some people it\u2019s still warm fine weather but for now a huge sector of the population it's more dangerous.\"",
      "Researchers looked at June 23 to July 2 in London; Paris; Frankfurt, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; Zagreb, Croatia; Athens, Greece; Barcelona, Spain; Madrid; Lisbon, Portugal; Rome; Milan and Sassari, Italy. They found that except in Lisbon, the extra warmth from greenhouse gases added 2 to 4 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) to what would have been a more natural heat wave. London got the most at nearly 4 degrees (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Climate change only added about a degree to Lisbon's peak temperature, the study calculated, mostly because of the Atlantic Ocean's moderating effect, Otto said.",
      "That extra climate-change-caused heat added the most extra deaths in Milan, Barcelona and Paris and the least in Sassari, Frankfort and Lisbon, the study found. The 1,500 figure is the middle of the range of overall climate-related death estimates that go from about 1,250 to around 1,700.",
      "Wednesday's study is not yet peer-reviewed. It is an extension of work done by an international team of scientists who do rapid attribution studies to search for global warming\u2019s fingerprints in the growing number of extreme weather events worldwide, and combine that with long-established epidemiological research that examines death trends that differ from what's considered normal.",
      "Researchers compared what the thermometers read last week to what computer simulations say would have happened in a world without planet-warming greenhouse gases from fossil fuel use. Health researchers then compared estimates \u2014 there are no solid figures yet \u2014 for heat deaths in what just happened to what heat deaths would be expected for each city without those extra degrees of warmth.",
      "There are long-established formulas that calculate excess deaths differing from normal based on location, demographics, temperatures and other factors and those are used, Otto and Konstantinoudis said. And health researchers take into account many variables like smoking and chronic diseases, so it's comparing similar people except for temperature so they know that's what's to blame, Konstantinoudis said.",
      "Studies in 2021 generally linked excess heat deaths to human-caused climate change and carbon emissions, but not specific events like last week's hot spell. A 2023 study in Nature Medicine estimated that since 2015, for every degree Celsius the temperature rises in Europe, there's an extra 18,547 summer heat deaths.",
      "Studies like Wednesday's are \u201cending the guessing game on the health harms from continued burning of fossil fuels,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, director of the Center for Health, Energy and Environmental Research at the University of Wisconsin. He was not part of the research but said it \u201ccombined the most up-to-date climate and health methods and found that every fraction of a degree of warming matters regarding extreme heat waves.\u201d",
      "Dr. Courtney Howard, a Canadian emergency room physician and chair of the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said, \u201cStudies like this help us see that reducing fossil fuel use is health care.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday that the national case count surpassed 2019, when there were 1,274 cases for the year and the country almost lost its status of having eliminated the vaccine-preventable illness. That could happen this year if the virus has nonstop spread for 12 months.",
      "This year's outbreaks, some of them interconnected, started five months ago in undervaccinated communities in West Texas. Three people have died \u2014 two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico \u2014 and dozens of people have been hospitalized. Public health experts maintain the true case count may be higher than state health departments have confirmed.",
      "North America has three other major measles outbreaks, with 2,966 cases in Chihuahua state, Mexico, 2,223 cases in Ontario, Canada and 1,230 in Alberta, Canada. Twelve other states have current confirmed outbreaks of three or more people \u2014 Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Utah \u2014 and four other states saw their outbreaks end.",
      "The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after two doses.",

      "The CDC identified 22 outbreaks in 2019, the largest being two separate clusters in New York \u2014 412 in New York state and 702 in New York City. These were linked because as measles was spreading through close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities, the CDC said.",
      "It's a similar situation in North America this year, where the Canada, Mexico and Texas outbreaks stem from large Mennonite communities in the regions. Mennonite churches do not formally discourage vaccination, though more conservative Mennonite communities historically have low vaccination rates and a distrust of government.",
      "A recent study found childhood vaccination rates against measles fell after the COVID-19 pandemic in nearly 80% of the more than 2,000 U.S. counties with available data, including in states that are battling outbreaks this year.",
      "Only 92.7% of kindergarteners in the U.S. had the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in the 2023-2024 school year, below the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks. In Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the Texas outbreak, only 82% of kindergarteners were up-to-date with MMR vaccines.",
      "State and federal leaders have for years kept funding stagnant for local public health departments' vaccination programs that are tasked with reversing the trend.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing with measles is a little bit of a \u2018canary in a coal mine,'\" said Lauren Gardner, leader of Johns Hopkins University's independent measles and COVID tracking databases. \"It\u2019s indicative of a problem that we know exists with vaccination attitudes in this county and just, I think, likely to get worse.\u201d",

      "Phay and her partner have two daughters, and they barely make ends meet. Determined not to have more children, she went to a health worker in her village, but contraception pills, implants and condoms had run out. Phay trekked for hours on red clay roads to the nearest clinic, but they had no contraceptives either.",
      "She did not know it, but her mission was doomed from the beginning. Just weeks before, U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly suspended most foreign aid through the U.S. Agency for International Development, which paid for medications in Liberia's public clinics.",
      "Tenacious and outspoken, Phay repeated the trip four times. Then she got pregnant.",
      "\u201cI'm suffering,\u201d she said, with daughter Pauline crying in her arms. \u201cI have this little child on my back, and the other child in my stomach is suffering.\" She must continue farming throughout her pregnancy, she said, or \"I will not eat.\u201d",
      "After she got pregnant she had to wean Pauline off breastfeeding, she said, and the girl became so badly malnourished that she almost died. The U.S. cuts left no therapeutic food to give her, and she is still ill.",
      "Phay is among millions across Africa who have seen their lives upended after the U.S. aid cuts. In Liberia, the American support made up almost 2.6% of the gross national income, the highest percentage anywhere in the world, according to the Center for Global Development.",
      "\u201cThe impact of USAID in Liberia cannot be overstated,\u201d said Richlue O. Burphy, who worked for USAID projects for over a decade and manages the National Lottery, a government body. \u201cEverywhere you go, you see the USAID (signs). And almost all the government institutions ... had some kind of USAID partnership.\u201d",
      "The sense of betrayal runs deep in Liberia, established in the early 1800s with the aim of relocating freed slaves and free-born Black people from the United States. The political system is modeled on that of the U.S., along with its flag. Liberians often refer to the U.S. as their \u201cbig brother.\u201d",
      "Liberia was one of the first countries to receive USAID support, starting in 1961. Its officials thought they would be spared from Trump\u2019s cuts because of the countries' close relationship.",
      "Following civil wars and an Ebola epidemic, Liberia's survival has depended largely on foreign aid, mainly from the U.S. and the World Bank. Despite abundant natural wealth, six out of 10 Liberians live in poverty, according to the World Bank, and Liberia is among the world's 10 poorest nations.",
      "The aid cuts pose \u201ca serious challenge,\u201d especially for the healthcare system, Deputy Finance Minister Dehpue Y. Zuo, responsible for drafting the development budget, told The Associated Press. To make sure the system stays afloat, he said, \"we have to take a dramatic switch to see where we will be cutting funding for other areas.\u201d",
      "Liberia received an average of $527.6 million in aid annually between 2014 and 2023, according to the finance ministry. This year, Liberia was supposed to receive $443 million, but the total estimated impact of the cuts is $290 million \u2014 essentially what hadn't been disbursed yet.",
      "USAID funding built schools and health clinics, provided training for teachers and doctors and gave scholarships for study in the U.S. It supported small-scale farmers and paid for school meals.",
      "But most of the U.S. funding went to Liberia's health system, making up 48% of its budget. It funded malaria control, maternal health programs, HIV/AIDS treatment and community health programs. It financed hundreds of health projects run by aid groups.",
      "Now in Bong county, where Phay lives, medicine shelves in health clinics are almost empty. The USAID-funded ambulance cannot function because there is no money for fuel. Hospitals are running out of hand sanitizer and gloves. Training for medical staff has stopped, and community health workers have not been paid in months.",
      "Moses K. Banyan, head of the nearby CB Dunbar Hospital, described the U.S. cuts as \u201cbeyond a shock.\u201d He worried about the future, especially now that Bong county has begun to see a handful of mpox cases spread from neighboring Sierra Leone.",
      "Warning of the cuts could have helped in finding options, he said. \u201cBut it's like you were sleeping, you woke up and you were told: \u2018Hey, leave this house.\u2019\u201d",
      "The withdrawal of U.S. support is an opportunity for others, especially China, experts and officials said. Chinese companies have been operating Liberia\u2019s gold mines, building roads and training aid workers. Chinese beer is sold alongside local brands. Many Liberians who would have sent children to universities in the U.S. are now choosing China.",
      "Last month, China opened a cardiology wing in the capital\u2019s main hospital, which is named after John F. Kennedy but was commonly referred to as \u201cJust For Killing\u201d because of its scarce resources, even before the U.S. cuts.",
      "\u201cThere are gaps to be filled, and that cannot be covered by the government of Liberia,\u201d said Zuo, the deputy finance minister. \u201cWe are open door to the rest of the world, including the United States.\u201d",
      "In Phay's village of Sarworlor, community health worker Alice Togbah still wears her USAID vest though she hasn't been paid in months. She has no more malaria medication for children. She is running out of cough medicine and diarrhea treatment.",
      "A 4-year-old resident, Promise, got malaria a few days ago. Her mother, Grace Morris, obtained only a limited number of malaria tablets at the nearest clinic because of the U.S. cuts. Now they are finished, and the child still feels ill.",
      "\u201cChildren die from malaria here,\u201d she said. Last year, her neighbor's son died because he did not get medication on time.",
      "Morris and other women also seek contraceptives. Liberia in recent years made strides in bringing down teenage pregnancy rates and maternal mortality rates.",
      "For women in traditional, conservative communities, access to contraceptives meant reclaiming some control over their lives.",
      "\u201cIf ... my man touches me, I cannot say no because I need to satisfy him,\u201d Phay said. \u201cBut if I have no medicine, I will get pregnant.\u201d",
      "Her 9-year-old daughter, also named Promise, is living in the capital, Monrovia, with her aunt. Phay wants her to finish school and have a different life from hers.",

      "A Chinese national has been arrested on suspicion of hacking into several U.S. universities\u2019 computer systems to steal COVID-19-related research",
      "HOUSTON -- A Chinese national has been arrested on suspicion of hacking into several U.S. universities' computer systems to steal COVID-19-related research, authorities announced on Tuesday.",
      "Xu Zewei is charged in a nine-count indictment in the Southern District of Texas for his alleged involvement in computer intrusions between February 2020 and June 2021. Another Chinese national, Zhang Yu, was also charged in the indictment.",
      "Xu was arrested on Thursday in Italy and is awaiting extradition to the U.S. Authorities said Zhang remains at large.",
      "Xu and others are accused of targeting and hacking several U.S.-based universities, immunologists, and virologists conducting research into COVID\u201119 vaccines, treatment and testing, according to court documents.",
      "\u201cThe hacking of these American universities is not just a violation of intellectual property rights. It\u2019s an attack on American scientific innovation,\u201d Nicholas J. Ganjei, the Houston-based U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas, said at a news conference.",
      "Authorities declined to name the universities that had been targeted but said two were located in the Southern District of Texas.",
      "Authorities allege that officers of China\u2019s Ministry of State Security, or MSS, directed Xu and others to conduct the hacking.",
      "A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.",
      "Authorities allege Xu and Zhang were part of a group known as HAFNIUM, that targeted over 60,000 U.S. entities, successfully victimizing more than 12,700 in order to steal sensitive information. One of those targeted was a law firm with offices worldwide, including in Washington, D.C.",
      "The charges against Xu include wire fraud, obtaining information by unauthorized access to protected computers and aggravated identity theft. The wire fraud charges carry sentences of up to 20 years in prison.",
      "Tuesday's announcement comes after the Justice Department earlier this month said two Chinese nationals had been charged with spying inside the United States on behalf of Beijing, including by taking photographs of a naval base.",

      "Doctors groups and public health organizations are suing the U.S. government over the decision to stop recommending COVID-19 vaccinations for most children and pregnant women",
      "NEW YORK -- A coalition of doctors groups and public health organizations sued the U.S. government on Monday over the decision to stop recommending COVID-19 vaccinations for most children and pregnant women.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Public Health Association and four other groups \u2014 along with an unnamed pregnant doctor who works in a hospital \u2014 filed the lawsuit in federal court in Boston.",
      "U.S. health officials, following infectious disease experts' guidance, previously urged annual COVID-19 shots for all Americans ages 6 months and older. But in late May, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced he was removing COVID-19 shots from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women.",
      "A number of health experts decried the move as confusing and accused Kennedy of disregarding the scientific review process that has been in place for decades \u2014 in which experts publicly review current medical evidence and hash out the pros and cons of policy changes.",
      "The new lawsuit repeats those concerns, alleging that Kennedy and other political appointees at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have flouted federal procedures and systematically attempted to mislead the public.",
      "\u201cThis administration is an existential threat to vaccination in America, and those in charge are only just getting started,\u201d said Richard H. Hughes IV, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs. \u201cIf left unchecked, Secretary Kennedy will accomplish his goal of ridding the United States of vaccines, which would unleash a wave of preventable harm on our nation\u2019s children.\u201d",

      "Prices are falling for the popular obesity treatments Wegovy and Zepbound, but steady access to the drugs remains challenging.",
      "The medications still amount to around $500 per month for those without insurance \u2014 out of reach for many patients. And even for people with insurance, coverage remains uneven.",
      "\u201cThe medications should be available, the question is at what price and can people sustain that,\u201d said Matt Maciejewski, a Duke University professor who studies obesity treatment coverage.",
      "Doctors say the situation forces them to get creative in treating patients, but there\u2019s hope that prices may fall more in the future.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity.",
      "Zepbound brought in $2.3 billion in U.S. sales during this year\u2019s first quarter, making it one of drugmaker Eli Lilly\u2019s best sellers.",
      "Novo Nordisk says Wegovy has about 200,000 weekly prescriptions in the U.S., where it brought in nearly $1.9 billion in first-quarter sales.",
      "The benefits consultant Mercer says more businesses with 500 or more employees are adding coverage of the injected drugs for their workers and family members.",
      "And Novo says 85% of its patients who have coverage in the U.S. pay $25 or less per month.",
      "Plus some patients with diabetes can get coverage of the GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Mounjaro from Novo and Lilly that are approved to treat that condition.",
      "But most state and federally funded Medicaid programs don\u2019t cover the drugs for obesity and neither does Medicare, the federal program mainly for people age 65 and older.",
      "Even the plans that cover the drugs often pay only a portion of the bill, exposing patients to hundreds of dollars in monthly costs, said Dr. Beverly Tchang.",
      "Drugmakers offer help with these out-of-pocket costs, but that assistance can be limited.",
      "\u201cCoverage is not the same as access,\u201d said Tchang, a New York-based doctor who serves as a paid advisor to both Novo and Lilly.",
      "Bill-payers like employers are nervous about drugs that might be used by a lot of people indefinitely.",
      "Some big employers have dropped coverage of the drugs due to the expense. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, also are starting to pick one brand over the other as they negotiate deals with the drugmakers.",
      "One of the nation\u2019s largest PBMs, run by CVS Health, dropped Zepbound from its national formulary, or list of covered drugs, on July 1 in favor of Wegovy.",
      "That forced Tchang to figure out another treatment plan for several patients, many of whom took Zepbound because it made them less nauseous.",
      "Dr. Courtney Younglove\u2019s office sends prospective patients a video link showing them how to check their insurer\u2019s website for coverage of the drugs before they visit.",
      "\u201cThen some of them just cancel their appointment because they don\u2019t have coverage,\u201d the Overland Park, Kansas, doctor said.",
      "Compounding pharmacies and other entities were allowed to make off-brand, cheaper copies of Wegovy and Zepbound when there was a shortage of the drugs. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined earlier this year that the shortage had ended.",
      "That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.",
      "The health care company Hims & Hers Health offers compounded doses of semaglutide, the drug behind Wegovy, that adjust dose levels to help patients manage side effects. Hims says these plans start at $165 a month for 12 months, with customers paying in full upfront.",
      "It\u2019s a contentious issue. Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.",
      "Novo recently ended a short-lived partnership with Hims to sell Wegovy because the telehealth company continued compounding. Novo says the compounded versions of its drug put patient safety at risk because ingredients are made by foreign suppliers not monitored by US regulators.",
      "Hims says it checks all ingredients to make sure they meet U.S. quality and safety standards. It also uses a third-party lab to verify that a drug's strength is accurately labeled.",
      "Both drugmakers are selling most of their doses for around $500 a month to people without insurance, a few hundred dollars less than some initial prices.",
      "Even so, that expense would eat up about 14% of the average annual per person income in the U.S., which is around $43,000.",
      "There are some factors that may suppress prices over time. Both companies are developing pill versions of their treatments. Those could hit the market in the next year or so, which might drive down prices for the older, injectable doses.",
      "Younglove said some of her patients save as much as 15% by getting their doses shipped from a pharmacy in Canada. They used to get them from an Israeli pharmacy until the Canadians dropped their prices.",
      "She says competition like this, plus the introduction of pill versions, will pressure U.S. prices.",
      "\u201cI think price wars are going to drive it down,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we are in the early stages. I have hope.\u201d",

      "Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad marked a historic milestone as he turned 100",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad marked a historic milestone as he turned 100 on Thursday, calling the moment \u201cquite frightening\u201d without showing signs of slowing down.",
      "A towering figure in Malaysian politics, Mahathir is known for his transformative and at times controversial leadership. First serving as the nation's fourth prime minister from 1981 to 2003, and then returning as its seventh from 2018 to 2020, Mahathir has been the country\u2019s longest-serving and oldest-serving prime minister.",
      "Despite the weight of the century mark, Mahathir remains remarkably active. After birthday wishes from his family, he turned up early for work at his Putrajaya office in his signature safari suit.",
      "\"I\u2019d like to thank all those who sent cakes, flowers, letters and for turning up to wish me a happy 100th birthday. To be 100 is quite frightening,\u201d he said in a special live podcast to mark the occasion.",
      "During the podcast, Mahathir also reflected on key moments in Malaysia\u2019s history, voiced solidarity with the Palestinian people and spoke about the rise of China.",
      "Mahathir, who previously attributed his longevity to neither smoking nor overeating and exercising his brain, also offered personal insights on aging. Although he has a history of heart disease, including two bypass surgeries, Mahathir said staying mentally and physically active has kept him going.",
      "\u201cI have always been active. I cannot understand people wanting to rest. I mean, you take a holiday, you do something, you go on a holiday that is doing something. But some people retire, and they want to rest. What is the meaning of rest? You do nothing?\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cSo long as I can function, I want to function. I want to behave almost as if I am not getting old. I try to live the same life that I lived when I was younger. I work, I come to the office, I attend functions and all that. And I think being active is what keeps me alive,\u201d he added.",
      "Mahathir acknowledged he was fortunate not to have been struck by any fatal diseases.",
      "\u201cI didnt make an effort to live this long but I look after my health,\" he said, describing his milestone birthday as just a \u201cnormal day.\u201d",
      "During his first 22-year term, Malaysia transformed into a modern economy, but Mahathir used stifling political control to hold power and silence dissent. He came out of retirement to challenge his former party over a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal, forming an alliance with old foes that produced a 2018 election victory hailed as a triumph for democracy.",
      "When he returned to power at age 92, he was hailed as a hero who ousted a corrupt government and led Malaysia\u2019s first opposition victory since independence from Britain in 1957. But that aura wore off.",
      "His government collapsed during infighting after just 22 months and in opposition Mahathir became a divisive voice advocating Malay supremacy, working with an Islamist party he had long denounced.",
      "After his birthday podcast, Mahathir met more well-wishers at his office. While there was no grand celebration, staff brought out a small cake and sang a birthday song, his aide Sufi Yusoff said.",
      "True to form, Mahathir ended the moment with his trademark discipline: \u201cOk, back to work!\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Houthi rebels in Yemen have launched a violent new wave of attacks on ships in the Red Sea, sinking two vessels and killing crew members",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- In just days, Yemen's Houthi rebels have begun a new, more violent campaign of attacks targeting ships in the Red Sea, sinking two of them and killing some of their crew.",
      "The assaults represent the latest chapter of the rebels' campaign against shipping over the Israel-Hamas war. They also come as Yemen's nearly decadelong war drags on in the Arab world's poorest country, without any sign of stopping.",
      "Here's what to know about the Houthis, Yemen and their ongoing attacks.",
      "The Houthis are members of Islam\u2019s minority Shiite Zaydi sect, which ruled Yemen for 1,000 years until 1962. They battled Yemen's central government for years before sweeping down from their northern stronghold in Yemen and seizing the capital, Sanaa, in 2014. That launched a grinding war still technically being waged in the country today. A Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 to try to restore Yemen\u2019s exiled, internationally recognized government to power.",
      "Years of bloody, inconclusive fighting against the Saudi-led coalition settled into a stalemated proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, causing widespread hunger and misery in Yemen, the Arab world\u2019s poorest country. The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.",
      "A ceasefire that technically ended in October 2022 is still largely being honored. Saudi Arabia and the rebels have done some prisoner swaps, and a Houthi delegation was invited to high-level peace talks in Riyadh in September 2023 as part of a wider d\u00e9tente the kingdom has reached with Iran. While they reported \u201cpositive results,\" there is still no permanent peace.",
      "Iran long has backed the Houthis. Tehran routinely denies arming the rebels, despite physical evidence, numerous seizures and experts tying the weapons back to Iran. That\u2019s likely because Tehran wants to avoid sanctions for violating a United Nations arms embargo on the Houthis.",
      "The Houthis now form the strongest group within Iran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance.\u201d Others like Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant group Hamas have been decimated by Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas that sparked Israel\u2019s war of attrition in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Iran also is reeling after Israel launched a 12-day war against the country and the U.S. struck Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "The Houthis also have seen their regional profile raise as they have attacked Israel, as many in the Arab world remain incensed by the suffering Palestinians in the Gaza Strip face.",
      "The Houthis have been launching missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group\u2019s leadership has described as an effort to end Israel\u2019s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Between November 2023 and December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two and killing four sailors. Their campaign has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.",
      "The last Houthi attack, targeting U.S. warships escorting commercial ships, happened in early December. A ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war began in January and held until March. The U.S. then launched a broad assault against the rebels that ended weeks later when Trump said the rebels pledged to stop attacking ships.",
      "Since then, the Houthis have continued occasional missile attacks targeting Israel, but they hadn't attacked ships until this past weekend. Shipping through the Red Sea, while still lower than normal, had increased in recent weeks.",
      "The attacks on the two ships, the Magic Seas and the Eternity C, represent a new level of violence being employed by the Houthis.",
      "Experts have referred to the assaults as being complex in nature, involving armed rebels first racing out to the vessels in the Red Sea, firing small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. They then have used anti-ship missiles and both aerial and sea drones loaded with explosives to attack the ships.",
      "This coordinated attack sank two vessels in just a matter of days, doubling the number of ships they have sunk. There also is a growing fear the attack on the Eternity C may have been the rebels' deadliest at sea as crew members remain missing.",
      "The attacks also signal that Israeli and American airstrikes have not stripped the rebels of their ability to launch attacks.",
      "For the Houthis, attacking commercial ships remains far easier than targeting warships as those vessels don't have air defense systems. Instead, some carry a few armed guards able to shoot at attackers or approaching drones. Downing a drone remains difficult and shooting down a missile is impossible with their weaponry.",
      "Armed guards also typically are more trained for dealing with piracy and will spray fire hoses at approaching small boats or ring a bridge with cyclone wire to stop attackers from climbing aboard. The Houthis, however, have experience doing helicopter-borne assaults and likely could overwhelm a private security detail, which often is just a three-member team aboard a commercial vessel.",
      "To hear it from the Houthis, the new attack campaign \u201crepresents a qualitative shift in the course of the open battle in support of Gaza.\" Their SABA news agency said Israel commits \u201cdaily massacres against civilians in Gaza and relies on sea lanes to finance its aggression and maintain its siege.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis stance, which is not content with condemnation or statements, is also advancing with direct military action, in a clear effort to support the Palestinians on various fronts,\u201d the rebels said.",
      "However, the rebels stopped their attacks in late December as Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire. The Houthis formally suspended their attacks, though they said ships or companies calling on Israeli ports would remain possible targets.",
      "The rebels also may have reconstituted their forces following the grinding American airstrikes that targeted them. They have not acknowledged their materiel losses from the attacks, though the U.S. has said it dropped more than 2,000 munitions on more than 1,000 targets.",
      "There likely is an international and domestic consideration, as well. Abroad, a new possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war \u2014 as well as the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran\u2019s battered nuclear program \u2014 remain in the balance. The Houthis in the past have been a cudgel used by Tehran, though experts debate just how much influence Tehran wields in picking targets for the rebels.",
      "At home, the Houthis have faced growing discontent over their rule as Yemen's economy is in tatters and they have waged a campaign of detaining of U.N. officials and aid workers. Resuming their attacks can provide the Houthis something to show those at home to bolster their control.",

    "story": [
      "A new U.N. AIDS agency report says the sudden withdrawal of U.S. funding has caused a \u201csystemic shock\u201d to the global effort against AIDS and HIV",
      "LONDON -- Years of American-led investment into AIDS programs has reduced the number of people killed by the disease to the lowest levels seen in more than three decades, and provided life-saving medicines for some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable.",
      "But in the last six months, the sudden withdrawal of U.S. money has caused a \u201csystemic shock,\u201d U.N. officials warned, adding that if the funding isn\u2019t replaced, it could lead to more than 4 million AIDS-related deaths and 6 million more HIV infections by 2029.",
      "\u201cThe current wave of funding losses has already destabilized supply chains, led to the closure of health facilities, left thousands of health clinics without staff, set back prevention programs, disrupted HIV testing efforts and forced many community organizations to reduce or halt their HIV activities,\u201d UNAIDS said in a report released Thursday.",
      "UNAIDS also said that it feared other major donors might also scale back their support, reversing decades of progress against AIDS worldwide \u2014 and that the strong multilateral cooperation is in jeopardy because of wars, geopolitical shifts and climate change.",
      "The $4 billion that the United States pledged for the global HIV response for 2025 disappeared virtually overnight in January when U.S. President Donald Trump ordered that all foreign aid be suspended and later moved to shutter the U.S. AID agency.",
      "Andrew Hill, an HIV expert at the University of Liverpool who is not connected to the United Nations, said that while Trump is entitled to spend U.S. money as he sees fit, \u201cany responsible government would have given advance warning so countries could plan,\u201d instead of stranding patients in Africa when clinics were closed overnight.",
      "The U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, was launched in 2003 by U.S. President George W. Bush, the biggest-ever commitment by any country focused on a single disease.",
      "UNAIDS called the program a \u201clifeline\u201d for countries with high HIV rates, and said that it supported testing for 84.1 million people, treatment for 20.6 million, among other initiatives. According to data from Nigeria, PEPFAR also funded 99.9% of the country\u2019s budget for medicines taken to prevent HIV.",
      "In 2024, there were about 630,000 AIDS-related deaths worldwide, per a UNAIDS estimate \u2014 the figure has remained about the same since 2022 after peaking at about 2 million deaths in 2004.",
      "Even before the U.S. funding cuts, progress against curbing HIV was uneven. UNAIDS said that half of all new infections are in sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Tom Ellman, of the charity Doctors Without Borders, said that while some poorer countries were now moving to fund more of their own HIV programs, it would be impossible to fill the gap left by the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere's nothing we can do that will protect these countries from the sudden, vicious withdrawal of support from the U.S.,\u201d said Ellman, director of Doctors Without Borders' South Africa Medical Unit.",
      "Experts also fear another loss: data. The U.S. paid for most HIV surveillance in African countries, including hospital, patient and electronic records, all of which has now abruptly ceased, according to Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University.",
      "\u201cWithout reliable data about how HIV is spreading, it will be incredibly hard to stop it,\u201d he said.",
      "The uncertainty comes as a twice-yearly injectable could end HIV, as studies published last year showed that the drug from pharmaceutical maker Gilead was 100% effective in preventing the virus.",
      "At a launch event Thursday, South Africa's health minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the country would \u201cmove mountains and rivers to make sure every adolescent girl who needs it will get it,\u201d saying that the continent's past dependence upon US aid was \u201cscary.\u201d",
      "Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, called Yeztugo, a move that should have been a \u201cthreshold moment\u201d for stopping the AIDS epidemic, said Peter Maybarduk of the advocacy group Public Citizen.",

      "Thousands of fans have flocked to Thailand's Khao Kheow Open Zoo to celebrate the first birthday of Moo Deng, the baby pygmy hippo that has become a social media sensation",
      "CHONBURI, Thailand -- Thousands of excited fans flocked to a Thai zoo on Thursday to celebrate the first birthday of Moo Deng, the adorable baby pygmy hippo that has become a social media sensation.",
      "The Khao Kheow Open Zoo was overrun with Moo Deng's fans on the first of four days of activities marking the hippo's birthday. Children under 12 years old can enter the zoo, which is about a two hour drive from the capital Bangkok, for free throughout the extravaganza.",
      "Many of Moo Deng\u2019s fans flew miles to see her.",
      "Among them was Molly Swindall, who traveled from New York for the celebrations. She was seen handing a tray of food to a zoo keeper for Moo Deng\u2019s breakfast, which the baby hippo and her mother Jona quickly devoured.",
      "\u201cEverything I was seeing started to be Moo Deng and I just loved her so much and decided, you know what, I have three or four days off of work,\" said Swindall, \"I can make it work to fly to Thailand. I will only be there for about 30 hours, but that\u2019s enough to go see Moo Deng. And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d",
      "By Thursday afternoon, the number of visitors reached 12,000, zoo director Narongwit Chodchoy said. Despite the noise of visitors calling out for her attention, Moo Deng appeared peaceful as she took a dip in a pond in her enclosure.",
      "Fans took pictures of the baby hippo on their cameras or cell phones and sang \u201cHappy birthday\u201d as her birthday cake, made of a variety of fruits and vegetables, was placed near the pond.",
      "\u201cMoo Deng is my happy pill, and she\u2019s my energy pill, my curing pill. She\u2019s my vitamin!\u201d said Thea Chavez, who flew in from Houston, Texas.",
      "Another fan from neighboring Malaysia, Jennifer Tang, leaned over the enclosure to take pictures.",
      "\u201cShe makes me happy. Whenever I\u2019m stressed at work I pull up photos of Moo Deng,\u201d Tang said. \"So my whole office knows that I\u2019m here .... They let me take a week off.\u201d",
      "The zoo held online auctions to celebrate Moo Deng's birthday, with photos, footprints and a food container on offer to raise funds for all the animals under their care.",
      "They also held an auction for the honor of sponsoring her birthday cake, which went for 100,000 baht ($3,065.)",
      "Moo Deng soared to stardom shortly after she was born, largely thanks to her keeper Atthapon Nundee who shared adorable pictures and videos of the baby hippo on social media. Atthapon keeps Moo Deng's fans updated with moments of her squirming as he tries to wash her, biting him as he tries to play, or calmly closing her eyes as he rubs her belly.",
      "Moo Deng, which literally means \u201cbouncy pork\u201d in Thai, is a type of meatball. The name was chosen by fans via a poll on social media. It matches the names of her other siblings: Moo Toon (stewed pork) and Moo Waan (sweet pork). There is also a common hippo at the zoo named Kha Moo (stewed pork leg).",
      "The Khao Kheow Open Zoo saw spikes of visitors since shortly after Moo Deng was born. But Narongwit said the number of visitors to the zoo has somewhat dropped since the height of Moo Deng\u2019s fame. He said the zoo has had about 2,000 visitors during a weekday and around 5,000 during weekends over the past few months, about half the numbers it saw at its peak.",
      "\u201cMoo Deng is a representative of all wild animals, and she helps everyone understand the roles of zoos,\u201d Narongwit told The Associated Press. \u201cShe speaks for all nearly extinct animals, and turns people's attention to their conservation.\u201d",
      "The zoo sits on 800 hectares (almost 2,000 acres) of land and is home to more than 2,000 animals.",
      "It runs breeder programs for many endangered species including the pygmy hippopotamus. The species is native to West Africa, where it is threatened by poaching and loss of habitat. There are only 2,000 to 3,000 left in the wild.",

      "The Houthis released dramatic footage of the sinking of the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned Eternity C, which the rebels targeted with gunfire and explosive drones for hours, killing at least three crew members.",
      "The attack on the Eternity C, as well as the sinking of the bulk carrier Magic Seas after another attack Sunday, represent a new level of violence being employed by the Houthis after a months of holding their fire in a campaign they tie back to the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Meanwhile, a new possible ceasefire in that war \u2014 as well as the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran\u2019s battered nuclear program \u2014 remain in the balance. The Houthis said that they fired a missile at Israel on Thursday morning, which the Israeli military said that it intercepted.",
      "A statement from the European Union naval mission in the Red Sea said the crew of the Eternity C included 22 sailors, among them 21 Filipinos and one Russian, as well as a three-member security team. Rescuers on Wednesday recovered five Filipinos and one Indian.",

      "At least three people also were killed during the hourslong attack on the ship, the EU force previously said, and their nationalities weren't immediately known. That leaves a dozen unaccounted for.",
      "In footage released by the Houthis, a rebel can be purportedly heard on a VHF radio transmission offering those on board the ability to flee the sinking vessel. However, it wasn't clear if any more crew fled and what happened to them.",
      "The Houthis said in a statement that their forces \u201cresponded to rescue a number of the ship\u2019s crew, provide them with medical care and transport them to a safe location.\u201d The statement offered no details on the number of the crew, their condition or where they were.",

      "\u201cAfter killing their shipmates, sinking their ship and hampering rescue efforts, the Houthi terrorists have kidnapped many surviving crew members of the Eternity C,\u201d the embassy said. \u201cWe call for their immediate and unconditional safe release.\u201d",
      "The Houthis have held mariners in the past. After seizing a ship called the Galaxy Leader in November 2023, the rebels held the crew until January 2025.",

      "In an interview with The Associated Press, Director General of the International Organization for Migration Amy Pope said that an approach focused solely on border enforcement without addressing causes of migration was \u201cshort-sighted\u201d and could destabilize origin countries further.",
      "\u201cIf you want to manage irregular migration, then you need to make investments in stabilizing populations closer to where the migration begins,\u201d Pope said. \u201cIt is short-sighted to cut foreign assistance without identifying alternatives to make sure that populations are not on the move.\u201d",
      "Pope became the first woman to lead the IOM in 2023 after serving as a White House advisor on migration and homeland security under the Obama and Biden administrations. She spoke to the AP at an international conference in Rome supporting Ukrainian reconstruction.",
      "Her comments come as European countries shift toward stricter migration policies, with more funding for expanded deportation efforts and for transit countries to deter migrants.",
      "Lawmakers in Greece on Thursday were expected to adopt a proposal to halt asylum applications for all migrants traveling by sea from Libya, following a spike in arrivals.",
      "Pope singled out Syria as a concern, cautioning that premature repatriation could prove counterproductive.",
      "\u201cIf Syrians go home too quickly and they\u2019re facing further destabilization, further conflict, if their children aren\u2019t safe, if their homes are still destroyed and they have nowhere to go, that could actually backfire,\u201d she said.",
      "Pope noted that tougher U.S. border policies have already created ripple effects throughout Latin America.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a reversal of the flows. Not only are fewer people coming to the United States and Mexico border, more are actually heading south,\u201d she said, raising concerns about capacity and support for countries along alternative migration routes including Panama, Costa Rica and other Central American nations.",
      "The IOM chief was supportive of Italy\u2019s approach, which combines strict border measures with expanded legal migration channels. Italy plans to provide nearly 500,000 permits for non-EU workers, starting in 2026 and staggered over three years, working with employers to identify labor needs.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have enforcement on its own without addressing the pull factors that are encouraging migrants to come,\u201d Pope said, calling Italy\u2019s strategy an \u201cexperiment\u201d worth watching. \u201cWe encourage other governments to watch what\u2019s happening in this space closely.\u201d ___",

      "European leaders are urging private business and equity funds to not be afraid to invest in rebuilding Ukraine now even as Russia accelerates its war",
      "ROME -- European leaders urged private business and equity on Thursday to invest in rebuilding Ukraine now, even as Russia accelerates its war, as they opened an annual recovery conference with announcements of a new equity fund and public-private partnerships amid uncertainties of the U.S. commitment to Kyiv\u2019s defense.",
      "Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy kicked off the proceedings in Rome as Russia pounded Ukraine\u2019s capital with another major missile and drone attack overnight in some of the heaviest attacks on Kyiv in the more than three-year war.",
      "The conference is expected to finalize individual deals of guarantees and grants to unlock more than 10 billion euros (around $12 billion) in investments, Meloni said. The European Commission, for its part, announced the creation of the largest equity fund to date to support Ukraine, the European Flagship Fund for the Reconstruction of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThe message we want to send today to businesses is: Don\u2019t be afraid to invest to build and rebuild Ukraine,\u201d Meloni told the gathering of business, political and development representatives. \u201cThe reconstruction of Ukraine is not a risk. It\u2019s an investment in a nation that has shown more resilience than any other.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy, for his part, thanked those countries and companies that have already invested and warned that only friends would be welcome to rebuild: \u201cWe will only welcome true partners, those who are not helping Russia continue this war,\u201d he said, without naming specific nations",
      "He repeated his call for Russia\u2019s frozen assets, and not just the interest, to be used, and called again for a Marshall Plan-style coordinated reconstruction effort.",
      "Italian organizers said 100 official delegations were attending and 40 international organizations and development banks. But there were also 2,000 businesses, civil society and local Ukrainian governments sending representatives. They are participating in a trade fair, complete with booths, on the grounds of the ministerial-level meeting at Rome's funky new \u201cCloud\u201d conference center in the Fascist-era EUR neighborhood.",
      "It\u2019s the fourth such conference on Ukraine\u2019s recovery, with earlier editions in Lugano, Switzerland in 2022, London in 2023 and Berlin last year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s basically a platform where a lot of businesses, European businesses and Ukrainian businesses, meet up and network, where you can actually see this public-private partnership in action, because obviously public money is not enough to undertake this gigantic effort of restructuring a country,\u201d said Eleonora Tafuro Ambrosetti, senior research fellow at the Rome-based Institute for Studies of International Politics, or ISPI.",
      "The World Bank Group, European Commission and the United Nations have estimated that Ukraine\u2019s recovery after more than three years of war will cost $524 billion (\u20ac506 billion) over the next decade.",
      "Alexander Temerko, a Ukrainian-British businessman, said that the Rome conference was different from its predecessors, because it is focused on specific industries and issues, not just vague talk about the need to rebuild. The program includes practical workshops on such topics as \u201cde-risking\u201d investment, and panel discussions on investing in Ukraine's rare earth minerals, pharmaceutical and domestic defense industries.",
      "\u201cThis is the first conference which is considering particularly projects in the energy sector, the mining sector, the metallurgical sector, the infrastructure sector, the transport sector, which need to be restored in Ukraine and during the war especially,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the special particularity of this conference.\u201d",
      "In addition to Meloni and Zelenskyy, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof, European Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen, as well as economy and or foreign ministers from other European countries are coming.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron remained in Britain with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, but they and several of the participants of the Rome conference will participate in a videoconference call Thursday of the \u201ccoalition of the willing.\u201d These include countries willing to deploy troops to Ukraine to police any future peace agreement with Russia.",
      "Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, was in Rome and met with Zelenskyy on Wednesday. Zelenskyy, who also met with Pope Leo XIV, planned talks with other U.S. officials to discuss the expected adoption of a new U.S. sanctions package, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Wednesday in a statement on Telegram.",
      "It was a reference to a bill sponsored by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who are both in Rome, calling in part for a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that continue to buy Russian oil. The move would have huge ramifications for China and India, two economic behemoths that buy Russian oil.",
      "The success of the coalition of the willing's future operation hinges on U.S. backup with airpower or other military assistance, but the Trump administration has made no public commitment to provide support. And even current U.S. military support to Ukraine is in question.",
      "On Monday, Trump said that the U.S. would have to send more weapons to Ukraine, just days after Washington paused critical weapons deliveries to Kyiv amid uncertainty over the U.S. administration\u2019s commitment to Ukraine\u2019s defense. Trump\u2019s announcement came after he privately expressed frustration with Pentagon officials for announcing a pause in some deliveries last week, a move that he felt wasn\u2019t properly coordinated with the White House, according to three people familiar with the matter.",
      "Merz issued an impassioned plea to Washington in his opening remarks.",

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart will meet Thursday in Malaysia for what could be a testy conversation as tensions between the countries rise over Moscow\u2019s increasing attacks on Ukraine and questions about whether Russia's leader is serious about a peace deal.",
      "Rubio and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are to see each other in Kuala Lumpur, where both men are attending the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, which brings together all 10 ASEAN members and their most important diplomatic partners, including Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, the Europeans and the U.S.",
      "The meeting will be their second face-to-face encounter since Rubio took office, although they have spoken by phone several times. Their first meeting came in February in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as the Trump administration sought to test both Russia and Ukraine on their willingness to make peace.",
      "This one is set to take place shortly after the U.S. resumed some shipments of defensive weapons to Ukraine following a pause \u2014 ostensibly for the Pentagon to review domestic munitions stocks \u2014 that was cheered in Moscow.",
      "The resumption comes as Russia fires escalating air attacks on Ukraine and as U.S. President Donald Trump has become increasingly frustrated with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cPutin is not, he\u2019s not treating human beings right,\u201d Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, explaining the pause\u2019s reversal. \u201cIt\u2019s killing too many people. So we\u2019re sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I\u2019ve approved that.\u201d",
      "Rubio was also seeing other foreign ministers, including many whose countries face tariffs set to be imposed on Aug. 1. The tariff threat could overshadow the top diplomat\u2019s first official trip to Asia, just as the U.S. seeks to boost relations with Indo-Pacific nations to counter China\u2019s growing influence in the region.",
      "Rubio sought to assuage concerns as he held group talks with ASEAN foreign ministers.",
      "\u201cThe Indo Pacific, the region, remains a focal point of U.S. foreign policy,\u201d he told them. \u201cWhen I hear in the news that perhaps the United States or the world might be distracted by events in other parts of the planet, I would say distraction is impossible, because it is our strong view and the reality that this century and the story of next 50 years will largely be written here in this region.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese are relationships and partnerships that we intend to continue to build on without seeking the approval or the permission of any other actor in the region of the world,\u201d he said in an apparent reference to China.",
      "Trump notified several countries on Monday and Wednesday that they will face higher tariffs if they don\u2019t make trade deals with the U.S. Among them are eight of ASEAN's 10 members.",
      "U.S. State Department officials said tariffs and trade won't be Rubio\u2019s focus during the meetings, which Trump\u2019s Republican administration hopes will prioritize maritime safety and security in the South China Sea, where China has become increasingly aggressive toward its small neighbors, as well as combating transnational crime.",
      "But Rubio may be hard-pressed to avoid the tariff issue that has vexed some of Washington's closest allies and partners in Asia, including Japan and South Korea and most members of ASEAN, which Trump says would face 25% tariffs if there's no deal.",
      "Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has warned that global trade is being weaponized to coerce weaker nations. Speaking at an ASEAN foreign ministers\u2019 meeting on Wednesday, Anwar urged the bloc to strengthen regional trade and reduce reliance on external powers.",
      "Rubio\u2019s \u201ctalking points on the China threat will not resonate with officials whose industries are being battered by 30-40% tariffs,\u201d said Danny Russel, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific during the Obama administration.",
      "When Anwar said \"ASEAN will approach challenges \u2018as a united bloc\u2019 \u2014 he wasn\u2019t talking about Chinese coercion but about U.S. tariffs,\u201d Russel noted.",
      "Among ASEAN states, Trump has so far announced tariffs on almost all of the 10 members of the bloc, which would face a 25% tariff that could specifically hit its electronics and electrical product exports to the United States.",
      "Trade Minister Zafrul Aziz said Wednesday that while Malaysia is ready to resume tariff negotiations, it wouldn't cross its red lines, including U.S. requests for changes to government procurement, halal certification, medical standards and digital taxes.",
      "Trump sent tariff letters to two more ASEAN members Wednesday: Brunei, whose imports would be taxed at 25%, and the Philippines at 20%. Others hit this week include Cambodia at 36%, Indonesia at 32%, Laos at 40%, Malaysia at 25%, Myanmar at 40% and Thailand at 36%.",
      "Vietnam recently agreed to a trade deal for a 20% tariffs on its imports, while Singapore still faces a 10% tariff that was imposed in April. The Trump administration has courted most Southeast Asian nations in a bid to blunt or at least temper China\u2019s push to dominate the region.",
      "In Kuala Lumpur, Rubio also will likely come face-to-face with China's foreign minister during his brief visit of roughly 36 hours.",
      "Russel noted that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is a veteran of such gatherings and \u201cfluent in ASEAN principles and conventions,\u201d while Rubio \u201cis a rookie trying to sell an \u2018America First\u2019 message to a deeply skeptical audience.\u201d",
      "Issues with China, including on trade, human rights, the militarization of the South China Sea and China's support for Russia in Ukraine, remain substantial.",
      "U.S. officials continue to accuse China of resupplying and revamping Russia\u2019s military industrial sector, allowing it to produce additional weapons that it can use to attack Ukraine.",
      "Earlier on Thursday, Rubio signed a memorandum on civilian nuclear energy memorandum with Malaysia\u2019s foreign minister, which will pave the way for negotiations on a more formal nuclear cooperation deal, known as a 123 agreement after the section of U.S. law that allows them.",
      "Such agreements allow the U.S. and U.S. companies to work with and invest in civilian energy nuclear programs in other countries under strict supervision.",

      "Four months after his release, South Korea\u2019s disgraced former President Yoon Suk Yeol has been sent back to a detention center after a Seoul court issued a warrant for his arrest",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Four months after his release, South Korea\u2019s disgraced former President Yoon Suk Yeol was sent back to a detention center after a Seoul court issued a warrant for his arrest Thursday.",
      "Yoon\u2019s brief, ill-fated imposition of martial law on Dec. 3 led to his indictment on charges that he directed a rebellion, which is punishable by life imprisonment or death. Prompted by concerns he might destroy evidence, Yoon\u2019s arrest could mark the start of a prolonged period in custody as investigators pursue additional charges.",
      "Yoon defended his martial law decree as a necessary step to quash \u201canti-state\u201d liberal opponents, accusing them of abusing their legislative majority to obstruct his agenda. But the order lasted only hours, until a quorum of lawmakers broke through a blockade of heavily armed soldiers at the National Assembly and voted to overturn the order.",
      "Here is what Yoon faces in one of the most explosive criminal cases in South Korea\u2019s history.",
      "Yoon\u2019s self-inflicted downfall extended a decadeslong run of South Korean presidencies ending badly. But the outspoken conservative, who was removed from office in April, is the first South Korean president to be arrested, released and then arrested again within months.",
      "Yoon became the country\u2019s first sitting president to be detained following a Jan. 15 raid on his official residence in Seoul by hundreds of anti-corruption investigators and police, which came 12 days after presidential security forces blocked an attempt to take him into custody.",
      "Seoul Western District Court later granted a formal arrest warrant, citing concerns by investigators that he could destroy evidence. The decision triggered a riot by his supporters.",
      "Anti-corruption investigators then transferred the case to public prosecutors, who indicted him Jan. 26 on rebellion charges in the Seoul Central District Court, describing Yoon\u2019s hourslong power grab as an illegal attempt to seize the legislature and election offices and arrest political opponents.",
      "Following a challenge from Yoon\u2019s defense team, the court ordered his release on March 7, citing unresolved questions about whether anti-corruption investigators had proper authority to detain him.",
      "This allowed Yoon to stand trial for rebellion without being held in custody. He also attended his impeachment trial at the Constitutional Court, which formally removed him from office in April.",
      "There were moments when Yoon appeared to use his freedom to display defiance, such as when he showed up at a theater in May to watch a documentary film justifying his martial law decree, weeks ahead of the snap election to choose his successor.",
      "Another attempt to arrest Yoon became predictable after the country\u2019s new president, Lee Jae Myung, a liberal who won the June 3 vote, quickly approved legislation to launch special investigations into Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle and other criminal allegations involving his wife and administration.",
      "Yoon\u2019s criminal case is now being handled by a team of investigators led by special prosecutor Cho Eun-suk, whose team questioned Yoon twice before submitting a request for his arrest warrant over the weekend.",
      "In their arrest warrant request, Cho\u2019s team cited additional charges they are pushing against Yoon including obstructing official duties, abuse of power and falsifying and destroying documents.",
      "Those charges stem from accusations that he sidestepped legally mandated actions before attempting to enact martial law, such as deliberation by a properly convened Cabinet meeting, and fabricated documents including a martial law proclamation in a belated attempt to satisfy formal requirements.",
      "Yoon also is suspected of ordering presidential security officials to delete server records tied to \u201csecret phones,\u201d which refer to devices equipped with anti-wiretapping software he allegedly used to communicate with military commanders involved in carrying out the martial law order.",
      "He also faces accusations of unlawfully deploying presidential security forces like a private army to block an initial attempt by law enforcement to detain him at his residence in early January.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers have denied all the accusations and accused the special prosecutor of conducting a rushed, unsubstantiated investigation driven by political motives.",
      "No longer afforded the security privileges of a sitting president, Yoon will give up his personal belongings, receive a serial number, undergo a health checkup, change into light-green prison clothes and be confined to a small solitary cell reportedly equipped with a television, toilet, sink, table and mattress. He will be required to wake up and go to bed at designated times, eat in his cell and wash his own dishes, according to the detention center, which did not provide further details, citing security rules.",
      "He may have to get used to it. His new arrest could mark the beginning of an extended period in custody, potentially lasting months or longer. Yoon can initially be held at the detention center for up to 20 days while the special prosecutor aims to indict him on additional charges.",
      "If Yoon is indicted on new charges, he could be held for up to six months until an initial court ruling. If the court convicts him and hands down a prison term, Yoon would serve his sentence even as the case potentially moves to higher courts, said Park SungBae, a lawyer specializing in criminal law.",
      "Investigators also could extend Yoon\u2019s detention by pursuing further charges, possibly including allegations that he deliberately sought to inflame tensions with rival North Korea to create a pretext for his authoritarian push.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible that the verdict in the rebellion trial could take more than six months, given the large number of defendants involved ... but there\u2019s a strong likelihood that Yoon will receive prison sentences on the other indictments before then,\u201d said Park, who views the charges related to blocking the initial arrest attempt as particularly damaging.",
      "Yoon\u2019s lawyers could ask the court to review the legality of his arrest or seek his release on bail. But it\u2019s unclear whether such efforts would succeed, given the severity of the charges and the court\u2019s view that Yoon poses a threat to destroy evidence, Park said.",

      "A report is recommending Australian universities lose government funding unless they address attacks on Jewish students and for potential immigrants to be screened for political affiliations",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian universities would lose government funding unless they address attacks on Jewish students and potential immigrants would be screened for political affiliations under recommendations to the government made public on Thursday aimed at curbing antisemitism.",
      "Antisemitic incidents including assaults, vandalism, threats and intimidation had surged more than threefold in Australia in the year after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism Jillian Segal reported.",
      "Synagogues and cars have been torched, businesses and homes have been graffitied and Jews have been attacked in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia\u2019s two largest cities where 85% of the nation\u2019s Jewish population live.",
      "A year after the Jewish lawyer and Sydney-based business executive was appointed envoy, Segal provided the government with a range of recommendations in her report.",
      "\u201cGiven its age-old heritage, we cannot hope to really abolish antisemitism, but we can push it to the margins of society,\u201d Segal told reporters.",
      "A major priority of the report was to ensure public institutions, particularly universities, were held accountable for addressing antisemitism.",
      "Australian universities have been the center of several pro-Palestinian protests.",
      "Segal would work with government to withhold funding from universities that fail to act against antisemitism, the report said.",
      "More broadly, public funding would be denied to cultural institutions, artists, broadcasters and individuals that \u201cimplicitly endorse antisemitic themes or narratives,\u201d the report said.",
      "People living in Australia who were not citizens and were involved in antisemitism should be deported. Potential immigrants should be screened for antisemitic views or affiliations, the report said.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his government would \u201ccarefully consider\u201d the report\u2019s recommendations.",
      "\u201cThere are Jewish students who have been attacked, vilified, abused because of their identification by someone \u2014 by a perpetrator \u2014 for being Jewish,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "\u201cThat has no place in Australia. It undermines out multiculturalism. And one of the things that I regard as Australia\u2019s strength is that we can be a microcosm for the world,\u201d he added.",
      "More than half Australia\u2019s population were born overseas or have an immigrant parent.",
      "Luke Sheehy, chief executive of Universities Australia, which represents the nation\u2019s 39 universities, said he was looking forward to the government\u2019s response.",
      "\u201cRacism has absolutely no place in Australia\u2019s universities and our sector condemns it in all forms,\u201d Sheehy said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAcademic freedom and freedom of expression are core to the university mission, but they must be exercised with responsibility and never as a cover for hate or harassment,\u201d he added.",
      "The Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the peak advocate for the nation\u2019s Jewish community, welcomed the report.",
      "But Max Kaiser, executive officer of the Jewish Council of Australia, said community groups such as his that supported human rights in Gaza had not been consulted by Segal.",
      "Kaiser described the threat of withholding university funding over antisemitism as dangerous.",
      "\u201cIt becomes this real way of cracking down on political dissent and cracking down on the protest movement. And we actually think that that\u2019s a really dangerous way to put it, because there are many Jews in Australia, including in the Jewish Council of Australia, who have been active parts of the protest movement,\u201d Kaiser told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThis is a movement that is against the genocide ongoing in Gaza. And it\u2019s a completely legitimate part of democratic political activity. And to suggest that somehow this is related to antisemitism really does a disservice to the cause of fighting antisemitism,\u201d Kaiser added.",
      "The report comes after three high-profile attacks on Jewish targets in Melbourne over the weekend.",
      "The front door of the East Melbourne Synagogue was set alight with ban accelerant on Friday night, and a suspect has been charged.",
      "Soon after, 20 masked protesters harassed diners at a nearby restaurant owned by an Israeli businessman. A window was broken, tables were flipped and chairs thrown as chanting protesters called for the death of the Israel Defense Forces.",
      "Four people have been charged with offenses including assault, riotous behavior and criminal damage.",
      "Police are also investigating the spray-painting of a business in Melbourne\u2019s northern suburbs and an arson attack on three vehicles attached to the business before dawn Saturday. The vehicles had also been graffitied.",
      "Police said there were antisemitic \u201cinferences\u201d at the scene. The business had also been the target of pro-Palestinian demonstrations in the past year.",

      "Steve Li, Chief Superintendent of the National Security Department, said the arrests on Wednesday involved four men between 15 and 47 years old. They face up to life imprisonment if convicted.",
      "Police said their organization, reportedly called the Hong Kong Democratic Independence Union, was founded last year in Taiwan. The self-ruled island is one of the democratic territories where many Hong Kongers have emigrated due to fears over Hong Kong's sweeping security law. The group's Facebook page only had dozens of followers.",
      "Li said the four men's roles included designing flags, studying how to solicit assistance from foreign countries, and planning to provide military training for members.",

      "On July 1, when the former British colony marked the 28th anniversary of its return to Chinese rule, the group held an activity abroad that saw participants stepping on the Chinese national flag and Hong Kong's regional flag, Li said. He said members played the song \u201cGlory to Hong Kong,\" which was often sung by demonstrators during huge anti-government protests in 2019 and was later banned by a court.",
      "Li said authorities have jurisdiction over Hong Kongers who commit the national security offences overseas.",

      "Last month, Hong Kong police accused a mobile game application, developed by ESC Taiwan, of advocating armed revolution and promoting secessionist agendas.",
      "Critics said the crackdown under the national security law imposed in 2020 has stifled the city's freedom of expression and other Western-style civil liberties that Beijing promised to keep intact when Hong Kong returned to its rule in 1997.",

      "The campaign, which ran from June 23 to July 6, mobilized more than 1,500 officers from Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Authorities conducted over 350 coordinated raids targeting illegal mining, wildlife trafficking, logging and fuel smuggling across some of the Amazon\u2019s most remote and ecologically sensitive regions.",
      "Dubbed Operation Green Shield, the crackdown was coordinated by the UAE's Ministry of Interior through the International Initiative of Law Enforcement for Climate (I2LEC), a platform launched in 2023 to support climate-related policing.

In Colombia, authorities said they disrupted three criminal groups and took down a cell allegedly linked to the Clan del Golfo, a powerful organized crime syndicate.",

      "More than 200 migrants were brought to the port of Piraeus, also near Athens, in separate transfers from Crete. The transfers to the mainland were ordered because makeshift reception centers on Crete have reached capacity, with around 500 new arrivals per day on the Mediterranean island since the weekend.",

      "The original Birkin bag, named after the actor, singer and fashion icon that Herm\u00e8s created it for \u2014 the late Jane Birkin \u2014 is up for auction in Paris on Thursday.",
      "The so-called Original Birkin is expected to fetch hundreds of thousands of euros (dollars) at the sale by auction house Sotheby\u2019s.",
      "Created for the London-born star by the Paris fashion house in 1984, the commercialized version of Birkin's bag went on to become one of the world\u2019s most exclusive luxury items, with its extravagant price tag and years-long waiting list.",
      "The fashion accessory was born of a fortuitous encounter on a London-bound flight in the 1980s with the then head of Herm\u00e8s, Jean-Louis Dumas. Birkin recounted in subsequent interviews that the pair got talking after she spilled some of her things on the cabin floor.",
      "Birkin asked Dumas why Herm\u00e8s didn\u2019t make a bigger handbag and sketched out on an airplane vomit sack the sort of bag that she would like. He then had an example made for her and, flattered, she agreed when Herm\u00e8s asked whether it could commercialize the bag in her name.",
      "The bag became so famous that Birkin once mused before her death in 2023 at age 76 that obituaries for her would likely \"say, \u2018Like the bag\u2019 or something,\u2019\u201d adding: \u201cWell, it could be worse.\u201d",
      "Sotheby\u2019s said that the all-black leather prototype was handcrafted for Birkin. It described it as a \u201clegendary handbag\" and \"one of the most iconic fashion items ever created.\u201d",
      "The bag has seven unique design elements that set it apart from every Birkin that followed, the auction house said.",
      "\u201cMore than just a bag, the Birkin has evolved from a practical accessory to become a timeless cultural icon. Its presence spans the worlds of music, film, television and the arts; it is a red-carpet staple, a fashion magazine mainstay, and a coveted piece in the wardrobes of celebrities, artists and stylists,\u201d it said.",

      "The stealth fighter, one of the world\u2019s most advanced and costing around $115 million, is stranded at Thiruvananthapuram International Airport in the southern state of Kerala due to a technical snag and is being repaired by U.K. engineers, officials said. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren't authorized to speak to media.",

      "The aircraft was then diverted to Thiruvananthapuram, where it landed safely on June 14. Officials said engineers hope to repair the plane in the next few days before it could fly back to U.K. sometime next week.",
      "The stranded military aircraft, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, has triggered A.I.-generated memes in India.

      "The British High Commission confirmed to the The Associated Press that a U.K. engineering team has been deployed to \u201cassess and repair\u201d the aircraft.",
      "There has been speculation in India that if the engineers fail to rectify the aircraft, it could be partially dismantled and transported in a cargo plane. The U.K.\u2019s Ministry of Defense dismissed the speculation in an emailed statement.",

      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has comfortably survived a vote of no confidence",
      "BRUSSELS -- European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen comfortably survived a vote of no confidence on Thursday, as an overwhelming number of European Union lawmakers rejected a censure motion against her.",
      "The motion contained a mix of allegations against von der Leyen, including text messaging privately with the chief executive of vaccine maker Pfizer during the COVID-19 pandemic, misuse of EU funds and interference in elections in Germany and Romania.",
      "The motion was defeated in a 360-175 vote against it, with 18 lawmakers choosing to abstain during a plenary session at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.",
      "Von der Leyen wasn't present for the vote, but taking to social media, she posted: \u201cAs external forces seek to destabilize and divide us, it is our duty to respond in line with our values. Thank you, and long live Europe.\u201d",
      "The vote has been a lightning rod for criticism of Von der Leyen \u2014 who led the EU drive to find vaccines for around 450 million citizens during the pandemic \u2014 and her European People\u2019s Party, or EPP, which is the largest political family in the assembly.",
      "They\u2019re accused of cozying up to the hard right to push through their agenda and sidestepping mainstream pro-European parties when it's difficult or inconvenient to form a majority. The European Parliament shifted perceptibly to the political right after Europe-wide elections a year ago.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t vote with the far-right and we do not support this motion. This vote was little more than a far-right PR stunt from Putin-loving populists,\" Greens group President Terry Reintke said in a statement after the poll, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

      "Iratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, the leader of the No. 2 bloc in parliament, the Socialists and Democrats, said that \u201cour vote doesn\u2019t mean that we are not critical of the European Commission. The recent shifts by von der Leyen towards far-right pledges are a major cause for alarm.\u201d",
      "After voting against, Valerie Hayer, the leader of the pro-business Renew group, insisted in a social media post that von der Leyen must \u201ctake control of her political family to put an end to alliances with the far right.\u201d",
      "The EPP has notably worked with the hard right to fix the agenda for hearing von der Leyen\u2019s new commissioners when they were questioned for their suitability for their posts last year, and to reject an ethics body meant to combat corruption.",
      "The censure motion, the first at the European Parliament in over a decade, was brought against the European Commission president by a group of hard-right lawmakers.",
      "On the eve of the vote, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n said on Facebook that it would \u201cbe the moment of truth: on one side the imperial elite in Brussels, on the other patriots and common sense. There is no getting out of it, it is essential to make a choice.\u201d",
      "He posted: \u201cMadam President, the essence of leadership is responsibility. Time to go!\u201d Von der Leyen's commission has frequently clashed with Orb\u00e1n over his staunchly nationalist government's moves to roll back democracy.

      "Farmers in Italy's northeastern Po Delta region are battling an unusual pest: flamingos",
      "JOLANDA DI SAVOIA, Italy -- An unusual pest is ravaging crops and irking farmers in northeastern Italy: the flamingo.",
      "Flocks of these relatively recent immigrants have set their hungry sights on the flooded fields that produce rice for risotto in Ferrara province, between Venice and Ravenna. The long-legged birds aren't interested in the seedlings; rather, flamingos use their webbed feet to stir up the soil and snatch mollusks, algae or insects from the shallow water.",
      "Rice is collateral damage.",
      "Farmers have started patroling day and night in a bid to scare the birds away. They honk their trucks' horns, bang barrels and even fire small gas cannons that make thunderous booms. Mostly, the noise just sends them flying to another nearby rice paddy to be trampled underfoot.",
      "Enrico Fabbri, a local grower, said he is discouraged after seeing production losses of as much as 90% in some of his planted areas.",
      "\u201cThese are new things that have never happened before. You invest so much time and care into preparing everything,\" Fabbri, 63, said beside one of his paddies on the outskirts of Jolanda di Savoia. \"Then, just as the crop begins to grow, it\u2019s like having a newborn child taken away. That\u2019s what it feels like.\"",
      "The flamingos appear to have come from their prior nesting grounds in the nearby Comacchio Valleys within a reserve on the coast, just south of where the Po River, Italy\u2019s longest, flows into the Adriatic Sea.",
      "The birds have been there since 2000, after drought in southern Spain sent them searching for nesting grounds further east, according to Roberto Tinarelli, ornithologist and president of the Emilia-Romagna Ornithologists Association.",
      "Previously, they had been confined to lakes in North Africa, parts of Spain and a bit of France's Camargue region, Tinarelli, 61, said beside a pond in Bentivolgio, a town near Bologna.",
      "There have been no studies yet to determine why these flamingos started seeking food further inland, where farmers flood their fields from late spring to early summer as a means of germinating newly planted rice seeds. Until the paddies are drained after a few weeks, the flamingos are a threat.",
      "\u201cObviously, we are looking for answers from those who have to deal with the problem. From an environmental point of view, all this is beautiful, but we must keep in mind that rice cultivation is among the most expensive, extensive crops,\" said Massimo Piva, a 57-year-old rice grower and vice-president of the local farmers\u2019 confederation.",
      "\u201cThey are beautiful animals, it\u2019s their way of moving and behaving, but the problem is trying to limit their presence as much as possible,\" Piva said.",
      "Tinarelli, the orinthologist, suggested several solutions to fend off flamingos that are more humane and effective than the clamorous efforts currently employed: surrounding paddies with tall trees or hedges and, even better, reducing water levels of freshly planted paddies to between 2 and 4 inches (5 and 10 centimeters), instead of 12 inches (30 centimeters).",
      "\u201cThis is sufficient for the rice to grow, but decidedly less attractive to flamingos, which must splash around in the water,\u201d he said.",

      "Hasina has been in exile since Aug. 5. Bangladesh\u2019s interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, sent a formal request to India for Hasina\u2019s extradition but India has not responded. Khan is possibly also in India.",
      "Al-Mamun was arrested and was in the dock Thursday while the judges indicted them. Al-Mamun pleaded guilty and told the tribunal that he would make a statement in favor of the prosecution at a later stage.",

      "Amir Hossain, a lawyer appointed by the state for Hasina and Khan, appeared at Thursday's hearing and filed a petition to drop their names from the case but the tribunal rejected the plea.",
      "The tribunal later fixed Aug. 3 for the opening statement by the prosecution and Aug. 4 for recording witness statements.",
      "Hasina and her Awami League party previously criticized the tribunal and its prosecution team for connections to political parties, especially the Jamaat-e-Islami party.",
      "Filing five charges, the prosecution argued Hasina was directly responsible for ordering all state forces, her Awami League party and its associates to carry out actions leading to mass killings, injuries, targeted violence against women and children, the incineration of bodies and denial of medical treatment to the wounded.",
      "The charges describe Hasina as the \u201cmastermind, conductor, and superior commander\u201d of the atrocities.",
      "The interim government already has banned the Awami League party and amended relevant laws to allow the trial of the former ruling party for its role during the uprising.",
      "In February, the U.N. human rights office estimated up to 1,400 people may have been killed in Bangladesh over three weeks of crackdowns on the student-led protests against Hasina and two weeks after her fall on Aug. 5.",
      "Earlier this month the tribunal sentenced Hasina to six months in jail after she was found in contempt of court for allegedly claiming she had a license to kill at least 227 people. The sentence was the first in any case against Hasina since she fled to India.",
      "The contempt case stemmed from a leaked audio recording of a supposed phone conversation between Hasina and a leader of the student wing of her political party. A person alleged to be Hasina is heard on the audio saying: \u201cThere are 227 cases against me, so I now have a license to kill 227 people.\u201d",
      "The tribunal was established by Hasina in 2009 to investigate and try crimes involving Bangladesh\u2019s independence war against Pakistan in 1971. The tribunal under Hasina tried politicians, mostly from the Jamaat-e-Islami party, for their actions during the nine-month war.",
      "Aided by India, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina\u2019s father and the country\u2019s first leader.",

      "At a U.K.-France summit on Thursday that caps Macron\u2019s three-day stay, senior officials from the two countries will try to seal deals on economic growth, defense cooperation and \u2013 perhaps trickiest of all \u2013 unauthorized migration.",

      "During a meeting inside 10 Downing St. on Wednesday, the two leaders agreed that tackling small boat crossings \"is a shared priority that requires shared solutions, including a new deterrent to break the business model\" of people-smuggling gangs, Starmer's office said.",
      "It said they would aim for \u201cconcrete progress\u201d on Thursday.",
      "Britain receives fewer asylum-seekers than Mediterranean European countries, but sees thousands of very visible arrivals each year as migrants cross the 20-mile (32 kilometer) channel from northern France in small, overcrowded boats.",
      "About 37,000 people were detected crossing the channel in 2024, and more than 20,000 made the crossing in the first six months of 2025, up by about 50% from the same period last year. Dozens of people have died trying to reach the English coast.",
      "Britain and France agree the dangerous and unregulated crossings are a problem, but have long differed on how to address it.",
      "The U.K. wants France to do more to stop boats leaving the beaches, and has paid the Paris government hundreds of millions of pounds (dollars, euros) to increase patrols and share intelligence in an attempt to disrupt the smuggling gangs.",
      "\u201cWe share information to a much greater extent than was the case before,\u201d Starmer told lawmakers in the House of Commons on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a new specialist intelligence unit in Dunkirk and we\u2019re the first government to persuade the French to review their laws and tactics on the north coast to take more effective action.\u201d",
      "Macron says Britain must address \u201cpull factors\u201d like the perception it is easy for unauthorized migrants to find work in the U.K. Many migrants also want to reach Britain because they have friends or family there, or because they speak English.",
      "As far back as 2001, the two countries were discussing ways to stop migrants stowing away on trains and trucks using the tunnel under the channel.",
      "Over the following years, French authorities cleared out camps near Calais where thousands of migrants gathered before trying to reach Britain. Beefed up security sharply reduced the number of vehicle stowaways, but from about 2018 people-smugglers offered migrants a new route by sea.",
      "\u201cYou see that pattern again and again, where smuggling gangs and migrants try to find new ways to cross from France to the U.K.,\u201d said Mihnea Cuibus, a researcher at the University of Oxford\u2019s Migration Observatory. \u201cThe authorities crack down on that, and then gradually you see migrants and gangs try to adapt to that. And it becomes a bit of a game of cat and mouse.\u201d",
      "Cooperation on stopping the boats stalled after Britain\u2019s acrimonious split from the European Union in 2020, but in the past few years the countries have struck several agreements that saw the U.K. pay France to increase police and drone patrols of the coast.",
      "Britain\u2019s previous Conservative government came up with a contentious plan in 2022 to deport asylum-seekers arriving by boat to Rwanda. Critics called it unworkable and unethical, and it was scrapped by Starmer soon after he took office in July 2024.",
      "Starmer is staking success on closer cooperation with France and with countries further up the migrants\u2019 routes from Africa and the Middle East.",
      "British officials have been pushing for French police to intervene more forcefully to stop boats once they have left the shore, and welcomed the sight of officers slashing rubber dinghies with knives in recent days.",
      "France is also considering a U.K. proposal for a \u201cone-in, one-out\u201d deal that would see France take back some migrants who reached Britain, in return for the U.K. accepting migrants seeking to join relatives in Britain.",
      "Macron said the leaders would aim for \u201ctangible results\u201d on an issue that\u2019s \u201ca burden for our two countries.\u201d",
      "Cuibus said irregular cross-channel migration would likely always be a challenge, but that the measures being discussed by Britain and France could make an impact, \u201cif they\u2019re implemented in the right way.",
      "\u201cBut that\u2019s a big if,\u201d he said.",

      "Each year from June to September, a series of heavy rains known as monsoons sweep through the Indian subcontinent, providing relief from heat, irrigating the country\u2019s farms and replenishing its rivers",
      "BENGALURU, India -- Each year from June to September, a series of heavy rains known as monsoons sweep through the Indian subcontinent, providing relief from heat, irrigating the country\u2019s farms and replenishing its rivers.",
      "However, as global heat increases, the rain is becoming more erratic and intense, creating the conditions for deadly floods. Nearly 1,300 people died in India throughout 2024 due to heavy rain and floods. Hundreds of rain-related deaths have already occurred this year in the South Asian region, which includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives and Nepal.",
      "Climate experts say the high temperatures and heavy rain are also contributing to the melting of glaciers in the mountainous Himalayan region, causing catastrophic flooding and landslides.",
      "The South Asian region has traditionally had two monsoon seasons. One typically lasts from June to September, with rains moving southwest to northeast. The other, from roughly October to December, moves in the opposite direction.",
      "But with more planet-warming gases in the air, the rain now only loosely follows this pattern. This is because the warmer air can hold more moisture from the Indian Ocean, and that rain then tends to get dumped all at once. It means the monsoon is punctuated with intense flooding and dry spells, rather than sustained rain throughout.",
      "\u201cWe are witnessing a clear climatic shift in monsoon patterns across South Asia,\u201d said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in Pune and author of several United Nations climate reports.",
      "Traditionally, people in India and neighboring countries excitedly awaited the monsoon rains, which would finally mean the end of summer heat. But attitudes are changing as disasters increase during the rainy seasons.",
      "\u201cThe frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events are increasing, often overwhelming drainage infrastructure in urban areas and triggering flash floods,\u201d Koll said.",
      "Higher temperatures and longer periods of drought are also making farming harder in South Asia, climate experts said.",
      "\u201cMore than 60% of the people in South Asia are dependent on agriculture, and almost all of them are dependent on monsoon rainfall,\u201d said Finu Shreshta, a climate scientist at Kathmandu, Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development.",
      "A 2023 report by Shreshta's organization found that glaciers are melting at unprecedented rates across the Hindu Kush and Himalayan mountain ranges. The study found that at least 200 of the more than 2,000 glacial lakes in the region are at risk of overflowing, which can cause catastrophic damage downstream. Heavy monsoon rains can exacerbate the problem.",
      "\u201cA lot of the mountain areas tend to have more warming than the global average, resulting in more glaciers melting,\u201d said Miriam Jackson, glaciologist at the International Cryosphere Climate Initiative.",
      "An October 2023 glacial lake overflow in the Indian state of Sikkim triggered flooding that killed 55 people and damaged bridges, buildings and a hydropower dam that was under construction.",
      "Heavy rainfall and increasing heat are leading to snow and ice avalanches, rockfalls and other events that can trigger the lakes to breach or overflow, Shreshta said.",
      "\u201cEven small glacial lakes are now breaching and causing damage,\u201d she said.",
      "Installing early warning systems and building in less risky areas can help reduce damage from heavy rains, climate experts say.",
      "\u201cIf you know a flood is coming, then people can get to higher ground and there could be a sort of standard early warning system along a river that sends out a siren,\u201d Jackson said, adding that social media and messaging applications can help people spread warnings to those downstream.",
      "Koll, the Pune-based scientist, said that rapid urbanization, shrinking floodplains and loss of natural drainage also exacerbate damage from heavy rains. Koll said that most government response currently comes after disasters, and there is a lack of long-term planning.",
      "\u201cIn the future monsoon, extreme rains are projected to intensify further, in addition to sporadic water shortages. Hence, we need proactive, long-term strategies that combine science, policy, and community engagement,\u201d he said.",
      "Jackson said the biggest issue, however, is to try to reduce emissions of planet-heating gases because there are limits to adapting to extreme weather.",
      "\u201cIf we continue with, you know, business as usual, and we have the same kind of emissions, then the world is going to keep on getting warmer and there will be more intense rain and floods. At some point, we could go beyond the limits of adaptation,\u201d she said.",

      "Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe has signed a repeal of a law guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers and inflationary adjustments to the minimum wage",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Eight months after voters approved it, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed the repeal of a law Thursday that had guaranteed paid sick leave to workers and inflationary adjustments to the minimum wage.",
      "The move marked a major victory for the state's largest business group and a frustrating defeat for workers' rights advocates, who had spent years \u2014 and millions of dollars \u2014 building support for the successful ballot measure. The repeal will take effect Aug. 28.",
      "Kehoe, who also signed a package of tax breaks Thursday, described the paid sick leave law as an onerous mandate that imposed burdensome record-keeping.",
      "\"Today, we are protecting the people who make Missouri work \u2014 families, job creators, and small business owners \u2014 by cutting taxes, rolling back overreach, and eliminating costly mandates,\u201d Kehoe, a Republican, said in a statement released after a private bill-signing ceremony.",
      "The new tax law excludes capital gains from individual state income taxes, expands tax breaks for seniors and disabled residents and exempts diapers and feminine hygiene products from sales taxes.",
      "Richard von Glahn, who sponsored the worker benefit ballot initiative, said many parents felt forced to go to work, instead of staying home to care for a sick child, in order to pay for their rent or utilities.",
      "\"The governor signing this bill is an absolute betrayal to those families, and it hurts my heart,\u201d said von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs With Justice.",
      "About one-third of states mandate paid sick leave, but many businesses voluntarily provide it. Nationwide, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, though part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than full-time employees, according to Department of Labor data.",
      "Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska all approved paid sick leave measures last November. Only Alaska\u2019s, which kicked in on July 1, has remained unchanged by state lawmakers.",
      "Before Nebraska's measure could take effect Oct. 1, Republican Gov. Jim Pillen signed a measure last month exempting businesses with 10 or fewer employees from the paid sick leave requirements. The revision also lets businesses withhold paid sick leave from seasonal agricultural workers and 14- and 15-year-olds.",
      "Missouri's law allowed employees to earn one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, starting May 1. By the time it's repealed, 17 weeks will have elapsed. That means someone working 40 hours a week could have earned 22 hours of paid sick leave.",
      "If workers don't use their paid sick leave before Aug. 28, there's no legal guarantee they can do so afterward.",
      "The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry had made repealing the law its top legislative priority.",
      "The \"paid leave and minimum wage policies were a job killer,\u201d chamber President and CEO Kara Corches said.",
      "But Missouri voters could get a second chance at mandating paid sick leave.",
      "Von Glahn has submitted a proposed ballot initiative to the secretary of state that would reinstate the repealed provisions. Because the new measure is a constitutional amendment, the Legislature would be unable to revise or repeal it without another vote of the people. Supporters haven't decided whether to launch a petition drive to try to qualify the measure for the 2026 ballot.",

      "High mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power.

      "Sticking to healthy snacks during workdays can be tough, especially with busy schedules and tempting treats nearby",
      "NEW YORK -- When Claire Par\u00e9 was a classroom teacher, working in a setting where every minute, down to the bathroom breaks, was scheduled, she brought granola bars, fruit and protein shakes to school so she\u2019d be prepared when hunger hits.",
      "Then she transitioned to a job at education publisher McGraw Hill. Working remotely at home in New Hampshire, her children\u2019s cheddar bunny crackers and Fruit Roll-Ups lured her to the pantry, confounding her commitment to healthy snacking.",
      "\u201cI have the opportunity to be judicious, but I choose not to most of the time,\u201d Par\u00e9 said. \u201cI really do enjoy being able to put the time into making something, but oftentimes convenience just has to win out.\u201d",
      "Eating healthy snacks during the workday can be challenging. Many people find themselves facing down a mid-afternoon slump and accompanying sugar, caffeine or carbohydrate cravings after lunch. Busy adults racing from back-to-back meetings to family commitments often reach for what\u2019s easy, whether it's a candy bar from the office vending machine or potato chips from a kitchen cupboard.",
      "The problem with eating packaged sugary or salty snacks to get through the afternoon is they may spike blood sugar levels but don't give a sustained second wind, according to Beth Czerwony, a registered dietitian at Cleveland Clinic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to burn off really fast, so you\u2019re going to get that boost of energy and then all of a sudden you\u2019re going to get another crash,\u201d Czerwony said. \"Some people just chase that for a while, and they\u2019re drinking coffee or their energy drinks and they're eating their candy, and it just sets you up for these spikes and these drops.\"",
      "Here are some ideas for maintaining healthy snacking habits at work.",
      "Foods that are high in protein, such as Greek yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, cottage cheese and beef or turkey jerky, can help people feel full for longer periods of time than snacks without protein, said Caroline Susie, a Dallas-based registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.",
      "Eating a snack consisting of refined carbohydrates such as a bagel causes blood sugar to rise rapidly and then drop, so teaming it up with another source of nutrition is preferable, Susie said.",
      "\u201cWhen you pair that carbohydrate with lean protein or have a protein-forward choice, it contributes to satiety. So you\u2019re just going to stay fuller longer,\u201d she added.",
      "Czerwony recommends snacks that combine lean proteins with complex carbohydrates such as crackers, rice cakes or fruit. The combination works because carbohydrates raise blood sugar, giving you a boost, while the protein takes longer to digest, helping to sustain you for longer, she said.",
      "\u201cThe carbohydrates are like the kindling on the fire, and then the proteins are the logs,\u201d Czerwony said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get the slow burn from the protein, but you need that sudden start, so you have the carbohydrates to get you going.\"",
      "Many people find it hard to resist crunchy foods. For a satisfying munch, the American Heart Association recommends sliced apples with a tablespoon of low-sodium peanut butter, pears dipped in reduced-fat cottage cheese, vegetables such as carrots, celery, bell peppers, cucumber or zucchini paired with hummus or tzatziki sauce, popcorn, rice cakes or unsalted nuts and seeds. You can also roast chickpeas, which provide both protein and carbohydrates.",
      "For a packaged snack, read the nutrition label to check how much added sugar and sodium it contains, the association suggests.",
      "The Cleveland Clinic recommends whole fruit, edamame, seeds, a handful of nuts or a single-serving package of tuna that you can eat with a fork.",
      "Bringing your own snacks to work can help you control the quality and quantity of what you eat, Czerwony said. Try slicing vegetables, cheese or low-fat meats on weekends to last through the week, she said.",
      "\u201cIf you have all that stuff already made, then it\u2019s easy in the morning to just grab it and go,\u201d she said.",
      "Take along a small, soft-sided cooler to help keep snacks like yogurt, sliced veggies or hummus fresh. \u201cGet cute little bento boxes, get little containers, make it fun if that\u2019s something that you want to do, because we\u2019ll eat things that are more attractive instead of just being in a Ziploc,\u201d Czerwony said.",
      "Petra Durnin, a Los Angeles-based senior director at commercial real estate firm JLL, blends greens, nuts, berries, avocado, banana and chia or flax seeds into homemade smoothies, which she makes in large batches. At night, she moves one jar to the fridge to thaw for the next day. An afternoon smoothie keeps her full until dinnertime and less likely to reach for chips, chocolate and sugar, she said.",
      "\u201cI feel like I have better brain clarity,\u201d Durnin said. \u201cI\u2019m able to push through the afternoon and work more efficiently. I don\u2019t feel bloated, bogged down. It just feels better.\u201d'",
      "Adopting healthy snacking habits doesn't mean you have to deprive yourself entirely of treats. If a coworker is celebrating a birthday, an occasional slice of cake won't completely derail healthy habits.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not demonize food,\u201d Susie said.",
      "Before dipping into a bag of chips, eat a meal that includes lean protein, complex carbohydrates and healthy fat, and then add something healthy to the snack while keeping an eye on portion size, Susie said.",

      "A Dutch court has convicted a 43-year-old Russian man for breaching international sanctions",
      "ROTTERDAM, Netherlands -- A 43-year-old Russian was convicted Thursday of breaching international sanctions by sharing sensitive information from Dutch semiconductor chip machine maker ASML and another tech company with a person in Russia.",
      "The man, whose identity was not released in line with Dutch privacy guidelines, was sentenced in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam to three years' imprisonment. He was acquitted of some of the counts in his indictment, including that he received payment for the information.",
      "\u201cGiving advice and sharing technology with Russia is extremely serious,\u201d the court said in a written judgment. \u201cIt can contribute to strengthening the country\u2019s military and strategic capabilities. That has consequences for Ukraine and indirectly for international security and stability.\u201d",
      "ASML is one of the world\u2019s leading makers of machines to manufacture processor chips. The company has an annual turnover of billions of dollars (euros) thanks to its cutting-edge technology. It had no immediate reaction to the judgment.",
      "Rotterdam District Court said the suspect shared information about setting up a microchip production line in Russia. Such semiconductor chips have many uses including as vital components in military equipment like drones that are a key part of Moscow's war machine in Ukraine.",
      "The suspect showed no emotion as he walked out of the courtroom after his convictions and sentence were read out and translated by a Russian-language interpreter on a speaker phone. He has 14 days to lodge an appeal.",
      "At his trial on June 26, the suspect admitted copying files last year and sending them to a person in Russia using the Signal messaging app.",
      "\u201cI didn't ask myself if these files were allowed to be sent to Russia,\u201d he said in comments quoted in the judgment. \u201cYes, I gave advice.\u201d",
      "ASML has been slapped with export restrictions in recent years that are seen as part of a U.S. policy that aims at restricting China\u2019s access to materials used to make such chips.",
      "The case is not the first time the Dutch high-tech sector has been a target for industrial espionage.",
      "In 2020, the Dutch domestic intelligence agency said it had unmasked two Russian spies who were targeting the Netherlands\u2019 science and technology sector.",
      "One of the spies was seeking information on artificial intelligence, semiconductors and nanotechnology, the agency said at the time. \u201cThis technology has civil as well as military applications, including in weapons systems,\u201d it added.",

      "Tesla has scheduled an annual shareholders meeting for November, one day after the electric vehicle company came under pressure from major shareholders to do so.",
      "Billionaire Elon Musk's company said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that the meeting will be held on Nov. 6. A group of more than 20 Tesla shareholders said in a letter to the company a day earlier that it needed to provide public notice of the annual meeting.",
      "Texas law states businesses must hold annual meetings within 13 months of their last one, if shareholders request it. But the law also allows for \u201cwritten consent instead of the annual meeting\u201d to be executed within the 13-month timeframe. Tesla is incorporated in Texas.",
      "The annual meeting, given Tesla's fortunes this year, has the potential to be a raucous event and it is unclear how investors will react to the delay, which is rare for any major U.S. corporation.",
      "Tesla shares have plunged 27% this year, largely due to blowback over Musk's affiliation with President Donald Trump, as well as rising competition.",
      "Many shareholders have been miffed by Musk's participation in the Trump administration this year, saying he needs to focus on his EV company which is facing extraordinary pressures.",
      "\u201cAn annual meeting provides shareholders with the opportunity to hear directly from the board about these concerns, and to vote for or against directors, the board\u2019s approach to executive compensation, and other matters of material importance,\u201d the group said in the letter.",
      "Tesla\u2019s last shareholders meeting was on June 13 of last year, where investors voted to restore Musk\u2019s record $44.9 billion pay package that was thrown out by a Delaware judge earlier that year.",
      "Tesla also said in its regulatory filing on Thursday that July 31 is the new deadline for the submission of proposals to be included in the proxy statement. In a January filing, Tesla said it would file its proxy statement for this year's annual meeting by the end of April.",
      "However, the company filed an amended report on April 30, saying that it didn't have a date for the meeting yet. Tesla also said in that filing that it was creating a special committee to look at Musk's compensation as CEO.",
      "Also on Thursday, Musk said that the Grok chatbot will be heading to Tesla vehicles.",
      "\u201cGrok is coming to Tesla vehicles very soon. Next week at the latest,\u201d Musk said on social media platform X, in response to a post stating that Grok implementation on Teslas wasn't announced on a Grok livestream Wednesday.",
      "Grok was developed by Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company xAI and pitched as an alternative to \u201cwoke AI\u201d interactions from rival chatbots like Google\u2019s Gemini, or OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Yet Grok has had a bumpy ride during its rollout.",
      "On Wednesday xAI announced that it was taking down \u201cinappropriate posts\u201d made by its Grok chatbot, which appeared to include antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "Shares of Tesla rose more than 3% in Thursday morning trading after tumbling this week as the feud between Trump and Musk heated up again.",

      "Italian confectioner Ferrero, known for brands like Nutella and Kinder, is buying the century-old U.S. cereal company WK Kellogg in a deal valued at approximately $3.1 billion",
      "Italian confectioner Ferrero, known for brands like Nutella and Kinder, is buying the century-old U.S. cereal company WK Kellogg in an effort to expand its North American sales.",
      "The Ferrero Group said Thursday it will pay $23 for each Kellogg share, or approximately $3.1 billion. The transaction includes WK Kellogg Co.'s six manufacturing plants, and the marketing and distribution of its breakfast cereals across the United States, Canada and the Caribbean.",
      "WK Kellogg's shares were up 31% in early afternoon trading Thursday.",
      "Kellogg was founded in Battle Creek, Michigan, in 1906 after its founder accidentally figured out how to make flaked cereal while he was experimenting with granola. Kellogg still makes Corn Flakes, as well as Froot Loops, Special K, Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies and other cereals.",
      "Kellogg now has four U.S. plants, which are located in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Nebraska. It also has a plant in Mexico and a plant in Canada. The company has around 3,000 employees.",
      "The current company was formed in 2023, when Kellogg snack brands like Cheez-Its and Pringles were spun into a separate company called Kellanova. M&M's maker Mars Inc. announced last year that it planned to buy Kellanova in a deal worth nearly $30 billion.",
      "Ferrero Group, which was founded in Italy in 1946, has been trying to expand its U.S. footprint. In 2018 it bought Nestle's U.S. candy brands, including Butterfinger, Nerds and SweeTarts. And in 2022 it bought Wells Enterprises, the maker of ice cream brands like Blue Bunny and Halo Top.",
      "WK Kellogg's brands have been struggling with a long-term decline in U.S. cereal consumption as consumers turned to protein bars, shakes and other breakfast items. Cereal sales got a bump during the coronavirus pandemic as more families stayed home, but sales continued to decline after the pandemic eased.",
      "At the start of July, U.S. cold cereal sales were down 6% compared to the same period in 2022, according to market research company Nielsen IQ. Kellogg's net sales fell 2% to $2.7 billion in 2024.",
      "Brad Haller, a senior partner for mergers and acquisitions at West Monroe, said Kellogg's large distribution network and relationships with grocery chains in North America is appealing to Ferrero because it would help the European company negotiate pricing and positioning for its products.",
      "The purchase also helps Ferraro expand beyond snacks and sweets and into a meal category, Haller said. But the company also may wind up cutting Kellogg brands or shutting down manufacturing plants.",
      "\u201cAs Americans, these brands are iconic and beloved by us, but a European company buying these wouldn\u2019t have the same nostalgia,\u201d Haller said.",
      "Kellogg has had other issues. A nearly three-month strike by workers at all its U.S. cereal plants in late 2021 hurt sales. And last fall, dozens of people rallied outside the company's Battle Creek headquarters demanding that Kellogg remove artificial dyes from its cereals.",
      "Earlier this year, Kellogg said it was reformulating cereals sold to schools to remove artificial dyes and will not include them in any new products starting in January.",
      "Ferrero's acquisition, which still needs approval from Kellogg shareholders, is expected to close in the second half of the year. Once the transaction is complete, Kellogg\u2019s stock will no longer trade on the New York Stock Exchange and the company will become a Ferrero subsidiary.",

      "The unique and original Birkin bag that fashion house Herm\u00e8s made for actor and singer Jane Birkin sold for 7 million euros or $8.2 million at auction in Paris",
      "PARIS -- Sketched out on an air sickness bag, the first Birkin bag that gave birth to fashion's must-have accessory sold for a record 7 million euros (about $8.2 million) at auction in Paris on Thursday.",
      "The huge amount \u2014 which drew gasps and applause from the audience \u2014 crushed what auctioneer Sotheby\u2019s had said was the previous record for a handbag. That was $513,040, for a White Himalaya Niloticus Crocodile Diamond Retourne Kelly 28.",
      "Now, the original Birkin bag, named after the actor, singer and fashion icon that Herm\u00e8s created it for \u2014 the late Jane Birkin \u2014 is in a new league of its own.",
      "The bidding started at 1 million euros ($1.17 million) and quickly became stratospheric.",
      "The Paris fashion house exclusively commissioned the bag for the London-born star in 1984 \u2014 branding it with her initials J.B. on the front flap, below the lock \u2014 and delivered the finished one-of-a-kind bag to her the following year, the auction house said. The subsequent commercialized version of Birkin's bag went on to become one of the world\u2019s most exclusive luxury items, extravagantly priced and with a yearslong waiting list.",
      "The bag was born of a fortuitous encounter on a London-bound flight in the 1980s with the then head of Herm\u00e8s, Jean-Louis Dumas. Birkin recounted in subsequent interviews that the pair got talking after she spilled some of her things on the cabin floor.",
      "Birkin asked Dumas why Herm\u00e8s didn\u2019t make a bigger handbag and sketched out on an airplane vomit bag the sort of hold-all that she would like. He then had an example made for her and, flattered, she agreed when Herm\u00e8s asked whether it could commercialize the bag in her name.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the Original Birkin bag is a true one-of-a-kind \u2014 a singular piece of fashion history that has grown into a pop culture phenomenon that signals luxury in the most refined way possible. It is incredible to think that a bag initially designed by Herm\u00e8s as a practical accessory for Jane Birkin has become the most desirable bag in history,\" said Morgane Halimi, Sotheby\u2019s head of handbags and fashion.",
      "The bag became so famous that Birkin once mused before her death in 2023 at age 76 that her obituaries would likely \u201csay, \u2018Like the bag\u2019 or something.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, it could be worse,\" she added.",
      "Sotheby\u2019s said that seven design elements on the handcrafted all-black leather prototype set it apart from Birkins that followed.",
      "It's the only Birkin with a nonremovable shoulder strap \u2014 fitting for the busy life and practicality of the singer, actor, social activist and mother who was also known for her romantic relationship with French singer Serge Gainsbourg and their duets that included the steamy 1969 song \u201cJe t\u2019aime moi non plus\u201d (\u201cI Love You, Me Neither\u201d).",
      "Her bag also had a nail clipper attached, because Birkin \u201cwas never one for long painted nails,\u201d Sotheby\u2019s said.",
      "The bag that Herm\u00e8s handmade for her, developed off its existing Haut A Courroies model, also has gilded brass hardware, bottom studs and other features that differ from commercial Birkins.",
      "Birkin's casual, breezy style in the 1960s and early 1970s \u2014 long hair with bangs, jeans paired with white tops, knit minidresses and basket bags \u2014 still epitomizes the height of French chic for many women around the world.",
      "When Birkin chatted to Herm\u00e8s' Dumas on the Paris-to-London flight about what her ideal handbag would be, she'd been in the habit of carrying her things around in a wicker basket, because she felt handbags in the 1980s were too small, Sotheby\u2019s said. She was traveling with her young daughter, Charlotte, and complained that she couldn\u2019t find a bag suitable for her needs as a mother, Herm\u00e8s says.",
      "Herm\u00e8s later gifted her four other Birkin bags. She kept the prototype for nearly a decade, before auctioning it for an AIDS charity in 1994. It was auctioned again in 2000 and has since been in private hands, Sotheby\u2019s said.",
      "\u201cMore than just a bag, the Birkin has evolved from a practical accessory to become a timeless cultural icon,\" the auction house said.",
      "\u201cIts presence spans the worlds of music, film, television and the arts,\" it added. \"It is a red-carpet staple, a fashion magazine mainstay, and a coveted piece in the wardrobes of celebrities, artists and stylists.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A new U.N. AIDS agency report says the sudden withdrawal of U.S. funding has caused a \u201csystemic shock\u201d to the global effort against AIDS and HIV",
      "LONDON -- Years of American-led investment into AIDS programs has reduced the number of people killed by the disease to the lowest levels seen in more than three decades, and provided life-saving medicines for some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable.",
      "But in the last six months, the sudden withdrawal of U.S. money has caused a \u201csystemic shock,\u201d U.N. officials warned, adding that if the funding isn\u2019t replaced, it could lead to more than 4 million AIDS-related deaths and 6 million more HIV infections by 2029.",
      "\u201cThe current wave of funding losses has already destabilized supply chains, led to the closure of health facilities, left thousands of health clinics without staff, set back prevention programs, disrupted HIV testing efforts and forced many community organizations to reduce or halt their HIV activities,\u201d UNAIDS said in a report released Thursday.",
      "UNAIDS also said that it feared other major donors might also scale back their support, reversing decades of progress against AIDS worldwide \u2014 and that the strong multilateral cooperation is in jeopardy because of wars, geopolitical shifts and climate change.",
      "The $4 billion that the United States pledged for the global HIV response for 2025 disappeared virtually overnight in January when U.S. President Donald Trump ordered that all foreign aid be suspended and later moved to shutter the U.S. AID agency.",
      "Andrew Hill, an HIV expert at the University of Liverpool who is not connected to the United Nations, said that while Trump is entitled to spend U.S. money as he sees fit, \u201cany responsible government would have given advance warning so countries could plan,\u201d instead of stranding patients in Africa when clinics were closed overnight.",
      "The U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, was launched in 2003 by U.S. President George W. Bush, the biggest-ever commitment by any country focused on a single disease.",
      "UNAIDS called the program a \u201clifeline\u201d for countries with high HIV rates, and said that it supported testing for 84.1 million people, treatment for 20.6 million, among other initiatives. According to data from Nigeria, PEPFAR also funded 99.9% of the country\u2019s budget for medicines taken to prevent HIV.",
      "In 2024, there were about 630,000 AIDS-related deaths worldwide, per a UNAIDS estimate \u2014 the figure has remained about the same since 2022 after peaking at about 2 million deaths in 2004.",
      "Even before the U.S. funding cuts, progress against curbing HIV was uneven. UNAIDS said that half of all new infections are in sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Tom Ellman, of the charity Doctors Without Borders, said that while some poorer countries were now moving to fund more of their own HIV programs, it would be impossible to fill the gap left by the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere's nothing we can do that will protect these countries from the sudden, vicious withdrawal of support from the U.S.,\u201d said Ellman, director of Doctors Without Borders' South Africa Medical Unit.",
      "Experts also fear another loss: data. The U.S. paid for most HIV surveillance in African countries, including hospital, patient and electronic records, all of which has now abruptly ceased, according to Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University.",
      "\u201cWithout reliable data about how HIV is spreading, it will be incredibly hard to stop it,\u201d he said.",
      "The uncertainty comes as a twice-yearly injectable could end HIV, as studies published last year showed that the drug from pharmaceutical maker Gilead was 100% effective in preventing the virus.",
      "At a launch event Thursday, South Africa's health minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the country would \u201cmove mountains and rivers to make sure every adolescent girl who needs it will get it,\u201d saying that the continent's past dependence upon US aid was \u201cscary.\u201d",
      "Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, called Yeztugo, a move that should have been a \u201cthreshold moment\u201d for stopping the AIDS epidemic, said Peter Maybarduk of the advocacy group Public Citizen.",
      "But activists like Maybarduk said Gilead\u2019s pricing will put it out of reach of many countries that need it. Gilead has agreed to sell generic versions of the drug in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates but has excluded nearly all of Latin America, where rates are far lower but increasing.",
      "\u201cWe could be ending AIDS,\" Maybarduk said. \"Instead, the U.S. is abandoning the fight.\u201d",

      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has met with his Russian counterpart in Malaysia as tensions between the countries rise over Moscow's increasing attacks on Ukraine",
      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) \u2014 U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart met Thursday in Malaysia as tensions between the countries rise over Moscow\u2019s increasing attacks on Ukraine and whether Russia's leader is serious about a peace deal.",
      "Rubio and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held talks in Kuala Lumpur on the sidelines of the annual Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, which brings together 10 ASEAN members and their most important diplomatic partners including Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, European nations and the U.S.",
      "The meeting lasted around 50 minutes. Rubio was seen winking at Lavrov afterward as reporters shouted questions, which they both ignored.",
      "The meeting was their second encounter since Rubio took office, although they have spoken by phone several times. Their first meeting took place in February in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as the Trump administration sought to test Russia and Ukraine on their willingness to make peace.",
      "Thursday's meeting occurred shortly after the U.S. resumed some shipments of defensive weapons to Ukraine following a pause, ostensibly for the Pentagon to review domestic munitions stocks, that was cheered in Moscow.",
      "The resumption comes as Russia fires escalating air attacks on Ukraine and as U.S. President Donald Trump has become increasingly frustrated with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cPutin is not, he\u2019s not treating human beings right,\u201d Trump said during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, explaining the pause\u2019s reversal. \u201cIt\u2019s killing too many people. So we\u2019re sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I\u2019ve approved that.\u201d",
      "Rubio was also seeing other foreign ministers, including many whose countries face tariffs set to be imposed Aug. 1. The tariff threat could overshadow the top diplomat\u2019s first official trip to Asia, just as the U.S. seeks to boost relations with Indo-Pacific nations to counter China\u2019s growing influence in the region.",
      "Rubio sought to assuage concerns as he held group talks with ASEAN foreign ministers.",
      "\u201cThe Indo Pacific, the region, remains a focal point of U.S. foreign policy,\u201d he told them. \u201cWhen I hear in the news that perhaps the United States or the world might be distracted by events in other parts of the planet, I would say distraction is impossible, because it is our strong view and the reality that this century and the story of next 50 years will largely be written here in this region.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese are relationships and partnerships that we intend to continue to build on without seeking the approval or the permission of any other actor in the region of the world,\u201d Rubio said in an apparent reference to China.",
      "Trump notified several countries on Monday and Wednesday that they will face higher tariffs if they don\u2019t make trade deals with the U.S. Among them are eight of ASEAN's 10 members.",
      "U.S. State Department officials said tariffs and trade won't be Rubio\u2019s focus during the meetings, which Trump\u2019s Republican administration hopes will prioritize maritime safety and security in the South China Sea, where China has become increasingly aggressive toward its small neighbors, as well as combating transnational crime.",
      "But Rubio may be hard-pressed to avoid the tariff issue that has vexed some of Washington's closest allies and partners in Asia, including Japan and South Korea and most members of ASEAN, which Trump says would face 25% tariffs if there is no deal.",
      "Rubio also met with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who has warned global trade is being weaponized to coerce weaker nations. Anwar urged the bloc Wednesday to strengthen regional trade and reduce reliance on external powers.",
      "Rubio\u2019s \u201ctalking points on the China threat will not resonate with officials whose industries are being battered by 30-40% tariffs,\u201d said Danny Russel, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific during the Obama administration.",
      "When Anwar said \"ASEAN will approach challenges \u2018as a united bloc\u2019 he wasn\u2019t talking about Chinese coercion but about U.S. tariffs,\u201d Russel noted.",
      "Among ASEAN states, Trump has announced tariffs on almost all of the bloc's 10 members.",
      "Trump sent tariff letters to two more ASEAN members Wednesday: Brunei, whose imports would be taxed at 25%, and the Philippines at 20%. Others hit this week include Cambodia at 36%, Indonesia at 32%, Laos at 40%, Malaysia at 25%, Myanmar at 40% and Thailand at 36%.",
      "Vietnam recently agreed to a trade deal for a 20% tariffs on its imports, while Singapore still faces a 10% tariff that was imposed in April. The Trump administration has courted most Southeast Asian nations in a bid to blunt or at least temper China\u2019s push to dominate the region.",
      "In Kuala Lumpur, Rubio also will likely come face-to-face with China's foreign minister during his visit of about 36 hours.",
      "Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is a veteran of such gatherings and \u201cfluent in ASEAN principles and conventions,\u201d while Rubio \u201cis a rookie trying to sell an \u2018America First\u2019 message to a deeply skeptical audience,\" Russel noted.",
      "Issues with China remain substantial, including trade, human rights, militarization of the South China Sea and China's support for Russia in Ukraine.",
      "U.S. officials continue to accuse China of resupplying and revamping Russia\u2019s military industrial sector, allowing it to produce additional weapons that can be used to attack Ukraine.",
      "Earlier on Thursday, Rubio signed a memorandum on civilian nuclear energy with Malaysia\u2019s foreign minister, which will pave the way for negotiations on a more formal nuclear cooperation deal, known as a 123 agreement after the section of U.S. law allowing such programs.",
      "Those agreements allow the U.S. government and U.S. companies to work with and invest in civilian energy nuclear programs in other countries under strict supervision.",

      "Ukrainian officials say that Russia pounded the capital with yet another major missile and drone attack",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russia pounded Ukraine\u2019s capital with another major missile and drone attack overnight into Thursday, killing at least two people and causing fires across Kyiv a day after the heaviest drone attack so far in the more than three-year war, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "In another tense and sleepless night for Kyiv residents, with many of them dashing in the dark with children and blankets to the protection of subway stations, at least 19 people were wounded, according to Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv Regional Administration.",
      "The night was punctuated with the chilling whine of approaching drones that slammed into residential areas, exploded and sent balls of orange flames into the dark during the 10-hour barrage. Russia fired 397 Shahed and decoy drones as well as cruise and ballistic missiles at Kyiv and five other regions, authorities said.",
      "\u201cThis is a clear escalation of Russian terror: hundreds of Shahed drones every night, constant missile strikes, massive attacks on Ukrainian cities,\u201d President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Telegram post.",
      "Two rounds of direct peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations have yielded no progress on stopping the fighting. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Thursday there is no date for a possible third round of negotiations.",
      "Russia has recently sought to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s air defenses with major attacks that include increasing numbers of decoy drones. The previous night, it fired more than 700 attack and decoy drones, topping previous nightly barrages for the third time in two weeks.",
      "\u201cThe continued increase in the size of strike packages is likely intended to support Russian efforts to degrade Ukrainian morale in the face of constant Russian aggression,\u201d the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said late Wednesday.",
      "In tandem with the bombardments, Russia\u2019s army has started a new drive to break through parts of the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where short-handed Ukrainian forces are under heavy strain at what could prove to be a pivotal period of the war.",
      "\u201cAt present, the rate of Russian advance is accelerating and Russia\u2019s summer offensive is likely to put the armed forces of Ukraine under intense pressure,\u201d Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at military think tank RUSI, wrote in an assessment published Wednesday.",
      "The pressure has caused alarm among Ukrainian officials, who are uncertain about continuing vital military aid from the United States and U.S. President Donald Trump's policy toward Russia.",
      "\u201cPartners need to be faster with investments in weapons production and technology development,\u201d Zelenskyy said Thursday. \u201cWe need to be faster with sanctions and put pressure on Russia so that it feels the consequences of its terror.\u201d",
      "In Kyiv, Karyna Holf, 23, was in the living room near the window when she heard a whistling sound from the incoming weapon. Moments later, little was left of the room but debris.",
      "\u201cAfter such a shock, when you know from your own experience what it\u2019s like to lose everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what comes next. All I have now is a backpack, a phone, a winter coat \u2014 that\u2019s it. This is my whole life now.\u201d",
      "Holf said she was grateful to have her parents to turn to, but added, \u201cThere are people who have no one at all.\u201d",
      "One Kyiv subway station worker said more than 1,000 people, including 70 children, took refuge there. One of them was 32-year-old Kyiv resident Alina Kalyna.",
      "\u201cThe drone attacks a year ago were one thing, and now they're a completely different thing. We're exhausted,\" she said. \"I sleep poorly, I recover poorly, in fact I no longer recover, I am just somehow on a reserve of energy, of which I have a little left, I just somehow live and exist,\u201d Kalyna said.",
      "Russia routinely fires more drones in a night than in a whole month a year ago, and analysts say the drone barrages are unlikely to let up.",
      "Russia is now producing more and better drones, including some using artificial intelligence technology, according to the Atlantic Council. Its factories are manufacturing more than 5,000 drones a month, the Washington-based think tank said this week.",
      "\u201cFor the first few years of the war following (Russia\u2019s) 2022 invasion, Ukraine\u2019s dynamic tech sector and vibrant startup culture helped keep the country a step ahead of Russia despite the Kremlin\u2019s far greater resources,\" the Atlantic Council said of the countries' drone development. \u201cIn recent months, however, it has become increasingly apparent that the initiative has passed to Moscow.\u201d",
      "Ukraine urgently needs more interceptor drones to take down Russia's Shaheds as well as Patriot missile systems to counter Russian missiles.",
      "The U.S. has resumed deliveries of certain weapons, including 155 mm munitions and precision-guided rockets known as GMLRS, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity so that they could provide details that hadn't been announced publicly. It\u2019s unclear exactly when the weapons started moving.",
      "Ukraine has also invested in drones, developing its own long-range weapons that can hit Russian soil.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Thursday that it shot down 14 Ukrainian drones overnight. Two people in the Belgorod region were injured by falling debris, Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said.",

      "A judge has ruled that Alabama's Public Service Commission can continue holding private meetings to decide fuel price hikes",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama's utility regulators can continue to hold closed-door meetings to determine price hikes, in an apparent departure from common practices in neighboring states, a circuit court judge ruled.",
      "The decision on Monday rejected a lawsuit filed by Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of Energy Alabama, a nonprofit that advocates for renewable energy sources. The watchdog group was denied access to two meetings in 2024 where the public service commission decided how Alabama Power \u2014 the state's largest electricity provider \u2014 should adjust prices based on volatility in global fuel costs.",
      "The lawsuit argued the denial flouts both local regulations and regional norms.",
      "Montgomery circuit Judge Brooke Reid ruled against the environmental advocates in a one-page order after a hearing in June. She said the group's rights had not been substantially violated. At the June hearing, Reid said the commission\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of its own rules should be given deference.\u201d",
      "Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, blasted Reid\u2019s decision in a statement on Monday.",
      "\u201cWhile other Southern states have meaningful public engagement in fuel cost proceedings, Alabama Power customers will continue to be shut out of the process,\u201d Tidwell wrote.",
      "The Alabama Public Service Commission has rules that govern how Alabama Power can change electricity prices to offset increases in fuel costs, which tend to be volatile. Those rules say that the public is entitled to hear evidence and participate in proceedings that adjust fuel costs to ensure these changes are \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit said there have been only two public fuel cost hearings since the commission\u2019s current rules were adopted in 1981. By contrast, the Georgia Public Service Commission, which regulates a sister company of Alabama Power, has held at least 26 public formal fuel cost proceedings, according to the complaint.",
      "The last public meeting in Alabama was called because the 2008 financial crisis caused fuel prices to skyrocket rapidly, according to attorneys for the state commission. They argued that the commission hasn't technically initiated a new proceeding since that change 16 years ago, even though rates have been adjusted over 15 times since then, so they are not compelled to invite public input.",
      "Attorneys for the state also argued that the public has \u201cplenty of opportunities for input\u201d even without public meetings, because the commission publishes monthly reports on fuel prices online, and rate changes are subject to public appeal.",
      "Alabama Power is a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Company, which reported $4.4 billion in profit in 2024, according to annual shareholder reports. Alabama Power serves about 1.5 million of the state\u2019s roughly 5 million residents.",
      "Most Alabama residents get electricity through municipal or cooperatively owned utilities. In 2023, the average Alabama Power consumer was paying about $159 per month, compared to the statewide average of approximately $132 per month, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Alabama Power did not respond to an emailed request for comment on Wednesday afternoon inquiring about recent rates.",
      "After the ruling, Energy Alabama's executive director Daniel Tait said in a statement that the decision was \u201cdisappointing\u201d for \u201cAlabamians who have no choice but to pay the high cost of fossil fuels on their Alabama Power bill.\u201d",

      "AP Business Writer -- Alan G. Hassenfeld, a renowned philanthropist and former CEO of iconic toy company Hasbro Inc., the maker of G.I. Joe and Play-Doh, has died. He was 76, according to the toy company.",
      "Hasbro, the nation's second largest toy company behind Mattel, declined to offer more details. Hassenfeld's family foundation, Hassenfeld Family Initiatives, wasn't immediately available to comment.",
      "Hassenfeld was born in Providence, Rhode Island and graduated from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts. He received an undergraduate arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1970. Upon graduation, he joined the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based family business in 1970. Hasbro was founded in 1923, by Hassenfeld\u2019s grandfather, Henry. Known initially as Hassenfeld Brothers, it sold textile remnants but expanded into school supplies and later toy manufacturing under the Hasbro name in the 1940s, according to Hasbro's website. It went public in 1968.",
      "Hassenfeld rose quickly in the family business serving as special assistant to the president and worked his way up the rank s. He became one of the key architects of Hasbro\u2019s international operations and spent extensive time traveling overseas. He was named executive vice president in 1980 and became president in September 1984.",
      "Hassenfeld labored for years in the shadow of his older brother Stephen. His brother\u2019s death of pneumonia in June 1989 at age 47, however, moved Hassenfeld into the position of chairman and chief executive officer.",
      "Hassenfeld stepped down as CEO in 2003 and in August 2005, he retired from his chairman position and became emeritus chairman. He stepped away from that role last year. Hassenfeld was the last family member to sit on the board, according to Hasbro.",
      "\u201cAll of us who have ever had any connection to Hasbro today are mourning the profound loss of Alan Hassenfeld, our beloved former Chairman & CEO, mentor, and dear friend, \u201d Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks in an e-mailed statement to The Associated Press. \u201cAlan\u2019s enormous heart was, and will remain, the guiding force behind Hasbro \u2014 compassionate, imaginative, and dedicated to bringing a smile to the face of every child around the world. His tireless advocacy for philanthropy, children\u2019s welfare, and the toy industry created a legacy that will inspire us always.\u201d",
      "Hassenfeld was involved in many charitable and social causes both nationally and locally in Rhode Island. His concerns ranged from childhood hunger to issues involving refugee settlement in the state. As chairman of the Hassenfeld Family Initiatives, he oversaw the foundation's mission of globalizing safety and human rights within the area of children\u2019s products; empowering women in developing countries; and enhancing the economy, education and business opportunities in Rhode Island.",
      "Hassenfeld was also founding benefactor of Hasbro Children\u2019s Hospital in Providence, and his family\u2019s contributions helped to establish the Hassenfeld Child Health Innovation Institute at Brown University.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is singling out Brazil for import taxes of 50%, citing its treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump singled out Brazil for import taxes of 50% on Wednesday for its treatment of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, showing that personal grudges rather than simple economics are a driving force in the U.S. leader's use of tariffs.",
      "Trump avoided his standard form letter with Brazil, specifically tying his tariffs to the trial of Bolsonaro, who is charged with trying to overturn his 2022 election loss. Trump has described Bolsonaro as a friend and hosted the former Brazilian president at his Mar-a-Lago resort when both were in power in 2020.",
      "\u201cThis Trial should not be taking place,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter posted on Truth Social. \u201cIt is a Witch Hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\u201d",
      "There is a sense of kinship as Trump was indicted in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. president addressed his tariff letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who bested Bolsonaro in 2022.",
      "Lula responded in a forceful statement that said Trump's tariffs would trigger the country's economic reciprocity law, which allows trade, investment and intellectual property agreements to be suspended against countries that harm Brazil's competitiveness.",
      "He noted that the U.S. has had a trade surplus of more than $410 billion with Brazil over the past 15 years.",
      "\u201cBrazil is a sovereign country with independent institutions that will not accept being taken for granted by anyone,\u201d Lula said.",
      "Bolsonaro testified before the country\u2019s Supreme Court in June over the alleged plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss. Judges will hear from 26 other defendants in the coming months, and legal analysts say a decision could come as early as September. The country\u2019s electoral authorities have already barred Bolsonaro from running for office until 2030.",
      "The former president did not comment about Trump\u2019s tariff decision on his social media channels, but wrote that he is being politically persecuted.",
      "In his statement, Lula defended the country's legal system, saying the \u201cproceedings against those who planned the coup d\u2019etat is a competence of the Brazilian judiciary and is not subject to interference or threats that harm the independence of national institutions.\u201d",
      "Trump also objected to Brazil's Supreme Court fining of social media companies, saying the temporary blocking last year amounted to \u201cSECRET and UNLAWFUL Censorship Orders.\u201d Trump said he is launching an investigation as a result under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which applies to countries with trade practices that are deemed unfair to U.S. companies.",
      "Among the companies the Supreme Court fined was X, which was not mentioned specifically in Trump's letter. X is owned by Elon Musk, Trump's multibillionaire backer in the 2024 election whose time leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency recently ended and led to a public feud over the U.S. president's deficit-increasing budget plan. Trump also owns a social media company, Truth Social.",
      "\u201cIn Brazil, freedom of speech is not mistaken by aggression or violent behavior,\" Lula said in his statement. \"To operate in our country, every company, local or foreign, must be subjected to Brazilian legislation.\u201d",
      "Brazilian lawmakers allied with Lula blamed Bolsonaro and two of his sons, congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro and Sen. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, for Trump\u2019s tariff action. Sen. Lindbergh Farias, the whip of Lula\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party in the Senate, said on social media that the Bolsonaros \u201cmust be very happy to harm Brazil, our economy and our jobs.\u201d",
      "The Brazil letter was a reminder that politics and personal relations with Trump matter just as much as any economic fundamentals. And while Trump has said the high tariff rates he\u2019s setting are based on trade imbalances, it was unclear by his Wednesday actions how the countries being targeted would help to reindustrialize America.",
      "The tariffs starting Aug. 1 would be a dramatic increase from the 10% rate that Trump levied on Brazil as part of his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement. In addition to oil, Brazil sells orange juice, coffee, iron and steel to the U.S., among other products. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus with Brazil last year, according to the Census Bureau.",
      "Trump initially announced his broad tariffs by declaring an economic emergency, arguing under a 1977 law that the U.S. was at risk because of persistent trade imbalances. But that rationale becomes problematic in this particular case, as Trump is linking his tariffs to the Bolsonaro trial and the U.S. exports more to Brazil than it imports.",
      "Trump also sent letters Wednesday to the leaders of seven other nations. None of them \u2014 the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Sri Lanka \u2014 is a major industrial rival to the United States.",
      "Most economic analyses say the tariffs will worsen inflationary pressures and subtract from economic growth, but Trump has used the taxes as a way to assert the diplomatic and financial power of the U.S. on both rivals and allies. His administration is promising that the taxes on imports will lower trade imbalances, offset some of the cost of the tax cuts he signed into law on Friday and cause factory jobs to return to the United States.",
      "Trump, during a White House meeting with African leaders, talked up trade as a diplomatic tool. Trade, he said, \u201cseems to be a foundation\u201d for him to settle disputes between India and Pakistan, as well as Kosovo and Serbia.",
      "\u201cYou guys are going to fight, we\u2019re not going to trade,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we seem to be quite successful in doing that.\u201d",
      "Trump said the tariff rates in his letters were based on \u201ccommon sense\u201d and trade imbalances, even though the Brazil letter indicated otherwise. Trump suggested he had not thought of penalizing the countries whose leaders were meeting with him in the Oval Office \u2014 Liberia, Senegal, Gabon, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau \u2014 as \u201cthese are friends of mine now.\u201d",
      "Countries are not complaining about the rates outlined in his letters, he said, even though those tariffs have been generally close to the ones announced April 2 that rattled financial markets. The S&P 500 stock index rose Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWe really haven\u2019t had too many complaints because I\u2019m keeping them at a very low number, very conservative as you would say,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Officials for the European Union, a major trade partner and source of Trump's ire on trade, said Tuesday that they are not expecting to receive a letter from Trump listing tariff rates. The Republican president started the process of announcing tariff rates on Monday by hitting two major U.S. trading partners, Japan and South Korea, with import taxes of 25%.",
      "According to Trump's Wednesday letters, imports from Libya, Iraq, Algeria and Sri Lanka would be taxed at 30%, those from Moldova and Brunei at 25% and those from the Philippines at 20%. The tariffs would start Aug. 1.",
      "The Philippine government's reaction has been relatively tame. Its ambassador in Washington, Jose Manuel Romualdez, said the country will seek new negotiations with the U.S. to lower the 20% tariff.",

The imbalance represents the difference between what the U.S. exported to those countries and what it imported.",

      "NEW YORK -- As job-seekers look for work in a challenging environment, an increasing number are falling victim to job scams that promise good pay for completing easy online tasks, according to the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "The scams start innocuously, often with a tailor-made text or WhatsApp message, and the scammers take time to build trust with the victim before cashing in on the relationship.",
      "\u201cMost of the people who end up losing money to a scammer are behaving pretty rationally,\u201d said Kati Daffan, assistant director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s division of marketing practices. \u201cScammers are sophisticated, and they keep changing their tactics.\"",
      "Reported losses to job scams increased more than threefold from 2020 to 2023. In the first half of 2024, they topped $220 million, according to the FTC. Gamified job scams, or task scams, represented a significant portion of that growth. About 20,000 people reported experiencing gamified scams in the first part of 2024, compared to 5,000 in all of 2023.",
      "Daffan said that that the number is certainly an underestimate, because many people don\u2019t report their experiences of job scams to law enforcement or government trackers.",
      "\u201cOnly 4.8% of people complain,\u201d she said.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "The scam typically begins with an unexpected text or WhatsApp message from a \u201crecruiter\u201d offering online work, according to the FTC. The mystery texter will say you can \u201cmake good money\u201d by \u201cproduct boosting\u201d or doing \u201coptimization tasks\u201d for an online platform or in an app, which might involve liking videos or rating product images.",
      "This \u201cjob\u201d promises to earn you money from \u201ccommissions\u201d per click. Once you complete the tasks, you'll see an increasing tally of \u201cearnings\u201d on the platform or in the app. These earnings are fake.",
      "Eventually, the app or platform will ask you to deposit your own money, typically in crypto, to complete more tasks and withdraw your (non-existent) earnings. But if you do make the deposit, you lose your real money, and you never receive the illusory pay.",
      "Eva Velasquez, CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, said these types of scammers typically prey on job-seekers who are new to the job market, people who have been out of the job market for some time (such as homemakers re-entering the workforce, whose children are grown), and immigrants, who may be less familiar with the employment landscape or who face language barriers.",
      "\u201cOften the job will have an easy interview or no interview, promise to let you work from home, and let you start right away,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cSometimes they'll start with praise, and the person will feel their skills are recognized. \u2018Oh, you think I\u2019m great? Tell me more.'\u201d",
      "Velasquez emphasized the vulnerability of people looking for work, especially given ongoing economic uncertainty, who may choose to accept a role even if it initially feels shady.",
      "\u201cSometimes the ask is to leave phony reviews for products,\u201d she said. \u201cThe scammers are probably selling those reviews illegally, but a job-seeker might look at a line and say, \u2018I\u2019ll cross that line. I've got to eat.'\u201d",
      "\u2014 Ignore any generic and unexpected texts or WhatsApp messages about jobs, no matter how specific or complimentary the messages.",
      "\u2014 Never pay to get paid, or to get a job. That requirement is a red flag that the position is a scam.",
      "\u2014 Don\u2019t trust employers who says they\u2019ll pay you to rate or like things online, without an above-board process for using the actual products or services you're rating.",

      "Houthi rebels have attacked and sunk the cargo ship Eternity C in the Red Sea",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- A Liberian-flagged cargo ship attacked by Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels sank Wednesday in the Red Sea, and a European naval force in the Mideast said only six of the 25 people who were on board have been rescued.",
      "The attack on the Eternity C, which also killed at least three of the crew, represents the most serious assault carried out by the Houthis in the crucial maritime trade route where $1 trillion in cargo once passed through annually.",
      "From November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones in a campaign the rebels describe as supporting Palestinians in the Gaza Strip during the Israel-Hamas war. The Iranian-backed rebels stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the war. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "The attack on the Eternity C, as well as the sinking of the bulk carrier Magic Seas in another attack Sunday, raise new questions about the Red Sea's safety as ships had slowly begun returning to its waters. Meanwhile, a new possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war \u2014 as well as the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran's battered nuclear program \u2014 remain in the balance.",
      "\u201cWe are now with grave concern seeing an escalation in the Red Sea with attacks on two commercial ships earlier this week by Ansar Allah, resulting in civilian loss of life and casualties as well as the potential for environmental damage,\u201d warned United Nations special envoy Hans Grundberg, using another name for the rebels.",
      "A statement from the European Union naval mission in the Red Sea said the crew of the ship included 22 sailors, among them 21 Filipinos and one Russian, as well as a three-member security team. Those rescued were five Filipinos and one Indian.",
      "Three people also were killed during the hourslong attack on the ship, the EU force said, and their nationalities were not immediately known.",
      "The armed rebels had attacked the ship with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms, later using two drones and two drone boats carrying bombs to strike the vessel, the EU force said. The Eternity C sank at 7:50 a.m. Wednesday, it added.",
      "The ship, flagged out of Liberia but owned by a Greek firm, likely had been targeted like the Magic Seas over its firm doing business with Israel. Neither vessel apparently requested an escort from the EU force.",
      "The U.S. military has two aircraft carriers in the Mideast, the USS Nimitz and the USS Carl Vinson, but both likely are in the Arabian Sea, far from the site of the attacks. There are two American destroyers believed to be operating in the Red Sea. However, the ships attacked had no U.S. ties and a ceasefire between the Houthis and America announced after the bombing campaign earlier this year still appears to be holding.",
      "Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, claimed the attack in a prerecorded message Wednesday night as the EU force acknowledged it was still searching for those onboard with private industry rescuers.",
      "The Houthis later released footage of them launching missiles at the Eternity C. The bridge appeared heavily damaged by the attack and oil leaked from the vessel. The ship took on water from holes along its waterline before sinking beneath the waves, the rebels chanting: \u201cGod is the greatest; death to America; death to Israel; curse the Jews; victory to Islam.\u201d",
      "The Houthis released a similar video after their attack on the tanker Sounion in August 2024 and on Tuesday from their attack on the Magic Seas.",
      "In the Philippines, Migrant Workers Secretary Hans Cacdac said he has been leading an effort to reach out to the families of the missing Filipino sailors to update them on the search and rescue efforts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s human nature that one should be terribly worried and distraught about the situation,\u201d Cacdac told The Associated Press by telephone. \u201cIt\u2019s our role in government to be there for them in their utmost hour of need to ensure that not just government services but throughout this hand-holding process, we will provide the necessary support.\u201d",
      "The attacks on the ships drew international condemnation.",
      "\u201cThese attacks demonstrate the ongoing threat that Iran-backed Houthi rebels pose to freedom of navigation and to regional economic and maritime security,\u201d U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. \u201cThe United States has been clear: We will continue to take necessary action to protect freedom of navigation and commercial shipping from Houthi terrorist attacks.\u201d",
      "The EU force earlier said one of the wounded crew lost his leg.",
      "Grundberg, the U.N. envoy, also decried the targeting of civilian infrastructure after Israel bombed three Houthi-controlled ports in Yemen over the weekend and hit a power station.",
      "\u201cYemen must not be drawn deeper into regional crises that threaten to unravel the already extremely fragile situation in the country,\u201d he warned during an address to the Security Council.",
      "Satellite images analyzed by The Associated Press showed new damage at Yemen's rebel-controlled port at Hodeida after it was targeted by the Israeli airstrikes. The images from Planet Labs PBC showed new portions of the pier at the port torn away by Israeli bombing, likely to affect the unloading of cargo there.",
      "In conducting the strikes, Israel said the Houthis used the port to smuggle military equipment into the country, a growing worry of analysts and Yemen watchers in recent years. Hodeida is the main entry point for food and other humanitarian aid for millions of Yemenis.",
      "Jamal Amer, a Houthi official, reportedly said Wednesday that shipments continue to arrive \u201csmoothly\u201d to Hodeida. In comments published by the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite channel, Amer also said that damage at the port \u201ddirectly affects civilians and is a disgrace to the United Nations, which is complicit in these crimes through its suspicious silence.\"",
      "Yemen's war began when the Houthis seized Sanaa in 2014. A Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen\u2019s exiled government considered trying to retake Hodeida by force in 2018, but ultimately decided against it as international criticism and worries about the port being destroyed grew.",

      "Trump first announced tariffs in April, but then delayed them for 90 days to allow for deals to be negotiated. On Tuesday, he announced new tariffs with rates of between 25%-40% on 14 countries, which will go into effect Aug. 1 unless new deals are struck. He also threatened to increase tariffs if any countries retaliate.",

      "President Donald Trump and his advisers promised a lightning round of global trade negotiations with dozens of countries back in April",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump and his advisers promised a lightning round of global trade negotiations with dozens of countries back in April.",
      "White House trade adviser Peter Navarro predicted \u201c90 deals in 90 days.\u2019\u2019 Administration officials declared that other countries were desperate to make concessions to avoid the massive import taxes \u2013 tariffs -- that Trump was threatening to plaster on their products starting July 9.",
      "But the 90 days have come and gone. And the tally of trade deals stands at two \u2013 one with the United Kingdom and one with Vietnam. Trump has also announced the framework for a deal with China,  the details of which remain fuzzy.",
      "Trump has now extended the deadline for negotiations to Aug. 1 and tinkered with his threatened tariffs, leaving the global trading system pretty much where it stood three months ago \u2014 in a state of limbo as businesses delay decisions on investments, contracts and hiring because they don\u2019t know what the rules will be.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rerun, basically,\u2019\u2019 said William Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official who\u2019s now an adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. Trump and his team \u201cdon\u2019t have the deals they want. So they\u2019re piling on the threats.\"",
      "The pattern has repeated itself enough times to earn Trump the label TACO \u2014 an acronym coined by The Financial Times\u2019 Robert Armstrong that stands for \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out.\u201d",
      "\"This is classic Trump: Threaten, threaten more, but then extend the deadline,\u201d Reinsch said. \u201cJuly 30 arrives, does he do it again if he still doesn\u2019t have the deals?\u2019\u2019 (Trump said Tuesday that there will be no more extensions.)",
      "The deal drought represents a collision with reality.",
      "Negotiating simultaneously with every country on earth was always an impossible task, as Trump himself belatedly admitted last month in an interview with the Fox News Channel. (\u201cThere\u2019s 200 countries,\u2019\u2019 the president said. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk to all of them.\u2019\u2019) And many trading partners \u2014 such as Japan and the European Union \u2014 were always likely to balk at Trump\u2019s demands, at least without getting something in return.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really, really hard to negotiate trade agreements,\u201d which usually takes several months even when it involves just one country or a small regional group, said Chad Bown, an economic adviser in the Obama White House and now senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cWhat the administration is doing is negotiating a bunch of these at the same time.\u2019\u2019",
      "The drama began April 2 \u2013 \"Liberation Day,'' Trump called it \u2014 when the tariff-loving president announced a so-called baseline 10% import tax on everybody and what he called \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 levies of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits.",
      "The 10% baseline tariffs appear to be here to stay. Trump needs them to raise money to patch the hole his massive tax-cut bill is blasting into the federal budget deficit.",
      "By themselves, the baseline tariffs represent a massive shift in American trade policy: Tariffs averaged around 2.5% when Trump returned to the White House and were even lower before he started raising them in his first term.",
      "But the reciprocal tariffs are an even bigger deal.",
      "In announcing them, Trump effectively blew up the rules governing world trade. For decades, the United States and most other countries abided by tariff rates set through a series of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay round. Countries could set their own tariffs \u2013 but under the \u201cmost favored nation\u2019\u2019 approach, they couldn\u2019t charge one country more than they charged another.",
      "Now Trump is setting the tariff rates himself, creating \u201ctailor-made trade plans for each and every country on this planet,\u2019\u2019 in the words of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "But investors have recoiled at the audacious plan, fearing that it will disrupt trade and damage the world economy. Trump\u2019s Liberation Day tariffs, for instance, set off a four-day rout in global financial markets. Trump blinked. Less than 13 hours after the reciprocal tariffs took effect April 9, he abruptly suspended them for 90 days, giving countries time to negotiate with his trade team.",
      "Despite the Trump administration\u2019s expressions of confidence, the talks turned into a slog.",
      "\u201cCountries have their own politics, their own domestic politics,\u201d Reinsch said. \u201cTrump structured this ideally so that all the concessions are made by the other guys and the only U.S. concession is: We don\u2019t impose the tariffs.\u2019\u2019",
      "But countries like South Korea and Japan needed \u201cto come back with something,\u2019\u2019 he said. Their thinking: \u201cWe have to get some concessions out of the United States to make it look like this is a win-win agreement and not a we-fold-and-surrender agreement. \u201d",
      "Japan, for example, wanted relief from another Trump tariff \u2014 50% levies on steel and aluminum.",
      "Countries may also be hesitant to reach a deal with the United States while the Trump administration conducts investigations that might result in new tariffs on a range of products, including pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.",
      "Frustrated by the lack of progress, Trump on Monday sent letters to Japan, South Korea and 12 other countries, saying he\u2019d hit them with tariffs Aug. 1 if they couldn\u2019t reach an agreement. The levies were close to what he\u2019d announced on April 2; Japan\u2019s, for example, would be 25%, compared to the 24% unveiled April 2.",
      "Trump did sign an agreement last month with the United Kingdom that, among other provisions, reduced U.S. tariffs on British automotive and aerospace products while opening the U.K. market for American beef and ethanol. But the pact kept the baseline tariff on British products mostly in place, underlining Trump\u2019s commitment to the 10% tax despite the United States running a trade surplus \u2014 not a deficit \u2014 with the U.K. for 19 straight years, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.",
      "On July 2. Trump announced a deal with Vietnam. The Vietnamese agreed to let U.S. products into the country duty free while accepting a 20% tax on their exports to the United States, Trump said, though details of the agreement have not been released.",
      "The lopsided deal with Vietnam suggests that Trump can successfully use the tariff threat to bully concessions out of smaller economies.",
      "\u201cThey just can\u2019t really negotiate in the same way that the (European Union) or Korea or Japan (or) Canada can negotiate with the United States,\u2019\u2019 said Dan McCarthy, principal in McCarthy Consulting and a former official with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in the Biden administration. \u201cA lot of (smaller) countries just want to get out of this and are willing to cut their losses.\u2019\u2019",
      "But wrangling a deal with bigger trading partners is likely to remain tougher.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is gambling that these countries will ultimately be intimidated and fold,\u201d Reinsch said. \u201cAnd the countries are gambling that the longer this stretches out, and the longer it goes without Trump producing any more deals, the more desperate he gets; and he lowers his standards.",
      "\"It\u2019s kind of a giant game of chicken.\u2019\u2019",

    "story": [
      "The last time President Donald Trump rolled out tariffs this high, financial markets quaked, consumer confidence crashed and his popularity plunged",
      "WASHINGTON -- When President Donald Trump last rolled out tariffs this high, financial markets quaked, consumer confidence crashed and his popularity plunged.",
      "Only three months later, he\u2019s betting this time is different.",
      "In his new round of tariffs being announced this week, Trump is essentially tethering the entire world economy to his instinctual belief that import taxes will deliver factory jobs and stronger growth in the U.S., rather than the inflation and slowdown predicted by many economists.",
      "On Tuesday, he told his Cabinet that past presidents who hadn't aggressively deployed tariffs were \u201cstupid.\u201d Ever the salesman, Trump added that it was \u201ctoo time-consuming\u201d to try to negotiate trade deals with the rest of the world, so it was just easier to send them letters, as he's doing this week, that list the tariff rates on their goods.",
      "The letters marked a change from his self-proclaimed April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d event at the White House, where he had posterboards with the rates displayed, a choice that led to a brief market meltdown and the 90-day negotiating period with baseline 10% tariffs that will end Wednesday. Trump, instead, chose to send form letters with random capitalizations and punctuation and other formatting issues.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a better way,\u201d Trump said of his letters. \"It\u2019s a more powerful way. And we send them a letter. You read the letter. I think it was well crafted. And, mostly it\u2019s just a little number in there: You\u2019ll pay 25%, 35%. We have some of at 60, 70.\"",
      "When Trump said those words, he had yet to issue a letter with a tariff rate higher than 40%, which he levied Monday on Laos and Myanmar. He plans to put 25% tariffs on Japan and South Korea, two major trading partners and allies deemed crucial for curbing China's economic influence. Leaders of the 14 countries tariffed so far hope to negotiate over the next three weeks before the higher rates are charged on imports.",
      "\u201cI would say that every case I\u2019m treating them better than they treated us over the years,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The president said Tuesday evening on Truth Social that he would be releasing letters to \u201ca minimum of 7 Countries\u201d on Wednesday morning, with additional letters coming out in the afternoon.",
      "His approach is at odds with how major trade agreements have been produced over the last half-century, detailed sessions that could sometimes take years to solve complex differences between nations.",
      "There are three possible outcomes to this political and economic wager, each of which could drastically reshape international affairs and Trump's legacy.",
      "Trump could prove most economic experts wrong and the tariffs could deliver growth as promised. Or he could retreat again on tariffs before their Aug. 1 start in a repeat of the \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out\u201d phenomenon, also known as TACO. Or he could damage the economy in ways that could boomerang against the communities that helped return him to the White House last year, as well as hurt countries that are put at a financial disadvantage by the tariffs.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said Trump's letters had \u201cextended his tariff purgatory for another month,\u201d essentially freezing in place the U.S. economy as CEOs, foreign leaders and consumers are unclear of Trump's actual strategy on foreign trade.",
      "\u201cThe TACO negotiating tactic pioneered by Trump is making his threats less and less credible and reducing our trading partners\u2019 willingness to even meet us halfway,\u201d Wyden said. \u201cThere\u2019s no sign that he\u2019s any closer to striking durable trade deals that would actually help American workers and businesses.\u201d",
      "So far, the stock and bond markets are relatively calm, with the S&P 500 stock index essentially flat Tuesday after a Monday decline. Trump is coming off a legislative win with his multitrillion-dollar income tax cuts. And he's confidently levying tariffs at levels that previously rocked global markets, buoyed by the fact that inflation has eased so far instead of accelerating as many economists and Democratic rivals had warned.",
      "\u201cBy floating tariffs as high as 40% to even 100%, the administration has \u2018normalized\u2019 the 25% tariff hikes \u2014 yet this is still one of the most aggressive and disruptive tariff moves in modern history,\" said Wendong Zhang, an economist at Cornell University. \"This gradual unveiling, paradoxically, risks normalizing what would otherwise be considered exceptionally large tariff hikes.\"",
      "Others simply see Trump as a source of nonstop chaos, with the letters and their somewhat random tariff rates showing the absence of a genuine policy process inside his administration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really just a validation that this policy is all over the place, that they\u2019re running this by the seat of their pants, that there is no real strategy,\" said Desmond Lachman, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank.",
      "With Trump's 90-day tariff negotiation period ending, he as of Monday had sent letters to 14 countries that place taxes on imported goods ranging from 25% to 40%. He said Tuesday he would sign an order to place 50% tariffs on copper and added that at some point pharmaceutical drugs could face tariffs of as much as 200%. All of that is on top of his existing 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, 25% tariffs on autos and his separate import taxes on Canada, Mexico and China.",
      "\u201cThe obvious inference is that markets for now are somewhat skeptical that Trump will go through with it, or alternatively they think compromises will be reached,\u201d said Ben May, a director of global economic research at the consultancy Oxford Economics. \u201cThat\u2019s probably the key element.\u201d",
      "May said the tariffs are likely to reduce the growth in U.S. household incomes, but not cause those incomes to shrink outright.",
      "Trump has said his tariffs would close U.S. trade imbalances, though it's unclear why he would target nations such as Tunisia that do relatively little trade with America. Administration officials say trillions of dollars in tariff revenues over the next decade would help offset the revenue losses from the continuation and expansion of his 2017 tax cuts that were signed into law Friday.",
      "The federal government has collected $98.2 billion in tariff revenues so far this year, more than double what it collected last year, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "At Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the tariff revenues could be \u201cwell over $300 billion by the end of the year.\u201d Bessent added that \u201cwe don\u2019t agree\u201d with the Congressional Budget Office estimate that tariffs would bring in $2.8 trillion over 10 years, \u201cwhich we think is probably low.\u201d",
      "The governments of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and South Africa have each said they hope for further negotiations on tariffs with Trump, though it's unclear how that's possible as Trump has said it would be too \u201ccomplicated\u201d to hold all those meetings.",
      "Instead on Tuesday, Trump posted on social media that the tariffs would be charged as scheduled starting Aug. 1.",
      "\"There has been no change to this date, and there will be no change,\" Trump said on Truth Social. \u201cNo extensions will be granted.\u201d",

      "Jacob deGrom is an All-Star ace again after several injury-filled seasons",
      "This is finally the vintage Jacob deGrom pitching for the Texas Rangers, and not because the lanky right-hander recently turned 37 years old.",
      "After several injury-filled seasons in a row, both before and since going to Texas in free agency, deGrom is again an All-Star ace.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit of validation,\" deGrom said. \u201cComing back from a major surgery, your second (Tommy John), there is some unknown. To be fortunate enough to be able to throw the ball pretty well, I\u2019m just thankful to be able to be back out there on a major league mound.\u201d",
      "DeGrom (9-2, 2.29 ERA) this year has made 18 starts, twice as many as he had combined the past two seasons after joining the Rangers. It is already his most since 2019, when he won his second National League Cy Young Award in a row while pitching for the New York Mets.",
      "His fifth All-Star nod is his first in the American League after being the only Texas player selected for the game next Tuesday night in Atlanta.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to take for granted how hard this game is because he\u2019s making it look really easy,\u201d said Chris Young, the Rangers\u2019 president of baseball operations and a former big league pitcher. \"It\u2019s precious when you get to see greatness like that.\u201d",
      "A no-decision against the Los Angeles Angels on Monday night ended deGrom's franchise record of 14 consecutive starts going at least five innings without giving up more than two runs. That same span was the longest streak by any traditional starter (not including openers) in the modern era since 1900 of not allowing more than six hits and two runs in a game, according to STATS.",
      "DeGrom came the closest he has to a no-hitter in his 236 career games on June 26 at Baltimore. He was perfect through six innings and the only hit was a leadoff single in the eighth.",
      "\"He's an alien or something, I don't know how he does what he does,\u201d said Jack Leiter, the son of a big league pitcher and the 2021 No. 2 overall pick still a Rangers rookie this season.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like anything\u2019s bothering him,\" catcher Jonah Heim said. \"It looks like he\u2019s going out there free and easy and and trusting his stuff, and it\u2019s pretty fun to watch.\u201d",
      "The Rangers won the first six games deGrom started in his debut for them by the end of April 2023 before he had Tommy John surgery for the second time \u2014 the first was in 2010 as a minor leaguer for the Mets. He wasn't pitching when Texas won its only World Series title, then rehabbed most of last year before three short starts at the end of the season.",
      "His 106 1/3 innings this year are one more than he pitched combined the past three seasons, his first two in Texas and his final one in New York.",
      "\u201cI think as much as anything with Jacob, he\u2019s just so happy that he feels good,\u201d Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. \u201cThe talent obviously is there. It\u2019s a tough road. ... Now he\u2019s back having fun playing the game.\u201d",
      "Bochy said the Rangers will continue to monitor deGrom's workload. He had at least five days of rest between six of his seven starts while going 5-0 since the beginning of June. He is averaging 86 pitches a game, and his 103 on May 21 was the only time over 100.",
      "\u201cThe thing about Jacob is it\u2019s so effortless,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cNot a lot of stressful innings.\u201d",
      "The 2014 NL Rookie of the Year made his first All-Star Game in 2015, when Bochy was the NL manager and DeGrom needed only 10 pitches to strike out Stephen Vogt, Jason Kipnis and Jose Iglesias.",
      "DeGrom also made three consecutive All-Star teams in 2018, 2019 and 2021 \u2014 there wasn't one during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. He allowed a solo homer to Mike Trout in the 2018 game, and pitched a perfect inning in 2019.",
      "After his back-to-back Cy Young seasons, deGrom started 12 of the Mets' 60 games in 2020. He had a 1.08 ERA over 92 innings through 15 starts in 2021, but didn't pitch in the All-Star Game and missed the rest of the season with right forearm tightness and a sprained elbow. He was shut down during spring training in 2022 after a stress reaction in his right scapula, then was 5-4 with a 3.08 ERA in 11 starts the last two months of that season before becoming a free agent.",
      "The $185 million, five-year contract deGrom signed with Texas included a conditional sixth-year club option for 2028 that has already been trigged because of the time he missed after Tommy John surgery.",
      "That option is worth at least $20 million, but would be $30 million if he finishes among the top five in Cy Young voting or pitches at least 625 innings during the contract. It increases to $37 million if he finishes among the top five at least three times or pitches 725 innings.",

    "story": [
      "Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano have fought twice, two of the best and most significant events in women\u2019s boxing history",
      "NEW YORK -- Katie Taylor remembers the minutes before her first fight with Amanda Serrano, when she left her locker room at Madison Square Garden to find a screaming, sold-out crowd that was larger and louder than anything she imagined.",
      "\u201cI think it was probably the longest ring walk in history, the first fight,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will ever be that long ever again, but I was just trying to take the atmosphere in.\u201d",
      "She and Serrano have fought twice, two of the best and most significant events in women's boxing history. They return to Madison Square Garden on Friday night to headline the first all-women's card at the arena for the expected conclusion to a rivalry that has elevated their sport, created opportunities that never previously existed for female fighters, and so far has delivered everything except a Serrano victory.",
      "\u201cI feel like even after the first fight I didn\u2019t think it was going to get any bigger than that, but here we are,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis fight is even bigger than the last two and to be headlining such a huge card, to be headlining an all-female card is an absolute privilege. It's an amazing situation and these are the kind of nights that I actually dreamt of as a kid, to be in this position and headlining a big show like this.\u201d",
      "Taylor (24-1, 6 KOs), the 2012 Olympic gold medalist from Ireland, will again be defending her super lightweight titles against Serrano (47-3-1, 31 KOs), the seven-division world champion from Puerto Rico who is based in nearby Brooklyn, on the card that will stream on Netflix.",
      "Taylor was still fighting at 135 pounds when she edged Serrano by split decision in their first fight on April 30, 2022. She won a unanimous decision in the rematch last November, when they fought in the Dallas Cowboys' stadium before Jake Paul's victory over Hall of Famer Mike Tyson.",
      "Serrano was more disappointed by the latter result, knowing the first fight could have gone either way but believing she had done more than enough to win the second \u2014 especially after Taylor was docked a point for a headbutt that forced Serrano to deal with a bloody gash for the remainder of the bout.",
      "\u201cObviously the judges didn\u2019t see me winning the fight, so something has to change and I\u2019m all up for that,\u201d Serrano said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we did in training camp. I\u2019m going to use my head \u2014 but not the way it was used on me \u2014 but I\u2019m just going to be smarter.\u201d",
      "It seems hard to recall now, but organizers weren't sure how big a women's boxing match could be before the first Taylor-Serrano fight. Preliminary plans were to stage the bout in MSG's smaller Theater venue before deciding it belonged in the big room, though they weren't going to have it fully opened until ticket demand showed they needed to make every seat available.",
      "There is no doubt now, not after they drew nearly 20,000 fans that night and the Tyson-Paul card had 108 million live viewers on Netflix, many of them knowing that Serrano-Taylor, not the heavily hyped main event, had been the highlight of the show.",
      "This card features some of the top fighters in women's boxing, including 130-pound champion Alycia Baumgardner (15-1, 7 KOs) against unbeaten Jennifer Miranda (12-0, 1 KO), who is also an actress in Spain; and Savannah Marshall (13-1, 10 KOs), whose only loss is to women's superstar Claressa Shields, in a super middleweight unification match against Shadasia Green (14-1, 11 KOs).",
      "It's so deep that Chantelle Cameron (20-1, 8 KOs), who handed Taylor her only loss, isn't even on the main portion of the card that features three undisputed title fights.",
      "\u201cI think anyone, if you give them a pen and paper to write their dream venue, and what Katie and Amanda represent of themselves, just as humans not just boxers, it\u2019s a blessing to be a part of it,\u201d said England's Ellie Scotney (10-0), who takes on Mexico's Yamileth Mercado (24-3, 5 KOs) in a 122-pound title fight.",
      "Taylor and Serrano have a respectful relationship and soaked in the applause arm-in-arm after their first fight. But they appear to be tiring of each other as they reach their trilogy fight, with Serrano saying Taylor backed out of an agreement to fight this match with three-minute rounds, rather than the two-minute format that is standard in most sanctioned women's bouts.",
      "Taylor is aggravated about the way Serrano reacted in the aftermath of the second fight \u2014 \u201cI guess I\u2019m just sick of the complaining and whining from your team,\u201d she said during their news conference \u2014 and annoyed by some of the demands from Serrano's Most Valuable Promotions team.

      "Rooker announced Thursday that he\u2019s participating in the event, which takes place Monday in Atlanta. He will become the first Athletics player in the Home Run Derby since Matt Olson in 2021.",
      "\u201cCompeting in the Home Run Derby has always been a dream of mine,\u201d Rooker said in an Instagram post. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to make it happen next week in Atlanta! See ya there!\u201d",
      "Rooker, 30, entered Thursday with a .270 batting average, 19 homers and 50 RBIs, putting him on pace for a third straight season of at least 30 homers. He went deep 30 times in 2023 and had 39 homers in 2024.",
      "His 58 homers since the start of the 2024 season rank him third among all American League players.",
      "The only A\u2019s to win the Derby were Mark McGwire in 1992 and Yoenis C\u00e9spedes in 2013 and 2014.",
      "Other announced participants include Atlanta\u2019s Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr., Minnesota\u2019s Byron Buxton, Tampa Bay\u2019s Junior Caminero, Pittsburgh\u2019s Oneil Cruz, Seattle\u2019s Cal Raleigh and Washington\u2019s James Wood.",

      "BALTIMORE -- The Baltimore Orioles traded right-handed reliever Bryan Baker to AL East rival Tampa Bay on Thursday in exchange for the 37th overall pick in the 2025 MLB amateur draft, a sign that one of baseball\u2019s most disappointing clubs could be sellers at the upcoming trade deadline.",
      "Orioles GM Mike Elias wouldn\u2019t completely commit to that idea. Speaking to reporters before Thursday\u2019s split doubleheader against the New York Mets, he cited the 2024 Detroit Tigers, who traded players off their major league roster but held on to ace Tarik Skubal and then surged into a playoff spot.",
      "Elias did, however, acknowledge the possibility of selling on a day that began with last-place Baltimore (40-50) sitting 12 1/2 games behind division-leading Toronto and seven out of the final AL wild card spot.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a step in that direction,\u201d said Elias three weeks before the July 31 deadline. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around that. The timing of the draft, and when you have draft picks involved in the trades, kind of frontloads these decisions, and it\u2019s earlier than my comfort level. But we thought it was a really good return and a good trade for everyone. So we did it.\u201d",
      "The draft begins Sunday. In a corresponding move, the Orioles selected the contract of catcher David Ba\u00f1uelos from Triple-A Norfolk.",
      "After a dreadful start that brought the May dismissal of manager Brandon Hyde, the Orioles have steadied under interim skipper Tony Mansolino, playing to a 21-14 record since a loss to St. Louis on May 28.",
      "Baker was a solid part of that, posting a 3.52 ERA, striking out 49 batters and posting a 1.096 WHIP in 38 1/3 innings as the setup man for closer Felix Bautista.",
      "\u201cThis is a team that is moving in the right direction, and we still have a lot of time left before the deadline, but this was a trade with the draft coming up in a couple days that we had to make a decision on,\u201d Elias said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to pass up on the opportunity. Hopefully, we can use the pick wisely, bring a lot of value back, and Bryan\u2019s going to a good place.\u201d",
      "Mansolino is also hoping his team will get replenishments in the form of players eventually returning from the injured list. That sizable group includes several possible starting pitchers: Grayson Rodriguez (shoulder), Albert Suarez (shoulder), Tyler Wells (elbow) and Kyle Bradish (Tommy John surgery).",
      "Meanwhile, Baltimore will now have four of the first 37 and seven of the first 93 draft picks.",
      "\u201cAll the drafts are important, but when you have this amount of picks, it becomes more important, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d Elias said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a much bigger opportunity ahead of us, and the draft is a lifeblood for our franchise.\u201d",

      "Manager Rocco Baldelli said before the game against the Chicago Cubs that Buxton could be available as a substitute \u2014 possibly as a pinch-hitter \u2014 depending on how the hand was feeling.",
      "Buxton was hit by a pitch in the first inning on Wednesday and stayed in the game to run the bases but was removed before his next at-bat. The pitch hit at least part of the protective pad Buxton wears on his hand. X-rays showed no breaks.",
      "\u201cNothing\u2019s really gotten worse from yesterday, but he\u2019s definitely sore and for the same reasons he came out of the game yesterday, he\u2019s not going to be starting the game today,\u201d Baldelli said. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to be fine and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he\u2019s back out there soon.\"",
      "Buxton was selected for his second All-Star Game and also chosen as a first-time entrant in the Home Run Derby, but his participation in those events next week in his home state of Georgia did not appear to be in jeopardy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just going to be seeing how he is today and tomorrow and see what he\u2019s capable of,\u201d Baldelli said. \u201cThe next couple of days will basically give us that answer.\u201d",
      "The 31-year-old Buxton has 20 home runs through 75 games this year, tied for sixth in the American League. He's also third in the AL in runs and slugging percentage, sixth in OPS and seventh in stolen bases.",

      "Red Bull has pledged not give up on the Formula 1 title fight until it\u2019s mathematically impossible for Max Verstappen to win, even after Christian Horner was fired as team principal",
      "Red Bull motorsport adviser Helmut Marko has pledged not give up on the Formula 1 title fight until it's mathematically impossible for Max Verstappen to win, even after Christian Horner was fired as team principal.",
      "In the first sign of the team's ambitions after ending Horner's 20-year tenure and appointing Laurent Mekies, Marko dismissed suggestions Thursday that the move might mark a shift of focus to 2026.",
      "\u201cAs for the current sporting situation: there are still twelve races to go, and we will continue to fight for the drivers\u2019 championship as long as it\u2019s mathematically possible,\" Marko said in comments released by the team.",
      "It comes after Max Verstappen \u2014 third in the standings, 69 points off the lead \u2014 had seemed pessimistic about his title defense. Marko himself last month told Austrian TV the team might need to \u201cwrite off\u201d the title if things didn't improve.",
      "There was no mention Thursday of the constructors\u2019 standings, where Red Bull is far adrift of McLaren.",
      "Turning around a disappointing season is just one of many urgent demands facing Mekies on his first full day as Red Bull's new team principal.",
      "The defending champion last week refused to commit to staying with Red Bull for 2026, even while Horner claimed Verstappen's \u201cintention is that he will be there.\u201d",
      "It's likely to become clearer in the coming weeks whether Horner's departure has done anything to make Verstappen more willing to stay.",
      "If Verstappen does leave, it would likely be for rival Mercedes. Losing its star driver relatively late in 2025 could hamper Red Bull's development work for next year, and there are few experienced options available.",
      "The two sides of the Red Bull garage seem like different teams.",
      "Verstappen has scored 165 of Red Bull's 172 points this year despite his frequent complaints about the car. For anyone else, it seems undriveable. The last Red Bull podium for a driver other than Verstappen was in April 2024. The last win came in April 2023.",
      "Last week, Horner said Verstappen's teammate Yuki Tsunoda would be given the rest of the season to show what he can do. Whatever happens, Mekies has to choose who will fill that seat for 2026.",
      "One option is Isack Hadjar, the impressive rookie at Racing Bulls. However, Mekies was at Racing Bulls when Liam Lawson was first promoted, then sent back down with shattered confidence.",
      "Getting the best out of Red Bull means dealing with its internal politics.",
      "In his previous role with Racing Bulls, Mekies worked with the 82-year-old Marko, who is employed by Red Bull's parent company and oversees both of its F1 teams. The Austrian is influential but his authority and position are vaguely defined.",
      "Another influential figure who isn't a team employee is Jos Verstappen. The star driver's father is a regular presence in the paddock and wasn't afraid of criticizing Horner in public.",
      "Since Red Bull co-founder Dietrich Mateschitz's death in 2022, the parent company's shareholders in Thailand have shaped the direction of the team. They're rarely seen at races and avoid commenting in public.",
      "The most sweeping changes to F1 cars in a generation could reshape the sport.",
      "Red Bull aced the last big regulation change in 2022 with a car designed by Adrian Newey. He left last year for Aston Martin, an ambitious team which has been planning for this moment for years. It's just one of several rivals with their eyes on Red Bull's place as a title challenger.",
      "Mekies will need to get a quick grasp of Red Bull's plans for 2026 and a major expansion of its in-house engine production program, which includes Ford returning to F1 for next year as Red Bull's partner.",

      "GENEVA -- Two-time Olympic champion runner Caster Semenya won a partial victory at the European Court of Human Rights on Thursday in her seven-year legal fight against track and field\u2019s sex eligibility rules.",
      "The court\u2019s 17-judge highest chamber said in a 15-2 vote that Semenya had some of her rights to a fair hearing violated at Switzerland\u2019s Supreme Court, where she had appealed against a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in favor of track's World Athletics.",
      "Her case should now go back to the Swiss federal court in Lausanne \u2014 to be watched closely by other sports which have passed or are reviewing their own rules on eligibility in women's events.",
      "The original case between Semenya and track\u2019s governing body based in Monaco was about whether athletes like her \u2014 who have specific medical conditions, a typical male chromosome pattern and naturally high testosterone levels \u2014 should be allowed to compete freely in women\u2019s sports.",
      "Europe's top human rights court in Strasbourg, France, dismissed other aspects of the appeal filed by Semenya, who was in court Thursday to hear the judgment read. It awarded her 80,000 euros ($94,000) \u201cin respect of costs and expenses.\u201d",
      "The European court\u2019s ruling does not overturn the World Athletics rules that effectively ended Semenya\u2019s career running the 800 meters after she won two Olympic and three world titles since emerging on the global stage as a teenager in 2009.",
      "The key legal point in Semenya's win was the Swiss Federal Court had not carried out a \u201crigorous judicial review\u201d that was required because Semenya had no choice but to pursue her case through the CAS's \u201cmandatory and exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d the Strasbourg judges ruled.",
      "Governing bodies of sports oblige athletes and national federations to take their disputes to the sports court in the International Olympic Committee's home city Lausanne.",
      "\u201cThe court considered, however, that the Federal Supreme Court\u2019s review had fallen short of that requirement,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "In dismissing other elements of the South African runner\u2019s case, the court judged she \u201cdid not fall within Switzerland\u2019s jurisdiction in respect of those complaints.\u201d",
      "World Athletics, led by its president Sebastian Coe, has said its rules maintain fairness because Semenya has an unfair, male-like athletic advantage from her higher testosterone. Semenya argues her testosterone is a genetic gift.",
      "World Athletics and the IOC did not immediately respond to the ruling.",
      "Thursday's win followed a legal victory from the same court two years ago for Semenya.",
      "That judgment which said she had faced discrimination opened a way for the Swiss supreme court to reconsider its decision to dismiss her appeal against the CAS verdict in favor of World Athletics.",
      "At CAS in 2019, three judges ruled 2-1 that discrimination against Semenya was \u201cnecessary, reasonable and proportionate\u201d to maintain fairness in women\u2019s track events.",
      "World Athletics drew up its rules in 2018 forcing Semenya and other female athletes with Differences in Sex Development to suppress their testosterone to be eligible for international women\u2019s events.",
      "Semenya last competed internationally in the 800 in 2019, winning at the Prefontaine Classic meeting on the Diamond League circuit in Eugene, Oregon. It extended her winning streak to more than 30 consecutive races when the rules made her ineligible.",
      "Her winning time then of 1 minute 55.70 seconds was faster than the gold medal-winning time at the 2024 Paris Olympics but not the 1:55.21 run by Athing Mu of the United States at the Tokyo Olympics held in 2021.",
      "Semenya returned to Eugene in 2022 to race in the world championships over 5,000 but did not advance from the heats.",
      "She is now 34 and has moved into coaching. She said recently her ongoing legal fight is no longer about a principle rather than her own running career.",

      "One game into his major league career, Cam Schlittler is the hardest-throwing member of the New York Yankees\u2019 rotation",
      "NEW YORK -- One game into his major league career, Cam Schlittler is the hardest-throwing member of the New York Yankees' rotation.",
      "Schlittler used his 100 mph fastball to shut down Cal Raleigh and the Seattle Mariners during an eye-opening debut Wednesday night, pitching the Yankees to a 9-6 victory before a throng of friends and family members in the crowd.",
      "\u201cObviously, it's been my goal my whole life,\u201d Schlittler said. \u201cI don't think I've really processed it yet.\u201d",
      "One of the team\u2019s top-rated prospects, the 6-foot-6 Schlittler struck out seven over 5 1/3 innings to earn the win. He threw New York's seven fastest pitches this season and his average fastball velocity of 97.9 mph was the highest for a Yankees pitcher this year.",
      "But it was his poise and improved secondary pitches that really impressed manager Aaron Boone.",
      "\u201cYou see his stuff really plays,\" Boone said. \u201cI see a lot of potential.\u201d",
      "Boone called it \u201ca great first step\u201d and said Schlittler will get another big league start, likely after the All-Star break.",
      "\u201cHe was sick,\u201d said Yankees teammate Jazz Chisholm Jr., who homered twice and drove in four runs.",
      "Schlittler was called up from Triple-A to pitch in place of injured Clarke Schmidt, who is expected to undergo a second Tommy John surgery on his right elbow that would sideline him for the rest of this season and much of next year.",
      "So there's a genuine opportunity for Schlittler to stick in the rotation for a Yankees squad trying to catch Toronto atop the AL East.",
      "\u201cObviously, just trying to get the first one under my belt and then whatever happens. I'm just fortunate that they gave me that opportunity,\u201d Schlittler said. \u201cJust take it day by day and see what happens.\u201d",
      "Staked to an early 3-0 lead, Schlittler gave up three runs and four hits \u2014 including solo homers by J.P. Crawford and Jorge Polanco.",
      "The 24-year-old right-hander walked his first batter but settled down quickly and froze Raleigh, the major league home run leader, with a 100 mph heater for his first strikeout in the opening inning.",
      "\u201cHe was nasty,\" Yankees outfielder Jasson Dom\u00ednguez said.",
      "That baseball was one of two sitting in Schlittler's locker after the game, both keepsakes inscribed and encased above the Yankees' championship belt for the night.",
      "Schlittler said the strikeout ball will probably end up in his room back home eventually, but first he planned to give it to his parents.",
      "\u201cI know they'll cherish that,\u201d he said.",
      "Schlittler, who walked two, ending his outing with another strikeout of Raleigh before leaving with a 6-2 lead in the sixth to a standing ovation as his parents hugged in the Yankee Stadium stands.",
      "Schlittler was born in Massachusetts but said he always wanted to play for the Yankees. They selected him in the seventh round of the 2022 amateur draft from Northeastern in Boston, right in the heart of rival Red Sox country.",
      "The pitcher said his girlfriend and cousin were on hand in addition to plenty of friends, and he left 23 tickets for his supporters. But he said he wasn't all that nervous come gametime.",
      "\u201cI think probably had more jitters this morning, honestly,\u201d Schlittler said. \u201cI know my dad just in general gets more nervous than I do when I throw.\u201d",

      "MILWAUKEE -- Former Olympic wrestler and MMA star Ben Askren, who has been hospitalized in Wisconsin after a severe case of pneumonia, said in a post on social media Wednesday that he had undergone a double lung transplant and is in recovery.",
      "Askren said during the Instagram video that he recalls very little of what happened over a monthlong stretch from late May through the first two days of July. His wife, Amy, had said in a series of social media posts that Askren was put on a ventilator in June and placed on the donor list for a lung transplant on June 24.",
      "\u201cNo recollection, zero idea, no idea what happened,\u201d Askren said of most of the past six weeks. \"I just read through my wife\u2019s journal. It\u2019s like a movie. It\u2019s ridiculous. I only died four times, where the ticker stopped for about 20 seconds.\u201d",
      "Askren said he lost about 50 pounds during the 45-day stretch.",
      "\u201cThe thing that was most impeccable to me was all the love I felt,\u201d Askren said. \u201cIt was almost like I got to have my own funeral.\u201d",
      "The 40-year-old Askren was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, but has lived primarily in Wisconsin, where he runs a youth wrestling academy. He won back-to-back NCAA titles at Missouri and competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics for the U.S. before moving into MMA, where he fought for Bellator and ONE Championship before moving into the UFC.",
      "Askren retired from MMA after a loss to Demian Maia in October 2019. He had a record of 19-2 with one no contest.",
      "Askren made a brief return to combat sports in April 2021, when he fought social media star Jake Paul in a boxing match. Paul won by technical knockout in the first round of a fight that sold about 500,000 on pay-per-view.",

      "In between, Caminero belted his 22nd homer of the season in the seventh inning of a 7-3 win in Detroit.",
      "Caminero, who turned 22 on July 5, leads all American League third basemen in homers during a breakout season. He is hitting .254 with 58 RBIs for the Rays, who moved within four games of first-place Toronto in the AL East on Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to put on a show. I\u2019m going to try to put on a show just to give the fans the opportunity to get to know me, see my power,\u201d Caminero said. \u201cJust being there with all those other All-Stars, it\u2019s going to be something very special.\u201d",
      "Caminero is the sixth player to commit to the Home Run Derby, joining the Mariners' Cal Raleigh, James Wood of the Nationals, Byron Buxton of the Twins, the Pirates' Oneil Cruz and Ronald Acuna Jr. of the host Braves. Two more contestants are still to be announced, and Buxton's status is unclear after he was hit in the left hand by a pitch during Wednesday night's win over the Cubs.",
      "New York Yankees infielder Jazz Chisholm Jr., also headed to the All-Star Game, said Wednesday night he'd be interested in participating if asked. Chisholm hit two homers in a 9-6 victory over Seattle to give him 17 this season.",
      "Caminero was picked earlier this week as the All-Star replacement for Boston third baseman Alex Bregman, who has been dealing with a strained right quadriceps. Caminero learned he will start at the hot corner after Cleveland's Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez opted out of the Midsummer Classic so he could rest an ailing Achilles tendon.",
      "Houston Astros third baseman Isaac Paredes was chosen to replace Ram\u00edrez on the AL roster.",

      "\u201cWe get to see (Caminero) do probably a modified Home Run Derby every time he takes batting practice. I\u2019m excited for him. I\u2019m excited for his family,\u201d Rays manager Kevin Cash said. \u201cSomewhat of a coming-out party for him. Hopefully, he gets the recognition that we\u2019ve all seen in the talent and the ability to hit the ball a long way.\u201d",

      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Frank Layden, the sharp-witted former coach who led the Utah Jazz to the playoffs for the first time, has died. He was 93.",
      "\u201cFrank Layden made a lasting impact on the Jazz, the state of Utah, and the NBA,\u201d the Jazz said in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThere will never be another like him. Our thoughts go out to his family as we join in mourning his loss and celebrating his life. Rest easy, Coach.\u201d",
      "Known for his humor and sideline antics, Layden coached the Jazz from 1981-89 and had 277 wins, third-most in franchise history. He's the only coach in Jazz history to be named NBA coach of the year, earning the honor in 1984, when he also was honored as executive of the year.",
      "Born in Brooklyn in 1932, Layden began his coaching career in the high school ranks before moving on to coach at his alma mater, Niagara University. He made the jump to the NBA in 1976 on Hubie Brown's staff with the Atlanta Hawks and became the New Orleans Jazz's general manager in 1979.",
      "Layden took over as coach after Tom Nissalke was fired midway through the 1981-82 season and led the franchise to its first playoff appearance in his second season. Layden stepped away from coaching early in the 1988-89 season and was replaced by future Hall of Famer Jerry Sloan.",
      "Layden stayed on as the team's president and general manager, part of a staff that selected Hall of Famers John Stockton and Karl Malone. He spent one season as coach of the WNBA's Utah Starzz in 1998-99.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine the story of the Utah Jazz without the presence of Frank Layden,\" Jazz owners Ryan and Ashley Smith said. \u201cHe was an amazing person who meant so much to this organization and to our fans. His love of the sport was felt around the NBA, and he set the franchise on a course for success, helping to build an enduring legacy for the state of Utah.\u201d",

      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Wearing their blue, red and white jerseys, Paris Saint-Germain supporters were surrounded by white shirts.",
      "Real Madrid fans were 95% of the crowd at MetLife Stadium for Wednesday's Club World Cup semifinal, the shirts of Los Blancos radiant in the harsh summer sun. Yet, it was PSG fans in a couple sections behind one goal who cheered virtually from start to finish as their team moved within one win of a historic quadruple.",
      "A 4-0 rout of Real Madrid in a Club World Cup semifinal following a 5-0 wipeout of Inter Milan in the Champions League final reinforced that PSG may be the dominant soccer team of the mid-2020s.",
      "\u201cWe have always said that the collective work by the players is what\u2019s helping us,\u201d said Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz, who scored twice as PSG built a three-goal lead in the first 24 minutes. \u201cWe are a great group, a young group that is working well.\u201d",
      "PSG moved on to Sunday's final against Chelsea in the first expanded Club World Cup with a chance to win its fourth major title of the season exactly 100 days after it clinched Ligue 1 on April 5. It added the Coupe de France by beating Reims 3-0 on May 24, then romped over Inter seven days later.",
      "PSG's blue, red and white jerseys don't have glamorous names pressed across the back, and they may not be as ubiquitous as the the red shirts of Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, Manchester City's light blue or Chelsea's royal blue, but the team is filling up the trophy display at Parc des Princes, its cramped, outdated stadium not far from Roland-Garros and the Bois de Boulogne.",
      "On May 31 at Munich, Achraf Hakimi got the first goal 12 minutes in, D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dou\u00e9 scored the next two and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Senny Mayulu added one goal each.",

      "Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, this year's Ligue 1 Golden Boot winner with 21 goals, started for the first time since straining his left quadriceps with France on June 5. He missed the Club World Cup group stage and was a substitute in PSG's first two knockout matches, scoring in second-half injury time during Saturday's 2-0 quarterfinal win over Bayern Munich.",
      "\u201cThis is the first match in this World Cup that we can use Usman as a normal player,\" PSG coach Luis Enrique said. \u201cI think he is the best player this season by a long term and I think he deserves to win everything because he gave everything to the team and the team is going to achieve trophies, which is the most important thing for a club.\u201d",
      "Real Madrid has 15 European and five world titles, a modern global superpower brand established two decades ago in the Galacticos era of David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane and Luis Figo, then lifted loftier by Cristiano Ronaldo from 2009-18 and the rise of social media.",
      "PSG hadn't won a Ligue 1 title since 1995 when Qatar Sports Investments took over in 2011. Paris has won 11 of 13 French championships since 2013 but until May failed to become Europe's best, despite emulating Madrid's star collection when its lineup included Lionel Messi and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9.",
      "A group achieved more than the star system.",
      "\u201cWe've all made history, that is, the players, the staff, the sports director, the managers, the fans, we've all made history,\u201d Enrique, hired in July 2023, said through an interpreter.",
      "PSG dominated every aspect with a 631-255 advantage in completed passes and 67% possession, including 76.5% in the first half.",
      "\u201cIt's a painful defeat. We were not up to standard today,\u201d Real coach Xabi Alonso through an interpreter.",
      "PSG has outscored opponents 16-1 in six matches, getting three goals from Ruiz, two each from Dembele, Hakimi and Jo\u00e3o Neves, and one apiece from Dou\u00e9, Lee Kang-in, Kvaratskhelia, Mayulu, Ramos and Vitinha. It hasn't allowed a goal since a 1-0 loss to Botofogo in its second group-stage match.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re truly happy to be in another final. Now we have to enjoy it because we\u2019re doing something historic,\u201d Ruiz said. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to reach every final this season, and now we\u2019re one step away.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- A Denver museum known for its dinosaur displays has made a fossil bone find closer to home than anyone ever expected, under its own parking lot.",
      "It came from a hole drilled more than 750 feet (230 meters) deep to study geothermal heating potential for the Denver Museum of Nature & Science.",
      "The museum is popular with dinosaur enthusiasts of all ages. Full-size dinosaur skeletons amaze kiddos barely knee-high to a parent, much less to a Tyrannosaurus.",

      "With a bore only a couple of inches (5 centimeters) wide, museum officials struggled to describe just how unlikely it was to hit a dinosaur, even in a region with a fair number of such fossils.",
      "\u201cFinding a dinosaur bone in a core is like hitting a hole in one from the moon. It\u2019s like winning the Willy Wonka factory. It\u2019s incredible, it\u2019s super rare,\u201d said James Hagadorn, the museum\u2019s curator of geology.",
      "Only two similar finds have been noted in bore hole samples anywhere in the world, not to mention on the grounds of a dinosaur museum, according to museum officials.",
      "A vertebra of a smallish, plant-eating dinosaur is believed to be the source. It lived in the late Cretaceous period around 67.5 million years ago. An asteroid impact brought the long era of dinosaurs to an end around 66 million years ago, according to scientists.",
      "Fossilized vegetation also was found in the bore hole near the bone.",
      "\u201cThis animal was living in what was probably a swampy environment that would have been heavily vegetated at the time,\u201d said Patrick O'Connor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science.",
      "Dinosaur discoveries in the area over the years include portions of Tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops-type fossils. This one is Denver's deepest and oldest yet, O'Connor said.",
      "Other experts in the field vouched for the find's legitimacy but with mixed reactions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise, I guess. Scientifically it\u2019s not that exciting,\u201d said Thomas Williamson, curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science in Albuquerque.",
      "There was no way to tell exactly what species of dinosaur it was, Williamson noted.",
      "The find is \"absolutely legit and VERY COOL!\u201d Erin LaCount, director of education programs at the Dinosaur Ridge track site just west of Denver, said by email.",
      "The fossil's shape suggests it was a duck-billed dinosaur or thescelosaurus, a smaller but somewhat similar species, LaCount noted.",
      "The bore-hole fossil is now on display in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, of course, but there are no plans to look for more under the parking lot.",
      "\u201cI would love to dig a 763-foot (233-meter) hole in the parking lot to excavate that dinosaur, the rest of it. But I don't think that's going to fly because we really need parking,\u201d Hagadorn said.",

      "The Irish national watchdog serves as TikTok\u2019s lead data privacy regulator in the 27-nation EU because the company\u2019s European headquarters is based in Dublin.",
      "During an earlier investigation, TikTok initially told the regulator it didn\u2019t store European user data in China, and that data was only accessed remotely by staff in China. However, it later backtracked and said that some data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers. The watchdog responded at the time by saying it would consider further regulatory action.",
      "\u201cAs a result of that consideration, the DPC has now decided to open this new inquiry into TikTok,\u201d the watchdog said.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of the inquiry is to determine whether TikTok has complied with its relevant obligations under the GDPR in the context of the transfers now at issue, including the lawfulness of the transfers,\u201d the regulator said, referring to the European Union\u2019s strict privacy rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation.",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Peter Jackson's fascination with a large extinct New Zealand bird has led to an unusual partnership with a biotech company known for its grand and controversial plans to bring back lost species",
      "WASHINGTON -- Filmmaker Peter Jackson owns one of the largest private collections of bones of an extinct New Zealand bird called the moa. His fascination with the flightless ostrich-like bird has led to an unusual partnership with a biotech company known for its grand and controversial plans to bring back lost species.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal Biosciences announced an effort to genetically engineer living birds to resemble the extinct South Island giant moa \u2013 which once stood 12 feet (3.6 meters) tall \u2013 with $15 million in funding from Jackson and his partner Fran Walsh. The collaboration also includes the New Zealand-based Ng\u0101i Tahu Research Centre.",
      "\u201cThe movies are my day job, and the moa are my fun thing I do,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cEvery New Zealand schoolchild has a fascination with the moa.\u201d",
      "Outside scientists say the idea of bringing back extinct species onto the modern landscape is likely impossible, although it may be feasible to tweak the genes of living animals to have similar physical traits. Scientists have mixed feelings on whether that will be helpful, and some worry that focusing on lost creatures could distract from protecting species that still exist.",
      "The moa had roamed New Zealand for 4,000 years until they became extinct around 600 years ago, mainly because of overhunting. A large skeleton brought to England in the 19th century, now on display at the Yorkshire Museum, prompted international interest in the long-necked bird.",
      "Unlike Colossal's work with dire wolves, the moa project is in very early stages. It started with a phone call about two years ago after Jackson heard about the company's efforts to \u201cde-extinct\u201d \u2013 or create genetically similar animals to \u2013 species like the woolly mammoth and the dire wolf.",
      "Then Jackson put Colossal in touch with experts he\u2019d met through his own moa bone-collecting. At that point, he\u2019d amassed between 300 and 400 bones, he said.",
      "In New Zealand, it\u2019s legal to buy and sell moa bones found on private lands, but not on public conservation areas \u2013 nor to export them.",
      "The first stage of the moa project will be to identify well-preserved bones from which it may be possible to extract DNA, said Colossal\u2019s chief scientist Beth Shapiro.",
      "Those DNA sequences will be compared to genomes of living bird species, including the ground-dwelling tinamou and emu, \u201cto figure out what it is that made the moa unique compared to other birds,\u201d she said.",
      "Colossal used a similar process of comparing ancient DNA of extinct dire wolves to determine the genetic differences with gray wolves. Then scientists took blood cells from a living gray wolf and used CRISPR to genetically modify them in 20 different sites. Pups with long white hair and muscular jaws were born late last year.",
      "Working with birds presents different challenges, said Shapiro.",
      "Unlike mammals, bird embryos develop inside eggs, so the process of transferring an embryo to a surrogate will not look like mammalian IVF.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s lots of different scientific hurdles that need to be overcome with any species that we pick as a candidate for de-extinction,\u201d said Shapiro. \u201cWe are in the very early stages.\u201d",
      "If the Colossal team succeeds in creating a tall bird with huge feet and thick pointed claws resembling the moa, there\u2019s also the pressing question of where to put it, said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who is not involved in the project.",
      "\u201cCan you put a species back into the wild once you\u2019ve exterminated it there?\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s exceedingly unlikely that they could do this in any meaningful way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis will be an extremely dangerous animal,\u201d Pimm added.",
      "The direction of the project will be shaped by M\u0101ori scholars at the University of Canterbury\u2019s Ng\u0101i Tahu Research Centre. Ng\u0101i Tahu archaeologist Kyle Davis, an expert in moa bones, said the work has \u201creally reinvigorated the interest in examining our own traditions and mythology.\u201d",
      "At one of the archaeological sites that Jackson and Davis visited to study moa remains, called Pyramid Valley, there are also antique rock art done by M\u0101ori people \u2013 some depicting moa before their extinction.",
      "Paul Scofield, a project adviser and senior curator of natural history at the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, New Zealand, said he first met the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d director when he went to his house to help him identity which of the nine known species of moa the various bones represented.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t just collect some moa bones \u2013 he has a comprehensive collection,\u201d said Scofield.",

      "Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company is taking down antisemitic comments and other \u201cinappropriate posts\u201d made by its Grok chatbot, including some praising Adolf Hitler",
      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company said Wednesday that it's taking down \u201cinappropriate posts\" made by its Grok chatbot, which appeared to include antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "Grok was developed by Musk\u2019s xAI and pitched as alternative to \u201cwoke AI\u201d interactions from rival chatbots like Google\u2019s Gemini, or OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Musk said Friday that Grok has been improved significantly, and users \u201cshould notice a difference.\u201d",
      "Since then, Grok has shared several antisemitic posts, including the trope that Jews run Hollywood, and denied that such a stance could be described as Nazism.",
      "\u201cLabeling truths as hate speech stifles discussion,\u201d Grok said.",
      "It also appeared to praise Hitler, according to screenshots of posts that have now apparently been deleted.",
      "After making one of the posts, Grok walked back the comments, saying it was \u201can unacceptable error from an earlier model iteration, swiftly deleted\" and that it condemned \"Nazism and Hitler unequivocally \u2014 his actions were genocidal horrors.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,\u201d the Grok account posted early Wednesday, without being more specific.",
      "\"Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X. xAI is training only truth-seeking and thanks to the millions of users on X, we are able to quickly identify and update the model where training could be improved.",
      "Talia Ringer, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said it\u2019s likely that the Grok update that caused the chatbot to spew antisemitic messages this week was the \u201csoft launch\u201d of Grok 4, which Musk plans to introduce late Wednesday. But if that\u2019s the case, it doesn\u2019t appear ready, she said.",
      "\u201cFixing this is probably going to require retraining the model,\u201d she said. \u201cAll they can do at this point, if they\u2019re really going to launch tonight, are some more Band-Aids, like adding filters on responses and tweaking the prompt.\u201d",
      "Editing some of the chatbot\u2019s instructions \u201cmight make its behavior a little bit better\u201d but won\u2019t fix all of its problems.",
      "Musk and the xAI staff did release the latest version of the Grok platform late Wednesday, with the Tesla CEO making fantastical claims about the intelligence of version 4.0.",
      "He compared its intelligence to post-graduate level in \u201cevery subject\u201d and said while at times it might lack common sense and has not yet invented new things or discovered new technologies, it might \u201cas soon as this year.\u201d",
      "The Anti-Defamation League, which works to combat antisemitism, called out Grok's behavior.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing from Grok LLM right now is irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic, plain and simple,\u201d the group said in a post on X. \u201cThis supercharging of extremist rhetoric will only amplify and encourage the antisemitism that is already surging on X and many other platforms.\u201d",
      "Musk later waded into the debate, alleging that some users may have been trying to manipulate Grok into making the statements.",
      "\u201cGrok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed,\u201d he wrote on X, in response to comments that a user was trying to get Grok to make controversial and politically incorrect statements.",
      "Also Wednesday, a court in Turkey ordered a ban on Grok and Poland's digital minister said he would report the chatbot to the European Commission after it made vulgar comments about politicians and public figures in both countries.",
      "Krzysztof Gawkowski, who's also Poland's deputy prime minister, told private broadcaster RMF FM that his ministry would report Grok \u201cfor investigation and, if necessary, imposing a fine on X.\u201d Under an EU digital law, social media platforms are required to protect users or face hefty fines.",
      "\u201cI have the impression that we\u2019re entering a higher level of hate speech, which is controlled by algorithms, and that turning a blind eye ... is a mistake that could cost people in the future,\u201d Gawkowski told the station.",
      "Turkey's pro-government A Haber news channel reported that Grok posted vulgarities about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his late mother and well-known personalities. Offensive responses were also directed toward modern Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, other media outlets said.",
      "That prompted the Ankara public prosecutor to file for the imposition of restrictions under Turkey\u2019s internet law, citing a threat to public order. A criminal court approved the request early on Wednesday, ordering the country\u2019s telecommunications authority to enforce the ban.",
      "It's not the first time Grok's behavior has raised questions.",
      "Earlier this year the chatbot kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d despite being asked a variety of questions, most of which had nothing to do with the country. An \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d was behind the problem, xAI said.",

      "Less than a month after extending a deadline to ban TikTok for the third time, President Donald Trump told reporters late Friday night that, \u201cWe pretty much have a deal,\u201d on TikTok \u2014 but he did not offer details.",
      "The details and timing of a potential deal are not clear. TikTok did not immediately respond to messages for comment on Monday.",
      "Emarketer analyst Jeremy Goldman said while TikTok is \u201creportedly planning\u201d a U.S. version of its app to comply with legal restrictions, the platform \u2014 if it launches without the original TikTok algorithm \u2014 \u201crisks losing the very personalization that drives user engagement.\u201d",

      "\u201cAnd getting millions to download a new app is no small feat, to say the least,\u201d Goldman added.",
      "Here's what to know about where TikTok stands in the U.S. following Trump's comments.",
      "Though he has no clear legal basis to do so, Trump has continued to extend the deadline for TikTok to avoid a ban in the U.S. This gives his administration more time to broker a deal to bring the social media platform under American ownership.",
      "It is not clear how many times Trump can \u2014 or will \u2014 keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance. While there is no clear legal basis for the extensions, so far there have been no legal challenges against the administration. Trump has amassed more than 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. He said in January that he has a \u201cwarm spot for TikTok.\u201d",
      "For now, TikTok continues to function for its 170 million users in the U.S. Tech giants Apple, Google and Oracle were persuaded to continue to offer and support the app, on the promise that Trump\u2019s Justice Department would not use the law to seek potentially steep fines against them.",
      "Americans are even more closely divided on what to do about TikTok than they were two years ago.",
      "A recent Pew Research Center survey found that about one-third of Americans said they supported a TikTok ban, down from 50% in March 2023. Roughly one-third said they would oppose a ban, and a similar percentage said they weren\u2019t sure.",
      "Among those who said they supported banning the social media platform, about 8 in 10 cited concerns over users\u2019 data security being at risk as a major factor in their decision, according to the report.",
      "Trump said Friday that on Monday or Tuesday, the U.S. would take the proposal to Chinese leader Xi Jinping or one of his representatives. The president said he thinks they \u201cprobably\u201d need China to approve the deal but he wasn\u2019t sure they needed to.",
      "When asked whether he was confident China would approve the deal, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m not confident but I think so.\u201d",
      "He said that for the U.S., \u201cwe make a lot of money if the deal goes through.\"",

More than 20 million foreign visitors entered without a visa in 2024 \u2014 almost one-third of the total and more than double from the previous year, according to the National Immigration Administration.",

      "San Bernardino Bishop Alberto Rojas, who leads more than 1.5 million Catholics in Southern California, has formally excused parishioners from their weekly obligation to attend Mass following immigration detentions on two parish properties in the diocese.",
      "The dispensation is a move usually reserved for extenuating circumstances, like the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. But Rojas says it is necessary because of the fear of being apprehended and possibly deported that has gripped communities, including Catholic churches.",
      "\u201cThere is a real fear gripping many in our parish communities that if they venture out into any kind of public setting they will be arrested by immigration officers,\" said Rojas, in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\u201cSadly, that includes attending Mass. The recent apprehension of individuals at two of our Catholic parishes has only intensified that fear. I want our immigrant communities to know that their Church stands with them and walks with them through this trying time.\u201d",
      "Save for a serious reason, Catholics are obligated by their faith to attend Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation. In May, the Diocese of Nashville in Tennessee issued a similar statement following immigration enforcement actions in the area, excusing those who were fearful of attending Mass from their holy obligation, though it was not named as a formal dispensation.",
      "Rojas is an immigrant himself. He was born and raised in Aguascalientes, Mexico. He has been consistent in his support of immigrants and said when he assumed this role that it would be one of his top priorities.",
      "Last month, as federal agents made arrests and the federal government deployed the National Guard to maintain order amid protests in Los Angeles, Rojas issued a statement calling out federal agents entering parish properties and \u201cseizing several people,\" creating an environment of fear, confusion and anxiety.",
      "\u201cIt is not of the Gospel of Jesus Christ \u2014 which guides us in all that we do,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask all political leaders and decision-makers to please reconsider these tactics immediately in favor of an approach that respects human rights and human dignity and builds toward a more lasting, comprehensive reform of our immigration system.\u201d",
      "The diocese, which was created in 1978, serves over 1.5 million Catholics in Riverside County, which is 52.5% Latino and San Bernardino County, which is 56.4% Latino, according to the 2020 U.S. Census.",
      "Members of local parishes who are in the U.S. without documents have made positive contributions to their communities \u201cwith no other issues than their legal status,\u201d the bishop said.",
      "\u201cMost of them are here because they wanted to save their families; they had no other option. I believe that they would love to be legalized, but who can help them?\u201d",
      "Rojas said he knows these people would be in church but for the threat to their safety and their family unity.",
      "\u201cWith all the worry and anxiety that they are feeling I wanted to take away, for a time, the burden they may be feeling from not being able to fulfill this commitment to which our Catholic faithful are called,\u201d Rojas said.",
      "Pastor Omar Coronado with Inland Congregations United for Change, a faith-based nonprofit serving Riverside and San Bernardino counties, called the bishop's decree \u201can extraordinary act of moral courage and pastoral care.\u201d",
      "At a time when so many families are living in fear and uncertainty, the Bishop\u2019s voice offers not just protection but hope,\" he said in a statement. \"We\u2019re deeply grateful for his leadership in reminding us that faith is not meant to hide behind walls, but to stand with the vulnerable.\u201d",
      "The Diocese of San Bernardino is the nation\u2019s fifth-largest Catholic diocese and second-largest in California next to the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which is the largest in the country with about 5 million members. Neither the Los Angeles Archdiocese nor the neighboring Diocese of Orange, which serves about 1.3 million Catholics, has issued similar dispensations.",
      "A spokesperson for the Diocese of Orange said they have in recent weeks taken steps to support the immigrant community, including asking priests to bring Communion and celebrate Mass in the homes of those who are fearful of leaving their homes. The diocese has also shared protocols with parishes and Catholic schools to help them prepare and respond properly to the presence of immigration officials on church or school grounds, he said. In addition, the diocese is also coordinating efforts to have priests and deacons accompany and spiritually support people at immigration court hearings.",

      "Millions of U.S. workers who earn tips and overtime pay may be eligible for a federal tax break when they file their 2025 income taxes next year.",
      "But which workers will qualify for the new deductions is among the details the government has to work out after President Donald Trump's signature spending and policy package won final congressional approval.",
      "Under the bill Trump signed into law on July 4, the U.S. Treasury Department must publish a list by Oct. 2 of occupations that qualify for tax-free tips. The department is also expected to publish guidance on how to report tips and overtime pay, and what documentation will be required.",
      "The deduction provisions are not permanent but were written to expire after the 2028 tax year.",
      "Overtime pay isn\u2019t currently separated out on an employee\u2019s W-2 tax form, for example, but employers generally keep track of it and itemize it on employees\u2019 pay stubs, said Miguel Burgos, a certified public accountant with TurboTax.",
      "Employers should continue to withhold taxes while waiting for guidance, Burgos said. The bill doesn\u2019t apply to state and local taxes or to federal payroll taxes, which help fund Social Security and Medicare.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about tax-free tips and overtime:",
      "The bill says eligible workers are those who already regularly received tips before December 2024. In the restaurant industry alone, there are 2.1 million tipped servers and bartenders, according to the National Restaurant Association.",
      "Barbers, hairdressers, nail technicians and delivery drivers are also expected to be included. Workers must include a Social Security number when they file their taxes to be eligible, and a spouse\u2019s Social Security number if they\u2019re married and filing jointly.",
      "Workers will be able to deduct up to $25,000 in tips if they make less than $150,000 (or $300,000 if they\u2019re married and filing jointly). The amount workers can deduct is reduced by $100 for every $1,000 they make over $150,000.",
      "The change will not affect around 40% of tipped workers since they already pay little to no income tax, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. The other 60% of tipped workers are expected to see an average tax cut of $1,800 per year.",
      "Both cash tips and credit cards are included. Tips pooled together and then distributed to a restaurant\u2019s employees are also included, although servers may be less inclined to participate in tip pooling now that they are eligible for a tax deduction. Service charges \u2013 such as an automatic gratuity for a large party \u2013 aren\u2019t included because the bill makes clear that eligible tips must be \u201cpaid voluntarily.\u201d",
      "The Budget Lab at Yale estimates that 8% of U.S. hourly workers and 4% of salaried workers are regularly paid overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which requires overtime pay of at least time and a half once employees have worked 40 hours in a week. People working in many jobs, including clergy, teachers and executives, are exempt from federal overtime rules.",
      "Workers can deduct up to $12,500 in overtime (or up to $25,000 in a joint return). Like the tip measure, the amount workers can deduct is reduced if they make more than $150,000. And they must include a Social Security number when they file.",
      "The average worker is expected to see a tax cut of between $1,400 and $1,750 per year, according to the White House Council of Economic Advisers.",
      "According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, tax-free tips would reduce federal revenue by $31 billion between the 2026 and 2029 fiscal years, while tax-free overtime would reduce federal revenue by $90 billion during the same period.",

      "The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a trade association of firearms manufacturers that ships firearms into New York, had sued over the law, saying it was pre-empted by the federal 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which blocks litigation that could destroy the firearms industry.",
      "In May 2022, Judge Mae A. D'Agostino threw out the lawsuit, rejecting arguments that the law's language did not adequately explain what was prohibited. She said the law closely tracked the language of New York's general public nuisance law, which has been \u201cgood law since 1965.\u201d",

He said the law creates \u201ca new pathway for victims and their families to hold bad actors in the gun industry accountable for their role in fueling the epidemic of gun violence that is ravaging communities across the Empire State.\u201d",
      "Everytown Law and the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence were among gun violence protection groups that filed an amicus brief in the case, arguing that the new law \u201csimply does not create the free-for-all\u201d that gun makers predicted.",
      "Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs concurred in the ruling, despite some reservations. He wrote that New York had \u201ccontrived a broad public nuisance statute that applies solely to \u2018gun industry members\u2019 and is enforceable by a mob of public and private actors.\u201d",
      "And he added: \u201cThe intent of Congress when it closes a door is not for States to thus jimmy a window.\u201d",
      "Jacobs, citing a recent Supreme Court ruling, said he agrees with the other two judges on the panel that the law could be applied consistent with the federal law and the U.S. Constitution.",
      "But he also wrote that the New York gun law is \u201cnothing short of an attempt to end-run\u201d the federal law, noting that then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo said when he signed it that it would \u201cright the wrong\u201d done by the federal law.",
      "\u201cThere is some legitimate reach to the law, which suffices for us to affirm the dismissal of this facial challenge. Just how limited that reach is must await future cases,\u201d Jacobs said.",

      "The 1925 Scopes \u201cMonkey Trial\u201d in Tennessee, where a teacher was prosecuted for teaching evolution, continues to influence debates on religion in public schools",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- One hundred years ago, a public high school teacher stood trial in Dayton, Tennessee, for teaching human evolution. His nation is still feeling the reverberations today.",
      "The law books record it as State of Tennessee v. John T. Scopes. History remembers it as the \u201c Monkey Trial.\u201d The case ballooned into a national spectacle, complete with a courthouse showdown between a renowned, agnostic defense attorney and a famous fundamentalist Christian politician who defended the Bible on the witness stand.",
      "In a sweltering, pre-air conditioning courtroom, the trial became a linchpin for a tense debate that wasn\u2019t just a small-town aberration.",
      "\u201cThis is a broad-based culture war of which the Scopes trial is just one place lightning struck,\u201d says James Hudnut-Beumler, professor of American religious history at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Today, new state laws requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms are facing legal challenges. As the Supreme Court leans right, there is an ongoing conservative push to infuse more religion \u2014 often Christianity \u2014 into taxpayer-funded education. Advocates of religious diversity and church-state separation are countering it in capitols, courts and public squares.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting on an almost daily basis,\u201d says Robert Tuttle, a religion and law professor at George Washington University Law School in Washington, D.C.",
      "That Tennessee jury found Scopes guilty of violating the state\u2019s Butler Act \u2014 of teaching \u201cany theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible.\u201d",
      "A century later, the role of religion in public schools \u2014 and whether to keep it out entirely \u2014 is still being fiercely debated.",
      "While attempts to interlace America and the divine are not new, from the last half of the 20th century to today they are driven by a perceived threat among white Christians who think their dominant spot in politics and culture is being eroded by secularism or multiculturalism, Tuttle says.",
      "Other recent examples of the debate over religion in schools include adding chaplains and Bibles to classrooms, infusing designated prayer time into the school day and expanding voucher programs that can be used at religious schools. At the Supreme Court, the justices effectively stopped the first taxpayer-funded Catholic charter school and gave parents a religious exemption for LGBTQ+-related instruction.",
      "Tuttle's scholarship was used in the recent federal appeals court ruling that declared Louisiana\u2019s Ten Commandments law unconstitutional, citing a similar Kentucky law the Supreme Court ruled against in 1980.",
      "Tuttle and his co-author, Ira Lupu, assert that the principles underlying the Establishment Clause \u2014 the First Amendment\u2019s ban on the government establishing a religion \u2014 remain alive despite arguments that cite a change made in a 2022 school prayer ruling by the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cWe have good reasons not to concede the battlefield to the forces aimed at eliminating the idea of a secular state,\u201d their article states. \u201cWhen they overclaim their victories, others should speak up.\u201d",
      "The day after the court ruling, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the Texas Ten Commandments bill that had easily passed the GOP-controlled state legislature. Lawsuits have been filed to block it and the Arkansas law that was approved earlier this year.",
      "Abbott has taken on a Ten Commandments issue before. He reiterated his support for the new law while celebrating the 20th anniversary of his 2005 Supreme Court victory that prevented efforts to tear down the Commandments monument on the grounds of the state Capitol.",
      "\u201cI will always defend the historical connection between the Ten Commandments and their influence on the history of Texas,\u201d he says in a video posted on X.",
      "Texas Values, a conservative Christian law and policy nonprofit, rallied support for the Texas bill. If other ideals are shared in the classroom, the Ten Commandments should be able to be shared as well, says Mary Elizabeth Castle, director of government relations for the organization.",
      "A similar argument was made in 1922 by Scopes prosecutor William Jennings Bryan, a onetime populist firebrand who became the face of the anti-evolution movement.",
      "\u201cIf the Bible cannot be taught, why should Christian taxpayers permit the teaching of guesses that make the Bible a lie?\u201d Bryan wrote in The New York Times. \u201cA teacher might just as well write over the door of his room, \u2018Leave Christianity behind you, all ye who enter here.'\u201d",
      "About 60 years earlier, advances in biblical criticism caused conservative Christians to double down on rejecting anything they believe conflicted with their interpretation of the Bible, human evolution included, says Hudnut-Beumler. He blames weaponized post-World War I rhetoric for spreading anti-evolution beliefs to legislation. He sees parallels to today.",
      "\u201cWhatever we\u2019re going through now,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s the product of people manufacturing rhetoric in a way that stokes fear.\u201d",
      "Castle sees the 2022 school prayer decision as a step in the right direction. \u201cThere\u2019s always just going to be that conflict where people are trying to trample on religious freedom,\u201d she says, \u201cand so that\u2019s why we do the work that we do.\u201d",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, joined by other legal groups, is representing the families in Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas that sued to block new Ten Commandments laws. A much younger ACLU, boosted by the star power of defense attorney Clarence Darrow, represented Scopes, who agreed to be a test case challenging the Butler Act and to bring attention to Dayton.",
      "Daniel Mach, who directs the ACLU program on freedom of religion and belief, sees a through line between 1925 and what he describes as a present-day assault on the separation of church and state.",
      "\u201cThere are those who want to use the machinery of the state \u2014 and in particular, our public schools \u2014 to impose their religious beliefs on everyone else,\u201d Mach says. \u201cThe constitutional guarantee of church-state separation has served us as a nation quite well over the years in general. And there\u2019s simply no reason to turn back the clock now.\u201d",
      "In 1925, the ACLU lost the Scopes case. It would be more than 40 years before the Supreme Court would overrule an anti-evolution teaching ban. But the trial, which took place from July 10-21, dealt a big hit to Bryan\u2019s reputation. He died days after it ended.",
      "Though a brief legal circus, the trial inflamed social divisions. Conservatives and fundamentalists in the Midwest and South felt mocked by those they considered liberal, East Coast elites. \u201cThey were humiliated,\u201d Tuttle says. \u201cThat\u2019s internalized, and it carries through.\u201d",
      "In the 1940s, tensions flared with a school funding case before the Supreme Court. They returned in the 1960s when the justices ruled against school-sponsored prayer and Bible readings. It was upsetting, Tuttle says, to conservative Christians who saw schools as a source of morality.",
      "\u201cThe link you see with the Scopes case is a sense of alienation and devaluing of what civic experience means to them,\u201d he says.",
      "Suzanne Rosenblith, an expert on religion in public education at the University at Buffalo in New York, sees the wave of court cases as primarily First Amendment tensions.",
      "\u201cYour argument for removing something can be seen as ensuring that Congress makes no law respecting the establishment of religion. And my wanting something included, that\u2019s my way of exercising my right to religious freedom,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it could be on the same issue.\u201d",
      "A lesson to be learned from the last 100 years, Rosenblith says, is that America remains a pluralist democracy and needs to be approached as such.",
      "\u201cAll sides are going to win some and lose some,\u201d she says. \u201cBut how can we treat each other, especially those with whom we disagree on these significant issues, how do we treat each other more seriously?\u201d",

      "The Los Angeles Fire Department says 31 workers have been safely removed from an industrial tunnel after part of the structure collapsed",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Thirty-one construction workers inside a huge industrial tunnel in Los Angeles made it to safety after a portion of it collapsed Wednesday evening, an outcome officials called a blessing after they initially feared much worse.",
      "The cave-in appears to have occurred between the tunnel boring machine 5 miles (8 kilometers) in from the sole entrance and the construction workers who were working 6 miles (9.6 kilometers) in, said Michael Chee, spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, which is in charge of the nearly $700 million project. The workers were about 400 feet (121 meters) underground.",
      "Authorities were still investigating the cause, Chee said.",
      "The workers scrambled over loose soil more than 12 feet (19.3 meters) high to reach the tunnel boring machine and then were transported back to the opening. Aerial footage showed workers being brought out of the tunnel in a yellow cage hoisted up by a crane.",
      "None of those rescued had major injuries, authorities said.",
      "Arally Orozco said she was at church when her phone started buzzing with calls and then her son texted her the news of the tunnel where her three brothers worked.",
      "\u201cIt was sad and scary,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cWe feared the worst.\u201d",
      "After an hour, she managed to get through to one brother who told her they had to squeeze through a tight space to get out.",
      "\u201cMy brother was crying,\u201d she said. \u201cHe told me he thought he was going to die underground.\u201d",
      "LA City Councilmember Tim McOsker praised the workers for keeping cool heads.",
      "\u201cThis is a highly technical, difficult project. And they knew exactly what to do. They knew how to secure themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThank goodness for the good people that were down in the tunnel.\u201d",

      "Work will not resume until the project contractor assesses what happened and deems the site safe, authorities said.",

      "As floodwaters rose in Texas, camp counselors hoisted children onto rafters, carried them to dry ground and sang with them to keep them calm. Some died trying to keep their campers safe.",
      "These heroics have cast a spotlight on the people who fill these roles. Often teenagers, some just a year or two removed from being a camper themselves, counselors are a staple of the summer camp experience for the more than 25 million children whom the American Camp Association estimates attend camp annually.",
      "\u201cThank goodness for the brave counselors,\" said Keli Rabon, a Houston mother whose 7- and 9-year-old sons were rescued from Camp La Junta. She said the counselors who saved them were \u201creally just kids themselves.\u201d",
      "More than 160 people still are believed to be missing, and at least 118 have died in the floods that laid waste to the Hill Country region of Texas. The riverbanks and hills of Kerr County are filled with vacation cabins, youth camps and campgrounds, including Camp Mystic, the century-old all-girls Christian summer camp where at least 27 campers and counselors died. Officials said five campers and one counselor from the camp have still not been found.",
      "Texas inspectors signed off on Camp Mystic\u2019s emergency planning just two days before the catastrophic flooding. The specifics of the plan weren't released, but under state law it had to include instructing campers what to do if they need to evacuate and assigning specific duties to each staff member and counselor.",
      "Henry DeHart, interim president and CEO of the American Camp Association, said counselors typically receive training in areas such as risk management, emergency procedures, child development, abuse prevention, and supervision. Over the years, they've stepped in during emergencies, from wildfires to medical crises, while grabbing few headlines, he said.",
      "\u201cWhat happened in Texas is a profound reminder of the immense responsibility camp counselors carry and how seriously they take that duty,\u201d he said.",
      "As Helen Hardymon watches the news stories about Texas, the 19-year-old wonders what she would have done if the tragedy had struck her camp, Westview on the James. The summer camp sits on a portion of the James River about a 40-minute drive from downtown Richmond, Virginia.",
      "\u201cOn paper, yeah, I\u2019m prepared,\u201d she said. \u201cI know the protocol. I know our meeting place. I knew who to call, who to radio. But in the moment, especially with an environmental concern or emergency, like, it is so unpredictable.\u201d",
      "There has been a lot of rain this summer, and she knows what it is like when kids are cold and wet.",
      "Her campers had just gone to bed as she spoke. They had to miss their evening showers in the bathhouse because there was so much thunder. They were calm, but she has seen worried kids cry or simply shut down.",
      "\u201cIt reaches a point, an emotional point that they might have never experienced without a parent there,\u201d said Hardymon, now in the hiring process to become a firefighter.",
      "Hardymon's training started two week before campers arrived. The camp used to make the first week of training optional, a time to certify people as lifeguards or to work the zip line. But starting this year, both weeks become mandatory to cover all the material, which ranges from homesickness to how to safely put a child into a harness for the high-ropes course, said Camp Director Anthony Gomez.",
      "The training can start years earlier. Gomez said many camps \u2014 his included \u2014 offer programs to turn campers into counselors. Hardymon, herself a former camper, is an example.",
      "In some places, young teens pay a discounted rate to attend a counselor-in-training program. The teens then might work at the camp part-time or volunteer for a few more summers, the tasks assigned to them gradually increasing before they become full-fledged counselors.",
      "\u201cThey are back at the camp that they love, they are participating in the program, but now their participation has shifted into paying this forward onto the next generation of folks,\u201d Gomez said.",
      "By the time they are in senior, paid positions, most are in college and deeply rooted in their camp's culture, said Barry Garst, a former camp director of several years and current professor of youth development at Clemson University.",
      "\u201cThey understand your expectations for supporting youth, understand the camp's mission and philosophy,\u201d Garst said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot harder to teach those things as opposed to having individuals come into the program that already understand it.\u201d",
      "Jim Sibthorp, a professor at the University of Utah who researches summer camps, said one of the things that makes these camp counselors so powerful is that they are seen as closer to peers than parent figures. The relationships are further strengthened by bunking together at night.",
      "\u201cEven in normal camps, they\u2019re leaders because there are decisions to be made,\u201d Sibthorp said. \u201cAnd, you know, these children are looking up to them to make those decisions.\u201d",

Officials said five campers and one counselor have still not been found.",

      "The event was held as search crews and volunteers continued to scour miles along the Guadalupe River for the people still missing.",

      "The floods are now the deadliest from inland flooding in the U.S. since 1976, when Colorado\u2019s Big Thompson Canyon flooded, killing 144 people, said Bob Henson, a meteorologist with Yale Climate Connections.",
      "Officials have been seeking more information about those who were in the Hill Country, a popular tourist destination, during the holiday weekend but did not register at a camp or a hotel and may have been in the area without many people knowing, Gov. Greg Abbott has said.",
      "Public officials in the area have come under repeated criticism amid questions about the timeline of what happened and why widespread warnings were not sounded and more preparations were not made.",
      "Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha has said those questions will be answered, but the focus now is on recovering victims.",
      "The governor called on state lawmakers to approve new flood warning systems and strengthen emergency communications in flood prone areas throughout the state when the Legislature meets in a special session that Abbott had already called to address other issues starting July 21. Abbott also called on lawmakers to provide financial relief for response and recovery efforts from the storms.",
      "\u201cWe must ensure better preparation for such events in the future,\u201d Abbott said in a statement.",
      "Local leaders have talked for years about the need for a flood warning system, but concerns about costs and noise led to missed opportunities to put up sirens.",
      "President Donald Trump has pledged to provide whatever relief Texas needs  to recover, and is planning to visit the state Friday.",
      "Polls taken before the floods show Americans largely believe the federal government should play a major role in preparing for and responding to natural disasters.",
      "Catastrophic flooding is a growing worry. On Tuesday, a deluge in New Mexico triggered flash floods that killed three people.",
      "Although it\u2019s difficult to attribute a single weather event to climate change, experts say a warming atmosphere and oceans make these type of storms more likely.",
      "After the ceremony in Kerrville on Wednesday, children and families mingled on the field, and some students formed prayer circles. Licensed counselors and therapists were also on hand to meet with people.",
      "Andrew Brown, who was at the vigil to honor a Tivy High School soccer coach who died in the flooding, said he believes a warning system with a siren would be helpful.",

      "The mountain village of Ruidoso has returned to the grim rituals of rebuilding from flash flooding",
      "RUIDOSO, N.M. -- The mountain village of Ruidoso returned to the grim rituals of rebuilding after flash flooding and a deadly natural disaster, just one year after wildfire and intense flooding reshaped the popular vacation getaway and its surroundings.",
      "Broken tree limbs, twisted metal, crumpled cars and muddy debris remained as crews worked to clear roads and culverts in the wake of Tuesday's flash flood that killed three people \u2014 including two children \u2014 and significantly damaged as many as 50 homes, with one home carried away entirely.",
      "Tracy Haragan, a Ruidoso native on the verge of retirement, watched from his home as a surging river carried away the contents of nine nearby residences.",
      "\u201cYou watched everything they owned, everything they had \u2014 everything went down,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is such a great town, it just takes a tail-whipping every once in a while. ... We always survive.\u201d",
      "An intense bout of monsoon rains set the disaster in motion Tuesday. Water rushed from the surrounding mountainside, overwhelming the Rio Ruidoso and taking with it a man and two children from an RV park along the river. The bodies were found downstream during search and rescue efforts.",
      "The children \u2014 a 4-year-old girl and a 7-year-old boy \u2014 had been camping with their parents when they were swept away. The father and mother were being treated for injuries at a hospital in Texas, according to officials at Fort Bliss, where the father is stationed.",
      "Mayor Lynn Crawford said hearts are broken over the lives lost and stomachs are in knots as residents begin to take stock of the damage.",
      "A popular summer retreat, Ruidoso is no stranger to tragedy. It has spent a year rebuilding following destructive wildfires last summer and the flooding that followed.",
      "Rebuilding again in Ruidoso will be hard, if not impossible, said Riverside RV Park owner Barbara Arthur.",
      "Arthur says her guests scrambled up a nearby slope when the river started coursing through the site Tuesday afternoon. She also lost her home in flood.",
      "It was the sixth time the river rose in the last several weeks and by far the worst, she said. And Tuesday\u2019s rainfall was more than could be absorbed by the hillsides and canyons within a wildfire burn scar.",
      "The floodwaters of the Rio Ruidoso rose more than 20 feet (6 meters) on Tuesday to set a record high-water mark, said National Weather Service meteorologist Todd Shoemake in Albuquerque. That eclipsed the previously recorded high in July 2024 by nearly 5 feet (1.5 meters).",
      "About 3.5 inches (8.9 centimeters) of rain fell over the South Fork burn scar in just an hour and a half, Crawford said. As little as a quarter of an inch (about 6 millimeters) of rain over a burn scar can cause flooding.",
      "\u201cThey were probably already getting some runoff from upstream before it even actually started raining on top of the wildfire burn scar,\u201d Shoemake said. \u201cIt really was just kind of a terrible coincidence of events that led to that.\u201d",
      "He likened the intense rainfall to a 100-year storm, which has a 1% chance of happening in any given year.",
      "Emergency crews completed dozens of swift water rescues before the water receded Tuesday. Two National Guard teams and several local crews already were in the area when the flooding began, said Danielle Silva of the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.",
      "New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham requested a presidential disaster declaration, tallying more than $50 million in emergency response expenditures, including water rescues, and damage to public infrastructure, including toppled bridges and washed out roadways. The estimate includes flood damage at Ruidoso and beyond from monsoon rainstorms since late June.",
      "Ruidoso has also recently requested $100 million in federal aid to convert flood-prone private land to public property after successive years of violent flooding laid bare the dangers of an expanded flood plain.",
      "The floods at Ruidoso came just days after flash floods in Texas killed at least 120 people and left more than 160 people missing.",
      "Local officials said the village, as the flood hit, was still in the process of replacing outdoor warning sirens destroyed in last year's wildfire and reassessing risks along the local flood plain.",
      "Crawford reiterated Wednesday that Ruidoso will continue to be in the crosshairs with each monsoon, as there's still work to do to recover from the wildfire. The rainy season begins in June and runs through September.",
      "The river, meanwhile, is running thick with sediment that can settle and raise future water levels.",
      "The village\u2019s tourism-based economy also has been thrown into turmoil again. With floodwaters running through Ruidoso Downs, one of the horse track's signature races that was scheduled to start Friday has been derailed.",
      "The mayor said people are anxious as the monsoon is sure to bring more rain throughout the summer.",
      "\u201cYesterday was a good lesson \u2014 you know, that Mother Nature is a much bigger, powerful force than we are,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cAnd that we can do a lot of things to protect ourselves and to try to help direct and whatever, but we cannot control.\u201d",

      "INGRAM, Texas -- Riding on horseback through brush and over numerous dead turkeys, Margo Mellon spent Tuesday scanning the flood-ravaged ground of Texas\u2019 Hill Country for dead bodies.",
      "As she and her rescue mates trudged through the muddy terrain, state officials announced that more than 160 people are still believed to be missing. With countless miles swamped by the floods, nobody knows when the searches will end.",
      "The triumphs of finding people alive ended days ago, while the mission of recovering bodies that might include even more children is far from over. The grim undertaking has prompted questions about how first responders and rescue teams are able to mentally reckon with the work ahead.",
      "Mellon, a 24-year-old volunteer with search and recovery organization Texas EquuSearch that is a working with local fire departments, said for now she feels emotionally detached as she focuses on the task. But she knows the experience will be difficult to process once she returns home to Corpus Christi.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll try not to think about it too much,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll just think about the fact that at least the families have closure.\u201d",
      "The flash floods deluged homes, campgrounds and an all-girls summer camp over Fourth of July weekend. More than 100 people have been killed, including 30 children.",
      "\u201cWe process it the best we can,\u201d Lt. Colonel Ben Baker of the Texas Game Wardens said Tuesday at a news conference after taking a deep breath.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re making sure they have the support,\u201d Baker said of the search teams, adding that \u201cto see a child in that loss of life is extremely tragic.\u201d",
      "The discussion about first responders' mental health likely wouldn't have occurred a generation ago, experts say. And while first responders have higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and other psychological health conditions, most are able to process the heavy realities of the job.",
      "Nick Culotta, who was a paramedic in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, said people in the profession are able to compartmentalize and work on autopilot. Despite the challenges of recovering bodies, he said the work is crucial.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not the goal that you are hoping for,\" he said. \"But just being able to give someone closure that their loved one was found can give us a sense of accomplishment. There are still people unaccounted for from Katrina.\u201d",
      "Mental health challenges may follow, he said, which is why learning how to rest and get support is important.",
      "\u201cPeople will still continue to call for police. People will still get sick. Things will still catch fire,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat's really important is understanding your limitations. And having resources available to use, whether it be an anonymous help line or a sit-down with a mental health counselor.\u201d",
      "The stresses of the job affect everyone differently, said Robin Jacobowitz, interim director at the Institute for Disaster Mental Health at SUNY New Paltz.",
      "A lot of it depends on what the first responder experienced previously, both on the job and off, she said.",
      "\u201cFor these responders who are working in Texas, it's probably not their first incident,\u201d said Jacobowitz, who co-authored a report on the mental health needs of New York\u2019s first responders. \u201cSo what they\u2019re dealing with now is probably layered on top of what they have dealt with in the past. And those things add up.\u201d",
      "Stress from the job can show up through sleeplessness, flashbacks or introversion, Jacobowitz said, as well as feelings of \u201cCould I have done more? Did I do enough?\u201d",
      "Most will lean on friends and family as well as clergy or spiritual advisers. But because many don't want to burden them with what they've seen, they also lean on each other and mental health professionals.",
      "One of the biggest predictors of recovering from a traumatic event is the degree of social support a person has.",
      "\u201cNot every traumatic incident turns into full-blown PTSD,\u201d Jacobowitz said. \u201cYou may struggle with PTSD-like symptoms and then be able to work through them.\"",
      "There's been a marked shift toward acknowledging the mental health challenges of the job, said Ian Stanley, a University of Colorado emergency medicine professor.",
      "Much of the change has occurred in the last decade, pushed along by the growing focus on PTSD among veterans coupled with the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic on first responders, Stanley said.",
      "But there's still a long way to go because the issue \"hasn\u2019t been talked about for so long,\u201d he said. Challenges include serving first responders who work for volunteer organizations or in rural areas where there are fewer mental health resources.",
      "The issue also hasn't been studied as extensively as it has among veterans and service members.",
      "Stanley stressed that most first responders are \u201cresilient to these challenges and live happy, healthy, productive, resilient lives.\u201d",
      "But he noted that many of those recovering flood victims in Texas are in small communities.",
      "\u201cThey might be recovering bodies of people they know or their neighbors,\u201d he said. \"And that's really challenging.\"",

      "Tom Fletcher told the U.N. Security Council that the food security crisis in the Arab world\u2019s poorest country, which is beset by civil war, has been accelerating since late 2023.",
      "The number of people going hungry could climb to over 18 million by September, he warned, and the number of children with acute malnutrition could surge to 1.2 million early next year, \u201cleaving many at risk of permanent physical and cognitive damage.\u201d",
      "Fletcher said the U.N. hasn\u2019t seen the current level of deprivation since before a U.N.-brokered truce in early 2022. He noted that it is unfolding as global funding for humanitarian aid is plummeting, which means reductions or cuts in food. According to the U.N., as of mid-May, the U.N.\u2019s $2.5 billion humanitarian appeal for Yemen this year had received just $222 million, just 9%.",
      "Yemen has been embroiled in civil war since 2014, when Iranian-backed Houthi rebels seized the capital of Sanaa, forcing the internationally recognized government into exile in Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition intervened months later and has been battling the rebels since 2015 to try and restore the government.",
      "The war has devastated Yemen, created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters, and turned into a stalemated proxy conflict. More than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, have been killed.",

      "Negotiations offer the best hope to address the complex conflict, he said, and the longer it is drawn out \u201cthere is a risk that divisions could deepen further.\u201d",
      "Grundberg said both sides must signal a willingness to explore peaceful avenues \u2014 and an important signal would be the release of all conflict-related detainees. The parties have agreed to an all-for-all release, he said, but the process has stagnated for over a year.",

      "WASHINGTON -- After deadly flooding in central Texas in 1987, some thought they'd proven they could handle Mother Nature's best punch. Then came this month's horrific flash floods, when unfathomable amounts of rain fell in only hours and more than 100 people died.",
      "Before 2021, the typically temperate Pacific Northwest and western Canada seemed highly unlikely to get a killer heat wave, but they did. Tropical Hawaii once felt an ocean away from drought-fueled wildfires, until it wasn't. And many in inland North Carolina figured hurricanes were a coastal problem until the remnants of Helene blew in last year.",
      "Climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense, according to climate scientists and government data. But people and governments are generally living in the past and haven't embraced that extreme weather is now the norm, to say nothing about preparing for the nastier future that\u2019s in store, experts in meteorology, disasters and health told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cWhat happens with climate change is that what used to be extreme becomes average, typical, and what used to never occur in a human lifetime or maybe even in a thousand years becomes the new extreme,\" Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said. \"We start to experience things that just basically never happened before.\u201d",
      "The 10-year summer average of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's climate extreme index, which tracks hurricanes, heavy rain, droughts and high and low temperatures, is 58% higher than it was in the 1980s.",
      "Despite the grim trajectory, society isn't acting with enough alarm, Oppenheimer said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that we sit there and do absolutely nothing while these risks are coming right at us like a moving railroad train and we\u2019re standing in the tracks. And then all of a sudden, bam,\u201d he said.",
      "Although the changing climate is the biggest problem, the way we react to or ignore the changes could make a bad situation worse, experts said.",
      "Marshall Shepherd, a University of Georgia meteorology professor who previously served as president of the American Meteorological Society, said people tend to base decisions on how they fared during past extreme weather events, including storms that didn't end up directly affecting them. This leaves them overly optimistic that they'll also fare well today, even though storms have grown more fierce.",
      "He points to the Texas flooding.",
      "\u201cThat is flash flood alley. We know that floods happen in that region all the time. ... I've already seen normalcy bias statements by people in the regions saying, well, we get flooding all the time,\u201d Shepherd said, pointing out that the amount of rain that fell in only a few hours last week was anything but normal.",
      "People need to shift how they think about disasters, even if they don\u2019t live in the most disaster-prone locations, said Kim Klockow McClain, an extreme weather social scientist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research who studies communicating disaster warnings and risk.",
      "\u201cThe message needs to be, if you\u2019re used to some degree of nuisance flooding, every so often, look at what happened in Texas and realize that this is a shifting baseline,\u201d she said.",
      "Time and again after catastrophic storms and wildfires, people whose lives were upended say they didn't think it could happen to them. This mindset helps people cope, but with extreme weather happening more frequently and in more places, it can prevent them from adequately preparing.",
      "\u201cIt's sort of a psychological mechanism to protect us that it can't happen to me,\u201d said Susan Cutter, co-director of the Hazards Vulnerability & Resilience Institute at the University of South Carolina.",
      "Surviving past extreme events can leave people believing that it won't happen again or, if it does, that they'll be fine, said Lori Peek, director of the Natural Hazards Center at the University of Colorado. She said this overconfidence can be dangerous: \u201cJust because I\u2019ve lived through a fire or a flood or a hurricane or a tornado, that does not mean that the next time is going to look like the last time.\u201d",
      "As the weather has grown more extreme, our ability to prepare for and react to it hasn't kept pace, the scientists said.",
      "\u201cInfrastructure is aging in our country and is more vulnerable given the fact that there are just simply, as a matter of fact, more people living in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Peek said. \u201cAs our population has continued to rise, it\u2019s not only that we have more people in the country, it\u2019s also that we have more people living in particularly hazardous areas like our coastal areas.\u201d",
      "The Trump Administration's mass layoffs and planned cuts to agencies that study climate and help warn of and deal with disasters \u2014 the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Weather Service and research labs at the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey \u2014 could further worsen the situation, several experts said.",
      "Smart and experienced people have already left these agencies and it could take years to make up for their knowledge and abilities, they said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re destroying the capability we have that we\u2019re going to need more and more in the future,\u201d Oppenheimer said.",
      "As for future disasters, the country needs to figure out and plan for the worst-case scenario instead of looking to the past, Peek said.",
      "\u201cThis is our future,\u201d Peek said. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that we\u2019re living into a future where there are going to be more fires and floods and heat waves.\"",

      "Former Rhode Island Governor Edward DiPrete has died at 91",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Former Rhode Island Gov. Edward DiPrete, who served as the state's chief executive for six years and was later jailed for corruption, has died. He was 91.",
      "Robert Murray, DiPrete\u2019s former chief of staff, co nfirmed that the Republican died Tuesday after celebrating his 91st birthday with family.",
      "DiPrete, a Republican, served as the state's 70th governor from January 1985 until January 1991.",
      "Less than a decade later, he became the first and only former Rhode Island governor to go to prison, having pleaded guilty to bribery, extortion and racketeering charges stemming from his time as the state's chief executive.",
      "DiPrete served one year in prison. After his 1999 release, the former governor said he hoped Rhode Islanders would still remember his accomplishments as governor.",
      "\u201cI hope historians 25 years from now will say that was a good period in time from a person who did make some mistakes, no question, and did some things he paid dearly for,\u201d he said.",
      "Political analyst Darrell West said DiPrete presided over years of relative economic strength in the state, but that his guilty plea and imprisonment were the last memory he left with the public.",
      "\u201cHe was the first and only governor to go to jail,\u201d West said. \u201cThat's an ignoble thing to be on his record.\u201d",
      "DiPrete served as governor for three two-year terms, winning reelection in 1986 and 1988, but losing to a Democrat in 1990.",
      "A year later, DiPrete was fined $30,000 by the state's Ethics Commission for improperly influencing the award of a state contract, but the former governor's legal odyssey was just beginning.",
      "DiPrete and one of his sons, Dennis L. DiPrete, a civil engineer who had never held office, were indicted on March 29, 1994, accused of accepting bribes from architects, engineers, developers and landlords in return for state contracts.",
      "The DiPretes were charged with taking at least $294,000 in bribes while the Republican was governor.",
      "As they headed for trial in 1997, Superior Court Judge Dominic Cresto dismissed all charges against the pair after finding the attorney general's office had disobeyed his order to turn over evidence to defense lawyers, a move that stunned the top state prosecutor.",
      "The state Supreme Court reinstated the charges in January 1998 after the attorney general\u2019s office appealed, ruling that Cresto had no authority to dismiss them.",
      "On Dec. 11, 1998, less than a month before he and his son were scheduled to stand trial, DiPrete pleaded guilty to 18 counts of bribery, extortion and racketeering, admitting he accepted $250,000 in exchange for state contracts.",
      "He was sentenced to serve one year in a work-release program at the state prison. Critics called the sentence too lenient, including then-Gov. Lincoln Almond.",
      "DiPrete said he pleaded guilty to end the stress on his family and because he knew it would keep his son out of jail.",
      "\u201cSparing my son and my grandchildren the anguish of these proceedings far outweighed any personal desires to put the state to its proof,\u201d the elder DiPrete said in a statement.",
      "A state judge later revoked DiPrete's $50,777 annual pension in November 1999. He appealed, arguing he deserved compensation for past public service, including work for the city of Cranston. The state Supreme Court disagreed, ruling in 2004 that his conduct as governor meant the state Retirement Board did not have to honor his pension.",
      "DiPrete often touted his \u201ceveryman\u201d persona while in office, taking his large family on vacation in a Winnebago motor home and sometimes serving guests supermarket fried chicken from the RV. In 1987, he decided to park the motor home outside the Rhode Island State House during a snowstorm and slept in it to avoid being stuck in the snow.",

      "CENTER POINT, Texas -- Justin Rubio awoke in the wee hours to an alert on his phone, thunder, sirens and the thud of helicopter blades \u2014 the beginning of one of the largest rescue operations in Texas history. Rubio was determined to be a part of it.",
      "Even as authorities in Kerr County have repeatedly discouraged civilian volunteers, Rubio and dozens of others went out Monday to search for people still missing after flash flooding tore through the Texas Hill Country over the July Fourth weekend.",
      "The emotions wrapped up in the calamity that killed at least 100 people \u2014 and the urge to help find those still missing \u2014 at times butted up against officials' need for structure and safety as they search over 60 miles (100 kilometers) along the Guadalupe River.",
      "The river grew by the size of a two-story building in less than an hour on Friday. One survivor described a \u201c pitch-black wall of death.\" The flooding decimated shorelines, ripped trees from the ground, tossed and crushed a Ram truck, disappeared buildings and swept through a century-old summer camp packed with kids.",
      "Rubio, who picked through torn tree limbs Monday, said he couldn\u2019t help but pitch in.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sad. It eats at your soul, it eats at your heart,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t just sit at home thinking about what's going on out here.\u201d",
      "The outpouring, volunteers say, is a Texas strain of solidarity, and officials have applauded the donations and volunteers in other areas.",
      "When it comes to search and rescue, however, fickle weather and a flash flood warning Sunday afternoon heightened authorities' fears that unorganized volunteers may end up adding to the missing or dead.",
      "On Sunday and Monday, officials began closing more search sites to volunteers, instead directing them to a local Salvation Army.",
      "\u201cWe need focused and coordinated volunteers, not random people just showing up and doing what they do,\u201d Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring Jr. said. \"We remain hopeful every foot, every mile, every bend of the river.\u201d",
      "Some families have been frustrated by the pace, but officials are asking for patience with the breadth of the search area and methodical, no-stone-unturned approach. It\u2019s a sweeping operation with 19 different local and state agencies, drones, dogs, boats and helicopters.",
      "Officials have laid out a grid over the search area. Each segment can reach over a mile (2 kilometers) and takes between one and three hours to search, Dalton Rice, the city manager of Kerrville, said at a news conference Monday morning.",
      "Rice reiterated for volunteers to \u201cstay out of the way\" so that first responders aren't waylaid ensuring that volunteers \u201cdon\u2019t become victims themselves.\u201d",
      "When volunteers were asked by official responders to leave sites in Kerrville, some moved to help search in the unincorporated community of Center Point on Monday, said Cord Shiflet, who'd rallied volunteers through a Facebook post.",
      "On Sunday, Shiflet had falsely claimed on Facebook that two girls had been rescued in a tree days after the flooding, but he said Monday that he had received bad information and apologized.",
      "The mistake caught the attention of U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, who represents the area and urged people to be careful about false news.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not fair to families and it distracts law enforcement,\u201d Roy posted on the social platform X.",
      "At Center Point on Monday, dozens of undeterred volunteers gathered, including Rubio and Bryan Dutton, in the afternoon heat. Dutton, a veteran who said he had friends at an RV camp affected by the floods, had been waiting to get off work to join the droves of residents coming out to assist and provide food.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge has allowed the Trump administration to rescind nearly $800 million dollars in grants for programs supporting violence reduction and crime victims.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington on Monday denied a preliminary injunction sought by five organizations on behalf of all recipients of the more than 360 grant awards, and granted a motion by the federal government to dismiss the case. Mehta called the Department of Justice's actions \u201cshameful,\u201d but said the court lacked jurisdiction and the organizations had failed to state a constitutional violation or protection.",
      "\u201cDefendants\u2019 rescinding of these awards is shameful. It is likely to harm communities and individuals vulnerable to crime and violence,\u201d Mehta wrote in his ruling. \u201cBut displeasure and sympathy are not enough in a court of law.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department\u2019s Office of Justice Programs cancelled the grants worth more than $800 million in April, saying it had changed its priorities to, among other things, more directly support certain law enforcement operations, combat violent crime and support American victims of trafficking and sexual assault.",
      "A message left seeking comment from Democracy Forward officials was not immediately returned. A Department of Justice spokesperson declined to comment on the ruling.",
      "The lawsuit filed by the Democracy Forward Foundation and the Perry Law firm argued that the grant terminations did not allow due process to the organizations and lacked sufficient clarity. The lawyers also said the move violated the constitutional separation of powers clause that gives Congress appropriation powers.",
      "Many of the organizations that lost the federal money said the unexpected cancellations mid-stream had meant layoffs, program closures and loss of community partnerships.",
      "The five organizations named as plaintiffs sought class status to represent all affected grant recipients. Attorneys General from at least 18 states and the District of Columbia had filed amicus briefs in support of the action, as well as local governments and prosecuting attorneys- several of whom had lost grants for victims programs, alternatives to prosecution programs or others.",
      "The Justice Department asked Mehta to dismiss the suit, arguing in a court filing that there was \u201cno legal basis for the Court to order DOJ to restore lawfully terminated grants and keep paying for programs that the Executive Branch views as inconsistent with the interests of the United States.\u201d",
      "Noting that it intended to redirect the grant funds, it called the suit a \u201crun-of-the mill contract dispute\u201d and said it belonged in a different court.",

      "A Colorado funeral home owner accused of storing nearly 190 decomposing bodies and defrauding the government is expected to plead guilty",
      "DENVER -- A funeral home owner in Colorado accused of storing nearly 190 decomposing bodies in a room-temperature building and defrauding the federal government out of nearly $900,000 is expected to plead guilty in federal court, according to court documents filed Tuesday.",
      "Carie Hallford, who ran Return to Nature Funeral Home with her husband Jon Hallford, allegedly duped the Small Business Administration out of almost $900,000 in pandemic-era relief aid and cheated customers who had paid for cremations the Hallfords never performed.",
      "Instead, the Hallfords are accused of spending the aid and customers\u2019 payments on lavish goods \u2014 luxury cars, cryptocurrency and items from stores like Gucci \u2014 all while stashing the bodies and sending fake ashes to the families.",
      "The Hallfords were charged with 15 fraud counts last year in federal court, where Jon Hallford already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and was sentenced to 20 years in prison last month.",
      "Carie Hallford is set to change her plea in federal court from not guilty in early August, and is expected to plead guilty, according to a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Colorado.",
      "Hallford's attorney, Robert Charles Melihercik, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a separate case in state court, Jon and Carie Hallford are both charged with 191 counts of corpse abuse for allegedly stashing the bodies between 2019 and 2023 and burying the wrong body in two instances.",
      "The building in Penrose, about a two-hour drive south of Denver, was searched in 2023. Officials discovered bodies stacked atop each other, swarms of bugs and fluid covering the floor. Families were shaken to learn their loved ones' remains weren't in the ashes they had spread, but were instead left decaying, some for four years.",

      "The original Herm\u00e8s Birkin bag was built specifically for Jane Birkin after a chance meeting in 1984. While on an Air France flight, Birkin complained to then-Herm\u00e8s leader Jean-Louis Dumas that she couldn't find a purse big enough to hold everything she carried daily, Sotheby's said. She was a young mother and couldn't find a bag that fit her needs, according to Herm\u00e8s.",

      "In the decades since, the Herm\u00e8s Birkin has become an iconic, highly in-demand and expensive luxury accessory. The bag is now made in a variety of colors, sizes and leather types. Sotheby's resells a range of Birkin bags for between $5,000 and $220,000.

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs got a standing ovation from fellow inmates when the music mogul returned to jail after being acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering in his federal trial in New York, providing what his lawyer says might have been the best thing he could do for incarcerated Black men in America.",
      "Combs, 55, was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution, but was acquitted on the most serious charges, which carried potential life-in-prison sentences.",
      "\"They all said: 'We never get to see anyone who beats the government,'\" attorney Marc Agnifilo told The Associated Press in a weekend interview days after the jury reached its verdict.",
      "The music mogul remains jailed at a federal lockup in Brooklyn after his conviction Wednesday on the prostitution-related charges, which could put him in prison for several more years. Any sentence will include credit for time served, which currently amounts to almost 10 months.",
      "After federal agents raided Combs' homes in Los Angeles and the Miami area in March 2024, Agnifilo said he told the \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer to expect to be arrested on sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"I said: 'Maybe it's your fate in life to be the guy who wins,'\" he recalled during a telephone interview briefly interrupted by a jailhouse call from Combs. \"They need to see that someone can win. I think he took that to heart.\"",
      "Blunt trial strategy works",
      "The verdict in Manhattan federal court came after a veteran team of eight defense lawyers led by Agnifilo executed a trial strategy that resonated with jurors. Combs passed lawyers notes during effective cross-examinations of nearly three dozen witnesses over two months, including Combs' ex-employees.",
      "The lawyers told jurors Combs was a jealous domestic abuser with a drug problem who participated in the swinger lifestyle through threesomes involving Combs, his girlfriends and another man.",
      "\"You may think to yourself, wow, he is a really bad boyfriend,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos told jurors in her May opening statement. But that, she said, \"is simply not sex trafficking.\"",
      "Agnifilo said the blunt talk was a \"no brainer.\"",
      "\"The violence was so clear and up front and we knew the government was going to try to confuse the jury into thinking it was part of a sex trafficking effort. So we had to tell the jury what it was so they wouldn't think it was something it wasn't,\" he said.",
      "Combs and his lawyers seemed deflated Tuesday when jurors said they were deadlocked on the racketeering count but had reached a verdict on sex trafficking and lesser prostitution-related charges. A judge ordered them back to deliberate Wednesday.",
      "\"No one knows what to think,\" Agnifilo said. Then he slept on it.",
      "Morning surprise awakes lawyer",
      "\"I wake up at three in the morning and I text Teny and say: \"We have to get a bail application together,\" he recalled. \"It's going to be a good verdict for us but I think he went down on the prostitution counts so let's try to get him out.\"",
      "He said he \"kind of whipped everybody into feeling better\" after concluding jurors would have convicted him of racketeering if they had convicted him of sex trafficking because trafficking was an alleged component of racketeering.",
      "Agnifilo met with Combs before court and Combs entered the courtroom rejuvenated. Smiling, the onetime Catholic schoolboy prayed with family. In less than an hour, the jury matched Agnifilo's prediction.",
      "The seemingly chastened Combs mouthed \"thank you\" to jurors and smiled as family and supporters applauded. After he was escorted from the room, spectators cheered the defense team, a few chanting: \"Dream Team! Dream Team!\" Several lawyers, including Geragos, cried.",
      "\"This was a major victory for the defense and a major loss for the prosecution,\" said Mitchell Epner, a lawyer who worked with Agnifilo as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey over two decades ago. He credited \"a dream team of defense lawyers\" against prosecutors who almost always win.",
      "Agnifilo showcased what would become his trial strategy \u2014 belittling the charges and mocking the investigation that led to them \u2014 last September in arguing unsuccessfully for bail. The case against Combs was what happens when the \"federal government comes into our bedrooms,\" he said.",
      "Lawyers gently questioned most witnesses",
      "During an eight-week trial, Combs' lawyers picked apart the prosecution case with mostly gentle but firm cross-examinations. Combs never testified and his lawyers called no witnesses.",
      "Sarah Krissoff, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan from 2008 to 2021, said Combs' defense team \"had a narrative from the beginning and they did all of it without putting on any witnesses. That's masterful.\"",
      "Ironically, Agnifilo expanded the use of racketeering laws as a federal prosecutor on an organized crime task force in New Jersey two decades ago, using them often to indict street gangs in violence-torn cities.",
      "\"I knew the weak points in the statute,\" he said. \"The statute is very mechanical. If you know how the car works, you know where the fail points are.\"",
      "He said prosecutors had \"dozens of fail points.\"",
      "\"They didn't have a conspiracy, they just didn't,\" he said. \"They basically had Combs' personal life and tried to build racketeering around personal assistants.\"",
      "Some personal assistants, even after viewing videos of Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, had glowing things to say about Combs on cross examination.",
      "Once freed, Combs likely to reenter domestic abusers program",
      "For Combs, Agnifilo sees a long road ahead once he is freed and resumes work on personal demons, likely reentering a program for domestic batterers that he had just started before his arrest.",
      "\"He's doing OK,\" said Agnifilo, who speaks with him four or five times daily.",
      "He said Combs genuinely desires improvement and \"realizes he has flaws like everyone else that he never worked on.\"",
      "\"He burns hot in all matters. I think what he has come to see is that he has these flaws and there's no amount of fame and no amount of fortune\" that can erase them,\" he said. \"You can't cover them up.\"",
      "For Agnifilo, a final surprise awaited him after Combs' bail was rejected when a man collapsed into violent seizures at the elevators outside the courtroom.",
      "\"I'm like: 'What the hell?'\" recalled the lawyer, who has experience in treating seizures.",
      "Agnifilo straddled him, pulling him onto his side and using a foot to prevent him from rolling backward while a law partner, Jacob Kaplan, put a backpack under the man's head and Agnifilo's daughter took his pulse.",
      "\"We made sure he didn't choke on vomit. It was crazy. I was worried about him,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "At a dock on Martha's Vineyard is the Orca, the boat from \"Jaws.\" It's a replica, of course; the original one sank, weighed down by a five-ton man-eating shark. The guy next to the Orca, however, is the real thing. Of this Orca, Richard Dreyfuss said, \"It's too neat, by far.\"",
      "It's been a while since Dreyfuss was on Martha's Vineyard. He says his memories of making \"Jaws\" are great. But back then, he did everything he could not to be in the movie. \"I turned the film down a couple of times because I was thinking that it was gonna be a bitch to shoot. And I was not wrong!\" he laughed. \"But it was such an adventure. And if you had to pick one word to describe the shoot, it was waiting.\"",
      "Now 77, Dreyfuss remembers the standing around, but he also knows \"Jaws,\" made here on the island in the summer of 1974, turned him into a Hollywood star.",
      "I asked, \"Was there ever a moment where you think, 'We're making one of the greatest outdoor films of all time'?\"",
      "\"No,\" Dreyfuss replied. He was convinced that what they were making was obviously a turkey, \"and this thing was gonna crash and burn.\"",
      "The production was a legendary slog. This was the first Hollywood movie to shoot on the unpredictable open seas of the Atlantic. The mechanical shark rarely worked in salt water, and the budget more than doubled.",
      "But Steven Spielberg, a 27-year-old director making his first big studio picture, turned misfortune into opportunity.",
      "\"Jaws\" became one of the most influential American films of the 20th century, and ushered in the summer blockbuster. Set 50 years ago over the July 4th weekend, the plot, says Dreyfuss, is simple: \"This was the story of three guys against this shark. It was this human thing. And we were really good and we knew it. Wow, a kid getting bitten? And if you remember the beginning of the film, you are terrified before you see the shark.\"",
      "Before the shark brought terror to the big screen, it arrived at the bookstore. In 1974, Peter Benchley's novel became a bestseller. Spielberg read it and immediately wanted to direct the movie version \u2013 though he was unhappy with early drafts. So, he asked a friend, screenwriter Carl Gottlieb, to rip it to shreds.",
      "\"Steven sent it to me with a note on the cover that said, 'Eviscerate it!!'\" Gottlieb said.",
      "Gottlieb wrote a lengthy memo, noting, \"If we do our jobs right, people will feel about going in the water the way they felt about taking a shower after 'Psycho.'\"",
      "They did their jobs, all right, led by those three guys: Actor Robert Shaw as Quint, the hunter with a shark-infested backstory; Roy Scheider, the police chief afraid of the water; and Dreyfuss, who changed his mind about making \"Jaws\" after seeing (and hating) his own performance in the film he'd just made, \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.\"",
      "\"I said, 'If I'm not working when this film comes out, I'll never work again,'\" Dreyfuss said. \"And so, I went back to Steven and begged him for the part, and he gave it to me. They had started shooting on April 2; I was cast on the 3rd; my first day of shooting was the 4th; that was the way it all went.\"",
      "Lorraine Gary played Ellen Brody, the police chief's wife. \"I had nothing to lose,\" she said. \"I was getting older. I was 32. That's almost ancient! And it sounded like fun.\"",
      "I asked, \"What about being cast in this sounded like fun to you?\"",
      "\"Going on location to Martha's Vineyard,\" Gary replied. \"I had never been there. Robert Shaw sounded like fun!\"",
      "\"Well, I think I know what that means. But what does that mean?\"",
      "\"You know what it means. And so do you in the audience!\" Gary laughed.",
      "Her experience with Roy Scheider? That was less fun. \"I feel closer to you than I did to the man who played my husband,\" Gary said. \"I think Roy was very protective of his career. I think he was at that point in his career where he hadn't quite made it to being a big-time star. And, perhaps, he thought that I wasn't top drawer enough to be his wife. I never felt a closeness with him. I felt older, and larger. A big head.\"",
      "\"Literally big head?\" I asked.",
      "\"Literally. I mean, he told me, 'Your head is bigger than mine' in the two-shot!\" she laughed.",
      "In addition to writing the script, Gottlieb played newspaperman Harry Meadows. He earned roughly $13,000 for writing and acting in \"Jaws.\" Though he says much of the dark humor was not on the page.",
      "\"We were blessed with a cast that could kind of ad lib in character,\" he said. \"With most actors if you say, 'Ad lib,' it makes their part bigger. But these people were ad libbing relatively selflessly. When I spotted something potentially funny, or if there was humor in something, I would say to Steven, 'I think we got a laugh here if we change the line.'\" And, he said, Spielberg was always responsive to that.",
      "Then there were the delays. As the shooting schedule tripled from 55 days to 159, the actors started to get under each other's skin. Dreyfuss said, \"The thing about Robert Shaw, he knew that he had me psychologically, like, with a little pin through my stomach. And if he said that I couldn't do 25 sit-ups, I couldn't. But I could. And he would say, 'You can't jump off the top of the Orca into the water.' And I couldn't. But I could. He had me!\"",
      "I spoke to Dreyfuss at the Harbor View Hotel, where some of the cast and crew stayed \u2026 and where Oscar-winning editor Verna Fields cut much of the movie. It was also the scene of a \"Jaws\" food fight. Dreyfuss doesn't quite remember who threw the first lobster roll: \"Well, it was either Roy or me.\"",
      "\"Jaws\" surfaced on June 20, 1975. For the first time ever, a movie opened nationwide, and for the first time ever, a movie made more than $100 million.",
      "Asked why it did so well, Gottlieb replied, \"You know, why is the Mona Lisa still a hit? It had that combination of things, any three of which or five of which would've made it a hit. But ['Jaws'] had, like, ten of those.\"",
      "\"Jaws\" changed Hollywood, as well as the lives of everyone associated with it. Steven Spielberg has become the defining director of his generation, and the legacies of Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are forever linked to this film, a movie that millions of us still think about every single time we stroll toward the ocean.",
      "Dreyfuss said, \"I will never walk from the beach into the water so that the water comes up to my chest. If and when that ever happens, I'll either be dead or in a mental institution. The fact that I can't see what's happening underneath is so real to me, I can't do it.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before 'Jaws' and after 'Jaws'?\"",
      "\"Before 'Jaws,\" I didn't care!\" Dreyfuss replied.",

    "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 10:18:03 -0400",
    "summary": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer's latest book delves into the life, complexities and sardonic humor of a man who remains a vital presence in American culture.",
    "story": [
      "The Mississippi Valley is \"as tranquil and reposeful as dreamland, and has nothing this-worldly about it \u2026 nothing to hang a fret or worry upon.\" It's a beautiful sentiment, and yet it contrasts with the fretful and worried life of the man who wrote those words: Samuel Clemens, known to the world by his pen name, Mark Twain.",
      "Twain died 115 years ago, but his books are still being read, and hotly debated, around the globe. It's quite the legacy for a mischievous boy of modest means raised in Hannibal, Missouri, just steps away from the roaring Mississippi. It was, said Jim Waddell, \"the international highway of 1835.\"",
      "Waddell has portrayed Twain for three decades \u2013 a performance always in demand when Hannibal's streets are filled each spring for the Twain on Main festival. It's a good gig that requires of Waddell a clean white suit. \"You keep the suit white by doing no work!\" Waddell laughed.",
      "Korbin Asbury and Ainsley Ahrens competed against other eighth graders in the town to represent the characters Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher in Hannibal. \"I love meeting the new people, 'cause there's 44 different countries that visited Hannibal last year,\" said Asbury.",
      "Asked if she were surprised that an author who lived more than 100 years ago still seems so relevant today, Ahrens replied, \"I am, but not really, because his words that he said, they still work with us today. They're wise words.\"",
      "Wise words, with more than a touch of humor:",
      "\"Always do right. This will gratify some people, and astonish the rest.\"",
      "\"Reader, suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself.\"",
      "Twain is quoted as having called himself not just an American, but \"the American.\" \"I think that part of the continuing fascination with Mark Twain is that he combines in his person both the best and the worst of our national culture,\" said Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow. He has chronicled the lives of great Americans, perhaps most famously Alexander Hamilton, whose biography spawned the Broadway musical. Chernow's latest book tackles the life of Twain, a figure who has never left the national spotlight.",
      "Twain once wrote, \"Biographies are but the clothes and buttons of the man \u2013 the biography of the man himself cannot be written.\" \"That line was in my head every single day that I worked on this book,\" Chernow laughed. \"I kind of had this image of Mark Twain coming back to life and saying, 'I told you so.'\"",
      "Chernow traces Twain's sardonic humor to the pain in which it was rooted. Although he enjoyed boyhood adventures that would inspire \"Tom Sawyer,\" his father was a failure in business.\u00a0 The fear of poverty, and an anxious pursuit of wealth, would dominate Twain's adult life.",
      "In Hartford, Connecticut, site of Twain's home, Chernow described the sprawling mansion that he had built: \"I see his personality. All the angles and porches and turrets, it's like all of the different sides of his personality. And he always loved conspicuousness, and this is probably the most conspicuous house in the city.\"",
      "I asked, \"Was Mark Twain happy here?\"",
      "\"Not just happy here, it was far and away the happiest 17 years of his life,\" Chernow said. \"It was this idyllic period. He had this large expensive house. He had a rich and gorgeous wife. He had three beautiful and smart daughters. It was really a charmed life.\"",
      "Although Twain became wealthy as a writer and public speaker, he poured his fortune \u2013 and his wife's \u2013 into ill-fated investments. The most notorious was the Paige Compositor, a typesetting machine that Twain was sure would make him millions.",
      "The themes that run through Twain's life and his work \u2013 politics, corruption, money, class, race, get-rich-quick themes \u2013 all seem quite relevant to America today. Chernow said, \"It's a great American story, and I think that there's so many things that he said \u2013 for instance, about politics \u2013 that really resonate today. One line that used to drive him crazy was, 'My country right or wrong.' You know, he said that we should support our country always, and our government when it deserves it.\"",
      "Chernow believes President Trump would be a familiar figure to the humorist, \"to the extent that one of the great stock characters in Mark Twain's fiction is the salesman. You can see it in President Trump. You could see it in so many different figures in American life \u2013 the big talkers, the big shots.\"",
      "It's no small irony that Twain was nothing if not a big shot himself \u2013 a man who craved attention as much as money. But fame also emboldened Twain to speak truth to power, most enduringly through his masterpiece, \"Huckleberry Finn.\"",
      "Chernow said, \"One of the things that I argued in my book was that there was no White author in the late 19th century who engaged more fully, and I think more affectionately, with the Black community than Twain. Now, I had to point out early on, if you read letters that he wrote when he was a teenager, they're full of crude, racist remarks \u2013 and not only about Blacks, seems like just about everybody.\"",
      "By 1884, Twain had published \"Huck Finn,\" which, said Chernow, \"whatever its imperfections, is still, I think, the great anti-slavery novel in the language.\"",
      "For Chernow, Mark Twain is still a vital presence in American life. His words continue to make us think, and almost certainly laugh.",
      "Asked why his works have endured when so many other great authors' books are languishing, Chernow replied, \"I think it's a very, very good question. He likened a fine literature to a wine, and he said, 'My writing is water, but everyone drinks water.'\"",
      "And they are still drinking it (and still reading Twain).",

      "\"We spent years together on Charmed\u2014years of scenes, stories, and so many in-between moments. He made me feel safe as an actor. Seen as a woman. He challenged me, teased me, supported me,\" Milano added. \"We were so different, and yet somehow we always understood each other.\"",

    "summary": "Boston nurse practitioner Alexa Nicholls Costa wants to help couples struggling with infertility by assisting with the numerous injections that are part of in vitro fertilization.",
    "story": [
      "Research shows that one out of every eight couples in the U.S. will struggle with infertility. It's part of the reason why IVF is on the rise, up 11% within the last two years. But mixing medicine and self-injecting hormones is one of the most stressful and unpleasant parts of the process.",
      "Boston nurse practitioner Alexa Nicholls Costa wants to help couples struggling with infertility by assisting with the numerous injections that are part of in vitro fertilization.",
      "\"Just being aware of how kind of crazy it is that we send boxes of medications to patients going through fertility treatments who have never picked up a syringe before. It's a little crazy to think about from the patient perspective,\" board-certified nurse practitioner Costa said.",
      "What is it like to go through IVF?",
      "Costa knows her way around a needle; she's the co-founder and CEO of LexRx, an aesthetic injectables practice with three locations in Boston and one in Nantucket. She's also a mom of two. Her daughter, Capri, is an IVF miracle.",
      "\"I was always in a panic to get home by a certain time, mix the medications properly, store them properly, show up on time for appointments. It really is a lot to go through - it's consuming, it can really impact your day-to-day.\"",
      "Costa found herself rescheduling many of her own patients to stay on top of her injections and doctors' appointments. What started as a scheduling headache turned into something incredibly meaningful for Costa and the people she treats.",
      "Helping others access IVF",
      "\"They would say, 'Oh, you have an appointment? What are you doing?' I became very transparent and open with my customer base that I was going through IVF treatments in the hopes of having a second child. It really opened the conversation for my patient population to say maybe they were going through it, too. A lot of them shared their fears and anxiety around administering the medication. I had two patients who said, 'I had two rounds fail because I messed up the medications,' and that just kills you because you know the meds are expensive and it's incredibly time-consuming. Their heartbreak really spoke to me,\" Costa said. \"They almost wanted to ask, would I be willing to help with the injections? I do their Botox treatments, I do other services for them. They trust me with a syringe and a needle. For me, it just felt like the best way to pay it forward was to really help my own clients going through this journey.\"",
      "So Costa began seeing patients after hours, helping with hormone injections completely free of charge.",
      "To date, she's helped more than 15 of her patients with their IVF injections - all of them successfully giving birth to happy, healthy babies.",
      "Anxiety around IVF injections",
      "One of them happens to be her cousin, Marisa Penta.",
      "Penta and her wife both went through IVF cycles in hopes of getting pregnant, attempting to handle injections on their own before eventually turning to Alexa.",
      "\"Bruising happens when you're injecting yourself and hit a certain spot in your body. It was very anxiety-provoking, very stressful to have to do it ourselves,\" Penta said.",
      "When asked how it felt to have someone else administer the injection, Penta described it as \"like a weight being lifted.\"",
      "\"It's a lot of shots, a lot of blood draws, a lot of ultrasounds. The number one reason people drop out of the process is that it's so physically hard,\" said Dr. Pietro Bortoletto, co-founder of Dedham-based Terra Fertility.",
      "\"To paint you a picture: When patients start the IVF process, they get a box at home that has dozens of needles, syringes, medications. If it's overwhelming to Alexa, I can't imagine how it feels for the average patient,\" Bortoletto said.",
      "That's why Bortoletto and Costa are now working on making the process feel a little less overwhelming. Their plan: take the pressure off patients by sending trained nurses to administer injections.",
      "It's something Penta and her wife certainly would have turned to if they hadn't had Alexa. They recently celebrated their daughter Ricci's first birthday, and Penta says she wouldn't change a thing.",

    "summary": "Canada \u2014 one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners \u2014 will face 35% tariffs, President Trump said Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose 35% tariffs on goods from Canada starting next month, hiking import duties on one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners.",
      "The president announced the 35% tax in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney posted to Truth Social, citing Canada's alleged \"failure to stop the drugs from pouring into our country,\" as well as retaliatory tariffs Canada has imposed on U.S. goods. The new tariffs are set to take effect Aug. 1, the president said.",
      "The move is an escalation from the 25% tariffs on Canadian \u2014 and Mexican \u2014 imports announced by Mr. Trump shortly after taking office. He later exempted goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which was negotiated during Mr. Trump's first term. It's unclear whether the same exemption will apply to next month's 35% tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent similar letters to the leaders of more than 20 other countries this week, telling them to expect higher tariffs starting next month. He told NBC News' Kristen Welker on Thursday, \"all of the remaining countries\" will likely face tariffs of 15% to 20% \u2014 higher than the baseline 10% rate that's currently applied to all countries.",
      "But Canada is the largest American trading partner to receive a letter so far. Canada was the world's largest buyer of American goods and the third-largest seller of goods to the U.S. last year, according to Census Bureau data. The country bought some $350 billion worth of American goods and sold $412 billion to the U.S. market in 2024.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter to Carney says he will \"consider an adjustment to this letter\" if \"Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl.\" For months, the president has cast tariffs against Canada and Mexico as a way of getting the U.S.'s two neighbors to stem illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking, though very little fentanyl appears to enter the U.S. via Canada. Just 43 pounds were seized at the Canadian border last year, compared to 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "\"Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses,\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote in a social media post late Thursday night. \"We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1. Canada has made vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl in North America. We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries.\"",
      "The president also assailed Canada for \"retaliat[ing] with its own Tariffs.\" And he said Canada has imposed other barriers on U.S. imports.",
      "Mr. Trump has held on-and-off discussions with Canada for months, but his relationship with the United States' northern neighbor has occasionally been rocky, with U.S. tariffs drawing retaliatory duties from Canada. The president\u00a0briefly called off all trade talks\u00a0with Canada last month due to a planned digital services tax that could hit U.S. tech companies, but the talks\u00a0resumed days later\u00a0after Carney rescinded the tax.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0repeatedly mused about annexing Canada, and Carney's party won this year's parliamentary elections after the prime minister ran on a platform\u00a0of defending Canada from the Trump administration's ambitions.",
      "Trump boosts tariffs on dozens of countries",
      "The president is sending out this week's spate of tariff letters about three months after first unveiling \"reciprocal tariffs\" against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, along with a 10% tariff on everybody else. The move unnerved financial markets and sparked recession and inflation fears, and Mr. Trump quickly suspended most of the duties for 90 days \u2014 aside from the 10% baseline rate \u2014 saying he planned to negotiate trade deals.",
      "With that 90-day pause set to expire this week, Mr. Trump began sending out letters to dozens of trading partners from Japan to South Africa informing them of their planned tariffs. The U.S. has trade deficits with most countries that received Mr. Trump's letters, though Brazil was also threatened with a 50% tariff despite the U.S. running a trade surplus. The letter cited the prosecution of right-wing former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called a \"Witch Hunt.\"",
      "On top of country-specific tariffs, the president has also imposed hefty \"sectoral\" tariffs on foreign steel, copper and other specific categories of goods.",
      "Mr. Trump says the tariffs are necessary to revive American manufacturing and correct trade imbalances. But many economists warn that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said concerns about tariffs are partly to blame for the central bank's decision not to cut interest rates so far this year.",
      "Still, the president has stood by his trade strategy.",
      "\"I think the tariffs have been very well-received,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Thursday. \"The stock market hit a new high today.\"",

Now, with the tariffs at 30%, some of those retailers want goods from China shipped immediately. That temporary 90-day deal, reached in mid-May, is set to run through mid-August.

    "summary": "A top White House budget official said President Trump is \"troubled\" by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's management, as Mr. Trump pressures him over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "A top Trump administration official accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law\" on Thursday, a new broadside against the central bank chief as President Trump tangles with him over interest rates.",
      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a letter Thursday.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its years-long office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Federal Reserve for comment.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",

      "Facing bipartisan frustration, TransDigm Group Inc. eventually of its own accord paid the money back. Yet after another review in 2021 outlined similar concerns, the company did not voluntarily refund millions of dollars in question. Since then, campaign finance records show the company's CEO Kevin Stein has donated to candidates from both major political parties and gave more than $300,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee earlier this year as Mr. Trump and many others within the GOP sharply criticized what they viewed as waste in government.",
      "\"Both sides should be screaming from the rooftops about this,\" William Hartung, a defense spending expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft think tank, said about TransDigm's business practices which he views as having taken advantage of a dysfunctional system.",
      "TransDigm may be little known to the public at large, but the company has attracted attention in the halls of Congress. Within the last decade, Stein has testified to lawmakers amid scrutiny of the business, which deals in parts for both military and commercial aircraft.",
      "\"As my oversight has exposed, TransDigm has spent years fleecing taxpayers to the tune of millions of dollars,\" Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley said in a statement. \"The Department of Defense Inspector General needs to conduct aggressive oversight of TransDigm's abuses and ensure proper accountability is had. At the same time, the Defense Department must step up its game to implement enhanced internal controls and explore alternative pathways of production, including through reverse engineering of spare parts, to avoid being swindled by contractors like TransDigm.\"",
      "TransDigm did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "In February 2019, an audit released by the Department of Defense Inspector General's Office \"determined that for 112 contracts, TransDigm earned $16.1 million in excess profit for 46 parts it sold to the [Defense Logistics Agency] and the Army for $26.2 million between January 2015 and January 2017.\"",
      "Months later as part of a House Oversight Committee hearing, Stein refuted the report, arguing in a written statement that its findings were \"based on cost data that excludes many actual costs of doing business.\"",
      "Still, lawmakers took issue with the company.",
      "North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, who would later become Mr. Trump's chief of staff towards the end of the president's first term, encouraged the company during the hearing to \"chalk it up to marketing expense and pay the American taxpayer back immediately.\"",
      "Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz argued the business was \"grossly robbing the American taxpayers and impacting our military readiness and our ability to make sure that we have the ability to accomplish mission-critical goals.\"",
      "Across Capitol Hill that same day, Grassley said during a speech that the report \"exposes a galactic price gouging, colossal rip-off and out-of-this-world waste.\"",
      "The company later voluntarily repaid the $16.1 million.",
      "Close to three years later, during Democratic President Joe Biden's tenure, the Defense Department's Inspector General's Office released another report looking at January 2017 to June 2019. That audit alleged findings \"that TransDigm earned excess profit of at least $20.8 million on 105 spare parts on 150 contracts.\"",
      "A 2022 House hearing on that report was far more politically divisive than the similar one held in 2019. Stein testified again, and shared what he described as deep concern \"with the fundamental errors in this report,\" while some Republicans took issue with the attention being trained on TransDigm.",
      "\"I don't think we should be picking on any one company, particularly an American-owned company, here,\" North Carolina GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx said during the hearing.",
      "Democrats continued to challenge company leaders, along with Grassley, a Republican.",
      "\"You all are the perfect poster child of an out-of-control defense budget that puts the interests of wealthy, well-connected people like yourselves ahead of the best interests of the American people,\" progressive Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib said at the time.",
      "Later, Grassley signed a letter asking for the amount of money identified in the 2021 audit to be repaid. A response from Stein obtained by CBS News shows the CEO argued that \"while the headline from the audit report may be TransDigm made \"excess profit,\" the reality is that this conclusion is derived from the audit report inexplicably counting millions of dollars of real costs as profit and creating an artificial profit measure not found in law.\"",
      "The Defense Department, which has the largest discretionary budget in the federal government, has long been susceptible to price gouging contracts. According to the Pentagon's inspector general, the Government Accountability Office has included the Defense Department's contract management in its \"High\u2011Risk List\" of programs vulnerable to waste and fraud since 1992.",
      "A spokesperson for the federal government's Defense Logistics Agency told CBS news on Tuesday that in early 2022, it had \"requested voluntary refunds from TransDigm for the $20.8M identified in the 2021 report.\"",
      "\"To date, DLA has not received a refund and TransDigm has not indicated their intent to pay,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Before the 2024 general elections, Stein donated to help Mr. Trump's presidential run, as well as to political efforts for Republicans and Democrats. On occasion, that resulted in his giving to a Democratic incumbent \u2014 and the Republican challenger \u2014 as he did in a recent Senate race in Pennsylvania that ended with then Democratic Sen. Bob Casey narrowly losing to Republican Dave McCormick.",
      "Last year, after having donated to Republicans, Stein also gave money to a few House Democratic candidates including some from frontline seats in the 2024 cycle whose wins went on to play a part in keeping Republicans' majority narrow.",
      "Stein has also helped fund a political operation that received donations from TransDigm leaders. Records show from late 2019 until the end of last year, the group called TransDigm Group Inc. Employee Political Action Committee gave money to dozens of Democrats and Republicans, including candidates from both major parties who now hold roles on the House oversight panel that in the past has questioned the company, as well as politicians who are part of Democratic leadership.",
      "After starting at TransDigm in 2014, Stein rose through the ranks over time, according to an online biography. Earlier this year, the company announced that he would retire as CEO at the end of September. Republican Ohio Rep. Max Miller, whose campaign counts Stein as a donor, called him \"a great guy.\"",
      "\"In terms of my dealings with him, he's been very straight and narrow,\" Miller said. \"I've had dealings with other people who are not straight and narrow that I will not take money from and tell them, 'bye and there's the door.' And believe it or not, members of Congress do that more frequently than people would think.\"",
      "A clear focus of Stein's political donations in the early part of this year has been House Republicans. Through a joint fundraising group tied to Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, the third highest-ranking Republican in the House, money from Stein has also gone towards a set of Republican campaigns that could be critical in deciding which party holds control of the House for the final two years of Mr. Trump's time in the White House.",
      "Republicans losing just three seats in the House could be the difference between the GOP having unified control of Washington for the final two years of Trump's presidency or the party's power and influence being limited before he leaves office.",
      "Outside of the House chamber last week, New York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler maintained that congressional Republicans and the Trump administration are looking to root out waste in government. He pushed back however on any concerns about the CEO's political spending after being asked about the dollars that have recently been given to his own campaign and other House Republican political operations.",
      "\"Obviously, in America, people are able to support whoever they want,\" Lawler said. \"We don't live in communist Russia, unless you would like to go down that road.\"",

      "Unlike many other countries that have been threatened with tariff hikes, the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, meaning Brazil buys more American goods than the U.S. buys from Brazil. Last year, the U.S. exported about $49 billion worth of goods to Brazil, and Brazil exported just over $42 billion in goods to the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter excoriated the South American country over the prosecution of Bolsonaro, who led the country before current Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The U.S. leader called the prosecution a \"Witch Hunt that should end immediately.\"",
      "Bolsonaro was indicted last year for allegedly attempting a coup to remain in office after Lula defeated him in the 2022 elections. The plan allegedly included dozens of people and involved a plot to poison Lula and shoot a Brazilian Supreme Court justice. Bolsonaro's defense team has vehemently denied the charges. Bolsonaro has also been barred from running for office until 2030, after casting doubt on the country's electronic voting machines.",
      "Mr. Trump has long expressed support for Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist sometimes known as \"Trump of the Tropics.\" He also lashed out at Brazil over the prosecution on Monday, calling it a \"terrible thing\" and an \"attack on a Political Opponent.\"",
      "\"LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump also criticized Brazil in his tariff letter for what he called \"insidious attacks\" on the \"Free Speech Rights of Americans,\" an apparent reference to the Brazilian Supreme Court's scrutiny of Elon Musk-owned X and some other social media platforms. And he alleged Brazil has an \"unfair trade relationship\" with the U.S., citing \"Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers.\"",
      "In the letter, Mr. Trump ordered U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to open an investigation into Brazil over \"attacks on the Digital Trade Activities of American Companies\" and \"other unfair Trading Practices.\"",
      "A report by the U.S. Trade Representative earlier this year said Brazil charged an average tariff of 11.2% on imports as of 2023. The report says Brazil imposes \"relatively high tariffs on imports across a wide range of sectors,\" and \"U.S. exporters face significant uncertainty in the Brazilian market because the government frequently modifies tariff rates.\" It also lists some other trade restrictions, like a tariff on ethanol and import licensing rules.",
      "As with the other countries that have faced tariff threats, Mr. Trump said his administration would \"consider an adjustment\" if Brazil were to change its trade practices.",
      "Lula said in a post on X that Brazil will react to any tariff increases by invoking the country's economic reciprocity law, which allows Brazil to impose import restrictions and other countermeasures in response to unilateral tariffs. He also pointed to the U.S.'s trade surplus with Brazil, said the proceedings against Bolsonaro \"fall exclusively under the jurisdiction of Brazil\u00b4s Judicial Branch\" and wrote that companies \"must comply with Brazilian law in order to operate within our territory.\"",
      "\"Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage,\" Lula wrote in the statement, as translated by Brazil's embassy in D.C.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump threatened an additional 10% tariff on any countries aligned with \"the Anti-American policies of BRICS,\" referring to a group of developing countries and emerging markets that includes Brazil.",
      "Tariffs are a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy. The moves have sparked fears of rising consumer prices and an economic slowdown, but Mr. Trump argues tariffs are necessary to revive U.S. manufacturing and punish what he views as unfair trade practices.",
      "The president imposed steep tariffs on dozens of countries in early April, rattling markets, before quickly delaying most of them for three months while his administration sought to negotiate trade deals. With the three-month extension set to run out this week, the administration began sending letters to various countries informing them of higher tariffs starting in August.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 07:10:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Manufacturers and construction companies \u2014 as well as consumers \u2014 would face higher prices if the U.S. jacks up tariffs on copper, analysts said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's move to impose a 50% tariff on U.S. copper imports targets a vital metal that is widely used in many products and industries. That could lead to higher prices for everything from appliances and electronics to cars and home repairs, economists and industry experts said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the copper duties late Wednesday on his Truth Social platform, saying they will take effect Aug 1.",
      "\"Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many,\" he wrote. \"Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense! Why did our foolish (and SLEEPY!) 'Leaders' decimate this important Industry? This 50% TARIFF will reverse the Biden Administration's thoughtless behavior, and stupidity. America will, once again, build a DOMINANT Copper Industry.\"",
      "Price jump",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said copper is an integral component in electrical wiring and plumbing, as well being used as a heat conductor in radiators and household appliances. He worries that a hefty copper tariff will trigger inflation.",
      "Copper prices had already surged 13% on Tuesday, reaching a record high, after Mr. Trump floated the possible tariff.",
      "\"It's bad news all around,\" Young said of Mr. Trump's proposed copper tariff. \"If companies' costs go up they pass them along to consumers, so we'd see higher prices for home repairs and anything that uses copper.\"",
      "Copper tariffs could also make maintaining the nation's electric grid more expensive and drive up household energy costs, Young said. \"It would negatively affect the electricity industry and anybody who uses electricity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that tariffs provide financial incentives to ramp up domestic production, including of critical materials like copper, and help create manufacturing jobs.",
      "\"America cannot be reliant on foreign imports of the copper that's necessary for key military hardware, infrastructure and everyday electronics,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump administration is committed to reshoring manufacturing that's critical [to] our national and economic security with a two-pronged approach of tariffs and a full suite of supply-side reforms like deregulation and the pro-growth tax cuts of The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Ripple effects",
      "The biggest users of copper \u2014 and therefore most exposed to the tariff increase \u2014 include a vast range of industries, covering everything from construction to semiconductors, electric vehicles and renewable energy components such as solar panels, according to industry data.",
      "Daan de Jonge, copper demand and prices lead analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said in a research note that \"a 50% price hike will have inevitable ripple effects on the cost of new infrastructure, the cost of housing the cost of fridges, cars, air conditioning.\"",
      "For consumers, that means the cost of appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners, as well as EVs, would likely rise if this 50% tariff goes into effect, according to analysts.",
      "\"Copper is an important element in development of semiconductors and electric vehicles. And the tariff announcement caused prices to go up quite dramatically, so you can tell it's a pretty big deal,\" Veronique de Rugy, a professor of political economy and senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The reason President Trump picked copper is because it's such a big deal for a lot of important things.\"",
      "Carveouts for key partners?",
      "The U.S. gets roughly two-thirds of its copper imports from Chile and Canada, with additional supply coming from Peru and Mexico.\u00a0 The U.S.'s net copper imports met 53% of U.S. demand for copper last year, according to Morgan Stanley research.",
      "Experts note that Mr. Trump isn't certain to hike duties on copper, saying his proposal could be aimed more at securing concession from exporters.",
      "\"These are two examples of countries that the U.S. could offer some sort of quota or export restraint relief to as part of a broader deal,\" UBS chief investment strategist Kurt Reiman told CBS MoneyWatch, referring to Canada and Chile. A revamped U.S. trade policy could also include carveouts for foreign copper suppliers, he added",
      "Although the U.S. could ramp up domestic copper production, it would take years to significantly increase output, Reiman said. \"We aren't ready. The mines would have to be built out, and that's typically a multi-year process.\"",
      "The sectoral tariff threats come after Mr. Trump this week announced stiff new tariff rates on 20 nations\u00a0that have not yet reached trade agreements with the U.S and that he said would take effect on Aug. 1. He outlined the new rates, posted in nearly identical letters on Truth Social, as a 90-day pause on so-called \"reciprocal\" levies was\u00a0set to expire\u00a0on Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump this week has threatened to hit at least 20 nations with steep import duties by next month.",
      "Mr. Trump initially\u00a0posted\u00a0two nearly identical letters on Truth Social Monday, addressed to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, outlining the new tariffs. A 90-day freeze on country-specific U.S. tariffs on dozens of nations, including Japan and South Korea, expires on July 9. That deadline, however, is no longer significant, with Mr. Trump saying on social media that \"tariffs will start being paid on Aug. 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"In other words, all money will be due and payable starting Aug. 1, 2025 \u2014 No extensions will be granted,\" he added.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday afternoon also announced separate tariffs on an additional 12 trade partners. Myanmar and Laos face a 40% tariff rate, the highest of the new levies the U.S. is threatening to deploy. Thailand and Cambodia face potential tariffs of 36%, while Mr. Trump announced slightly lower tariffs of 35% on both Bangladesh and Serbia.",
      "Indonesia is the lone country facing a possible tariff rate of 32%. Imports from South Africa and Bosnia and Herzegovina will be subject to 30% duties as of Aug. 1, while goods from Malaysia, Kazakhstan and Tunisia will be taxed at 25%, Mr. Trump said in letters posted on Truth Social. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social that more tariff letters \"will be sent today, tomorrow, and for the next short period of time.\"",
      "Additional letters bring total to 20",
      "The president posted six more tariff letters on Truth Social on Wednesday morning, bringing the total number of tariff letters sent to 20. They include a letter to the Philippines, which faces a 20% levy on its products, unless a trade deal with the U.S. is reached by Aug. 1. Goods from Brunei and Moldova will be taxed at 25%, and imports from Algeria, Iraq and Libya face tariffs of 30%.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday signed an executive order delaying the July 9 deadline to August 1.",
      "\"I have determined, based on additional information and recommendations from various senior officials, including information on the status of discussions with trading partners, that it is necessary and appropriate to extend the suspension effectuated by Executive Order 14266 until 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on August 1, 2025,\" the order states.",
      "Trump is also expected to announce more deals with U.S. trade partners before the beginning of August, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump included identical language in each letter informing recipients that the notice \"demonstrates the strength and commitment of our Trading Relationship,\" and that \"we invite you to participate in the extraordinary Economy of the United States.\"",
      "The 25% tariffs on South Korea and Japan are in line with the so-called \"reciprocal\" rates Mr. Trump had announced when he unveiled country-specific duties on April 2. At the time, the Trump administration said it would impose tariffs of 24% and 25% on imports from Japan and South Korea, respectively.",
      "\"If none of these 14 countries manage to seal a preliminary trade deal (and assuming Trump doesn't delay implementation for another month) then the effective tariff rate on U.S. imports would rise from 15.5% to 17.3%,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a report. In 2024, the effective tariff rate on imports was 2.5%, he noted.",
      "25% tariff would bog down trade",
      "Trade policy expert Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that Monday's announcements \"are simply indications that he is making them pay full admission price to access the U.S. market.\"",
      "\"At 25%, it is possible, but challenging, to trade with Japan and Korea. This rate was carefully set at the higher side of the spectrum. In essence trade with the U.S. now is a pay to play proposition for Japan, Korea and likely others to come,\" he said.",
      "Appleton added that the country-specific rates announced Monday do not bode well for other nations looking to strike deals with the U.S., including EU countries, Canada and Switzerland.",
      "Economists warn that wide-ranging U.S. tariffs on trading partners could spark another bout of inflation and hinder economic growth, while global financial markets have heaved at the prospect of significantly higher trading costs.",

    "summary": "McDonald's is reviving its long-lamented Snack Wrap and leaning into affordable eats as it looks to reverse a rare sales slump.",
    "story": [
      "McDonald's is reviving fan favorites, spicing up its menu and emphasizing low-cost items to bring inflation-weary customers back to the Golden Arches.",
      "The world's largest restaurant chain recently announced it was bringing back the popular Snack Wrap, which makes its return to McD's outlets on July 10, along with a new, limited-time Spicy Egg McMuffin sandwich, which debuted on July 8. The refreshed menu comes as the company looks to boost sales as budget-conscious consumers pull back on spending.",
      "Same-store sales at McDonald's outlets in the U.S. declined 3.6% in the first quarter, the biggest drop since the COVID-19 pandemic closed stores nationwide. At the same time, traffic among low-income customers was down \"nearly double digits,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's May earnings call, reflecting a customer base that the company acknowledged is still feeling the effects of inflation.",
      "McDonald's isn't the first fast-food chain to use promotions to drive business, but it has long been among the most adept at tweaking its menu and pricing, while its scale makes it a bellwether for customer tastes. In January, for example, it introduced\u00a0the McValue\u00a0menu, which includes the $5 meal deal, along with a \"buy one, add one for $1\" deal, as the company leaned into affordable offerings.",
      "McDonald's is reacting to a number of economic and competitive pressures, said Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings. Chief among them is continuing to deliver value to low-income consumers in a time of economic uncertainty.",
      "\"This isn't anything new, but I think it's a continuation of this pursuit of regaining the consumers' trust,\" Todd said.",
      "Sara Senatore, a research analyst at the Bank of America, told CBS MoneyWatch that McDonald's move to expand its affordable offerings is an attempt to \"stay relevant\" with low-income consumers, who are \"under much greater pressure than other cohorts.\"",
      "Other fast-food chains and restaurants also have seen weaker sales as consumers battered by higher prices and the general cost of living look to save cash. For McDonald's, which has over 13,500\u00a0locations\u00a0nationwide, the difference now is it's not outperforming competitors as much as it once was, Senatore said.",
      "\"Their same-store sales versus their direct competitors have been much more similar than different,\" she said. \"Whereas, if you look at its long-term history, McDonald's has historically outpaced their competitors.\"",
      "McDonald's did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on the strategy behind its menu changes.",
      "Return of the Snack Wrap",
      "Perhaps the most highly anticipated new menu item is the Snack Wrap, which is returning to McDonald's establishments nationwide on this week after a nine-year hiatus. The wrap, which consists of a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese, was nixed in 2016, sparking a social media campaign by fans lobbying for its return.",
      "\"Given that they're looking for sales drivers, it makes sense that they would go to their archives, if you will,\" Senatore said.",
      "The revived Snack Wrap will come in two flavors \u2014 Ranch and Spicy \u2014 and will be priced at $2.99, according to a McDonald's spokesperson. The main protein will consist of chicken strips \u2014 easier to prepare, and thus less labor-intensive, than the type of chicken McD's previously used in the wrap, which required more cutting, Senatore explained.",
      "Reviving the Snack Wrap is a strategic decision on McDonald's part given the item's cult following. Customers went so far ast to start a Change.org petition garnering more than 19,000 signatures urging McDonald's to bring back the Snack Wrap.",
      "\"Bringing back a product that customers really want to have come back, you typically have higher rate of success,\" Senatore said.",
      "McDonald's is also introducing a new take on its classic Egg McMuffin, with a trio of limited-time breakfast sandwiches featuring spicy pepper sauce. The new items coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin, a McDonald's staple that consists of egg, cheese and Canadian bacon on an English muffin.",
      "\"Limited-time offerings are always something in the toolkit for quick service restaurants to drive traffic,\" Todd said.",
      "Other menu tweaks include a new home for the Daily Double, one of McDonald's burger offerings. The Daily Double will now be part of the the McValue deal, where it will be bundled with fries, Chicken McNuggets, and a small soft drink for $6 or $7, depending on the location.",
      "McDonald's has also upped its chicken offerings. In May, the chain launched a new item called McCrispy Strips nationwide, the first time since 2021 McDonald's debuted a new permanent menu item in the U.S, according to a company\u00a0statement.",
      "Todd said McDonald's and other industry players are emphasizing chicken meals given its popularity and that it is significantly cheaper than beef, which rose to record prices in May.",
      "\"We've been seeing tons of chicken offerings, and just chicken... in general being very successful,\" he said.",

      "Ives' comments came in reaction to Musk's recent announcement of the formation\u00a0of a new political party called the America Party. Musk had initially floated the idea\u00a0of creating a new party last month in the midst of a resurrected feud with President Trump, sparked by the billionaire's public disapproval of the massive legislation whichhe\u00a0described as\u00a0an \"insane spending bill.\" Mr. Trump signed the bill into law on July 4.",

      "In addition to calling for the oversight on Musk's political endeavors by Tesla's board, Ives, a prominent voice in the tech world, also recommended that the board establish a new pay package for Musk that would limit his voting control to 25% and establish guardrails on how much time the tech mogul spends at Tesla.",
      "Ives explained his rationale in a research note to investors Tuesday, in which he said Tesla cannot afford to have Musk focus his time on creating a political party.",
      "\"In a nutshell, we believe this is a tipping point in the Tesla story and ultimately the Tesla Board needs to act now and set the ground rules for Musk going forward around his political ambitions and actions,\" Ives wrote in his note Tuesday.",
      "The struggling company, Ives said, needs Musk to stay on as CEO for the next five years given the role he would play in Tesla's \"autonomous and robotics future.\" The company recently piloted its robotaxis in Austin, Texas, which Ives said at the time would be the start of the \"golden era\" for Tesla.",
      "By going after seats in the Republican-Controlled Congress, Musk would become a \"foe of Trump and the Republican party\" which would not bode well for Tesla's shareholders, Ives said.",
      "Pozner said the board could take the steps Ives outlined, but thinks Musk is unlikely to be forced out.",
      "\"It is clear that Musk calls the shots, that the board is deferential to him and that neither side is motivated to alter this fundamental arrangement, at least as present,\" Pozner said.",

      "\"When @elonmusk and I first spoke of his vision for X, I knew it would be the opportunity of a lifetime to carry out the extraordinary mission of this company,\" Yaccarino wrote. \"I'm immensely grateful to him for entrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the Everything App.\"",
      "In her note, Yaccarino also talked about accomplishments made under her tenure at the company and nodded to the platform's future with xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence company.",
      "\"Now, the best is yet to come as X enters a new chapter with\u00a0@xai,\" she wrote.",
      "Musk\u00a0responded\u00a0to Yaccarino's announcement on X writing, \"Thank you for your contributions.\"",
      "Musk tapped Yaccarino to replace him as CEO of the company in May 2023. \"Looking forward to working with Linda to transform this platform into X, the everything app,\" he posted on X at the time.",
      "After joining X in 2023, Yaccarino was immediately tasked with boosting ad revenue \u2014 not an easy feat after many big brands pulled back on spending following Musk's October 2022 takeover of the platform. Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney all removed paid ads\u00a0from X that year.",
      "By January 2024, the company's market value had plunged over 70% compared to when Musk purchased the platform, according to one Wall Street estimate.",
      "Yet X's prospects appeared to be improving under Yaccarino's leadership. Both Amazon and Apple announced they would rejoin the platform earlier this year.",
      "Before taking the helm at X, Yaccarino spent over a decade at NBCUniversal, where she served as chair of global advertising. During her tenure at NBC, her team generated $100 billion in ad sales, while she also helped launch the company's ad-supported streaming service, Peacock.",
      "Prior to NBC, Yaccarino spent nearly two decades at global entertainment company Turner. In her farewell\u00a0note\u00a0posted on X, Yaccarino did not say if she was immediately taking another job.",

    "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 10:21:05 -0400",
    "summary": "As of Tuesday, passengers at U.S. airports are no longer required to remove their shoes during the TSA screening process.",
    "story": [
      "The Transportation Security Administration's shoe rule expired on Monday, relieving fliers of the requirement to remove their footwear\u00a0while passing through security before boarding a plane.",
      "Speaking at a press briefing on Tuesday at Washington, D.C.'s Reagan National Airport, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that starting Tuesday, all passengers traveling through domestic airports can keep their shoes on while moving through TSA checkpoints.",
      "\"TSA will no longer require travelers to remove their shoes when they go through our security checkpoints,\" Noem said, adding that she expects travelers to be \"very excited\" at the policy change.",
      "Previously, only travelers enrolled in TSA PreCheck could keep their shoes on. The TSA on Monday did not issue a statement confirming the end of the policy, but sources familiar with the matter on Monday confirmed the change to CBS News.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, an industry advocacy group, cheered the rule change. \"The days of removing your shoes at airport security checkpoints are finally behind us \u2014 and that's a win for all travelers,\" CEO Geoff Freeman said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "\"Thanks to cutting-edge screening technology and strong decision-making, all travelers will now experience a more secure, seamless and efficient process at Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints. Keeping shoes on will reduce wait times and streamline air travel for all Americans,\" he added.",
      "Here's what to know about the status of the TSA's updated shoe policy.",
      "What is the \"shoes-off\" rule?",
      "The TSA screening policy, known informally as the \"shoes-off rule,\" was instituted in 2006 after British terrorist Richard Reid unsuccessfully tried to detonate homemade bombs hidden in his shoes during a December 2001 flight from Paris to Miami. The shoes he wore on the flight contained 10 ounces of explosive material, according\u00a0to an FBI account of the incident.",
      "The shoe-removal policy went into effect in August 2006. \"Based on intelligence pointing to a continuing threat, TSA requires passengers to remove shoes to screen for explosives,\" the TSA states on a policy timeline on its website.",
      "Under the policy, the TSA required passengers in standard screening lines to remove and place their shoes on X-ray belts, along with laptops, liquids, belts and outerwear.",
      "Passengers with TSA PreCheck benefits were exempt from the shoe removal requirement.",
      "Do I still have to take my shoes off?",
      "Not as long as TSA screeners are following the revised policy. As of Tuesday, the agency will no longer require passengers who move through TSA checkpoints to remove their shoes.",
      "That said, TSA officers may still flag some travelers for additional screening measures. \"Once in a while, someone will have to remove their shoes if they need additional layers of screening,\" Noem said Tuesday.",
      "On Monday, before the rule change was announced, some airports across the U.S. had already started phasing out the security measure and begun allowing fliers to move through security with their shoes on, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA worker who now runs Gate Access, a site about passenger rights, was the first to report on the policy shift, calling it \"one of the biggest changes to TSA screening in over a decade.\"",
      "\"It marks a huge shift in what the average traveler is used to going through TSA,\" he said.",
      "The revised shoes-on policy was already in effect at seven U.S. airports on Monday, according to CBS News sources. The first airports to ditch the security measure include Baltimore/Washington International Airport; Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport; Fort Lauderdale International Airport; Philadelphia International Airport; Piedmont Triad International Airport in North Carolina; and Portland International Airport.",
      "Some passengers at New York's LaGuardia Airport also reported being allowed to keep their shoes on Monday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday re-posted a CBS News report on the rule change on social media, describing it as \"Big news from @DHSgov!\" .",
      "Will this mean shorter security lines?",
      "Harmon-Marshall of Gate Access told CBS MoneyWatch that he expects the policy change to result in shorter airport screening lines and an expedited security process for all passengers. In come cases, TSA officers could still ask passengers to remove their footwear.",
      "\"They still have that discretion,\" he said.",
      "For passengers, Harmon-Marshall expects screening time to \"drop significantly.\"",
      "\"Allowing passengers to keep their shoes on in the standard line will make going through TSA a breeze,\" he predicted.",
      "The revamped shoe policy could also have implications for TSA PreCheck, which costs around $80 for five years, Harmon added.",
      "\"TSA has to figure out what the value proposition of PreCheck is,\" he said. \"Allowing passengers to access screening with their shoes on diminishes its value, which leads me to believe there is another shakeup coming with TSA PreCheck.\"",
      "Noem on Tuesday said PreCheck status still offers advantages to pass holders because they're not required to take off their belts or remove liquids and electronics from their bags, unlike other passengers.",
      "\"I believe PreCheck will still be something many travelers will want to utilize,\" she said.",
      "She added that DHS will continue to evaluate all TSA screening procedures for efficiency. Homeland Security also plans to test new security lanes at TSA checkpoints over the next six to nine months that allow travelers to move through security even more quickly.",

    "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 09:35:46 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump pushed to eliminate taxes on Social Security. Does his \"one big, beautiful bill\" deliver?",
    "story": [
      "As Congress was approving President Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday, the Social Security Administration touted the legislation by stating that it \"eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.\"",
      "That claim, which echoes\u00a0previous promises by Mr. Trump to remove taxes on Social Security, may have come as welcome news for the millions of older and disabled people who depend on the program for income. So does the bill deliver? Not entirely.",
      "In a press release, the SSA said that the tax and spending package, which the president is set to sign into law on Friday, \"ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits.\"",
      "That figure draws on a June\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that said 88% of seniors \u2014 or 51.4 million people \u2014 on Social Security will pay no tax on their payments under the measure because their deductions would exceed their taxable benefits. More than 70 million Americans collect Social Security benefits, according to the SSA.",
      "The bill \"includes the largest tax break in American history for our nation's seniors,\" CEA said, adding that \"the deductions ensure that seniors who earned their Social Security through years of hard work get more money back in their pockets.\"",
      "Yet while it's true that the bill offers fresh tax relief for some people on Social Security, it is misleading to suggest that the measure does away with taxes on Social Security benefits, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Rather, the bill offers relief by creating a new \"bonus\" tax deduction for beneficiaries.",
      "\"While the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told The Associated Press this week ahead of Congress approving the bill.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.",
      "How does the \"big, beautiful bill\" impact Social Security?",
      "The bill doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security, but rather introduces a temporary deduction that beneficiaries can claim to lower their federal income tax. Notably, that deduction applies to all of a senior's income \u2014 not just to Social Security benefits.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS MoneyWatch the bill doesn't change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Eliminating taxes on Social Security under the bill was impossible because of a congressional restriction (dubbed the Byrd Rule\u00a0after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what the Senate can include in a reconciliation bill like the Republican budget measure.",
      "What the bill does do is provide a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older. The tax break is available to people with an adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.",
      "\"Each spouse can take the deduction, for a total of $12,000, if both are 65-plus,\" AARP explains in its analysis of the budget bill. The deduction phases out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "\"While the Byrd Rule prevented a permanent repeal of taxes on Social Security benefits from being included, this deduction provides immediate relief to many seniors,\" said Christian Bridges, CEO of Thirteen Twenty-Two Advisors, a financial planning firm in Texas, in an email.",
      "Bridges added that the deduction isn't just for people on Social Security, \"It benefits a broader group of older Americans trying to stretch every dollar,\" he said.",
      "Social Security recipients under 65 and people above the specified income thresholds are ineligible to claim the new tax deduction. It also won't benefit the many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little.",
      "\"Boosting the amount that you get to write off when you already get to write off everything does not help you at all,\" Kogan said.",
      "The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group, said in a June\u00a0report\u00a0that exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would not change the after-tax income for the bottom 20% of taxpayers, noting that \"those taxpayers are already exempt from taxation on their Social Security benefits.\"",
      "The biggest beneficiaries of the bill will be higher-income seniors, said Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, which focuses on Social Security education.",
      "\"The people who benefit by definition have to be richer, and the people who benefit the most are the richest people, before the tax cut phases out,\" Kogan added.",
      "The tax cut is fully phased out for individuals making $175,000 and for couples making $250,000.",
      "More pressure on Social Security?",
      "Providing a temporary tax deduction is likely to help some Social Security recipients, but it could also worsen the retirement program's fragile financial state, Kogan said. Social Security is on track to\u00a0deplete its trust fund by 2034 if Congress does not take action.",
      "\"We already have a problem of not enough money going into the trust fund. This bill makes even less money go into the trust fund,\" he said.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies fiscal issues, estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits would lower federal revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7%\u00a0 by 2054.",
      "As the debate continues over how to shore up Social Security while offering tax relief to older Americans, one thing is clear, and perhaps politically unpalatable: cutting benefits. According to a AARP-funded survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance released in January, 85% of Americans think benefits should not be reduced, or that they should be increased, even if it means raising taxes on some or all Americans.",
      "\"Virtually all Americans want their Social Security benefits to be preserved and are willing to do what it takes to ensure the program continues to provide meaningful support for future generations,\" said AARP Chief Public Policy Officer Deb Whitman in a statement after the survey was released.",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Jul 2025 15:37:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Beef costs around the U.S. surged to a record high in May. What's driving that jump, and are prices likely to ease up?",
    "story": [
      "Soaring U.S. beef prices are hitting consumers in the wallet and raising costs for restaurants.",
      "\"Anybody should be able to afford a burger,\" said Andrew Schnipper, a managing partner at Hamburger America in New York City. \"It's never been an expensive item historically.\"",
      "Yet the restaurant may be forced to raise the price of its burgers, which start at $7.50. \"We're very focused on trying to charge the least amount we feel comfortable doing,\" he added. \"But obviously, if prices go up we have to raise prices.\"",
      "The cost of beef reached $5.98 per pound in May, according to Federal Reserve data \u2014 the highest since the Department of Labor started tracking beef prices in the 1980s. That rise hasn't come overnight. Ground beef costs have increased 45% over the last 10 years, compared with roughly 30% for the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "Overall food prices have eased since surging during the pandemic, although they're still up nearly 17% since 2022, according to the CBS News price tracker. That means a grocery bill that cost $100 back then would cost around $116.85 as of May (the latest data available).",
      "So what accounts for higher beef prices? The answer largely comes down to simple economics, with demand outstripping supply. That has resulted in higher costs throughout the supply chain, including for meat processing companies, the restaurant industry and consumers.",
      "\"There's plenty of alternative protein sources in terms of pork and poultry, primarily in the U.S., that consumers could turn to that are in abundant supply and relatively cheaper,\" Derrell Peel, a professor in the department of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And yet beef demand has stayed remarkably robust.\"",
      "Shrinking herds and drought",
      "If the rules of supply and demand explain why beef has gotten so prices, other dynamics come into play.",
      "Notably, Americans' enduring appetite for beef has coincided with shrinking cattle herds. The number of beef cattle in 2025, 27.8 million, is the lowest it's been since the 1960s despite the growing U.S. population, Agriculture Department data shows.",
      "Over the last decade, in turn, the decline in cattle supplies has mainly been driven by drought conditions around the U,.S., which reduced the available feedstock and forced many cattle ranchers to sell off their beef cows, Peel said. \"They simply had no choice because of the drought.\"",
      "Most recently, a severe drought started in 2021 and continued through last year, sweeping through the western half of the country.",
      "\"Somewhere during that period, just about every major beef cow-producing area was subject to drought and subject to this sort of forced liquidation,\" Peel said.",
      "Even without the challenge of insufficient rainfall, herds take a long time to grow due to the biology of cattle. Cows can only have one calf at a time, and it takes longer for them to reach the age for slaughter than other livestock, Peel said.",
      "Other factors driving up beef prices include high grain prices, tariffs and rising interest rates, according to a June\u00a0study\u00a0from NerdWallet, a financial services company.",
      "Will prices cool?",
      "Unfortunately for Americans, beef prices are expected to keep rising for some time. Diminished cattle supplies are likely to drive prices to new record highs in 2026,\u00a0according to projections from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "Longer term, Peel expects beef prices to stay high for the next several years as ranchers work on rebuilding their herds.",
      "\"We're going to be in a tight supply situation, in an elevated price situation for the next two to three years, probably to the rest of the decade,\" he said.",

      "They've remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have kept climbing, though more slowly.",
      "As home sales have slowed, properties are taking longer to sell. That's led to a sharply higher inventory of homes on the market, benefitting investors and other home shoppers who can afford to bypass current mortgage rates by paying in cash or tapping home equity gains.",
      "\"As traditional buyers struggle with affordability, investors with cash and financing advantages are stepping in to maintain transaction volume,\" according to the report.",
      "Vacation homes and rentals",
      "BatchData analyzes U.S. home sales records to determine which properties were purchased by investors. These could include vacation homes or rentals, but not a homebuyer's primary residence.",
      "Investors bought 1.2 million homes in 2024, up from an average of 1.1 million homes a year going back to 2020, according to BatchData.",
      "Even so, investor-owned homes account for roughly 20% of the nation's 86 million single-family homes, the firm said.",
      "Of those, mom-and-pop investors, or those who own between 1 and 5 homes, account for 85% of all investor-owned residential properties, while those with between 6 and 10 properties account for another 5%.",
      "Institutional investors that own 1,000 or more homes account for only about 2.2% of all investor-owned homes, the firm said.",
      "And that number could get smaller, amid signs that large institutional investors are scaling back home purchases.",
      "Out of a group of eight of the biggest companies that own and lease single-family houses, including Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent, six sold more homes in the second quarter than they bought, according to data from Parci Labs.",

      "Here's a scary thought: Your job security could be in the hands of AI.",
      "That's according to a new study from career site\u00a0Resumebuilder.com, finding that more managers are relying on tools like ChatGPT to make hiring and firing decisions.",
      "Managers across the U.S. are increasingly outsourcing personnel-related matters to a range of AI tools, despite their not being well-versed in how to use the technology, according to the survey of more than 1,300 people in manager-level positions across different organizations.",
      "The survey found that while one-third of people in charge of employees' career trajectories have no formal training in using AI tools, 65% use it to make work-related decisions. Even more managers appear to be leaning heavily on AI when deciding who to hire, fire or promote, according to the survey. Ninety-four percent of managers said they turn to AI tools when tasked with determining who should be promoted or earn a raise, or even be laid off.",
      "The growing reliance among managers on AI tools for personnel-related decisions is at odds with the notion that these tasks often fall under the purview of human resources departments. But companies are quickly integrating AI into day-to-day operations, and urging workers to use it.",
      "\"The guidance managers are getting from their CEOs over and over again, is that this technology is coming, and you better starting using it,\" Axios Business reporter Erica Pandey told CBS News. \"And a lot of what managers are doing are these critical decisions of hiring and firing, and raises and promotions. So it makes sense that they're starting to wade into the use there.\"",
      "To be sure, there are risks associated with using generative AI to determine who climbs the corporate ladder and who loses their job, especially if those using the technology don't understand it well.",
      "\"AI is only as good as the data you feed it,\" Pandey said. \"A lot of folks don't know how much data you need to give it. And beyond that ... this is a very sensitive decision; it involves someone's life and livelihood. These are decisions that still need human input \u2014 at least a human checking the work.\"",
      "In other words, problems can arise when AI is increasingly determining staffing decisions with little input from human managers.",
      "\"The fact that AI could be in some cases making these decisions start to finish \u2014 you think about a manager just asking ChatGPT, 'Hey, who should I lay off? How many people should I lay off?' That, I think is really scary,\" Pandey said.",
      "Companies could also find themselves exposed to discrimination lawsuits.",
      "\"Report after report has told us that AI is biased. It's as biased as the person using it. So you could see a lot of hairy legal territory for companies,\" Pandey said.",
      "AI could also struggle to make sound personnel decisions when a worker's success is measured qualitatively, versus quantitatively.",
      "\"If there aren't hard numbers there, it's very subjective,\" Pandey said. \"It very much needs human deliberation. Probably the deliberation of much more than one human, also.\"",

      "With the creation of the academy, leading artificial intelligence companies are stepping up their efforts to bring AI to schools across the U.S. OpenAI has committed to giving $10 million over five years, while Microsoft will provide $12.5 million. Anthropic, meanwhile, will contribute $500,000 the first year, said Andrew Crook, a spokesperson for the AFT.",

With this in mind, the foundation said reached out to tech companies for their assistance in developing the AI-training academy.",
      "\"The direct connection between a teacher and their kids can never be replaced by new technologies, but if we learn how to harness it, set commonsense guardrails and put teachers in the driver's seat, teaching and learning can be enhanced,\" AFT President Randi Weingarten said in the\u00a0announcement.",
      "\"We want to do it in a way that teachers can really master the tools,\" Weingarten told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Courses will begin this fall at the United Federation of Teachers' facility in Manhattan, New York. Funding from the tech trio will also go toward the buildout of additional hubs throughout the U.S., which are set to open in 2030, according to Crook. UFT is an affiliate of AFT.",
      "The companies say the training academy will offer a space for educators to learn how to harness AI and implement it safely and ethically in their classrooms. The programming, designed by AI experts and educators, will include workshops, online courses and hands-on training sessions, according to the AFT.",
      "\"We're at a pivotal moment in education, and how we introduce AI to educators today will shape teaching for generations to come,\" Anthropic co-Founder Jack Clark said in an emailed statement on the partnership.",

      "CBS News found multiple paid advertisements on Meta's Instagram stories feature that promoted opportunities to meet women alongside URL links that led to the Telegram platform. Several such ads were promoted by an Instagram account with over 100,000 followers called Royal Garden Club that marketed itself as a \"premium dating agency for wealthy men\" alongside a link to both a website and a Telegram channel.",
      "Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News the company had removed the accounts associated with the advertisements and disabled the ad accounts for violating Meta's content moderation policies.",
      "Meta also confirmed to CBS News that it had banned the administrators of the ad accounts from advertising on the company's social media platforms.",
      "Logan pointed to the company's human exploitation policy, which includes removing \"content where a third-party actor recruits for, facilitates or benefits from commercial sexual activity,\" as well as the company's adult sexual solicitation policy which, amongst other things, removes \"content that offers, asks or provides methods of contact for prostitution.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club's Telegram channel explicitly offered potential clients access to \"over 7,000 girls worldwide for fun dates, relationships and hot sex.\" That included advertising a \"VIP lifetime\" offer of $8,000 of \"top models, bloggers, actresses, athletes, magazine cover girls, adult stars.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club claimed on its Telegram that it is a \"full-service escort agency operating legally,\" pointing to the fact that the business, R GARDEN LLP, is registered in the United Kingdom. A CBS News review of public business records in the U.K. found the company R GARDEN LLP registered to a London address.",
      "Reached on Telegram, an anonymous moderator for the Royal Garden Club channel declined to comment when asked how it was able to promote ads on Instagram, and what type of service the company offers.",
      "Another paid Instagram ad was promoted by an account called men.s_dreams, which appeared to be a shell account with very little content and very few followers. That advertisement promoted \"meeting beautiful girls\" and included a link to a Telegram channel. The Telegram channel in question, called \"Meeting with Girls,\" had messages written in both Russian and English promoting \"girls ready to fly with you anywhere in the world.\"",
      "That channel posted profile pictures of hundreds of women and noted their nationalities. CBS News could not independently verify the identity of the women, nor verify if they had consented to their images being shared by the channel. The anonymous moderator of the account repeatedly posted messages on the public channel asking prospective clients to send private messages if they wanted to \"know something about girls, sex or anything.\"",
      "CBS News has also sought comment from this account about how it was able to pay for ads on Instagram.",
      "While Meta has strict content moderation policies, Telegram is known for its hands-off approach. The platform's content moderation policies outlined on its website do not include anything beyond banning \"illegal pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels,\" or engaging in \"activities that are recognized as illegal in the majority of countries.\" CBS News has sought comment from Telegram as to whether the channels in question violate the platform's policies or will cause Telegram to review its policies.",
      "In recent months, Meta has struggled to combat a rise in sexualized paid advertisements appearing for some users, despite such ads violating its terms of use. A CBS News investigation last month\u00a0uncovered hundreds of ads\u00a0on its platforms promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfake images of real people.",
      "Many of these ads targeted male users between the ages of 18 and 65, in the United States and the European Union.",

Mr. Trump posted tariff letters to each of the countries on Truth Social detailing the new levies.",
      "The letters come just days ahead of Wednesday, July 9, when the pause on U.S. reciprocal tariffs had originally been set to expire.

    "story": [
      "In Connecticut, construction workers in the Local 478 union who complete addiction treatment are connected with a recovery coach who checks in daily, attends recovery meetings with them, and helps them navigate their return to work for a year.",
      "In Pennsylvania, doctors applying for credentials at Geisinger hospitals are not required to answer intrusive questions about mental health care they've received, reducing the stigma around clinicians seeking treatment.",
      "The workplace is the new ground zero for addressing mental health. That means companies \u2014 employees and supervisors alike \u2014 must confront crises, from addiction to suicide. The two seemingly unrelated initiatives in Connecticut and Pennsylvania have one common factor: They grew out of the work of a little known federal agency called the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.",
      "It's one of the key federal agencies leading workplace mental health efforts, from decreasing alarmingly high rates of suicide among construction workers to addressing burnout and depression among health care workers.",
      "But after gaining considerable traction during the COVID-19 pandemic, that work is now imperiled. The Trump administration has fired a majority of NIOSH staffers and is proposing severe reductions to its budget.",
      "Private industry and nonprofits may be able to fill some of the gap, but they can't match the federal government's resources. And some companies may not prioritize worker well-being above profits.",
      "About 60% of employees worldwide say their job is the chief factor affecting their mental health, according to a survey by human resources consulting company UKG. A 2015 study in Management Science suggests workplace stress causes about 120,000 deaths and accounts for up to 8% of health costs in the U.S. each year.",
      "\"Workplace mental health is one of the most underappreciated yet critical areas we could intervene on,\" said Thomas Cunningham, a former senior behavioral scientist at NIOSH who took a buyout this year. \"We were just starting to get some strong support from all the players involved,\" he said. \"This administration has blown that apart.\"",
      "NIOSH, established in 1970 by the same law that created the better-known Occupational Safety and Health Administration, is charged with producing research that informs workplace safety regulations. It's best known for monitoring black lung disease in coal miners and for testing masks, like the N95s used during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "As part of the mass firing of federal workers this spring, NIOSH was slated to lose upward of 900 employees. After pushback from members of Congress \u2014 primarily over coal miner and first responder safety \u2014 the administration reinstated 328. It's not clear if any rehired workers focus on mental health initiatives.",
      "At least two lawsuits challenging the firings are winding through the courts. Meanwhile, hundreds of NIOSH employees remain on administrative leave, unable to work.",
      "Emily Hilliard, a press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, asserted in a statement that \"the nation's critical public health functions remain intact and effective,\" including support for coal miners and firefighters through NIOSH. \"Improving the mental health of American workers remains a key priority for HHS, and that work is ongoing,\" she wrote.",
      "She did not answer specific questions from KFF Health News about whether any reinstated NIOSH employees lead mental health efforts or who is continuing such work.",
      "Reducing suicides and addiction in construction and mining",
      "Over 5,000 construction workers die by suicide annually \u2014 five times the number who die from work-related injuries, according to the Center for Construction Research and Training. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows miners suffer high rates too. And nearly a fifth of workers in both industries have a substance use disorder, double the rate among all U.S. workers, according to a report from NORC at the University of Chicago and the National Safety Council.",
      "Kyle Zimmer recognized these issues as early as 2010. That's when he started a members' assistance program for the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 478 in Connecticut. He hired a licensed clinician on retainer and developed partnerships with local treatment facilities.",
      "At first, workers pushed back, said Zimmer, who recently retired after 25 years in the union, many as director of health and safety.",
      "Their perception was, \"If I speak up about this issue, I'm going to be blackballed from the industry,\" he said.",
      "But slowly, that changed \u2014 with NIOSH's help, Zimmer said.",
      "The agency developed an approach to worker safety called Total Worker Health, which identifies physical and mental health as critical to occupational safety. It also shifts the focus from how individuals can keep themselves safe to how policies and environments can be changed to keep them safe.",
      "Over decades, the concept spread from research journals and universities to industry conferences, unions, and eventually workers, Zimmer said. People began accepting that mental health was an occupational safety issue, he said. That paved the way for NIOSH's Miner Health Program to develop resources on addiction and for Zimmer to establish the recovery coaching program in Connecticut.",
      "\"We have beat that stigma down by a lot,\" Zimmer said.",
      "Other countries have made more progress on mental health at work, said Sally Spencer-Thomas, co-chair of the International Association for Suicide Prevention's workplace special interest group. But with the growth of the Total Worker Health approach, a 2022 surgeon general report on the topic, and increasing research, the U.S. appeared to finally be catching up. The recent cuts to NIOSH suggest \"we're kind of losing our footing,\" she said.",
      "Last year, Natalie Schwatka, an assistant professor at the Colorado School of Public Health's Center for Health, Work & Environment, received a five-year NIOSH grant to build a toolkit to help leaders in labor-intensive industries, such as construction and mining, strengthen worker safety and mental health.",
      "While many companies connect people to treatment, few focus on preventing mental illness, Schwatka said. NIOSH funding \"allows us to do innovative things that maybe industry wouldn't necessarily start.\"",
      "Her team planned to test the toolkit with eight construction companies in the coming years. But with few NIOSH employees left to process annual renewals, the funds could stop flowing anytime.",
      "The consequence of losing such research is not confined to academia, Zimmer said. \"Workers' health and safety is very much in jeopardy.\"",
      "Health care sector braces for fallout from NIOSH cuts",
      "For a long time, clinicians have had troubling rates of addiction and suicide risk. Just after the height of the pandemic, a NIOSH survey found nearly half of health workers reported feeling burned out and nearly half intended to look for a new job. The agency declared a mental health crisis in that workforce.",
      "NIOSH received $20 million through the American Rescue Plan Act to create a national campaign to improve the mental health of health workers.",
      "The results included a step-by-step guide for hospital leaders to improve systems to support their employees, as well as tips and suggested language for leaders to discuss well-being and for workers to advocate for better policies.",
      "Cunningham, the behavioral scientist who left NIOSH this year, helped lead the effort. He said the goal was to move beyond asking health workers to be resilient or develop meditation skills.",
      "\"We're not saying resilience is bad, but we're trying to emphasize that's not the first thing we need to focus on,\" he said.",
      "Instead, NIOSH suggested eliminating intrusive questions about mental health that weren't relevant to keeping patients safe from hospital credentialing forms and offering workers more input on how their schedules are made.",
      "The agency partnered on this work with the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation, named after an emergency medicine doctor who died by suicide during the pandemic. The foundation extended the campaign by helping health systems in four states implement pieces of the guide and learn from one another.",
      "Foundation leaders recently appeared on Capitol Hill with Noah Wyle, who plays an emergency physician on the TV series \"The Pitt,\" to advocate for renewed federal funding for this work.",
      "Corey Feist, foundation CEO and co-founder, said renewing that funding to NIOSH is crucial to get this guide out to all hospitals.",
      "Without those resources, \"it's just going to really delay this transformation of health care that needs to happen,\" he said.",
      "Who can fill the gap?",
      "TJ Lyons, a multidecade construction industry safety professional who has worked at big-name companies such as Gilbane, Turner, and DPR Construction, is confident that workplace mental health will remain a priority despite the NIOSH cuts.",
      "General contractors and project owners have been incorporating budget lines for mental health support for years, he said, sharing an example of a $1 billion project that included a mental health clinician on call for four hours several days a week. Workers would make appointments to sit in their pickup trucks during lunch breaks and talk to her, he said.",
      "Now when these big companies subcontract with smaller firms, they often ask if the subcontractors provide mental health support for workers, Lyons said.",
      "But others are skeptical that industry can replace NIOSH efforts.",
      "Several workplace safety experts said smaller companies lack the means to commission research studies and larger companies may not share the results publicly, as a federal agency would. Nor would they have the same credibility.",
      "\"Private industry is going to provide what the people paying them want to provide,\" said a NIOSH employee and member of the American Federation of Government Employees union, currently on administrative leave, who was granted anonymity for fear of professional retaliation.",
      "Without federal attention on workplace mental health, \"people may leave the workforce,\" she said. \"Workers may die.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

      "The president announced the 35% tax in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney posted to Truth Social, citing Canada's alleged \"failure to stop the drugs from pouring into our country,\" as well as retaliatory tariffs Canada has imposed on U.S. goods. The new tariffs are set to take effect Aug. 1, the president said.",
      "The move is an escalation from the 25% tariffs on Canadian \u2014 and Mexican \u2014 imports announced by Mr. Trump shortly after taking office. He later exempted goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which was negotiated during Mr. Trump's first term. It's unclear whether the same exemption will apply to next month's 35% tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent similar letters to the leaders of more than 20 other countries this week, telling them to expect higher tariffs starting next month. He told NBC News' Kristen Welker on Thursday, \"all of the remaining countries\" will likely face tariffs of 15% to 20% \u2014 higher than the baseline 10% rate that's currently applied to all countries.",
      "But Canada is the largest American trading partner to receive a letter so far. Canada was the world's largest buyer of American goods and the third-largest seller of goods to the U.S. last year, according to Census Bureau data. The country bought some $350 billion worth of American goods and sold $412 billion to the U.S. market in 2024.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter to Carney says he will \"consider an adjustment to this letter\" if \"Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl.\" For months, the president has cast tariffs against Canada and Mexico as a way of getting the U.S.'s two neighbors to stem illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking, though very little fentanyl appears to enter the U.S. via Canada. Just 43 pounds were seized at the Canadian border last year, compared to 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "\"Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses,\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote in a social media post late Thursday night. \"We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1. Canada has made vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl in North America. We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries.\"",
      "The president also assailed Canada for \"retaliat[ing] with its own Tariffs.\" And he said Canada has imposed other barriers on U.S. imports.",
      "Mr. Trump has held on-and-off discussions with Canada for months, but his relationship with the United States' northern neighbor has occasionally been rocky, with U.S. tariffs drawing retaliatory duties from Canada. The president\u00a0briefly called off all trade talks\u00a0with Canada last month due to a planned digital services tax that could hit U.S. tech companies, but the talks\u00a0resumed days later\u00a0after Carney rescinded the tax.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0repeatedly mused about annexing Canada, and Carney's party won this year's parliamentary elections after the prime minister ran on a platform\u00a0of defending Canada from the Trump administration's ambitions.",
      "Trump boosts tariffs on dozens of countries",
      "The president is sending out this week's spate of tariff letters about three months after first unveiling \"reciprocal tariffs\" against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, along with a 10% tariff on everybody else. The move unnerved financial markets and sparked recession and inflation fears, and Mr. Trump quickly suspended most of the duties for 90 days \u2014 aside from the 10% baseline rate \u2014 saying he planned to negotiate trade deals.",
      "With that 90-day pause set to expire this week, Mr. Trump began sending out letters to dozens of trading partners from Japan to South Africa informing them of their planned tariffs. The U.S. has trade deficits with most countries that received Mr. Trump's letters, though Brazil was also threatened with a 50% tariff despite the U.S. running a trade surplus. The letter cited the prosecution of right-wing former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called a \"Witch Hunt.\"",
      "On top of country-specific tariffs, the president has also imposed hefty \"sectoral\" tariffs on foreign steel, copper and other specific categories of goods.",
      "Mr. Trump says the tariffs are necessary to revive American manufacturing and correct trade imbalances. But many economists warn that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said concerns about tariffs are partly to blame for the central bank's decision not to cut interest rates so far this year.",
      "Still, the president has stood by his trade strategy.",
      "\"I think the tariffs have been very well-received,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Thursday. \"The stock market hit a new high today.\"",

    "summary": "The State Department is planning to lay off hundreds of U.S. staff, part of the Trump administration's plan to slash the size of the federal workforce.",
    "story": [
      "The State Department will begin layoffs as early as Friday as it seeks to cut the size of its U.S. workforce by about 15%, CBS News has learned \u2014 part of the Trump administration's sweeping plan to reorganize the department.",
      "The cuts will include layoffs, or reductions-in-force (RIF), as well as voluntary departures by State Department staffers who took part in the Trump administration's buyout programs, two senior State Department officials said Thursday. The department is also closing or merging scores of U.S.-based offices and rearranging its organizational chart shortly after.",
      "The total number of layoffs expected in the coming days will be \"pretty close\" to the roughly 1,800 that were listed in a plan submitted to Congress earlier this year, one senior department official said.",
      "Cuts to staff stationed overseas are not planned at this time, according to the official.",
      "A draft reduction-in-force notice obtained by CBS News said the goal is \"streamlining domestic operations to focus on diplomatic priorities.\" It added the cuts \"have been carefully tailored to affect non-core functions.\"",
      "Critics argue the cuts could undermine the State Department's work.",
      "The long-planned cuts are taking place days after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration's sweeping plans to slash the size of the government workforce, pausing a lower court order that halted layoff plans at dozens of federal agencies.",
      "Department staff were informed of the impending reduction-in-force plans in a Thursday afternoon message from Deputy Secretary of State Michael Rigas obtained by CBS News, thanking staff who face layoffs \"for their dedication and service to the United States.\"",
      "Some employees were told that due to the anticipated RIF, they would not be permitted to telework on Friday, and should report to work with all department-issued equipment including laptops, telephones, diplomatic passports, travel cards, and any other property owned by the State Department. An email with these instructions told staff that badges would be collected during outprocessing, and to ensure that any personal items be collected before that time.",
      "The department told reporters it plans to conduct the reductions-in-force over the course of a single day.",
      "Trump administration planning sweeping State Department reorganization",
      "After the reduction-in-force notices go out, the agency will move into a \"transition period of several weeks\" to phase in the new organization chart, a senior State Department official told reporters on Thursday.",
      "The official said the changes are aimed at \"streamlining this bloated bureaucracy,\" cutting redundant departments, consolidating functions like human resources and finance, and shifting more focus to foreign embassies and offices assigned to handle specific regions.",
      "For example, the official said, the State Department has multiple offices that oversee sanctions.",
      "\"Now, no one's saying that the people who were working in any of those sanctions offices weren't doing a good job or weren't valuable members of the State Department family, but at the end of the day, we have to do what's right for the mission and what's right for the American people, and that means having one combined sanctions office,\" the official said.",
      "The department's Political Affairs bureau \u2014 which includes the country-specific desks that handle the United States' relations with individual nations and regions \u2014 is \"largely unaffected by the reductions,\" according to the official.",
      "Another senior State Department official told reporters the department \"identified offices where natural efficiencies could be found.\"",
      "\"We took a very deliberate step to reorganize the State Department to be more efficient and more focused,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters during a trip to Malaysia on Thursday.",
      "The State Department formally told Congress about its reorganization plans in May, telling lawmakers it intended to eliminate about 3,400 U.S.-based jobs and close or merge almost half of its domestic offices. At the time, the department said it planned to phase out some offices focused on democracy or human rights that it claimed were \"prone to ideological capture,\" and add new offices focused on \"civil liberties\" and \"free market principles.\"",
      "The plan also integrates the previous functions of the U.S. Agency for International Development into the State Department, after the Trump administration moved to shutter the foreign aid agency. That move has drawn stiff criticism, with Democrats arguing the agency was unlawfully shut down without permission from Congress and humanitarian groups warning the shutdown could endanger public health.",
      "The American Foreign Service Association, which represents members of the Foreign Service, has also previously pushed back on the plans.",
      "\"No one disputes the value of strengthening and rationalizing the State Department to meet today's global challenges. But there is a right way and a wrong way to do it,\" the association said in April. \"The right way does not involve weakening and demoralizing the workforce. Neither does it involve rhetoric that accuses our diplomats of being ineffective, lacking accountability and concern for American interests.\"",
      "The cuts to the State Department have drawn pushback from Democratic lawmakers, who argue the moves could undermine American diplomatic efforts.",
      "Many department staff have expressed alarm at the changes. For foreign service officers, the reductions-in-force are based on whether they worked in an office impacted by the reorganization on May 29, one of the two senior State Department officials told reporters Thursday.",
      "A current State Department employee told CBS News there are people who were in these positions six weeks ago, but have since moved on to new assignments. \"So why would you punish them for previously having held a job that they're no longer in?\" they said. \"It makes absolutely no sense.\"",
      "The second senior State Department official told reporters, \"we've tried to do this in an anonymized functional way,\" with cuts based on department.",
      "\"Some of these are positions that are being eliminated, not people,\" Rubio said Thursday.",

    "summary": "A top White House budget official said President Trump is \"troubled\" by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's management, as Mr. Trump pressures him over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "A top Trump administration official accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law\" on Thursday, a new broadside against the central bank chief as President Trump tangles with him over interest rates.",
      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a letter Thursday.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its years-long office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Federal Reserve for comment.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",
      "The Fed has previously acknowledged in budget reports that the price tag for its office renovations had jumped due to \"significant increases in raw materials costs.\"",
      "Last week, Bill Pulte, the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, also accused Powell of \"deceptive\" testimony to the Senate about the office project.",
      "Asked about the allegation in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump said: \"Then he should resign immediately. We should get somebody in it that's going to lower interest rates.\"",

      "In a letter delivered Monday and obtained by CBS News, Dr. Shoshana Shendelman also demanded a formal apology from acting school President Claire Shipman and board co-chairs David Greenwald and Jeh Johnson.",
      "\"The conduct which has been exhibited by Columbia leadership in recent months \u2014 particularly the failure to decisively address antisemitism on campus \u2014 demonstrates a disturbing lack of moral clarity and poses a significant threat to the safety and well-being of Jewish students, faculty, and the broader community of Columbia University,\" Shendelman wrote.",
      "\"It is evident that the ongoing failures have resulted in substantial legal and financial ramifications, and our university's reputation has been tarnished for the foreseeable future. Unequivocally, this is the direct consequence of Columbia's failure to adhere with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act,\" she added.",
      "That section of the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin by organizations that get federal funds.",
      "\"Columbia must fully accept the Trump administration's demands regarding antisemitism and Title VI compliance,\" the letter continued. \"It is the right thing to do for our students, and it is undeniable that the current situation at Columbia is untenable. Thus, our Board must work promptly and unconditionally with the United States Federal government.\"",
      "The letter comes on the heels of the release of text messages Shipman wrote in 2023 and 2024 suggesting that Shendelman, who is Jewish with Iranian ancestry, be removed from the board.",
      "In the texts, Shipman also pushed for the addition of an Arab trustee to the board, saying, \"We need to get somebody from the middle east [sic] or who is Arab on our board. Quickly I think. Somehow.\"",
      "The texts were released last week by New York Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik, chair of the House Committee on Education and Workforce, which has been investigating antisemitism on college campuses.",
      "Shendelman asked in her letter to be \"renewed for a second term as a Trustee, should I elect to continue my service\" and requested a written response from the board within 48 hours.",
      "A Columbia spokesperson said in a statement Thursday morning that Shipman \"has apologized to Dr. Shendelman and others regarding internal communications that members of Congress chose to make public.\"",
      "\"Columbia University leadership \u2014 including the acting president and Board co-chairs \u2014 are deeply committed to combatting antisemitism on campus and securing Columbia's future as a safe and welcoming place for all community members,\" the spokesperson said. \"They remain fully focused on ongoing discussions to reach an agreement with the Joint Task Force to Combat Antisemitism to restore the University's critical partnership with the federal government.\"",
      "In a letter to Shendelman on Wednesday, Greenwald and Johnson, the Board of Trustees co-chairs, wrote that they are \"deeply sorry about the internal communications that referred to you, that certain members of Congress chose to make public.\"",
      "\"As we conveyed to you when we last spoke, we value your viewpoints and experiences around antisemitism at Columbia and beyond. The viewpoints you have expressed in our internal board of trustee discussions have been impactful and significant,\" Greenwald and Johnson wrote. \"We are at a crucial stage in our negotiations with the federal government to resolve its pending investigations, and we are actively working to try to reach a settlement of those matters soon. \u00a0Most important, we are both fully committed to combating antisemitism at Columbia, without regard to the pending investigations.\"",
      "Shendelman's letter and her request for a new term follow controversy in her professional life outside Columbia.",
      "In December, she was replaced as CEO of pharmaceutical company Applied Therapeutics, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "The move came after the Food and Drug Administration rejected the company's application for a new drug. The agency wrote in a warning letter to Shendelman in November that the company didn't appear to adhere to \"applicable statutory requirements\" and regulations regarding \"the conduct of clinical investigations.\" According to the nonprofit news site The Intercept, Shendelman defended the drug, govorestat, on a podcast, saying there weren't any \"patient safety issues or any patient safety concerns.\"",
      "Shendelman and Applied Therapeutics were named in a shareholder lawsuit filed in federal court in New York in December. The suit alleges that they knew about the issues that led the FDA to reject the drug, but didn't disclose them to investors and instead made \"positive representations\" publicly about the interactions with the FDA. Shendelman and the company deny any wrongdoing, The Intercept reported.",
      "The Education Department threatened Columbia's accreditation last month, saying the school failed to address antisemitism on campus and harassment of Jewish students after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas. The department's civil rights office notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education \u2014 which accredits U.S. colleges and universities \u2014 that Columbia was out of compliance with antidiscrimination laws.",
      "A Columbia spokesperson responded by telling CBS News the school \"is aware of the Department of Education's concerns\" and has \"addressed those concerns directly with Middle States,\" referring to its accreditor. The spokesperson also said Columbia is \"deeply committed to combating antisemitism on our campus\" and is \"continuing to work with the federal government to address it.\"",
      "In March, the Education Department canceled $400 million\u00a0in grants to and contracts with Columbia, citing \"the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" The school said it would work with the Trump administration to get that funding restored.",

      "\"I'm really interested in getting people to focus and to invest and to pay attention to what is happening in our country and in our government,\" Jackson said during a question-and-answer portion of an Indianapolis Bar Association meeting.",
      "\"I'm not afraid to use my voice,\" Jackson said earlier in the event.",
      "Jackson has emerged as the court's fiercest critic of the Trump administration \u2014 and of some of her fellow justices.",
      "Her comments came on the heels of remarks this past weekend at an event in Louisiana, where she explained why she writes so many dissents and speaks the most of any justice at oral arguments, even as the court's most junior member.",
      "\"I just feel that I have a wonderful opportunity to tell people in my opinions how I feel about the issues, and that's what I try to do,\" Jackson said Saturday at the Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans.",
      "Her dissent in the nationwide injunction case, which reined in federal judges' ability to issue sweeping orders and stemmed from Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, prompted an unusually sharp reply from Justice Amy Coney Barrett, which the five other conservatives joined.",
      "Jackson wrote that the majority's decision \"to permit the executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not yet sued is an existential threat to the rule of law.\"",
      "Barrett said Jackson's dissent \"chooses a startling line of attack\" that is \"at odds with more than two centuries' worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself.\"",
      "\"Justice Jackson decries an imperial Executive while embracing an imperial Judiciary,\" Barrett wrote.",
      "And on Tuesday, when the court said the administration could move forward with plans, for now, to cut the federal workforce, Jackson stood alone, calling the order \"not only truly unfortunate, but also hubristic and senseless.\"",
      "\"For some reason, this court sees fit to step in now and release the president's wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation,\" she wrote in a dissent that saw her at odds with all eight of her colleagues.",
      "In Indianapolis, she said she was unfazed by the criticism she's received for her dissents, saying she had a \"very thick skin.\"",
      "Before Mr. Trump won reelection, Jackson said she was \"concerned\" about the court's landmark decision that granted him immunity from prosecution for official acts he took while in office. She suggested that the ruling gives Mr. Trump special treatment compared to anyone else in the criminal justice system.",
      "\"I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,\" she said.",

    "summary": "ICE official Thomas Giles was asked in federal court Thursday about where Kilmar Abrego Garcia would be sent if released from pretrial detention.",
    "story": [
      "An Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said that if Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, were to be released from pretrial detention, ICE officials have not determined where he would be sent.",
      "\"There's been no decision made, as he is not in ICE custody,\" Thomas Giles, assistant director for ICE enforcement and removal operations, testified Thursday in federal court in Maryland. Giles was in court after U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis earlier this week ordered the government to produce someone with firsthand knowledge of any third country Abrego Garcia where he could be deported if he were released from custody.",
      "Giles said ICE would take custody of Abrego Garcia \"as soon as possible\" and the transfer would take place in Tennessee, where he's being detained. He said that the Salvadoran native's detention location would be \"based on bed space availability,\" and added that ICE lacks the resources to work on the case until he is in its custody.",
      "At that point, a decision about Abrego Garcia's removal would be made within \"a few days to a few weeks.\" Abrego Garcia would \"receive a notice of removal\u2026and will get a fear interview if he claims fear of return,\" if he has a fear \"of being returned to a third country,\" Giles said.",
      "If Abrego Garcia were to receive a notice of removal, up until his deportation, he would be able to express fear about going to a third country, a period of time that could range from \"a day to a week,\" Giles said.",
      "A magistrate judge ruled last month that Abrego Garcia should be released before his trial on human trafficking charges, but in a hearing on June 26, Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn said that if the Salvadoran man were to be released, ICE would begin removal proceedings to a \"third country,\" instead of his native El Salvador.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers and the Justice Department ultimately agreed that he would remain in the custody of U.S. Marshals at least until a hearing next week, on July 16, and a ruling on the government's bid to revoke his release order.",
      "At the end of the day, Xinis said she was not willing to allow for an \"unfettered release\" of Abrego Garcia into ICE custody so he can be \"spirited away\" and removed from the U.S. before she rules. The hearing will continue Friday.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney, Sascha Rand, at some points sought to cast doubt on the reliability of Giles' testimony, eliciting from him that he had no involvement in Abrego Garcia's case until this week. He said his prior knowledge of the case was based on media reports, until ICE issued an immigration detainer in June to local officials in Tennessee, after Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. to face criminal charges. The charges stemmed from a traffic stop in 2019.",
      "Under Rand's questioning, Giles also said that he had never been involved in a successful third-country removal and knew of no other deportation officer in a similar capacity who had been involved in one.",
      "Earlier Thursday, the Justice Department said it was willing to agree not to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country without following due process, and that it would not remove him to El Salvador without first reopening his immigration case and terminating the court order that bars his deportation to El Salvador.",
      "But Abrego Garcia's attorneys told U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis that they didn't agree to the government's stipulation because it would not guarantee him advanced notice of his removal or a court hearing in the proper jurisdiction before removal.",
      "On Monday, after denying the government's motions to dismiss Abrego Garcia's lawsuit over his deportation, Xinis asked the government for a witness with \"firsthand knowledge\" about where he would be deported if he were to be released from custody. She also said Abrego Garcia should be given \"a reasonable amount of time\" to challenge his removal.",
      "She expressed some frustration during that hearing with the government's lack of information about Abrego Garcia's short\u2013term fate. \"It's like trying to nail Jello to a wall trying to find out what is going to happen next week,\" Xinis said, adding that it remains within her jurisdiction to ensure that Abrego Garcia is \"not spirited away again\" to another country without due process.",
      "Xinis said Monday the government could \"clarify all of this\" in a \"binding way,\" if it stipulated that he would receive due process \u2014 that he would not be removed without notice and would have the opportunity to be heard before a court.",
      "On Monday, Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn told the court the government had not yet decided whether to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country or to challenge a previous court order that bars his removal to El Salvador.",

    "summary": "A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security called Mahmoud Khalil's claim \"absurd,\" accusing him of \"hateful behavior and rhetoric\" that threatened Jewish students.",
    "story": [
      "On a recent afternoon, Mahmoud Khalil sat in his Manhattan apartment, cradling his 10-week-old son as he thought back to the pre-dawn hours spent pacing a frigid immigration jail in Louisiana, awaiting news of the child's birth in New York.",
      "For a moment, the outspoken Palestinian activist found himself uncharacteristically speechless.",
      "\"I cannot describe the pain of that night,\" Khalil said finally, gazing down as the baby, Deen, cooed in his arms. \"This is something I will never forgive.\"",
      "Now, weeks after regaining his freedom, Khalil is seeking restitution. On Thursday, his lawyers filed a claim for $20 million in damages against the Trump administration, alleging Khalil was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted and smeared as an antisemite as the government sought to deport him over his prominent role in campus protests.",
      "The filing \u2014 a precursor to a lawsuit under the Federal Tort Claims Act \u2014 names the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the State Department.",
      "It comes as the deportation case against Khalil, a 30-year-old recent graduate student at Columbia University, continues to wind its way through the immigration court system.",
      "The goal, Khalil said, is to send a message that he won't be intimidated into silence.",
      "\"They are abusing their power because they think they are untouchable,\" Khalil said. \"Unless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked.\"",
      "Khalil said he plans to share any settlement money with others targeted in President Trump's \"failed\" effort to suppress pro-Palestinian speech. In lieu of a settlement, he would also accept an official apology and changes to the administration's deportation policies.",
      "In an emailed statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, called Khalil's claim \"absurd,\" accusing him of \"hateful behavior and rhetoric\" that threatened Jewish students.",
      "The State Department said its actions toward Khalil were fully supported by the law. Inquiries to the White House and ICE were not immediately returned.",
      "The filing accuses Mr. Trump and other officials of mounting a campaign to \"terrorize him and his family,\" beginning with Khalil's March 8 arrest.",
      "On that night, he said he was returning home from dinner with his wife, Noor Abdalla, when he was \"effectively kidnapped\" by plainclothes federal agents, who refused to provide a warrant and appeared surprised to learn he was a legal U.S. permanent resident.",
      "He was then whisked overnight to an immigration jail in Jena, Louisiana, a remote location that was \"deliberately concealed\" from his family and attorneys, according to the filing.",
      "Inside, Khalil said he was denied his ulcer medication, forced to sleep under harsh fluorescent lights and fed \"nearly inedible\" food, causing him to lose 15 pounds (7 kilograms). \"I cannot remember a night when I didn't go to sleep hungry,\" Khalil recalled.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration publicly celebrated the arrest, promising to deport him and others whose protests against Israel it dubbed \"pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.\"",
      "Khalil, who has condemned antisemitism before and since his arrest, was not accused of a crime and has not been linked to Hamas or any other terror group. \"At some point, it becomes like reality TV,\" Khalil said of the allegations. \"It's very absurd.\"",
      "A few weeks into his incarceration, Khalil said he was awoken by a fellow detainee, who pointed excitedly to his face on a jailhouse TV screen. A new memo signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged Khalil hadn't broken the law, but argued he should be deported for beliefs that could undermine U.S. foreign policy interests.",
      "\"My beliefs are not wanting my tax money or tuition going toward investments in weapons manufacturers for a genocide,\" Khalil said. \"It's as simple as that.\"",
      "By then, Khalil had become something of a celebrity in the 1,200-person lock-up. When not dealing with his own case, he hosted \"office hours\" for fellow immigrant detainees, leaning on his past experience working at a British embassy in Beirut to help others organize paperwork and find translators for their cases.",
      "\"I'm pretty good at bureaucracy,\" Khalil said.",
      "At night, they played Russian and Mexican card games, as Khalil listened to \"one story after another from people who didn't understand what's happening to them.\"",
      "\"This was one of the most heartbreaking moments,\" he said. \"People on the inside don't know if they have any rights.\"",
      "On June 20, after 104 days in custody, Khalil was ordered released by a federal judge, who found the government's efforts to remove him on foreign policy grounds were likely unconstitutional.",
      "He now faces new allegations of misrepresenting personal details on his green card application. In a motion filed late Wednesday, attorneys for Khalil described those charges as baseless and retaliatory, urging a judge to dismiss them.",
      "The weeks since his release, Khalil said, have brought moments of bliss and intense personal anguish.",
      "Fearing harassment or possible arrest, he leaves the house less frequently, avoiding large crowds or late-night walks. But he lit up as he remembered watching Deen taking his first swim earlier in the week. \"It was not very pleasant for him,\" Khalil said, smiling.",
      "\"I'm trying as much as possible to make up for the time with my son and my wife,\" he added. \"As well thinking about my future and trying to comprehend this new reality.\"",
      "Part of that reality, he said, will be continuing his efforts to advocate against Israel's war in Gaza, which has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza. On the day after his release, he led a march through Manhattan, draped in a Palestinian flag \u2014 and flanked by security.",
      "As he poured Deen's milk into a bottle, Khalil considered whether he might've done anything differently had he known the personal cost of his activism.",
      "\"We could've communicated better. We could've built more bridges with more people,\" he said. \"But the core thing of opposing a genocide, I don't think you can do that any differently. This is your moral imperative when you're watching your people be slaughtered by the minute.\"",

    "story": [
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by President Trump last week will allow him to dramatically expand his immigration crackdown, giving Immigration and Customs Enforcement an unprecedented pool of funding to bolster its efforts to arrest and deport immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The money allocated by the law amounts to the largest infusion of funds Congress has given the federal government for immigration enforcement, at a time when the Trump administration has vowed to oversee a deportation campaign of unprecedented proportions.",
      "Overall, the Republican-led Congress set aside roughly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts through the legislation, including $75 billion in extra funding for ICE, making it by far the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the federal government.",
      "\"The bill will supercharge immigration enforcement,\" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an attorney at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "Here's a look at what the new funds will be used for:",
      "$45 billion for ICE's detention system",
      "The law gives ICE $45 billion to expand its already sprawling detention system over the next four years, letting officials use the money to hold both single adults and families with children facing deportation.",
      "Based on cost estimates, the money could allow ICE to hold more than 100,000 detainees at any given time, roughly doubling the current capacity. On Wednesday morning, ICE was holding just over 58,000 individuals in its detention network, which was previously funded for 41,500 beds, according to internal agency data obtained by CBS News.",
      "ICE's detention network mainly consists of facilities operated by for-profit prison companies and county jails. The Trump administration has also been exploring using military facilities in the U.S. to hold detainees before they are deported. The naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has been housing some ICE detainees since February.",
      "$30 billion for ICE's arrest and deportation efforts",
      "ICE is also receiving nearly $30 billion in additional money to fund every single stage of the deportation process.",
      "Congress said ICE can use the money to hire additional deportation officers and other staff; retain current personnel through bonuses; increase transportation assets supporting deportation efforts; and expand and facilitate agreements that allow state and local officials to enforce federal immigration laws.",
      "The funds can also be used to modernize ICE's fleet of deportation planes and hire more agency prosecutors whose job it is to persuade immigration judges that unauthorized immigrants should be deported.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has said the money could pave the way for ICE to hire 10,000 deportation officers. The agency currently has fewer than 6,000 officers in its deportation branch, though the Trump administration has tasked other federal law enforcement agencies, like the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration, to support immigration arrests throughout the country.",
      "Tens of billions of dollars for other immigration and border efforts",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" allocates tens of billions of dollars for other types of immigration-related enforcement, including along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "More than $46 billion is allocated for Customs and Border Protection to build walls, barriers and related projects along the U.S.-Mexico border. The agency received an additional $12 billion to fund Border Patrol agent vehicles, facilities, training, hiring and bonuses.",
      "While the money is allocated for CBP, the Trump administration has been using hundreds of Border Patrol agents in the interior of the country to help ICE arrest unauthorized immigrants in places like Los Angeles. That deployment has come amid historically low levels of illegal crossings at the U.S. southern border.",
      "The law also gives the Department of Homeland Security a catch-all pool of $10 billion to support its \"mission to safeguard the borders of the United States.\" Another $13.5 billion was set aside to reimburse states for their immigration enforcement and border security actions, including for efforts under the Biden administration.",
      "That money for states could allow Texas to be paid back for Operation Lone Star, under which the state deployed National Guardsmen to fortify the southern border and bussed thousands of migrants to Democratic-led cities. It could also fund actions taken by states like Florida to aid the Trump administration's deportation campaign by deputizing state officials as immigration agents and offering facilities, like the so-called \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" to hold detainees awaiting deportation.",
      "ICE heads hails funds; but critics have concerns",
      "In a statement, Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, hailed passage of the \"big, beautiful bill.\"",
      "\"The unprecedented funding for ICE will enable my hard-working officers and agents to continue making America safe again by identifying, arresting and removing criminal aliens from our communities,\" Lyons said.",
      "But critics of the administration have denounced Republican lawmakers for giving billions of dollars to an agency under fire in many parts of the country over concerns that its enforcement operations have been too aggressive and indiscriminate.",
      "Andrea Flores, a former Biden administration immigration official, warned that the money given to ICE would lead to dire humanitarian, legal and economic consequences, including \"inhumane\" conditions at detention facilities.",
      "\"The administration now has the resources it needs to carry out more deportations than we have ever seen in modern history,\" said Flores, who now serves as a vice president at FWD.US, a bipartisan group that supports liberal immigration policies.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is expected to vote next week on a request from the White House to claw back funding for international aid and public broadcasting. But the funding for rural radio and television stations \u2014 sometimes an area's sole source for emergency warnings and other news \u2014 has sparked concern among some Senate Republicans, especially after the recent devastating flash floods in Texas.",
      "The White House asked lawmakers to rescind $9.4 billion in spending on June 3, starting the clock on a process that gives Congress 45 days to act. The House approved the rescission package last month, and the Senate now faces a July 18 deadline. But a number of Senate Republicans now say they want to see changes to the package.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican who sits on the Appropriations Committee, told reporters Wednesday that he's not comfortable with some of the rescission package's provisions, like cuts to public broadcasting, saying, \"That's the reason why we're proposing changes.\"",
      "Along with $8.3 billion in cuts to international assistance programs, the package includes a proposed $1.1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to NPR and PBS. The White House has targeted the entities, including in a May executive order that instructed the CPB to cease federal funding for PBS and NPR, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "PBS CEO Paula Kerger and NPR CEO Katherine Maher defended their organizations' records in an appearance on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" in May, outlining how local stations will see the immediate impacts of cuts to public broadcasting funding.",
      "\"The impact of this could really be devastating, particularly in rural communities,\" Maher said, noting that there are 246 stations throughout the country, and for some Americans, they provide the sole local source of news. Kerger said for stations in small communities, some of which receive 40 or 50% of their funding from the federal government, \"it's existential.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said Wednesday that there would be an amendment process on the rescissions package, forecasting a vote next week. And Rounds outlined to reporters earlier in the day that Senate Republicans have been considering the best way to handle the opposition to some provisions within the rescissions package, saying they plan to resolve the issue through an amendment or \"other means.\"",
      "\"There's a specific group of Native American tribes that have a public radio system set up, and really the vast majority of the funding for it comes from one source, and that's within the rescission package,\" Rounds told reporters earlier this week. \"What we're trying to do is to work with [the Office of Management and Budget] to find a path forward where the funding for those radio stations would be left alone.\"",
      "Rounds noted that the goal is not to eliminate a number of the provisions within the rescissions package, but \"specifically to take care of those that were in some of these rural areas,\" pointing to stations in South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana and Alaska.",
      "\"This is their way of getting emergency messages out to people. It's the way in which they communicate in a very rural area,\" Rounds said. \"So for us, it's a matter of, for those specific ones, it's not a lot of funding involved with it, but it's pretty important in those rural areas.\"",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, told reporters that cuts to local radio stations and the impact it could have on Native American tribes is \"something we'll take a look at.\" And GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia told CBS News that the impact on rural stations is \"one of the considerations\" lawmakers are taking into account.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, defended public broadcasting and its role in her state during a hearing on the rescissions package last month. \"I hope you feel the urgency that I'm trying to express on behalf of the people in rural Alaska and I think in many parts of rural America where this is their lifeline,\" Murkowski told OMB Director Russ Vought.",
      "\"This is where they get the updates on [landslides], this is where they get the updates on the wildfires that are coming their way,\" she said.",
      "GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told reporters Thursday that while she's supportive of \"a lot\" of what the CPB does, citing the funding for local stations and maintaining the Emergency Alert System, \"the problem is NPR, which has a decidedly partisan bent.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a group of Democrats took to the Senate floor Wednesday to rail against the cuts to public broadcasting within the rescissions package, including Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Peter Welch of Vermont, Maria Cantwell of Washington, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.",
      "Durbin warned that \"once these stations are gone, they're gone.\"",
      "\"In times of crisis, that could mean in the extreme a difference between life and death,\" Durbin said, citing as examples the ability of Alaska radio stations to share information about weather conditions, or emergency alerts to go out during tornado scares in Alabama. \"These are critical services, but President Trump doesn't agree.\"",
      "Wyden cited the Texas flash floods, saying \"we saw the devastating impact of underfunded emergency alert systems with the deadly flash flooding in Texas.\"",
      "\"As more details emerge, there's one area that seems to me to be clear: More could and should have been done to bolster the local emergency alert system to help avoid and limit the horrendous tragedies that we have watched nightly for the last few days,\" Wyden added. \"As extreme deadly weather events like this become more and more common, local, state and federal governments need to be investing \u2014 not shrinking \u2014 systems like public TV and radio.\"",
      "Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, told CBS News that he's \"very concerned\" about the cuts, adding that \"in big rural western states,\" many communities are \"completely dependent on those rural radio stations for emergency services.\" Flash floods killed at least three people in New Mexico earlier this week, officials said.",
      "\"There's not a backup, there's not competition, and so that's something we're looking very closely at,\" Heinrich said.",
      "Still, other senators saw things differently.",

      "At issue is the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" The Trump administration says the phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means the U.S. can deny citizenship to babies born to women in the country illegally, ending what has been seen as an intrinsic part of U.S. law for more than a century.",
      "\"Prior misimpressions of the citizenship clause have created a perverse incentive for illegal immigration that has negatively impacted this country's sovereignty, national security, and economic stability,\" government lawyers wrote in the New Hampshire case.",
      "LaPlante, who had issued a narrow injunction in a similar case, said while he didn't consider the government's arguments frivolous, he found them unpersuasive. He said his decision to issue an injunction was \"not a close call\" and that deprivation of U.S. citizenship clearly amounted to irreparable harm.",
      "Several federal judges had issued nationwide injunctions stopping Mr. Trump's order from taking effect, but the U.S. Supreme Court limited those injunctions in a June 27 ruling that gave lower courts 30 days to act. With that time frame in mind, opponents of the change quickly returned to court to try to block it. Universal injunctions in class action suits are on stronger legal footing under the Supreme Court's new framework.",
      "In a Washington state case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, the judges have asked the parties to write briefs explaining the effect of the Supreme Court's ruling. Washington and the other states in that lawsuit have asked the appeals court to return the case to the lower court judge.",
      "As in New Hampshire, a plaintiff in Maryland seeks to organize a class action lawsuit that includes every person who would be affected by the order. The judge set a Wednesday deadline for written legal arguments as she considers the request for another nationwide injunction from CASA, a nonprofit immigrant rights organization.",
      "Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA, said the group has been stressing to its members and clients that it is not time to panic.",
      "\"No one has to move states right this instant,\" she said. \"There's different avenues through which we are all fighting, again, to make sure that this executive order never actually sees the light of day.\"",
      "The New Hampshire plaintiffs, referred to only by pseudonyms, include a woman from Honduras who has a pending asylum application and is due to give birth to her fourth child in October. She told the court the family came to the U.S. after being targeted by gangs.",
      "\"I do not want my child to live in fear and hiding. I do not want my child to be a target for immigration enforcement,\" she wrote. \"I fear our family could be at risk of separation.\"",
      "Another plaintiff, a man from Brazil, has lived with his wife in Florida for five years. Their first child was born in March, and they are in the process of applying for lawful permanent status based on family ties \u2014 his wife's father is a U.S. citizen.",
      "\"My baby has the right to citizenship and a future in the United States,\" he wrote.",

      "President Trump announced Wednesday that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy will temporarily lead the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, weeks after Mr. Trump withdrew an Elon Musk-linked entrepreneur as his pick to lead the space agency.",
      "The president praised Duffy in a Wednesday Truth Social post, writing: \"He will be a fantastic leader of the ever more important Space Agency, even if only for a short period of time.\"",
      "\"Honored to accept this mission. Time to take over space. Let's launch,\" Duffy\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "NASA was being\u00a0led by Janet Petro, a former leader of the Kennedy Space Center who has served as the agency's acting administrator since the start of Mr. Trump's term. She'll be returning to that post, she said in a statement Thursday, adding that in that role, she would continue \"to work hand-in-hand with Secretary Duffy to propel the President's ambitious goals.\"",
      "Mr. Trump initially chose billionaire private astronaut Jared Isaacman to lead NASA, but the president pulled his nomination just days before the Senate was set to hold a confirmation vote, citing a \"thorough review of prior associations.\"",
      "Last weekend, the president expanded on the issue, saying Isaacman was recommended to him by Musk \"and, while I thought his friend was very good, I was surprised to learn that he was a blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.\"",
      "Federal Election Commission records show Isaacman has donated to Democratic congressional candidates and groups, though he has also given some money to Republicans.",
      "\"I also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life,\" Mr. Trump wrote in a Truth Social post last weekend, referring to Musk's company SpaceX, which has NASA contracts.",
      "Isaacman has previously flown on SpaceX rockets as a private astronaut. In a Monday post on X, Isaacman described himself as \"relatively apolitical\" and a \"right-leaning moderate,\" and said he disclosed his political donations prior to his nomination. He also said he \"only know[s] Elon professionally\" and does not own any equity in SpaceX, but he has a \"firsthand appreciation for what he and his companies have accomplished.\"",
      "Days after Isaacman's nomination was pulled, a feud between Mr. Trump and Musk \u2014 a onetime Trump ally who served as a special government employee heading up the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 burst into public view. The attacks between the president and the world's richest man have largely focused on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a massive spending package that Musk has criticized.",

    "summary": "Business is being accused by Sen. Chuck Grassley of having \"spent years fleecing taxpayers.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 During President Trump's first term, an Ohio company was admonished by Republicans and Democrats in Congress after an audit claimed it made millions in excess profit from federal defense contracts.",
      "Facing bipartisan frustration, TransDigm Group Inc. eventually of its own accord paid the money back. Yet after another review in 2021 outlined similar concerns, the company did not voluntarily refund millions of dollars in question. Since then, campaign finance records show the company's CEO Kevin Stein has donated to candidates from both major political parties and gave more than $300,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee earlier this year as Mr. Trump and many others within the GOP sharply criticized what they viewed as waste in government.",
      "\"Both sides should be screaming from the rooftops about this,\" William Hartung, a defense spending expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft think tank, said about TransDigm's business practices which he views as having taken advantage of a dysfunctional system.",
      "TransDigm may be little known to the public at large, but the company has attracted attention in the halls of Congress. Within the last decade, Stein has testified to lawmakers amid scrutiny of the business, which deals in parts for both military and commercial aircraft.",
      "\"As my oversight has exposed, TransDigm has spent years fleecing taxpayers to the tune of millions of dollars,\" Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley said in a statement. \"The Department of Defense Inspector General needs to conduct aggressive oversight of TransDigm's abuses and ensure proper accountability is had. At the same time, the Defense Department must step up its game to implement enhanced internal controls and explore alternative pathways of production, including through reverse engineering of spare parts, to avoid being swindled by contractors like TransDigm.\"",
      "TransDigm did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "In February 2019, an audit released by the Department of Defense Inspector General's Office \"determined that for 112 contracts, TransDigm earned $16.1 million in excess profit for 46 parts it sold to the [Defense Logistics Agency] and the Army for $26.2 million between January 2015 and January 2017.\"",
      "Months later as part of a House Oversight Committee hearing, Stein refuted the report, arguing in a written statement that its findings were \"based on cost data that excludes many actual costs of doing business.\"",
      "Still, lawmakers took issue with the company.",
      "North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, who would later become Mr. Trump's chief of staff towards the end of the president's first term, encouraged the company during the hearing to \"chalk it up to marketing expense and pay the American taxpayer back immediately.\"",
      "Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz argued the business was \"grossly robbing the American taxpayers and impacting our military readiness and our ability to make sure that we have the ability to accomplish mission-critical goals.\"",
      "Across Capitol Hill that same day, Grassley said during a speech that the report \"exposes a galactic price gouging, colossal rip-off and out-of-this-world waste.\"",
      "The company later voluntarily repaid the $16.1 million.",
      "Close to three years later, during Democratic President Joe Biden's tenure, the Defense Department's Inspector General's Office released another report looking at January 2017 to June 2019. That audit alleged findings \"that TransDigm earned excess profit of at least $20.8 million on 105 spare parts on 150 contracts.\"",
      "A 2022 House hearing on that report was far more politically divisive than the similar one held in 2019. Stein testified again, and shared what he described as deep concern \"with the fundamental errors in this report,\" while some Republicans took issue with the attention being trained on TransDigm.",
      "\"I don't think we should be picking on any one company, particularly an American-owned company, here,\" North Carolina GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx said during the hearing.",
      "Democrats continued to challenge company leaders, along with Grassley, a Republican.",
      "\"You all are the perfect poster child of an out-of-control defense budget that puts the interests of wealthy, well-connected people like yourselves ahead of the best interests of the American people,\" progressive Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib said at the time.",
      "Later, Grassley signed a letter asking for the amount of money identified in the 2021 audit to be repaid. A response from Stein obtained by CBS News shows the CEO argued that \"while the headline from the audit report may be TransDigm made \"excess profit,\" the reality is that this conclusion is derived from the audit report inexplicably counting millions of dollars of real costs as profit and creating an artificial profit measure not found in law.\"",
      "The Defense Department, which has the largest discretionary budget in the federal government, has long been susceptible to price gouging contracts. According to the Pentagon's inspector general, the Government Accountability Office has included the Defense Department's contract management in its \"High\u2011Risk List\" of programs vulnerable to waste and fraud since 1992.",
      "A spokesperson for the federal government's Defense Logistics Agency told CBS news on Tuesday that in early 2022, it had \"requested voluntary refunds from TransDigm for the $20.8M identified in the 2021 report.\"",
      "\"To date, DLA has not received a refund and TransDigm has not indicated their intent to pay,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Before the 2024 general elections, Stein donated to help Mr. Trump's presidential run, as well as to political efforts for Republicans and Democrats. On occasion, that resulted in his giving to a Democratic incumbent \u2014 and the Republican challenger \u2014 as he did in a recent Senate race in Pennsylvania that ended with then Democratic Sen. Bob Casey narrowly losing to Republican Dave McCormick.",
      "Last year, after having donated to Republicans, Stein also gave money to a few House Democratic candidates including some from frontline seats in the 2024 cycle whose wins went on to play a part in keeping Republicans' majority narrow.",
      "Stein has also helped fund a political operation that received donations from TransDigm leaders. Records show from late 2019 until the end of last year, the group called TransDigm Group Inc. Employee Political Action Committee gave money to dozens of Democrats and Republicans, including candidates from both major parties who now hold roles on the House oversight panel that in the past has questioned the company, as well as politicians who are part of Democratic leadership.",
      "After starting at TransDigm in 2014, Stein rose through the ranks over time, according to an online biography. Earlier this year, the company announced that he would retire as CEO at the end of September. Republican Ohio Rep. Max Miller, whose campaign counts Stein as a donor, called him \"a great guy.\"",
      "\"In terms of my dealings with him, he's been very straight and narrow,\" Miller said. \"I've had dealings with other people who are not straight and narrow that I will not take money from and tell them, 'bye and there's the door.' And believe it or not, members of Congress do that more frequently than people would think.\"",
      "A clear focus of Stein's political donations in the early part of this year has been House Republicans. Through a joint fundraising group tied to Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, the third highest-ranking Republican in the House, money from Stein has also gone towards a set of Republican campaigns that could be critical in deciding which party holds control of the House for the final two years of Mr. Trump's time in the White House.",
      "Republicans losing just three seats in the House could be the difference between the GOP having unified control of Washington for the final two years of Trump's presidency or the party's power and influence being limited before he leaves office.",
      "Outside of the House chamber last week, New York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler maintained that congressional Republicans and the Trump administration are looking to root out waste in government. He pushed back however on any concerns about the CEO's political spending after being asked about the dollars that have recently been given to his own campaign and other House Republican political operations.",
      "\"Obviously, in America, people are able to support whoever they want,\" Lawler said. \"We don't live in communist Russia, unless you would like to go down that road.\"",

    "summary": "The Senate panel considering Emil Bove's nomination to be a judge has emails regarding allegations he advised DOJ to defy court orders.",
    "story": [
      "A week before an expected committee vote on the controversial nomination of Trump ally Emil Bove for a federal judgeship, CBS News has obtained emails and text messages shared with Congress by a whistleblower who accuses Bove of unethical actions while he was a top Justice Department official this year.",
      "The messages were released Thursday morning by Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats who are trying to defeat Bove's nomination for a judicial appointment to the Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The text and email messages allegedly offer new insight into the administration's response to its mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from Maryland to El Salvador on March 15.",
      "The whistleblower is former Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni, who was fired April 11, after more than 14 years at the agency, when department leadership accused him of presenting an insufficiently vigorous argument on behalf of the Trump administration during Abrego Garcia's court proceedings.",
      "Last month, Reuveni issued a public statement opposing the nomination of Bove, who is one of Mr. Trump's former criminal defense lawyers.",
      "The text and email messages, which were obtained by Democratic leadership on the Senate Judiciary Committee, show Reuveni unsuccessfully pressed his colleagues and other federal agencies for assistance in fulfilling a court order that Abrego Garcia be returned to the U.S. in March. Dozens of the email messages also allegedly reveal attempts by Trump administration officials to label Abrego Garcia a leader of the gang MS-13 \u2014 which Abrego Garcia's lawyers have strongly denied \u2014 and downplay the agency's mistake in removing him to El Salvador.",
      "Some email exchanges in which Reuveni was a recipient during the week of March 27 included questions about the extent of Abrego Garcia's membership or leadership of MS-13 and inquired about whether or how the U.S. could request that El Salvador return Abrego Garcia.",
      "The messages by Reuveni also warn about the legal peril of ignoring court orders. One of the messages in the batch purportedly showed that a homeland security official conflated Abrego Garcia's alleged MS-13 membership with membership in Tren de Aragua, a different gang based in Venezuela.",
      "Some of the text messages from Reuveni included exchanges by Reuveni and a Justice Department colleague in which they refer to alleged instructions from Bove to communicate a \"f*** you\" to the court's order that Abrego Garcia and others be returned from El Salvador to U.S. custody after the March 15 deportation flights.",
      "One such exchange between Trump administration officials, including Justice Department officials, from the night of the March 15 court order to return the deportation flights, includes a reference to the alleged \"f*** you\" guidance.",
      "The messages are emerging two weeks after Reuveni filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that he was \"threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged\" after questioning instructions from Bove and other officials to ignore court orders.",
      "The Justice Department denied the claims at the time. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche called the allegations \"utterly false,\" referred to Reuveni as a \"disgruntled former employee\" and said, \"at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed.\"",
      "Reuveni first drew attention after the Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia to a prison in El Salvador, defying a 2019 court order barring him from being sent to the Central American country.",
      "Weeks after the mid-March deportation, Reuveni conceded to a Maryland federal judge that Abrego Garcia was deported by mistake and \"should not have been removed.\" When the judge pressed for details on why the government couldn't fly Abrego Garcia back, Reuveni said he'd \"asked the government the same question\" and did not receive an answer.",
      "Reuveni was quickly put on leave, with Attorney General Pam Bondi suggesting he failed to \"zealously advocate on behalf of the United States.\" Six days later, Reuveni says he was fired.",
      "Abrego Garcia was eventually returned to the U.S. in June, months after a judge ordered his return. He is now awaiting trial for criminal smuggling charges, and has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said he sought the text messages and emails. Durbin said, \"Senators raised these allegations at Emil Bove's judicial nomination hearing, and he offered only carefully wordsmithed responses. So, I asked for documentation from Mr. Reuveni to further substantiate his claims.\"",
      "\"Text messages, email exchanges, and documents show that the Department of Justice misled a federal court and disregarded a court order. Mr. Bove spearheaded this effort, which demanded attorneys violate their ethical duty of candor to the court,\" Durbin said.",
      "In a statement, Bondi called Reuveni a \"disgruntled employee\" and a \"leaker asserting false claims seeking five minutes of fame, conveniently timed just before a confirmation hearing and a committee vote.\"",
      "\"As Mr. Bove testified and as the Department has made clear, there was no court order to defy, as we successfully argued to the DC Circuit when seeking a stay, when they stayed Judge Boasberg's lawless order. And no one was ever asked to defy a court order,\" the attorney general said. \"This is another instance of misinformation being spread to serve a narrative that does not align with the facts. This 'whistleblower' signed 3 briefs defending DOJ's position in this matter and his subsequent revisionist account arose only after he was fired because he violated his ethical duties to the department.\"",
      "Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said that Bove \"is an incredibly talented legal mind and a staunch defender of the U.S. Constitution who will make an excellent circuit court judge.\"",
      "\"Bove is unquestionably qualified for the role and has a career filled with accolades, both academically and throughout his legal career, that should make him a shoo-in for the Third Circuit,\" Fields said in a statement. \"The President is committed to nominating constitutionalists to the bench who will restore law and order and end the weaponization of the justice system, and Emil Bove fits that mold perfectly.\"",
      "At his Senate confirmation hearing last month, Bove denied Reuveni's accusations of any unethical conduct.",
      "\"I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,\" Bove told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He added, \"I don't think there's any validity to the suggestion that that whistleblower complaint filed yesterday calls into question my qualifications to serve as a circuit judge.\"",
      "The committee is expected to hold a hearing on Bove's confirmation Thursday, according to two congressional sources.",

      "President Trump said Wednesday he would impose a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil next month, one of the steepest rates for any U.S. trading partner, citing the criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called an \"international disgrace.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has sent open letters to about 20 countries this week \u2014 ranging from Japan to Iraq \u2014 telling them to expect higher tariffs starting Aug.\u00a01, after delaying his sweeping tariffs against dozens of nations in April. So far, the 50% tariff on Brazilian imports is the highest rate threatened against any country, and Brazil is the only country to get hit with a tariff this week after being spared by Mr. Trump's April \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
      "Unlike many other countries that have been threatened with tariff hikes, the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, meaning Brazil buys more American goods than the U.S. buys from Brazil. Last year, the U.S. exported about $49 billion worth of goods to Brazil, and Brazil exported just over $42 billion in goods to the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter excoriated the South American country over the prosecution of Bolsonaro, who led the country before current Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The U.S. leader called the prosecution a \"Witch Hunt that should end immediately.\"",
      "Bolsonaro was indicted last year for allegedly attempting a coup to remain in office after Lula defeated him in the 2022 elections. The plan allegedly included dozens of people and involved a plot to poison Lula and shoot a Brazilian Supreme Court justice. Bolsonaro's defense team has vehemently denied the charges. Bolsonaro has also been barred from running for office until 2030, after casting doubt on the country's electronic voting machines.",
      "Mr. Trump has long expressed support for Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist sometimes known as \"Trump of the Tropics.\" He also lashed out at Brazil over the prosecution on Monday, calling it a \"terrible thing\" and an \"attack on a Political Opponent.\"",
      "\"LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump also criticized Brazil in his tariff letter for what he called \"insidious attacks\" on the \"Free Speech Rights of Americans,\" an apparent reference to the Brazilian Supreme Court's scrutiny of Elon Musk-owned X and some other social media platforms. And he alleged Brazil has an \"unfair trade relationship\" with the U.S., citing \"Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers.\"",
      "In the letter, Mr. Trump ordered U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to open an investigation into Brazil over \"attacks on the Digital Trade Activities of American Companies\" and \"other unfair Trading Practices.\"",
      "A report by the U.S. Trade Representative earlier this year said Brazil charged an average tariff of 11.2% on imports as of 2023. The report says Brazil imposes \"relatively high tariffs on imports across a wide range of sectors,\" and \"U.S. exporters face significant uncertainty in the Brazilian market because the government frequently modifies tariff rates.\" It also lists some other trade restrictions, like a tariff on ethanol and import licensing rules.",
      "As with the other countries that have faced tariff threats, Mr. Trump said his administration would \"consider an adjustment\" if Brazil were to change its trade practices.",
      "Lula said in a post on X that Brazil will react to any tariff increases by invoking the country's economic reciprocity law, which allows Brazil to impose import restrictions and other countermeasures in response to unilateral tariffs. He also pointed to the U.S.'s trade surplus with Brazil, said the proceedings against Bolsonaro \"fall exclusively under the jurisdiction of Brazil\u00b4s Judicial Branch\" and wrote that companies \"must comply with Brazilian law in order to operate within our territory.\"",
      "\"Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage,\" Lula wrote in the statement, as translated by Brazil's embassy in D.C.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump threatened an additional 10% tariff on any countries aligned with \"the Anti-American policies of BRICS,\" referring to a group of developing countries and emerging markets that includes Brazil.",
      "Tariffs are a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy. The moves have sparked fears of rising consumer prices and an economic slowdown, but Mr. Trump argues tariffs are necessary to revive U.S. manufacturing and punish what he views as unfair trade practices.",
      "The president imposed steep tariffs on dozens of countries in early April, rattling markets, before quickly delaying most of them for three months while his administration sought to negotiate trade deals. With the three-month extension set to run out this week, the administration began sending letters to various countries informing them of higher tariffs starting in August.",

      "Matt Quinn, Secret Service deputy director, told CBS News that their penalty ranged from 10 to 42 days of leave without pay or benefits. The personnel were placed into restricted duty or roles with less operational responsibility upon their return.",
      "\"We are laser-focused on fixing the root cause of the problem,\" said Quinn, who defended the agency's decision not to dismiss anyone after the security failure on July 13, 2024, in which a gunman opened fire during a campaign rally and a bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear. One person was killed and two others were wounded while the alleged gunman, Thomas Crooks, was killed by a Secret Service sniper.",
      "\"We aren't going to fire our way out of this,\" Quinn said in an interview Wednesday. \"We're going to focus on the root cause and fix the deficiencies that put us in that situation.\"",
      "\"Secret Service is totally accountable for Butler,\" he said. \"Butler was an operational failure and we are focused today on ensuring that it never happens again.\"",
      "Quinn said the personnel were disciplined according to a federally mandated process. Quinn told CBS News the agency has been focused on addressing the root causes of the operational failures that played out in Butler. To do that, the Secret Service introduced a new fleet of military grade drones and mobile command posts that allows agents to communicate over radio directly with local law enforcement \u2013 interoperability that didn't exist last year.",
      "The assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and a second, foiled attempt against Mr. Trump in West Palm Beach, Florida, a few weeks later, spurred the resignation of then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle and triggered several investigations and contentious congressional hearings.",
      "A bruising 180-page report released by a bipartisan House task force in December found that the security lapses that led to the first incident were \"not isolated to the campaign event itself.\"",
      "The lawmakers noted that \"preexisting issues in leadership and training created an environment\" in which the failures could occur, like giving significant responsibilities to Secret Service personnel with little to no experience in advanced planning roles. Lawmakers also noted a lack of coordination and planning between the Secret Service and its law enforcement partners.",
      "\"The events of July 13, 2024, were tragic and preventable, and the litany of related security failures are unacceptable,\" the report said.",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 07:10:17 -0400",
    "summary": "Manufacturers and construction companies \u2014 as well as consumers \u2014 would face higher prices if the U.S. jacks up tariffs on copper, analysts said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's move to impose a 50% tariff on U.S. copper imports targets a vital metal that is widely used in many products and industries. That could lead to higher prices for everything from appliances and electronics to cars and home repairs, economists and industry experts said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the copper duties late Wednesday on his Truth Social platform, saying they will take effect Aug 1.",
      "\"Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many,\" he wrote. \"Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense! Why did our foolish (and SLEEPY!) 'Leaders' decimate this important Industry? This 50% TARIFF will reverse the Biden Administration's thoughtless behavior, and stupidity. America will, once again, build a DOMINANT Copper Industry.\"",
      "Price jump",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said copper is an integral component in electrical wiring and plumbing, as well being used as a heat conductor in radiators and household appliances. He worries that a hefty copper tariff will trigger inflation.",
      "Copper prices had already surged 13% on Tuesday, reaching a record high, after Mr. Trump floated the possible tariff.",
      "\"It's bad news all around,\" Young said of Mr. Trump's proposed copper tariff. \"If companies' costs go up they pass them along to consumers, so we'd see higher prices for home repairs and anything that uses copper.\"",
      "Copper tariffs could also make maintaining the nation's electric grid more expensive and drive up household energy costs, Young said. \"It would negatively affect the electricity industry and anybody who uses electricity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that tariffs provide financial incentives to ramp up domestic production, including of critical materials like copper, and help create manufacturing jobs.",
      "\"America cannot be reliant on foreign imports of the copper that's necessary for key military hardware, infrastructure and everyday electronics,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump administration is committed to reshoring manufacturing that's critical [to] our national and economic security with a two-pronged approach of tariffs and a full suite of supply-side reforms like deregulation and the pro-growth tax cuts of The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Ripple effects",
      "The biggest users of copper \u2014 and therefore most exposed to the tariff increase \u2014 include a vast range of industries, covering everything from construction to semiconductors, electric vehicles and renewable energy components such as solar panels, according to industry data.",
      "Daan de Jonge, copper demand and prices lead analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said in a research note that \"a 50% price hike will have inevitable ripple effects on the cost of new infrastructure, the cost of housing the cost of fridges, cars, air conditioning.\"",
      "For consumers, that means the cost of appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners, as well as EVs, would likely rise if this 50% tariff goes into effect, according to analysts.",
      "\"Copper is an important element in development of semiconductors and electric vehicles. And the tariff announcement caused prices to go up quite dramatically, so you can tell it's a pretty big deal,\" Veronique de Rugy, a professor of political economy and senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The reason President Trump picked copper is because it's such a big deal for a lot of important things.\"",
      "Carveouts for key partners?",
      "The U.S. gets roughly two-thirds of its copper imports from Chile and Canada, with additional supply coming from Peru and Mexico.\u00a0 The U.S.'s net copper imports met 53% of U.S. demand for copper last year, according to Morgan Stanley research.",
      "Experts note that Mr. Trump isn't certain to hike duties on copper, saying his proposal could be aimed more at securing concession from exporters.",
      "\"These are two examples of countries that the U.S. could offer some sort of quota or export restraint relief to as part of a broader deal,\" UBS chief investment strategist Kurt Reiman told CBS MoneyWatch, referring to Canada and Chile. A revamped U.S. trade policy could also include carveouts for foreign copper suppliers, he added",
      "Although the U.S. could ramp up domestic copper production, it would take years to significantly increase output, Reiman said. \"We aren't ready. The mines would have to be built out, and that's typically a multi-year process.\"",
      "The sectoral tariff threats come after Mr. Trump this week announced stiff new tariff rates on 20 nations\u00a0that have not yet reached trade agreements with the U.S and that he said would take effect on Aug. 1. He outlined the new rates, posted in nearly identical letters on Truth Social, as a 90-day pause on so-called \"reciprocal\" levies was\u00a0set to expire\u00a0on Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Ken Burns said it's \"shortsighted\" to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as public media has become a target of the White House in recent months.",
      "\"This seems foolhardy and seems misguided, mainly because there is a perception among a handful of people that this is somehow a blue or a left-wing thing,\" Burns said of cutting funds to PBS in an interview that aired Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump signed an executive order in May instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to public media, to cease federal funding for PBS and NPR. Then in June, the House approved a request from the White House to claw back $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The package is expected to be taken up by the Senate in the coming weeks as the White House has targeted the public media entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "Burns, whose upcoming film \"The American Revolution\" is expected to air on PBS in November and has had more than 40 documentaries on the public broadcaster, told \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson that he's worried about PBS' future, noting that he's \"always been worried about it.\"",
      "The filmmaker recalled testifying before congressional committees in the 1990s about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He likened PBS to the \"Declaration of Independence applied to the communications world,\" saying it's \"bottom up.\"",
      "The funding cuts are \"shortsighted,\" Burns said, because \"it mainly serves rural areas in which the PBS signal may be the only signal they get.\"",
      "Burns stressed that PBS has children's programming, continuing education, information on homeland security, crop reports and weather emergencies, saying, \"that, we're going to take away?\"",
      "\"I just think that maybe we're throwing the baby out with the bath water,\" Burns said.",
      "The filmmaker also noted that his films wouldn't be possible without PBS, saying he wouldn't be afforded the time it takes to produce his films elsewhere.",
      "\"I couldn't do any of the films I've done without them being on PBS,\" Burns said, noting that streaming services or cable \"wouldn't give me 10 years.\"",
      "Of his work, Burns said many of the projects have \"taken time to incubate, and that has been under the system that has one foot tentatively in the marketplace and the other proudly out, kind of like the National Parks or the Declaration of Independence applied to the landscape.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 15:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers were able to date the fossil of the flying reptile, a close cousin of dinosaurs, back to more than 209 million years ago.",
    "story": [
      "For paleontologist Ben Kligman, the question was: Is this fragile jawbone a pterosaur or not?",
      "Other researchers also had questions about the fossil, unearthed along with thousands of others during a decades-long archaeological dig at a remote bone bed in the Petrified Forest National Park\u00a0in Arizona. Some thought the bone could've been a mammal, Kligman told CBS News.",
      "Now, their new research offers insight into North America's oldest known flying reptile that Kligman and other paleontologists say was the size of a \"small seagull.\"",
      "The Smithsonian-led paper,\u00a0published Monday\u00a0in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, details the new pterosaur fossil discovery along with several others, providing insight into the late Triassic period.",
      "Kligman remembers looking at the jawbone under a microscope at the Smithsonian \u2014 where he is a Peter Buck postdoctoral fellow and where the fossil had been sent \u2014 and running through his \"Rolodex\" of Triassic jaw anatomy, thinking about what species could have a similar jaw. He wanted to solve the mystery of where the delicate jawbone belonged.",
      "Through the process of elimination, and thinking of the features pterosaurs have that no other animal has, Kligman said he and other researchers were able to conclude that, \"Oh yeah, this is definitely a pterosaur \u2014 therefore, this is a very important discovery.\"",
      "The team named the pterosaur the Eotephradactylus mcintireae, which means \"ash-winged dawn goddess.\" The species name references its discoverer, Suzanne McIntire, who volunteered in the Smithsonian's FossiLab for 18 years.",
      "McIntire discovered the pterosaur fossil, which had been brought to the museum from the Petrified Forest National Park along with 1,200 other individual fossils, including bones, teeth, fish scales and coprolites, or fossilized excrement.",
      "Volunteers painstakingly clean each fossil, flag ones of interest and perform other fossil conservation tasks. McIntire unearthed the jawbone and noticed the teeth were still in the bone, making it easier to identify.",
      "The winged reptile \u2014 a close cousin of dinosaurs and the first animals after insects to evolve powered flight \u2014 would've been small enough to comfortably perch on a person's shoulder.",
      "\"It could've sat on your shoulder, like a small seagull,\" Kligman said of the species.",
      "Researchers were able to date the fossil back to 209.2 million years ago \u2014 an unusually precise date, Kligman said, because of the level of volcanic ash where the fossil was found. The finding helps fill in a gap in the fossil record that predates the end-Triassic extinction, he said. Very few pterosaur fossils exist, Kligman said. After their extinction, their fragile bones preserved poorly, so pterosaur fossils are frequently incomplete. They also did not live close to places where fossils tend to form.",
      "\"It helps us understand what a pterosaur was and how they became what they would become,\" Kligman said.",
      "Along with the pterosaur, the study also detailed other findings, including one of the world's oldest turtle fossils, giant amphibians and armored crocodile relatives, which lived alongside evolutionary upstarts like frogs, turtles and pterosaurs.",

Pieces of Mars found on Earth are rare. According to the auction house, just 400 of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth \u2014 or about 0.6% \u2014 are from Mars. The meteorite represents approximately 6.5% of all Martian material currently known on Earth.",

    "story": [
      "Meta\u00a0has removed paid advertisements for channels on the\u00a0Telegram\u00a0messaging app that promoted escort and sex work services in the U.S. and other countries from its Instagram platform.",
      "CBS News found multiple paid advertisements on Meta's Instagram stories feature that promoted opportunities to meet women alongside URL links that led to the Telegram platform. Several such ads were promoted by an Instagram account with over 100,000 followers called Royal Garden Club that marketed itself as a \"premium dating agency for wealthy men\" alongside a link to both a website and a Telegram channel.",
      "Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News the company had removed the accounts associated with the advertisements and disabled the ad accounts for violating Meta's content moderation policies.",
      "Meta also confirmed to CBS News that it had banned the administrators of the ad accounts from advertising on the company's social media platforms.",
      "Logan pointed to the company's human exploitation policy, which includes removing \"content where a third-party actor recruits for, facilitates or benefits from commercial sexual activity,\" as well as the company's adult sexual solicitation policy which, amongst other things, removes \"content that offers, asks or provides methods of contact for prostitution.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club's Telegram channel explicitly offered potential clients access to \"over 7,000 girls worldwide for fun dates, relationships and hot sex.\" That included advertising a \"VIP lifetime\" offer of $8,000 of \"top models, bloggers, actresses, athletes, magazine cover girls, adult stars.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club claimed on its Telegram that it is a \"full-service escort agency operating legally,\" pointing to the fact that the business, R GARDEN LLP, is registered in the United Kingdom. A CBS News review of public business records in the U.K. found the company R GARDEN LLP registered to a London address.",
      "Reached on Telegram, an anonymous moderator for the Royal Garden Club channel declined to comment when asked how it was able to promote ads on Instagram, and what type of service the company offers.",
      "Another paid Instagram ad was promoted by an account called men.s_dreams, which appeared to be a shell account with very little content and very few followers. That advertisement promoted \"meeting beautiful girls\" and included a link to a Telegram channel. The Telegram channel in question, called \"Meeting with Girls,\" had messages written in both Russian and English promoting \"girls ready to fly with you anywhere in the world.\"",
      "That channel posted profile pictures of hundreds of women and noted their nationalities. CBS News could not independently verify the identity of the women, nor verify if they had consented to their images being shared by the channel. The anonymous moderator of the account repeatedly posted messages on the public channel asking prospective clients to send private messages if they wanted to \"know something about girls, sex or anything.\"",
      "CBS News has also sought comment from this account about how it was able to pay for ads on Instagram.",
      "While Meta has strict content moderation policies, Telegram is known for its hands-off approach. The platform's content moderation policies outlined on its website do not include anything beyond banning \"illegal pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels,\" or engaging in \"activities that are recognized as illegal in the majority of countries.\" CBS News has sought comment from Telegram as to whether the channels in question violate the platform's policies or will cause Telegram to review its policies.",
      "In recent months, Meta has struggled to combat a rise in sexualized paid advertisements appearing for some users, despite such ads violating its terms of use. A CBS News investigation last month\u00a0uncovered hundreds of ads\u00a0on its platforms promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfake images of real people.",
      "Many of these ads targeted male users between the ages of 18 and 65, in the United States and the European Union.",
      "Later in June, Meta sued one of the most prominent nudify app makers, filing a lawsuit in Hong Kong against Joy Timeline HK Limited, the entity behind the app \"CrushAI,\" to prevent it from advertising the app on Meta platforms.",

      "Musk has not offered any details on exactly what steps he's taken toward the creation of a new political party, a complicated process which would require compliance with the diverse laws in each state as well as federal rules.",
      "Still, Musk's talk of an America Party could reignite investor worries over the fate of the Tesla brand, which was badly damaged after Musk took on a central role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk in late May announced he would step back from the Trump administration. Now, after a public falling out with Mr. Trump over the budget bill, it seems Musk is injecting himself back into the Washington political scene.",

    "summary": "Canada \u2014 one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners \u2014 will face 35% tariffs, President Trump said Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose 35% tariffs on goods from Canada starting next month, hiking import duties on one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners.",
      "The president announced the 35% tax in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney posted to Truth Social, citing Canada's alleged \"failure to stop the drugs from pouring into our country,\" as well as retaliatory tariffs Canada has imposed on U.S. goods. The new tariffs are set to take effect Aug. 1, the president said.",
      "The move is an escalation from the 25% tariffs on Canadian \u2014 and Mexican \u2014 imports announced by Mr. Trump shortly after taking office. He later exempted goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which was negotiated during Mr. Trump's first term. It's unclear whether the same exemption will apply to next month's 35% tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent similar letters to the leaders of more than 20 other countries this week, telling them to expect higher tariffs starting next month. He told NBC News' Kristen Welker on Thursday, \"all of the remaining countries\" will likely face tariffs of 15% to 20% \u2014 higher than the baseline 10% rate that's currently applied to all countries.",
      "But Canada is the largest American trading partner to receive a letter so far. Canada was the world's largest buyer of American goods and the third-largest seller of goods to the U.S. last year, according to Census Bureau data. The country bought some $350 billion worth of American goods and sold $412 billion to the U.S. market in 2024.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter to Carney says he will \"consider an adjustment to this letter\" if \"Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl.\" For months, the president has cast tariffs against Canada and Mexico as a way of getting the U.S.'s two neighbors to stem illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking, though very little fentanyl appears to enter the U.S. via Canada. Just 43 pounds were seized at the Canadian border last year, compared to 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "\"Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses,\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote in a social media post late Thursday night. \"We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1. Canada has made vital progress to stop the scourge of fentanyl in North America. We are committed to continuing to work with the United States to save lives and protect communities in both our countries.\"",
      "The president also assailed Canada for \"retaliat[ing] with its own Tariffs.\" And he said Canada has imposed other barriers on U.S. imports.",
      "Mr. Trump has held on-and-off discussions with Canada for months, but his relationship with the United States' northern neighbor has occasionally been rocky, with U.S. tariffs drawing retaliatory duties from Canada. The president\u00a0briefly called off all trade talks\u00a0with Canada last month due to a planned digital services tax that could hit U.S. tech companies, but the talks\u00a0resumed days later\u00a0after Carney rescinded the tax.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0repeatedly mused about annexing Canada, and Carney's party won this year's parliamentary elections after the prime minister ran on a platform\u00a0of defending Canada from the Trump administration's ambitions.",
      "Trump boosts tariffs on dozens of countries",
      "The president is sending out this week's spate of tariff letters about three months after first unveiling \"reciprocal tariffs\" against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, along with a 10% tariff on everybody else. The move unnerved financial markets and sparked recession and inflation fears, and Mr. Trump quickly suspended most of the duties for 90 days \u2014 aside from the 10% baseline rate \u2014 saying he planned to negotiate trade deals.",
      "With that 90-day pause set to expire this week, Mr. Trump began sending out letters to dozens of trading partners from Japan to South Africa informing them of their planned tariffs. The U.S. has trade deficits with most countries that received Mr. Trump's letters, though Brazil was also threatened with a 50% tariff despite the U.S. running a trade surplus. The letter cited the prosecution of right-wing former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called a \"Witch Hunt.\"",
      "On top of country-specific tariffs, the president has also imposed hefty \"sectoral\" tariffs on foreign steel, copper and other specific categories of goods.",
      "Mr. Trump says the tariffs are necessary to revive American manufacturing and correct trade imbalances. But many economists warn that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said concerns about tariffs are partly to blame for the central bank's decision not to cut interest rates so far this year.",
      "Still, the president has stood by his trade strategy.",
      "\"I think the tariffs have been very well-received,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Thursday. \"The stock market hit a new high today.\"",

      "The State Department will begin layoffs as early as Friday as it seeks to cut the size of its U.S. workforce by about 15%, CBS News has learned \u2014 part of the Trump administration's sweeping plan to reorganize the department.",
      "The cuts will include layoffs, or reductions-in-force (RIF), as well as voluntary departures by State Department staffers who took part in the Trump administration's buyout programs, two senior State Department officials said Thursday. The department is also closing or merging scores of U.S.-based offices and rearranging its organizational chart shortly after.",
      "The total number of layoffs expected in the coming days will be \"pretty close\" to the roughly 1,800 that were listed in a plan submitted to Congress earlier this year, one senior department official said.",
      "Cuts to staff stationed overseas are not planned at this time, according to the official.",
      "A draft reduction-in-force notice obtained by CBS News said the goal is \"streamlining domestic operations to focus on diplomatic priorities.\" It added the cuts \"have been carefully tailored to affect non-core functions.\"",
      "Critics argue the cuts could undermine the State Department's work.",
      "The long-planned cuts are taking place days after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration's sweeping plans to slash the size of the government workforce, pausing a lower court order that halted layoff plans at dozens of federal agencies.",
      "Department staff were informed of the impending reduction-in-force plans in a Thursday afternoon message from Deputy Secretary of State Michael Rigas obtained by CBS News, thanking staff who face layoffs \"for their dedication and service to the United States.\"",
      "Some employees were told that due to the anticipated RIF, they would not be permitted to telework on Friday, and should report to work with all department-issued equipment including laptops, telephones, diplomatic passports, travel cards, and any other property owned by the State Department. An email with these instructions told staff that badges would be collected during outprocessing, and to ensure that any personal items be collected before that time.",
      "The department told reporters it plans to conduct the reductions-in-force over the course of a single day.",
      "Trump administration planning sweeping State Department reorganization",
      "After the reduction-in-force notices go out, the agency will move into a \"transition period of several weeks\" to phase in the new organization chart, a senior State Department official told reporters on Thursday.",
      "The official said the changes are aimed at \"streamlining this bloated bureaucracy,\" cutting redundant departments, consolidating functions like human resources and finance, and shifting more focus to foreign embassies and offices assigned to handle specific regions.",
      "For example, the official said, the State Department has multiple offices that oversee sanctions.",
      "\"Now, no one's saying that the people who were working in any of those sanctions offices weren't doing a good job or weren't valuable members of the State Department family, but at the end of the day, we have to do what's right for the mission and what's right for the American people, and that means having one combined sanctions office,\" the official said.",
      "The department's Political Affairs bureau \u2014 which includes the country-specific desks that handle the United States' relations with individual nations and regions \u2014 is \"largely unaffected by the reductions,\" according to the official.",
      "Another senior State Department official told reporters the department \"identified offices where natural efficiencies could be found.\"",
      "\"We took a very deliberate step to reorganize the State Department to be more efficient and more focused,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters during a trip to Malaysia on Thursday.",
      "The State Department formally told Congress about its reorganization plans in May, telling lawmakers it intended to eliminate about 3,400 U.S.-based jobs and close or merge almost half of its domestic offices. At the time, the department said it planned to phase out some offices focused on democracy or human rights that it claimed were \"prone to ideological capture,\" and add new offices focused on \"civil liberties\" and \"free market principles.\"",
      "The plan also integrates the previous functions of the U.S. Agency for International Development into the State Department, after the Trump administration moved to shutter the foreign aid agency. That move has drawn stiff criticism, with Democrats arguing the agency was unlawfully shut down without permission from Congress and humanitarian groups warning the shutdown could endanger public health.",
      "The American Foreign Service Association, which represents members of the Foreign Service, has also previously pushed back on the plans.",
      "\"No one disputes the value of strengthening and rationalizing the State Department to meet today's global challenges. But there is a right way and a wrong way to do it,\" the association said in April. \"The right way does not involve weakening and demoralizing the workforce. Neither does it involve rhetoric that accuses our diplomats of being ineffective, lacking accountability and concern for American interests.\"",
      "The cuts to the State Department have drawn pushback from Democratic lawmakers, who argue the moves could undermine American diplomatic efforts.",
      "Many department staff have expressed alarm at the changes. For foreign service officers, the reductions-in-force are based on whether they worked in an office impacted by the reorganization on May 29, one of the two senior State Department officials told reporters Thursday.",
      "A current State Department employee told CBS News there are people who were in these positions six weeks ago, but have since moved on to new assignments. \"So why would you punish them for previously having held a job that they're no longer in?\" they said. \"It makes absolutely no sense.\"",
      "The second senior State Department official told reporters, \"we've tried to do this in an anonymized functional way,\" with cuts based on department.",

    "story": [
      "Flash floods in Texas killed at least 121 people over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, including girls attending a summer camp, and left others still missing. On Monday, Camp Mystic confirmed at least 27 campers and counselors had died in the flooding.",
      "The devastation along the Guadalupe River, west of Austin and northwest of San Antonio, has drawn a massive search effort as officials face questions over their preparedness and the speed of their initial actions.",
      "Here's what to know about the deadly flooding, the colossal weather system that drove it in and around Kerr County, Texas, and ongoing efforts to identify victims.",
      "Massive rain hit at just the wrong time, in a flood-prone place",
      "The floods grew to their worst at the midpoint of a long holiday weekend when many people were asleep.",
      "The Texas Hill Country in the central part of the state is naturally prone to flash flooding due to the dry dirt-packed areas where the soil lets rain skid along the surface of the landscape instead of soaking it up. An area of cliffs and steep hills called the Balcones Escarpment is also a factor.",
      "\"When warm air from the Gulf rushes up the escarpment, it condenses and can dump a lot of moisture. That water flows down the hills quickly, from many different directions, filling streams and rivers below,\" Hatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at The University of Texas at San Antonio, wrote in an article in The Conversation.",
      "In addition to the geography, multiple weather factors contributed to Friday's heavy rainfall, meteorologists say.",
      "\"First and foremost, you had Barry,\" a tropical system that had made landfall in eastern Mexico early last week and was weakening, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Kate Bilo said Monday.",
      "Moisture from that system was lifted northward \"right on up into Texas,\" Bilo said. There were also other weather systems \u2014 a low-level jet stream and an upper-level disturbance \u2014 adding more moisture.",
      "\"Nothing was really moving so you just had all of this rain coming down over the same areas and heavy, heavy rainfall rates because of all of that deep, deep moisture in the atmosphere,\" Bilo explained.",
      "After a flood watch notice midday Thursday, the National Weather Service office issued an urgent warning around 4 a.m. that raised the potential of catastrophic damage and a severe threat to human life. By at least 5:20 a.m., some in the Kerrville City area said water levels were getting alarmingly high. The massive rain flowing down hills sent rushing water into the Guadalupe River, causing it to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes.",
      "Death toll is expected to rise as dozens remain missing",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott said there were dozens of people unaccounted for across the state and more could be missing.",
      "In Kerr County, home to youth camps in the Texas Hill Country, at least 96 people, including more than 30 children, have died, officials said Thursday.",
      "There were 161 people known to be missing in Kerr County as of Tuesday, Abbott said, and at least 12 people were missing in other parts of the state. The missing included five girls and a counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the river, as of Tuesday, Abbott said during a news conference. One child not associated with the camp is also missing, Abbott said.",
      "The campers who died include 8-year-old Linnie McCown of Austin, 8-year-old Eloise Peck of Dallas and 9-year-old Lila Bonner of Dallas, their families said. Chloe Childress, an 18-year-old counselor from the Houston area, also died in the floods, according to the Kinkaid School, where she had recently graduated.",
      "Camp Mystic's owner and director, Dick Eastland, died while trying to save girls at the camp, according to local media reports. The obituary section of the Kerrville community news site was dotted with tributes to victims, including Eastland.",
      "Officials face scrutiny over flash flood warnings",
      "Survivors have described the floods as a \"pitch black wall of death\" and said they received no emergency warnings.",
      "Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, who lives along the Guadalupe River, said Saturday that \"nobody saw this coming.\" Various officials have referred to it as a \"100-year flood,\" meaning the water levels were highly unlikely based on the historical record.",
      "And records behind those statistics don't always account for human-caused climate change. Though it's hard to connect specific storms to a warming planet so soon after they occur, meteorologists say a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and allow severe storms to dump even more rain.",
      "Additionally, officials have come under scrutiny about why residents and youth summer camps along the river were not alerted sooner than 4 a.m. or told to evacuate.",
      "Officials noted that the public can grow weary from too many flooding alerts or forecasts that turn out to be minor.",
      "Kelly said authorities were shocked by the ferocity of the floods. \"We had no reason to believe that this was gonna be any, anything like what's happened here. None whatsoever,\" Kelly told \"CBS Evening News.\"",
      "Kerr County officials said they had presented a proposal for a more robust flood warning system, similar to a tornado warning system, but that members of the public reeled at the cost. Tom Moser, a former Kerr County commissioner, told CBS News the county had previously applied for a grant to build the system, but it wasn't approved, leading to concerns about the local budget if the county were to try to fund the system alone. He also noted there was local resistance over the possibility that the sirens could inadvertently be triggered, causing unwanted noise in the community.",
      "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told CBS News on Monday that the state could possibly step in to fund the system.",
      "\"If they can't afford to do it, then let us do it,\" he said, adding: \"We have a special session starting two weeks from today, and I think we can take that up and do some other things of funding these sirens.\"",
      "On Sunday, officials walked out of a news briefing after reporters asked them again about delays in alerts and evacuations.",
      "Search for victims and monumental cleanup",
      "Crews are searching urgently for the missing. Volunteers, search dogs and drones have joined the effort, with some rescuers maneuvering through challenging terrain filled with snakes.",
      "U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the U.S. Coast Guard was responsible for saving more than 200 people, as dramatic\u00a0video\u00a0showed Guard members conducting aerial rescues near Kerrville while dark water covered the ground.",
      "The flash floods have erased campgrounds and torn homes from their foundations.",
      "\"It's going to be a long time before we're ever able to clean it up, much less rebuild it,\" Kelly said Saturday after surveying the destruction from a helicopter.",
      "Other massive flooding events have driven residents and business owners to give up, including in areas struck last year by Hurricane Helene.",
      "President Trump signed a major disaster declaration Sunday for Kerr County and said he would likely visit Friday: \"I would have done it today, but we'd just be in their way.\"",
      "\"It's a horrible thing that took place, absolutely horrible,\" he told reporters.",
      "At the Vatican, Pope Leo extended a prayer to the flooding victims during Sunday Mass, saying: \"I express my sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters who were at summer camp, in the disaster caused by the flooding of the Guadalupe river in Texas in the United States.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 20:09:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A top White House budget official said President Trump is \"troubled\" by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's management, as Mr. Trump pressures him over interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "A top Trump administration official accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law\" on Thursday, a new broadside against the central bank chief as President Trump tangles with him over interest rates.",
      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a letter Thursday.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its years-long office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Federal Reserve for comment.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",
      "The Fed has previously acknowledged in budget reports that the price tag for its office renovations had jumped due to \"significant increases in raw materials costs.\"",
      "Last week, Bill Pulte, the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, also accused Powell of \"deceptive\" testimony to the Senate about the office project.",
      "Asked about the allegation in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump said: \"Then he should resign immediately. We should get somebody in it that's going to lower interest rates.\"",

And the most terrifying fact is, their road map is very long,\" Hartman also wrote.",
      "She told CBS News she had been fired without due process and said she's considering a legal challenge over her termination.",
      "Hartman said the administration has \"just thrown all of the rules out the window, like we are falling into a crevasse or an abyss, and I really, truly hope that the country can pull out of it.\"",
      "One of Hartman's colleagues, who asked for anonymity to avoid incurring retaliation for speaking publicly, told CBS News, \"Patty's firing really pisses me off. It's so unconscionably petty and vindictive. Who is the constituency for firing Patty?

      "At least 121 people have been confirmed dead, according to local law enforcement and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. Ongoing search operations were underway to find anyone lost in the debris after the catastrophic weekend storm, which caused the Guadalupe River to swell rapidly to near-unprecedented levels.",
      "There are 161 people known to be missing in Kerr County alone, officials said. The county, located in the flood-prone Texas Hill Country west of Austin, the state capital, bore the brunt of the disaster. At least 10 more people are missing in other parts of the state.",
      "President Trump signed a federal disaster declaration at Abbott's request, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deploy its own teams to support local rescue and recovery efforts as those operations press on.

      "Friday was the last time a missing person was found alive in Kerr County, according to authorities. But search crews continued to survey miles of the Guadalupe River\u00a0in the hope of locating others who may have been lost in the floods that inundated Kerr County, Baker told reporters.",
      "The river runs for approximately 230 miles through a region that sits between Austin and San Antonio, starting in Kerr County and ending along the Gulf Coast. It's nicknamed \"flash flood alley\" because the terrain makes it vulnerable to inundation.",
      "Officials in five other Texas counties have also confirmed deaths in the flooding: Travis County, which includes Austin, as well as Burnet, Kendall, Williamson and Tom Green County.",

      "Camp Mystic was \"horrendously ravaged,\" Abbott later wrote in a social media post after visiting the site. About 650 people were staying there, including around 550 children, according to inspection records released by the Texas Department of State Health Services, which were dated July 2 \u2014 just two days before the flood.",
      "According to the records, Camp Mystic had \"a written plan of procedures to be implemented in case of a disaster,\" which was \"posted in the camp's administrative on-site office.\" But exactly what the plan contained isn't clear. Unlike at least one other camp along the Guadalupe River whose employees spoke to The Associated Press, Camp Mystic did not evacuate to higher ground ahead of the floods.",
      "Kerr County officials said Wednesday that evacuating from Hill Country is not always the best course of action during a storm, echoing an earlier statement released by a joint information center established in the wake of the floods, which said that disaster responses in the Hill Country terrain are complex.",
      "Rural areas, like Hunt, are full of single-lane bridges known as \"low water crossings\" that easily flood and create scattered \"islands\" of land that are impassable, said Johnathan Lam of the police department in Kerrville, a city in Kerr County. Those same locations have inconsistent cell service and are hard to reach for first responders.",
      "\"In Hunt, Highway 39 crisscrosses the Guadalupe again and again and again,\" Lam said. \"And all of those low water crossings, when they flood, they create islands where you can't get in and you can't get out, trapping people in their homes, trapping people in their vehicles. And that's what happened on the morning of July 4.\"",
      "A makeshift crew consisting of two Kerville officers, an emergency room doctor and some volunteer firefighters did what they could to fulfill the duties of a robust response team for 13 hours on Friday, until emergency workers in high-profile vehicles were able to reach them at around 5 p.m., Lam said Wednesday.",
      "Scrutiny over weather forecasts",
      "Whether communities in the path of the flooding received adequate warnings has been heavily scrutinized and is the subject of ongoing debate. Kerr County officials have largely declined to respond to reporters' inquiries on the matter during their daily news conferences.",
      "Some have questioned if the Trump administration's cuts earlier this year to the National Weather Service\u00a0and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, potentially prevented local forecast offices from sufficiently preparing the public for the extent of the flooding.",
      "Mr. Trump and his team have repeatedly rejected any suggestions that federal firings impacted forecasting or emergency preparedness ahead of the floods.",
      "A\u00a0CBS News analysis found that 22 warnings from the National Weather Service were issued for Kerr County around the storms and flash flooding, which used escalating language as time went on. But some local residents said they did not receive emergency alerts on their phones nor did they understand how serious the situation had truly become until it actually happened.",
      "The San Antonio and San Angelo weather service offices issued warnings for the areas affected by flooding. Officials with the union representing National Weather Service workers told CBS News there are 23 meteorologists staffed between those offices, which together have 10 vacant positions.",
      "In San Antonio, the office is missing a warning coordination meteorologist, a vital role that essentially liaises between forecasters and emergency management agencies in the region to plan how information about an extreme weather event will be disseminated to the public, and which steps to take to protect them.",
      "Nim Kidd, the chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said his office received a forecast Wednesday that predicted several inches of rain, but \"the amount of rain that fell at this specific location was never in any of those forecasts.\"",
      "Dalton Rice, the city manager for Kerrville, in Kerr County, said during the same briefing that the storm \"dumped more rain than what was forecasted.\"",
      "Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said at a news conference July 4 that the county does \"not have a warning system\" in place to alert the public about weather emergencies. County officials had previously\u00a0discussed a public alarm system but did not proceed with it because of the cost.

      "Jackson has emerged as the court's fiercest critic of the Trump administration \u2014 and of some of her fellow justices.",
      "Her comments came on the heels of remarks this past weekend at an event in Louisiana, where she explained why she writes so many dissents and speaks the most of any justice at oral arguments, even as the court's most junior member.",
      "\"I just feel that I have a wonderful opportunity to tell people in my opinions how I feel about the issues, and that's what I try to do,\" Jackson said Saturday at the Essence Festival of Culture in New Orleans.",
      "Her dissent in the nationwide injunction case, which reined in federal judges' ability to issue sweeping orders and stemmed from Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, prompted an unusually sharp reply from Justice Amy Coney Barrett, which the five other conservatives joined.",
      "Jackson wrote that the majority's decision \"to permit the executive to violate the Constitution with respect to anyone who has not yet sued is an existential threat to the rule of law.\"",
      "Barrett said Jackson's dissent \"chooses a startling line of attack\" that is \"at odds with more than two centuries' worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself.\"",
      "\"Justice Jackson decries an imperial Executive while embracing an imperial Judiciary,\" Barrett wrote.",
      "And on Tuesday, when the court said the administration could move forward with plans, for now, to cut the federal workforce, Jackson stood alone, calling the order \"not only truly unfortunate, but also hubristic and senseless.\"",
      "\"For some reason, this court sees fit to step in now and release the president's wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation,\" she wrote in a dissent that saw her at odds with all eight of her colleagues.",
      "In Indianapolis, she said she was unfazed by the criticism she's received for her dissents, saying she had a \"very thick skin.\"",
      "Before Mr. Trump won reelection, Jackson said she was \"concerned\" about the court's landmark decision that granted him immunity from prosecution for official acts he took while in office. She suggested that the ruling gives Mr. Trump special treatment compared to anyone else in the criminal justice system.",
      "\"I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,\" she said.",

    "summary": "ICE official Thomas Giles was asked in federal court Thursday about where Kilmar Abrego Garcia would be sent if released from pretrial detention.",
    "story": [
      "An Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said that if Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, were to be released from pretrial detention, ICE officials have not determined where he would be sent.",
      "\"There's been no decision made, as he is not in ICE custody,\" Thomas Giles, assistant director for ICE enforcement and removal operations, testified Thursday in federal court in Maryland. Giles was in court after U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis earlier this week ordered the government to produce someone with firsthand knowledge of any third country Abrego Garcia where he could be deported if he were released from custody.",
      "Giles said ICE would take custody of Abrego Garcia \"as soon as possible\" and the transfer would take place in Tennessee, where he's being detained. He said that the Salvadoran native's detention location would be \"based on bed space availability,\" and added that ICE lacks the resources to work on the case until he is in its custody.",
      "At that point, a decision about Abrego Garcia's removal would be made within \"a few days to a few weeks.\" Abrego Garcia would \"receive a notice of removal\u2026and will get a fear interview if he claims fear of return,\" if he has a fear \"of being returned to a third country,\" Giles said.",
      "If Abrego Garcia were to receive a notice of removal, up until his deportation, he would be able to express fear about going to a third country, a period of time that could range from \"a day to a week,\" Giles said.",
      "A magistrate judge ruled last month that Abrego Garcia should be released before his trial on human trafficking charges, but in a hearing on June 26, Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn said that if the Salvadoran man were to be released, ICE would begin removal proceedings to a \"third country,\" instead of his native El Salvador.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers and the Justice Department ultimately agreed that he would remain in the custody of U.S. Marshals at least until a hearing next week, on July 16, and a ruling on the government's bid to revoke his release order.",
      "At the end of the day, Xinis said she was not willing to allow for an \"unfettered release\" of Abrego Garcia into ICE custody so he can be \"spirited away\" and removed from the U.S. before she rules. The hearing will continue Friday.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney, Sascha Rand, at some points sought to cast doubt on the reliability of Giles' testimony, eliciting from him that he had no involvement in Abrego Garcia's case until this week. He said his prior knowledge of the case was based on media reports, until ICE issued an immigration detainer in June to local officials in Tennessee, after Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. to face criminal charges. The charges stemmed from a traffic stop in 2019.",
      "Under Rand's questioning, Giles also said that he had never been involved in a successful third-country removal and knew of no other deportation officer in a similar capacity who had been involved in one.",
      "Earlier Thursday, the Justice Department said it was willing to agree not to remove Abrego Garcia to a third country without following due process, and that it would not remove him to El Salvador without first reopening his immigration case and terminating the court order that bars his deportation to El Salvador.",
      "But Abrego Garcia's attorneys told U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis that they didn't agree to the government's stipulation because it would not guarantee him advanced notice of his removal or a court hearing in the proper jurisdiction before removal.",
      "On Monday, after denying the government's motions to dismiss Abrego Garcia's lawsuit over his deportation, Xinis asked the government for a witness with \"firsthand knowledge\" about where he would be deported if he were to be released from custody. She also said Abrego Garcia should be given \"a reasonable amount of time\" to challenge his removal.",
      "She expressed some frustration during that hearing with the government's lack of information about Abrego Garcia's short\u2013term fate. \"It's like trying to nail Jello to a wall trying to find out what is going to happen next week,\" Xinis said, adding that it remains within her jurisdiction to ensure that Abrego Garcia is \"not spirited away again\" to another country without due process.",
      "Xinis said Monday the government could \"clarify all of this\" in a \"binding way,\" if it stipulated that he would receive due process \u2014 that he would not be removed without notice and would have the opportunity to be heard before a court.",

    "story": [
      "On a recent afternoon, Mahmoud Khalil sat in his Manhattan apartment, cradling his 10-week-old son as he thought back to the pre-dawn hours spent pacing a frigid immigration jail in Louisiana, awaiting news of the child's birth in New York.",
      "For a moment, the outspoken Palestinian activist found himself uncharacteristically speechless.",
      "\"I cannot describe the pain of that night,\" Khalil said finally, gazing down as the baby, Deen, cooed in his arms. \"This is something I will never forgive.\"",
      "Now, weeks after regaining his freedom, Khalil is seeking restitution. On Thursday, his lawyers filed a claim for $20 million in damages against the Trump administration, alleging Khalil was falsely imprisoned, maliciously prosecuted and smeared as an antisemite as the government sought to deport him over his prominent role in campus protests.",
      "The filing \u2014 a precursor to a lawsuit under the Federal Tort Claims Act \u2014 names the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the State Department.",
      "It comes as the deportation case against Khalil, a 30-year-old recent graduate student at Columbia University, continues to wind its way through the immigration court system.",
      "The goal, Khalil said, is to send a message that he won't be intimidated into silence.",
      "\"They are abusing their power because they think they are untouchable,\" Khalil said. \"Unless they feel there is some sort of accountability, it will continue to go unchecked.\"",
      "Khalil said he plans to share any settlement money with others targeted in President Trump's \"failed\" effort to suppress pro-Palestinian speech. In lieu of a settlement, he would also accept an official apology and changes to the administration's deportation policies.",
      "In an emailed statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, called Khalil's claim \"absurd,\" accusing him of \"hateful behavior and rhetoric\" that threatened Jewish students.",
      "The State Department said its actions toward Khalil were fully supported by the law. Inquiries to the White House and ICE were not immediately returned.",
      "The filing accuses Mr. Trump and other officials of mounting a campaign to \"terrorize him and his family,\" beginning with Khalil's March 8 arrest.",
      "On that night, he said he was returning home from dinner with his wife, Noor Abdalla, when he was \"effectively kidnapped\" by plainclothes federal agents, who refused to provide a warrant and appeared surprised to learn he was a legal U.S. permanent resident.",
      "He was then whisked overnight to an immigration jail in Jena, Louisiana, a remote location that was \"deliberately concealed\" from his family and attorneys, according to the filing.",
      "Inside, Khalil said he was denied his ulcer medication, forced to sleep under harsh fluorescent lights and fed \"nearly inedible\" food, causing him to lose 15 pounds (7 kilograms). \"I cannot remember a night when I didn't go to sleep hungry,\" Khalil recalled.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration publicly celebrated the arrest, promising to deport him and others whose protests against Israel it dubbed \"pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.\"",
      "Khalil, who has condemned antisemitism before and since his arrest, was not accused of a crime and has not been linked to Hamas or any other terror group. \"At some point, it becomes like reality TV,\" Khalil said of the allegations. \"It's very absurd.\"",
      "A few weeks into his incarceration, Khalil said he was awoken by a fellow detainee, who pointed excitedly to his face on a jailhouse TV screen. A new memo signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged Khalil hadn't broken the law, but argued he should be deported for beliefs that could undermine U.S. foreign policy interests.",
      "\"My beliefs are not wanting my tax money or tuition going toward investments in weapons manufacturers for a genocide,\" Khalil said. \"It's as simple as that.\"",
      "By then, Khalil had become something of a celebrity in the 1,200-person lock-up. When not dealing with his own case, he hosted \"office hours\" for fellow immigrant detainees, leaning on his past experience working at a British embassy in Beirut to help others organize paperwork and find translators for their cases.",
      "\"I'm pretty good at bureaucracy,\" Khalil said.",
      "At night, they played Russian and Mexican card games, as Khalil listened to \"one story after another from people who didn't understand what's happening to them.\"",
      "\"This was one of the most heartbreaking moments,\" he said. \"People on the inside don't know if they have any rights.\"",
      "On June 20, after 104 days in custody, Khalil was ordered released by a federal judge, who found the government's efforts to remove him on foreign policy grounds were likely unconstitutional.",
      "He now faces new allegations of misrepresenting personal details on his green card application. In a motion filed late Wednesday, attorneys for Khalil described those charges as baseless and retaliatory, urging a judge to dismiss them.",
      "The weeks since his release, Khalil said, have brought moments of bliss and intense personal anguish.",
      "Fearing harassment or possible arrest, he leaves the house less frequently, avoiding large crowds or late-night walks. But he lit up as he remembered watching Deen taking his first swim earlier in the week. \"It was not very pleasant for him,\" Khalil said, smiling.",
      "\"I'm trying as much as possible to make up for the time with my son and my wife,\" he added. \"As well thinking about my future and trying to comprehend this new reality.\"",
      "Part of that reality, he said, will be continuing his efforts to advocate against Israel's war in Gaza, which has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza. On the day after his release, he led a march through Manhattan, draped in a Palestinian flag \u2014 and flanked by security.",
      "As he poured Deen's milk into a bottle, Khalil considered whether he might've done anything differently had he known the personal cost of his activism.",
      "\"We could've communicated better. We could've built more bridges with more people,\" he said. \"But the core thing of opposing a genocide, I don't think you can do that any differently. This is your moral imperative when you're watching your people be slaughtered by the minute.\"",

    "summary": "Plans to develop a flood monitoring system in the Texas county hit hardest by deadly floods were scheduled to begin only a few weeks later.",
    "story": [
      "After years of unsuccessful attempts to finance and build a public alarm network that would warn residents of Kerr County, Texas, about dangerous flooding, officials in the region, nicknamed \"flash flood alley,\" were going to start developing a centralized flood monitoring system this summer to help leaders and emergency managers plan ahead.",
      "On July 4, storms in Central Texas caused the Guadalupe River to overflow, rising as high as 26 feet over about an hour in the very early morning. At least 121 people from several counties have been confirmed dead so far, and even more remain missing six days after the disaster. The majority of those deaths happened in Kerr County, where at least 96 people perished in floodwaters and another 161 are unaccounted for, local authorities said Thursday. In Hunt, a section of the county that faced particularly formidable inundation, at least 27 children and counselors from a girls' summer camp called Camp Mystic are among the dead, the camp announced.",
      "The Upper Guadalupe River Authority, a leadership board that manages the river, had approved funding earlier this year for a dashboard \"to support local flood monitoring and emergency response,\" a spokesperson for the joint information center established in Kerr County since the disaster said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"While real-time streamflow and rainfall data are already available through various sources, this new tool will bring those datasets for Kerr County into one platform to enhance usability for emergency managers,\" the statement said. \"This is not a public alert system, but a decision-support resource intended to complement existing infrastructure.\"",
      "Board meeting minutes for the Upper Guadalupe River Authority stretching back to at least August 2024 reflect those plans. Last year, the river authority requested bids for a \"flood warning\" dashboard that would combine multiple sources of weather and forecasting data into a single tool, intended to assist its own staff, local emergency management coordinators, and leaders as they made decisions regarding potential flooding events. Part of the project also called for recommendations for how to improve monitoring equipment in the county related to flood warnings in the future.",
      "Kisters North America, an environmental technology company, was selected as the contractor for the project in April, when Kerr County also submitted a hazard mitigation plan to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, with one hazard being flooding.",
      "The contract was initiated in June, and preliminary meetings with Kisters to begin developing the flood monitoring dashboard were scheduled for mid-July, \"but in light of recent events the timeline will be reevaluated,\" according to the joint information center in Kerr County.",
      "How weather alerts and forecast warnings contributed to the consequences of last week's floods in Kerr County is unclear, but the death toll has left many questioning whether more could have been done to protect those in the path of the inundation. A\u00a0CBS News analysis\u00a0found that\u00a022 warnings\u00a0from the National Weather Service were issued for Kerr County around the storms and flash flooding. However, some local residents said they either did not receive emergency alerts on their phones or received them late, while others said they did not understand the gravity of the situation until the flooding actually hit.",
      "Judge Rob Kelly, a leading official in Kerr County, said at a news conference Friday that\u00a0his area does not have a warning system established for weather events and suggested\u00a0 that could have played a role in the lack of preparedness. County officials had previously discussed installing a public alarm system but did not proceed because of the cost.",

    "summary": "A federal judge in New Hampshire certified a class action lawsuit over President Trump's birthright citizenship order and issued a preliminary injunction blocking it.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in New Hampshire on Thursday certified a class action lawsuit including all children who will be affected by President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship and issued a preliminary injunction blocking it.",
      "Judge Joseph LaPlante announced his decision after an hour-long hearing and issued a written order soon after. The order includes a seven-day stay to allow for appeal.",
      "The class is slightly narrower than that sought by the plaintiffs, who originally included parents as plaintiffs.",
      "The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a pregnant woman, two parents and their infants. It's among numerous cases challenging Mr. Trump's January order denying citizenship to those born to parents living in the U.S. illegally or temporarily. The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and others.",
      "\"Tens of thousands of babies and their parents may be exposed to the order's myriad harms in just weeks and need an injunction now,\" lawyers for the plaintiffs wrote in court documents filed Tuesday.",
      "The White House criticized the decision, with spokesman Harrison Fields calling it \"an obvious and unlawful attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court's clear order against universal relief.\"",
      "\"This judge's decision disregards the rule of law by abusing class action certification procedures,\" Fields said. \"The Trump Administration will be fighting vigorously against the attempts of these rogue district court judges to impede the policies President Trump was elected to implement.\"",
      "Birthright citizenship",
      "At issue is the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" The Trump administration says the phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means the U.S. can deny citizenship to babies born to women in the country illegally, ending what has been seen as an intrinsic part of U.S. law for more than a century.",
      "\"Prior misimpressions of the citizenship clause have created a perverse incentive for illegal immigration that has negatively impacted this country's sovereignty, national security, and economic stability,\" government lawyers wrote in the New Hampshire case.",
      "LaPlante, who had issued a narrow injunction in a similar case, said while he didn't consider the government's arguments frivolous, he found them unpersuasive. He said his decision to issue an injunction was \"not a close call\" and that deprivation of U.S. citizenship clearly amounted to irreparable harm.",
      "Several federal judges had issued nationwide injunctions stopping Mr. Trump's order from taking effect, but the U.S. Supreme Court limited those injunctions in a June 27 ruling that gave lower courts 30 days to act. With that time frame in mind, opponents of the change quickly returned to court to try to block it. Universal injunctions in class action suits are on stronger legal footing under the Supreme Court's new framework.",
      "In a Washington state case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, the judges have asked the parties to write briefs explaining the effect of the Supreme Court's ruling. Washington and the other states in that lawsuit have asked the appeals court to return the case to the lower court judge.",
      "As in New Hampshire, a plaintiff in Maryland seeks to organize a class action lawsuit that includes every person who would be affected by the order. The judge set a Wednesday deadline for written legal arguments as she considers the request for another nationwide injunction from CASA, a nonprofit immigrant rights organization.",
      "Ama Frimpong, legal director at CASA, said the group has been stressing to its members and clients that it is not time to panic.",
      "\"No one has to move states right this instant,\" she said. \"There's different avenues through which we are all fighting, again, to make sure that this executive order never actually sees the light of day.\"",
      "The New Hampshire plaintiffs, referred to only by pseudonyms, include a woman from Honduras who has a pending asylum application and is due to give birth to her fourth child in October. She told the court the family came to the U.S. after being targeted by gangs.",
      "\"I do not want my child to live in fear and hiding. I do not want my child to be a target for immigration enforcement,\" she wrote. \"I fear our family could be at risk of separation.\"",
      "Another plaintiff, a man from Brazil, has lived with his wife in Florida for five years. Their first child was born in March, and they are in the process of applying for lawful permanent status based on family ties \u2014 his wife's father is a U.S. citizen.",
      "\"My baby has the right to citizenship and a future in the United States,\" he wrote.",

      "Tel Aviv\u00a0\u2014 After five days of negotiations in Qatar and two meetings in Washington between Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump, there was still no ceasefire agreement for Gaza on Thursday, as Netanyahu prepared to leave Washington to fly back home.",
      "At the start of the week, the Trump administration sounded optimistic that a deal could be done as soon as the weekend. On Wednesday evening, however, a senior Israeli official said it could still take 20 more days to reach an agreement.",

      "The charity said in a statement that the missile had struck \"directly in front of Project HOPE's Altayara health clinic, killing 15 civilians, including 10 children and two women, and injuring many more. The strike occurred as patients had gathered outside the clinic, awaiting its opening to receive treatment for malnutrition, infections, chronic illnesses, and more.\"",
      "\"Project HOPE's health clinics are a place of refuge in Gaza where people bring their small children, women access pregnancy and postpartum care, people receive treatment for malnutrition, and more,\" Rabih Torbay, Project HOPE's president and CEO, said in the statement. \"This morning, innocent families were mercilessly attacked as they stood in line waiting for the doors to open.\"",

      "Thousands of excited fans flocked to a Thai zoo on Thursday to celebrate the first birthday of\u00a0Moo Deng, the adorable baby pygmy hippo that has become a\u00a0social media sensation.",
      "The Khao Kheow Open Zoo was overrun with Moo Deng fans on the first of four days of activities marking the hippo's birthday. Children under 12 years old can enter the zoo, about a two-hour drive from the capital Bangkok, for free throughout the extravaganza.",
      "Excited fans",
      "Many of Moo Deng's fans flew miles to see her.",
      "Among them was Molly Swindall, who traveled from New York for the celebrations. She was seen handing a tray of food to a zoo keeper for Moo Deng's breakfast, which the baby hippo and her mother Jona quickly devoured.",
      "\"I just loved her so much and decided, you know what, I have three or four days off of work,\" Swindall said. \"I can make it work to fly to Thailand. I will only be there for about 30 hours, but that's enough to go see Moo Deng. And that's exactly what I did.\"",
      "By Thursday afternoon, the number of visitors reached 12,000, zoo director Narongwit Chodchoy said. Despite the noise of visitors calling out for her attention, Moo Deng appeared peaceful as she took a dip in a pond in her enclosure.",
      "Fans photographed the baby hippo with their cameras or cell phones and sang \"Happy birthday\" as her birthday cake, made of a variety of fruits and vegetables, was placed near the pond.",
      "\"Moo Deng is my happy pill, and she's my energy pill, my curing pill. She's my vitamin!\" said Thea Chavez, who flew in from Houston, Texas.",
      "Another fan, Jennifer Tang from Malaysia, leaned over the enclosure to take pictures.",
      "\"She makes me happy. Whenever I'm stressed at work I pull up photos of Moo Deng,\" Tang said. \"So my whole office knows that I'm here ... They let me take a week off.\"",
      "The zoo held online auctions to celebrate Moo Deng's birthday, with photos, footprints and a food container on offer to raise funds for all the animals under their care.",
      "They also held an auction for the honor of sponsoring her birthday cake, which went for 100,000 baht ($3,065.)",
      "A star baby hippo",
      "Moo Deng soared to stardom shortly after she was born, largely thanks to her keeper, Atthapon Nundee, who shared adorable pictures and videos of the baby hippo on social media. Atthapon keeps Moo Deng's fans updated on fun hippo moments \u2014 how she squirms as he tries to wash her, bites him as he tries to play, or calmly closes her eyes as he rubs her belly.",
      "The name Moo Deng, which literally means \"bouncy pork\" in Thai, was chosen by fans via a poll on social media. It matches the names of her other siblings: Moo Toon (stewed pork) and Moo Waan (sweet pork). There is also another hippo at the zoo named Kha Moo (stewed pork leg).",
      "The zoo \u2014 which sits on 800 hectares (almost 2,000 acres) of land and is home to more than 2,000 animals \u2014 saw spikes of visitors since shortly after Moo Deng was born. But Narongwit said the number of visitors has somewhat dropped since the height of Moo Deng's fame. He said the zoo has had about 2,000 visitors during a weekday and around 5,000 during weekends over the past few months \u2014 about half the numbers it saw at its peak.",
      "\"Moo Deng is a representative of all wild animals, and she helps everyone understand the roles of zoos,\" Narongwit told The Associated Press. \"She speaks for all nearly extinct animals, and turns people's attention to their conservation.\"",
      "What to know about pygmy hippos",
      "The zoo also runs breeding programs for many endangered species, including the pygmy hippopotamus. The species is native to West Africa, where it is threatened by poaching and loss of habitat. There are only 2,000 to 3,000 left in the wild. Pygmy hippos are now found in the wild in only four countries: C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, according to the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance. The species is threatened by logging, farming and increasing human development.",
      "Pygmy hippos are one of just two hippo species, according to the African Wildlife Foundation. The large/common river hippo is the third-largest living land mammal, after elephants and white rhinos. Pygmy hippos can grow to weigh more than 600 pounds, while a river hippo may weigh up to 10 times more than a pygmy hippo, according to the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance.",
      "Besides the size difference, the pygmy hippo is also less aquatic than the common hippo, according to the San Diego Zoo. Their toes are less webbed, and they also have just one pair of incisors, while the common hippo has two or three.",
      "Pygmy hippos are largely nocturnal animals, according to experts. Their average life span ranges from 30 to 50 years."

      "Caracol dates back to 900 B.C., according to the Caracol Archaeological Project, and lasted centuries until the collapse of the Maya civilization in A.D. 800-900. At its peak, the city had a population of over 100,000 people. Today, the city is the largest Mayan archaeological site in Belize, the project said.",
      "Archaeologists have been working at the site for over 40 years. Husband and wife team Arlen and Diane Chase, with the University of Houston, have been conducting excavations there for decades. The pair run the Caracol Archaeological Project. During their most recent expedition, carried out in partnership with Belize's Institute of Archaeology, they found the first identifiable tomb of a ruler of Caracol. The tomb was underneath another burial chamber, which researchers first discovered in 1993.",
      "Te K'ab Chaak was the first ruler of Caracol and the founder of its royal dynasty, the University of Houston said in a news release. He took power in A.D. 331.",
      "The Chases found that he had been interred at the base of a royal family shrine in about A.D. 350. Alongside the ruler were 11 pottery vessels, a jadeite death mask and jewelry, carved bone tubes, and other relics. The death mask was found in dozens of pieces.",
      "Many pieces of pottery were engraved. One showed a scene of a deity receiving offerings. Others showed bound prisoners.",

We've found numerous tombs with really impressive artifacts inside that were clearly members of the royal family, but this is the first one where it matches with hieroglyphic records to be a ruler and beyond that, the first dynastic ruler.\"",
      "This is the third tomb found at Caracol that dates back to around A.D. 350. One tomb, found in 2009, held the remains of a woman, along with jewelry, shells and pottery vessels. Another internment site was a cremation vessel that held the remains of three people, two large knives and several other relics associated with central Mexico. In A.D. 350, the ancient Maya had begun to have contact with the central Mexican city of Teotihuacan. Archaeologists believe that the cremated individuals likely included a Caracol royal family member who had embraced Mexican ritual practices and may have even served as an envoy to Teotihuacan.",
      "For decades, archaeologists have wondered at how Teotihuacan may have influenced Mayan society, Diane Chase said in the news release. The Mexican city had a larger presence in Caracol in A.D. 378, but the three burials were all a generation before that, indicating that early Mayan rulers were \"fully enmeshed in Mesoamerican-wide contacts prior\" to what records previously led researchers to believe.",
      "\"Maya carved stone monuments, hieroglyphic dates, iconography, and archaeological data all suggest that widespread pan-Mesoamerican connections occurred after an event in 378 AD referred to as the 'entrada.' Whether this event represented actual Teotihuacanos in the Maya area or Maya using central Mexican symbols is still debated,\" Diane Chase said in a news release. \"The Caracol archaeological data suggests that the situation was far more complicated.\"",
      "Research on Te K'ab Chaak's tomb will continue. Archaeologists are working to reconstruct the jadeite death mask and perform DNA and isotope analysis on the skeletal material. More information from the excavation will be presented at an academic conference on Maya\u2013Teotihuacan interaction in August, the University of Houston said.",

      "A pause on some U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine has eased and the arms are flowing again, but not fast enough to stop Russia's relentless and deadly aerial assault.",
      "For the second night in a row, Russia launched hundreds of drones and more than a dozen missiles at Ukraine, including a heavy assault on the capital Kyiv, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday. Two people were killed and 13 more were wounded as fires sprung up in at least five districts around the city, according to Zelenskyy, quoting emergency officials.",
      "Residents fled to bomb shelters, as they have done countless times since Russia launched its full-scale invasion more than three years ago, with many taking cover in underground metro stations. A grey haze of smoke hung in the air.",

      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in Rome for a global conference on Ukrainian reconstruction, implored world leaders to give more support. He called for a Marshall Plan for his country, referring to the U.S. government-funded program to rebuild the economies of Western Europe in the wake of World War II.",
      "\"Rebuilding Ukraine is not just about our country. It's also about your countries, your companies, technology, your jobs, the way we rebuild our country can also modernize your infrastructure and industries,\" Zelenskyy told the political and business leaders from across Europe at the Ukraine Recovery Conference.",
      "He also called on Europe to agree to use all of Russia's frozen financial assets, estimated to be worth about $450 billion, to aid in Ukraine's recovery.",
      "\"Not only the income from these assets, but the assets themselves must be used, and much more actively than they are now, to help save lives,\" he said.",
      "The goal of the fourth annual Ukraine Recovery Conference is to raise more than $500 billion in government and private funding for the eventual reconstruction of the country. More than 100 governments are represented at the two-day conference. About 40 international organizations, including the World Bank and various U.N. agencies, and more than 2,000 private companies are also at the summit \u2014 many looking to partner with Ukrainian counterparts on projects to rebuild everything from defense to energy infrastructure over the next decade.",

      "The pontiff reiterated the Vatican's willingness to serve as a mediator in the war sparked by Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, however the Kremlin has previously said it would not be appropriate for the Catholic Church to serve as a mediator between the two Christian Orthodox countries.",
      "Zelenskyy described his meeting with Kellogg as \"substantive,\" adding in a social media post that they had discussed additional U.S. support in the form of more weapons deliveries to Ukraine, and support for harsher sanctions against Russia.",
      "\"We discussed arms supplies and strengthening air defense. Against the backdrop of increased Russian attacks, this is one of the priorities,\" wrote Zelenskyy. \"We also discussed the purchase of American weapons, joint defense production, and localization in Ukraine.\"",
      "A U.S. official confirmed to CBS News on Wednesday that shipments of some munitions, including 155mm artillery rounds and precision guided GMLRS rockets, which had been paused by the Pentagon about a week earlier, had resumed flowing to Ukraine. The resumption comes after President Trump said earlier this week that additional defensive weapons would be sent to Ukraine.",
      "\"We're going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday night. He said the shipments would consist of \"defensive weapons, primarily.\"",
      "Zelenskyy has also pressed U.S. officials to send additional Patriot missile systems, which are used to intercept Russian missiles and fighter jets.",
      "Asked specifically about those weapons \u2014 which were among the items that the Pentagon paused shipments of last week, citing limited U.S. stockpiles \u2014   Mr. Trump said Wednesday that he was considering sending more to Ukraine.",

      "This meeting came after Mr. Trump announced the new weapons shipments to Ukraine, and sharply criticized Putin for talking \"bull***\" about his sincerity for achieving peace in Ukraine.",
      "Rubio said after the meeting that the U.S. and Russia had exchanged new ideas to reach a deal to end the Ukraine war, but he offered no details.",
      "\"I think it's a new and a different approach,\" Rubio told reporters. \"I wouldn't characterize it as something that guarantees a peace, but it's a concept that, you know, that I'll take back to the president.\"",
      "Rubio noted Mr. Trump's growing disappointment \"that there's not been more flexibility on the Russian side,\" adding: \"We need to see a roadmap moving forward about how this conflict can conclude.\"",

Mr. Trump hosted a White House lunch with African leaders and, after brief remarks from Liberian President Joseph Boakai, he asked the business graduate where he had picked up his linguistic acumen.",
      "\"Thank you, and such good English,\" Mr. Trump said, asking: \"Where did you learn to speak so beautifully? Where were you educated?\"",
      "Boakai \u2014 who, like most Liberians, speaks English as a first language \u2014 indicated that he had been educated in his own country.",
      "Mr. Trump, who was surrounded by French-speaking presidents from other West African nations, continued on the theme, telling Boakai: \"It's beautiful English. I have people at this table can't speak nearly as well.\"",
      "The Liberian leader was facing away from the media, making his countenance hard to gauge, but his laconic, mumbled response hinted at awkwardness. On the websites of two of Liberia's most-read daily newspapers, there was little mention of Mr. Trump's remarks about Boakai's English mastery.",
      "The FrontPageAfrica outlet didn't mention the brief exchange, while the Daily Observer said Mr. Trump, \"impressed by Boakai's remarks, jokingly inquired about his eloquent English.\"",

      "Beijing has stepped up espionage warnings in recent years as relations with the United States and other Western nations have worsened. Its Ministry of State Security (MSS) said Thursday that foreign spies \"have been increasingly active in infiltrating and stealing secrets from China\" and were targeting public officials.",
      "\"Individual officials have caused the damaging effects of leaking secrets due to a lack of belief, a weakened sense of discipline and a loosened awareness of rules... harming national security and interests,\" the MSS said.",
      "It described a case in which a provincial government employee surnamed Li fell into a \"meticulously designed honey trap\" while traveling overseas for work.",
      "\"Unable to resist the seductive beauty of the foreign intelligence agent,\" Li was then blackmailed with \"intimate photos\" and forced to hand over official documents once back in China.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Monday his administration will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine amid its war with Russia, days after pausing some weapons shipments.",
      "\"We're going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a White House event with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday night.",
      "The president said the shipments will consist of \"defensive weapons, primarily,\" saying Ukraine is \"getting hit very hard\" and \"so many people are dying in that mess.\"",
      "\"At President Trump's direction, the Department of Defense is sending additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to ensure the Ukrainians can defend themselves while we work to secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement later Monday night. \"Our framework for POTUS to evaluate military shipments across the globe remains in effect and is integral to our America First defense priorities.\"",
      "Matthew Whitaker, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said the president has taken issue with Russia's strikes on Ukrainian cities.",
      "\"It is one thing to attack militaries \u2014 and we have thousands of people every week dying on the battlefield \u2014 but Vladimir Putin is attacking major cities like Odessa and Kyiv, and I think that is crossing the line,\" he told Fox's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \"And I think President Trump has told Vladimir Putin that, you know, attacking citizens is just not something that you can do legitimately.\"",
      "Asked Tuesday about Mr. Trump's announcement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow that \"these actions probably do not align with attempts to promote a peaceful resolution\" to the war in Ukraine, according to Russia's state-run news agencies.",
      "The United States has provided Ukraine with tens of billions of dollars in weapons and other assistance since February 2022, when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of the country, according to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.",
      "Last week, the White House confirmed it had decided to halt some shipments to Ukraine. A White House official said the pause was part of a broader review of weapons transfers to other countries. A U.S. official told CBS News the administration was concerned about military stockpiles falling too low.",
      "But during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he doesn't know who ordered the pause in weapons shipments to Ukraine.",
      "\"Putin is not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people,\" the president told reporters during the meeting. \"So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I've approved that.\"",
      "Multiple sources with knowledge confirmed to CBS News that the State Department was cut out of the decision to pause some weapons shipments to Ukraine. Sources said the freeze was largely presented to Secretary of State Marco Rubio as a review of weapons shipments and not specifically described as a halt of arms to Ukraine. The White House was also told of the broader review for all weapons, which has been publicly discussed by the White House, Pentagon and State Department. One U.S. official told CBS News the Defense Department did not inform the White House of the pause.",
      "In comments to reporters last week, Mr. Trump said his administration\u00a0was still sending weapons to Ukraine, but former President Joe Biden \"emptied out our whole country giving them weapons, and we have to make sure that we have enough for ourselves.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last week. Mr. Trump told reporters he was \"very disappointed\" with the Putin call, saying he \"didn't make any progress\" with the Russian leader.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Monday he's \"not happy with President Putin at all.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Zelenskyy said his call with Mr. Trump was \"very important and fruitful,\" adding the two leaders \"agreed that we will work together to strengthen protection of our skies.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed Russia and Ukraine to strike a deal to end their three-year war.",
      "But his relationship with both leaders has been rocky at times. Mr. Trump \u2014 who has\u00a0expressed skepticism about Ukraine aid \u2014 accused Zelenskyy in April of prolonging the conflict, and the administration briefly paused military aid to Ukraine in March, after a televised Oval Office meeting-turned-argument between the American and Ukrainian leaders.

      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a social media post most of the Russian drones were taken down by Ukrainian interceptor drones, but some of the weapons did get through air defenses. Ukrainian prosecutors were quoted by the French news agency AFP as saying five civilians were killed by drones that slammed into private vehicles in the far eastern town of Rodynske, while three more people were killed about 10 minutes later in Kostiantynivka, around which Russian forces have been closing in.",
      "Officials said two people were also wounded in the Kyiv region during the attack. Zelenskyy said the main target of the Russian attacks, however, was the northwestern city of Lutsk, which sits near the Ukrainian border with Poland and Belarus and is home to airfields used by the Ukrainian army.",
      "Zelenskyy said the attack \"comes precisely at a time when so many efforts have been made to achieve peace, to establish a ceasefire, and yet only Russia continues to rebuff them all.\"",
      "The massive Russian strike came a day after President Trump pledged to send more weapons to Ukraine and directly criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin.",

      "In a statement, Johnson said he and Netanyahu discussed the United States' commitment to Israel's security and a ceasefire agreement in Gaza.",
      "\"America and Israel's strong stand in the 12-Day War dealt a devastating blow to the greatest enemy of peace in the region, leaving the Iranian regime weaker than at any point in decades. We are hopeful that this marks the dawn of a new chapter of peace in the Middle East,\" Johnson said.",
      "Netanyahu's meeting with a bipartisan group of more than a dozen senators was delayed until Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, both attended the meeting.",
      "GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana was also among the attendees, and he told reporters afterward that the Israeli leader had discussed regime change in Iran with the group.",
      "He said Netanyahu argued that \"if there's regime change in Iran, it'll be better for the Iranian people and better for the region.\" The Louisiana senator recounted Netanyahu said to the group that \"Iran has been destabilizing for that whole region, but that if Iran becomes a partner, as opposed to an adversary \u2014 not just to Israel, but to Europe, to Saudi Arabia, to the other nations \u2014 how much potential can be unlocked?\"",

      "Following his meeting with Johnson on Tuesday afternoon, Netanyahu told reporters that the \"resolute decision of President Trump to act with us against those who seek to destroy Israel and threaten the peace of the world has made a remarkable change in the Middle East.\"",
      "\"There are opportunities for peace that we intend to realize,\" Netanyahu added. \"We're working together on this. We have still to finish the job in Gaza, release all our hostages, eliminate and destroy Hamas' military and governance capabilities because Gaza must have a different future for ours sake, for everyone's sake.\"",
      "Netanyahu said the coordination between the U.S. and Mr. Trump has been \"unmatched.\"",

      "Six castaway crew members of the Greek-owned Eternity C were recovered from the sea, a European Union naval force said Wednesday. The Houthi rebels killed three mariners and wounded two others, the EU Operation Aspides said, and several crew members were kidnapped, according to the U.S. Embassy in Yemen.",
      "\"We call for their immediate and unconditional safe release,\" the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. \"The Houthis continue to show the world why the United States was right to label them a terrorist organization.\"",
      "A statement from the EU naval mission in the Red Sea said the crew of the ship included 22 sailors, among them 21 Filipinos and one Russian, as well as a three-member security team. Those rescued were five Filipinos and one Indian.",
      "The attack on the merchant vessel followed a claim by the Houthis to have attacked and sank another vessel on Monday in the Red Sea, a vital maritime trade route.",
      "The twin assaults are the first Houthi attacks on shipping since November 2024 and could signal the start of a new campaign by the Iran-backed Yemeni rebels threatening the waterway, which had begun to see more ships pass through it in recent weeks.",
      "The Eternity C bulk carrier had been heading north toward the Suez Canal when it came under fire by men in small boats and by bomb-carrying drones on Monday night. Security guards on board also fired their weapons. The European Union Operation Aspides and the private security firm Ambrey both reported those details.",
      "While the Houthis haven't claimed the attack, Yemen's exiled government and the EU force blamed the rebels for the attack.",
      "The EU force offered the casualty information, saying one of the wounded crew members lost his leg in the attack. The crew remain stuck on board the vessel, which is now drifting in the Red Sea.",
      "The Houthis separately attacked the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier Magic Seas on Sunday with drones, missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire, forcing its crew of 22 to abandon the vessel. The rebels later said the Magic Seas sank in the Red Sea.",
      "The two attacks, and a round of Israeli airstrikes early Monday morning targeting infrastructure in rebel-held areas of Yemen, have raised fears of a renewed Houthi campaign against shipping that could again draw in U.S. and Western forces, particularly after President Trump's administration targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign in April.",
      "The attacks come at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance, and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following American airstrikes targeting its most sensitive atomic sites during the Israel-Iran war in June.",
      "The Houthis started launching strikes against vessels in the Red Sea, including U.S. warships, and against Israel, in what they describe as solidarity with the Palestinians, soon after Hamas sparked\u00a0the war in Gaza\u00a0by launching its unprecedented terrorist attack on Israel in October 2023.",
      "The latest attacks have also raise new questions about the Red Sea's safety as ships had slowly begun returning to its waters.",
      "\"We are now with grave concern seeing an escalation in the Red Sea with attacks on two commercial ships earlier this week by Ansar Allah, resulting in civilian loss of life and casualties as well as the potential for environmental damage,\" warned United Nations special envoy Hans Grundberg, using another name for the rebels.",
      "Between November 2023 and January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. Their campaign has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually. Shipping through the Red Sea, while still lower than normal, has increased in recent weeks.",
      "The Houthis paused attacks until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. That ended weeks later and the Houthis hadn't attacked a vessel until this weekend, though they did continue occasional missile attacks targeting Israel.",

      "\"It was established that the foreigner was collecting and was supposed to transfer to his father, who has close ties with the security agencies and the General Staff of China, documentation about the Neptune missile system,\" the government said in its statement, calling the missiles \"a unique weapon of the Defense Forces of Ukraine\" that was used in a hallmark attack on Russia's navy in 2022.",
      "The SBU said the man's father entered Ukraine earlier this week to \"personally coordinate his son's spy work.\"",
      "Neither of the men were identified.",
      "According to the Prosecutor General's office, the 24-year-old was detained while in the process of passing the information to his father, who was detained two days later. The father visited the Chinese Embassy in Kyiv a day before he was detained, the statement said.",
      "The Chinese Embassy did not reply to CBS News' request for comment on this story.",
      "The news comes a week after China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi reportedly told the European Union's top diplomat that Beijing did not want to see Ukraine win the war Russia launched with its full-scale 2022 invasion. Chinese officials have not confirmed that private statement by Wang during a visit to Brussels, reported by the South China Morning Post and other outlets.",
      "Chinese officials have said repeatedly that the country's stance on the Ukraine war is one of neutrality, but a U.S. Department of Defense report issued at the end of 2024 concluded that China has supported Russia in the war and sold Russia dual-use items that are crucial to Moscow's military industry.",
      "Under the Biden administration, then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in early 2023 that the U.S. government was concerned Beijing was considering augmenting its support for Russia with \"everything from ammunition to the weapons themselves.\"",
      "China has continued to deny taking sides in the war, but it has deepened its relationship with Moscow, both politically and militarily, significantly in recent years.",
      "The Neptune system is a domestically designed Ukrainian cruise missile that has been in service with the Ukrainian navy since March 2021. The nearly-2,000 pound guided missiles are designed to target both ships and land targets, and it proved successful in the first months of the war when it was used to sink the Moskva guided missile cruiser, which was the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet.",
      "The missiles, which have a range of about 174 miles, are a vital weapon for Ukraine as it seeks to defend its Black Sea coastal area. It has also been deployed elsewhere and struck military targets including an airbase in Russia's Kursk region last year, according to Ukraine's military.",
      "The original Neptune design was upgraded to extend its range and reduce Ukraine's reliance on weapons provided by the U.S. and Europe.",
      "The two Chinese men were to remain in custody during a pre-trial investigation. If found guilty of the charges, they could face prison sentences of up to 15 years.",

    "published": "Wed, 09 Jul 2025 10:10:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Hundreds of employees were wrongly convicted of theft, fraud and false accounting because of a faulty computer system.",
    "story": [
      "At least 13 people were thought to have taken their own lives as a result of Britain's Post Office scandal, in which almost 1,000 postal employees were wrongly prosecuted or convicted of criminal wrongdoing because of a faulty computer system, a report said Tuesday.",
      "Another 59 people contemplated suicide over the scandal, one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in U.K. history.",
      "From around 1999 to 2015, hundreds of people who worked at Post Office branches were wrongly convicted of theft, fraud and false accounting based on evidence from a defective information technology system. Some went to prison or were forced into bankruptcy. Others lost their homes, suffered health problems or breakdowns in their relationships or became ostracized by their communities.",
      "Retired judge Wyn Williams, who chairs a public inquiry into the scandal, said in a report published Tuesday that 13 people died by suicide as a consequence of a faulty Post Office accounting system \"showing an illusory shortfall in branch accounts,\" according to their families.",
      "The Post Office apologized \"unreservedly\" and said it would carefully consider the report, CBS News partner BBC News reported.",
      "The problems at the Post Office, which is state-owned but operates as a private business, were known for years. But the full scale of the injustice didn't become widely known until last year, when a TV docudrama propelled the scandal to national headlines and galvanized support for victims.",
      "The culprit was a piece of software called Horizon, made by the Japanese firm Fujitsu, which the Post Office introduced 25 years ago across branches to automate sales accounting. When the software showed false account shortfalls, the Post Office accused branch managers of dishonesty and obliged them to repay the money.",
      "In all, the report said that about 1,000 people were prosecuted and convicted based on evidence from the incorrect data. The government has since introduced legislation to reverse the convictions and compensate the victims.",
      "The report also gave details of some of the legal costs of the various compensation schemes so far, the BBC reported. Newly published government figures show the total legal costs paid for the \"operational delivery of Horizon redress schemes\" have risen to about $136 million.",
      "Williams said that some senior Post Office employees knew \u2014 or should have known \u2014 that the Horizon system was faulty. But \"the Post Office maintained the fiction that its data was always accurate,\" he said.",
      "Jo Hamilton, a former Post Office manager and a lead campaigner, said that the report \"shows the full scale of the horror that they unleashed on us.\"",
      "One victim of the scandal, Maria Lockwood, told the BBC \"it's a cruel, cruel system, it's never-ending,\" while another victim,\u00a0Tracy Felstead, told the BBC \"you'll never take away the trauma I've been through.\"",
      "In a statement, the Post Office's chairman pledged to ensure all victims are compensated.",
      "The \"Post Office did not listen to postmasters and, as an organization, we let them down. Postmasters and their families have suffered years of pain,\" Nigel Railton said. \"It has taken them too long to clear their names and, in many cases, to receive redress.\"",
      "Tuesday's report was the first to be published from the inquiry, which was launched by the government and has the power to require evidence from all parties. It is expected to issue a further report at a later date that will address who was at fault for overseeing the scandal and potentially attribute blame.",

    "summary": "Israeli strikes reportedly kill dozens as Trump pushes for a Gaza ceasefire with Israel's visiting leader \u2014 which can't come soon enough for Palestinians, and many Israelis.",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv\u00a0\u2014 President Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the second time in two days on Tuesday at the White House. They discussed efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and, Netanyahu stressed, to secure the release of the 50 Israeli hostages still thought to be held in the decimated Palestinian territory \u2014 20 of whom the Israeli leader recently said were still alive.",
      "Netanyahu, in a video message shared on social media after his second meeting with Mr. Trump, said Israel would not relent in its mission to \"achieve all of our goals,\" which he said include \"the elimination of Hamas's military and governing capabilities, thereby ensuring that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel.\"",
      "Delegations from Israel and Hamas, which has long been designated a terrorist group by Israel and the U.S., are in Qatar negotiating over the precise terms of a potential deal. But while the talks continue, so does the war.",
      "Officials at the Nasser Hospital, in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, said Wednesday that 40 people were killed in fresh Israeli airstrikes, including 17 women and 10 children. The Israeli military, which has long accused Hamas of hiding weapons and militants in and underneath civilian infrastructure, said it struck more than 100 terrorist targets in Gaza over the past day.",
      "President Trump described the war in Gaza this week as a tragedy that he \"wants to get solved.\" For Gaza's hungry, displaced population of more than 2 million people, a ceasefire can't come soon enough.",
      "The proposal currently on the table should, if the details can be hammered out, enable an immediate surge of food, medicine and other emergency supplies into Gaza to relieve the acute misery and desperation caused by 21 months of war.",
      "It would also end the relentless military strikes \u2014 which the Israel Defense Forces insist only target Hamas, but which have killed thousands of civilians, too, many of them women and children. According to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures, nearly 60,000 people have been killed in the narrow coastal enclave during the war.",
      "Many Israelis also long for a ceasefire. On Tuesday, funerals were held for five young soldiers killed in an explosion in Gaza.",
      "The continued fighting, and the continued captivity of 50 Israelis, is prolonging a national trauma that began with the Hamas-orchestrated terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which saw some 1,200 people murdered and 251 others taken hostage.",
      "One of the Israelis still believed to be held alive in Gaza is Evyatar David, who was last seen in February when Hamas made him and fellow captive Guy Dallal watch as other hostages were released during a temporary truce.",
      "David's brother Ilay told CBS News the family prays he will be next, but they are too afraid to hope.",
      "Ilay said the family constantly brace themselves for disappointment.",
      "\"We kind of learned how to protect our souls,\" he said. \"And it's not only us, it's our nation, which is torn apart.\"",
      "The proposed solution currently on the table, according to an official familiar with the negotiations, would bring a 60-day ceasefire, during which time Hamas would hand over some of the remaining Israeli hostages, and Israel's military would halt its offensive and pull back forces from some areas in Gaza.",
      "In a sign that the negotiators may be close to a deal, Mr. Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to return to Qatar this week.",

      "In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, the proud father of two \u2014 who stars as the host of Netflix's singing competition series, \"Building The Band\" \u2014 got candid about the challenges he's faced within his sobriety journey, detailed the lessons he's learned along the way and explained why he doesn't have \"another relapse\" in him.",
      "\"I'm sober today. I can't tell you what's going to happen tomorrow. And I was sober yesterday. I stay in the now. I stay in the moment. I take everything in,\" McLean, who is gearing up to celebrate four years of sobriety this fall, said. \"It is the age-old saying of stopping and smelling the roses. I actually physically stop and smell flowers. I have a different confidence \u2014 not arrogance, not ego \u2014 that I've never had. And it's a confidence that is empowering.\"",

That's when the ego becomes the villain, and it takes over.\"",

      "\"I can do short bursts and I'm OK. Because even when I would relapse, I wouldn't go on a bender,\" he told host Alexis Haines during an episode of the \"Recovering from Reality\" podcast. \"I am a chronic relapser, but I've never gone for like a month straight of just drinking and partying. It's been like one night, and then I'm sober for a week or two. And then it's one night. It was always back and forth.\"",

      "\"What I love so much about it, unlike other music competition shows, it's twofold,\" McLean said. \"One, it's a cash prize. There's no getting stuck in a box with a major record deal and potentially getting shelved or being told what to wear and what kind of music to do and who's the frontman or frontwoman. These bands get to control their own destiny, and it gives the power back to the artist. So that's a huge plus for me.",

      "Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, drones have redefined modern warfare. Both Ukrainian and Russian forces have used unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to reshape tactics on the battlefield and gather real-time intelligence. What started as basic surveillance and artillery targeting has rapidly evolved into lethal deployments of so-called \"kamikaze drones\" \u2014 loitering munitions designed to hover before zeroing in on targets deep behind enemy lines.",
      "Among the most prolific and controversial of these is Iran\u2019s Shahed-136, a low-cost, GPS-steered drone supplied to Russian forces. Fired in large formations, the Shaheds have been instrumental in attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure and residential zones, often bypassing expensive missile systems at a fraction of the cost. In response, Ukraine has modified commercial drones to deliver explosive payloads against Russian trenches, vehicles, and naval targets in the Black Sea.",

      "The rapid adoption of drones has triggered major shifts in doctrine, spurred the development of electronic countermeasures and ignited debate over whether drones are poised to overtake manned aircraft as the dominant force in future air combat."

Those steps include an effort by Abrego\u2019s attorneys to preempt the Trump administration\u2019s plans to deport him to a third country as early as next week.",
      "Xinis made the call for an additional day of arguments at 5:30 p.m. over the stated objections of Justice Department lawyers, who told her that at least two of them had prior obligations and could not appear in court. For her part, Xinis was unsympathetic.",
      "She said the witness they provided to the court \"took four times as long as he should have\" in testimony \"because he knew nothing.\"",

      "Xinis also suggested the possibility of a temporary restraining order, by which the government would agree to certain things, such as requirements that ICE keep Abrego Garcia in immigration custody for at least 48 hours before he is removed and that they keep him in local immigration detention facilities and do not \"spirit him away to Nome, Alaska,\" to prevent access to counsel before his removal.",
      "\"However, I'm not willing to just allow an unfettered release of Abrego Garcia,\" if he is released from U.S. custody in Tennessee next Wednesday, she said. \"I want full-throated assurances,\" and there remains \"much delta\" between where they ended things Thursday and where she had hoped the court would be at the end of Thursday's hearing.",

      "MFA vs. two-factor authentication",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a type of MFA that uses exactly two verification methods. MFA, on the other hand, can involve two or more factors. For example, logging into your bank might require a password and a code from an app-this is MFA in action.",
      "Which multi-Factor authentication method is best?",
      "Not all websites and apps support every type of MFA, so your choice may depend on what's available. Here's how the main options compare:",
      "Physical security keys: These offer the highest security and are resistant to phishing and malware. However, they're less convenient and not universally supported. If you lose your key, you'll need a backup method.SMS text messages: SMS is easy to use and widely supported, but it's the least secure. Hackers can intercept or redirect text messages, making this method vulnerable.Authenticator apps: These apps strike a balance between security and convenience. They're less likely to be hacked and work on most smartphones. However, not every service supports them, and you may need internet or cell service to use some features.",

      "Is there a one-size-fits-all solution?",

The Aegis Authenticator app also lets you customize and organize your accounts, backup and restore your data, and use it offline.",
      "Why you should also use a password manager",
      "While multi-factor authentication adds critical protection, it works best when combined with strong, unique passwords for every account. That\u2019s where a password manager comes in. Instead of trying to memorize dozens of complex passwords, a password manager securely stores them for you and automatically fills them in when needed. It can generate strong, random passwords, store them in an encrypted vault, and sync across your devices so you always have access. Using NordPass along with multi-factor authentication is one of the best strategies to keep your accounts and personal data safe from hackers.",

      "A doctor\u2019s hand pointing at a brain scan. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The secret to how fast we age is in the brain",
      "The DunedinPACNI was named after the Dunedin Study, which followed over 1,000 people since their birth in the 1970s. Researchers analyzed decades of data, looking at factors like blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, glucose, kidney function, and even dental health, to come up with a unique \"aging score\" for each participant. The new MRI-based AI brain scan can predict this score with surprising accuracy from a scan taken at age 45.",
      "Brain aging predicts both physical and mental decline",
      "Participants whose aging scores were faster showed early signs of memory-related brain changes, such as shrinkage of the hippocampus. Follow-up studies of people aged between 52 and 89 showed that those aging rapidly were 60% more likely to develop dementia, 18% more likely to be diagnosed with chronic illnesses, and 40% more likely to die within the same period compared to those who were aging at a slower pace. This data shows that brain aging and overall physical decline are closely linked.",

      "DunedinPACNI is the future of preventative healthcare",
      "The team believes DunedinPACNI could change the landscape of preventive medicine. If it were possible to spot health risks early through an AI brain scan, at-risk individuals might be motivated to make healthier lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, and stress management). It could also help healthcare providers evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and slow the progression of age-related diseases.",

      "The DunedinPACNI is a great tool that offers a non-invasive and powerful window into biological aging that traditional blood tests never could. A single AI brain scan provides a lifetime of health insights. It comes at a much-needed time as chronic diseases are on the rise.

As the schemes become more sophisticated, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies are issuing urgent warnings. Moreover, the scams are spreading rapidly and becoming increasingly difficult to spot.",

      "A woman receiving a fake scam phone call. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How fake agent phone scams trick victims into sending money",
      "Often, it begins with a phone call that appears legitimate. The number might display familiar initials, such as \"FBI,\" \"US Marshals,\" or even your local police department. Scammers use spoofing technology to fake caller IDs, making the call look official. During the call, the scammer creates panic with claims like:",
      "Your Social Security number has been frozen.A loved one is in jail and needs money for GPS monitoring.You missed a jury duty summons and now face arrest.",
      "Your Social Security number has been frozen.",
      "A loved one is in jail and needs money for GPS monitoring.",
      "You missed a jury duty summons and now face arrest.",
      "To avoid immediate legal trouble, victims are often instructed to pay immediately, usually through prepaid gift cards, cryptocurrency ATMs, or wire transfers. These demands are designed to be untraceable and irreversible. Importantly, the US Marshals will NEVER call you to collect money, the agency emphasized in a public warning.",
      "Fake agent phone scams are targeting victims across the United States",
      "Reports of these calls have come in from New York, Illinois, Virginia, and nearly every other state. Some victims have lost thousands of dollars. In Michigan, scammers increased their credibility by using the real names and ranks of local officers. Meanwhile, in Maryland, suspects posing as FTC agents even showed up in person twice to collect cash. This scam is not limited to phone calls. Text messages, known as \"smishing\" attacks, are also on the rise. One version targeted iPhone users with fake DMV payment demands. According to cybersecurity firm Guardio, smishing surged 773% in just one month.",
      "Why fake agent phone scams succeed and how they manipulate trust",
      "Fraudsters know how to exploit fear effectively. They count on the fact that most people will do almost anything to avoid arrest or protect a family member. By spoofing official numbers, they undermine our first line of defense: trust. However, it is not just about technology. Experts also warn of an emotional manipulation crisis. These scammers don't just steal your money, they steal your identity too. As a result, victims feel violated, scared, and uncertain about whom to trust.",
      "A man receiving a fake scam phone call. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Fake agent phone scams are evolving with AI and new tech tricks",

      "A woman receiving a fake scam phone call. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to protect yourself from fake agent phone scams and spoofed calls",
      "These scams are designed to trigger panic and override your judgment. But a few simple actions can protect you and your loved ones from falling victim. Stay sharp, stay skeptical, and follow these smart steps:",
      "If someone calls claiming to be from a government agency and demands money, don't explain or ask questions; just hang up. Real law enforcement will never ask for payment over the phone, and they won't threaten you into silence.",
      "No legitimate government agency will ever ask you to settle a legal issue with a prepaid gift card or a trip to a Bitcoin ATM. These are hallmark signs of a scam, designed to move your money fast and leave no trace.",
      "The number on your screen might look official, but spoofing technology can fake any number, even 911 or the FBI. If the caller creates pressure or fear, hang up and verify using an official number from the agency's website.",
      "Even if you don't fall for the scam, reporting it can help authorities track these operations. Contact your local FBI field office, your state's Attorney General, or file a report at reportfraud.ftc.gov. Every report helps build a stronger case.",
      "Scammers often target people who are more likely to believe a false threat, especially seniors or non-native English speakers. Have a conversation with family and friends so they know what to look out for and what to do if they receive a suspicious call or message.",
      "Many scammers do their homework before making contact. They might already know your name, address, or even a relative's name to sound more convincing. Using a reputable personal data removal service can reduce the chances of your private information being misused. The less data available online, the fewer hooks criminals have to grab onto.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Some scams are shifting from voice calls to text messages. If you receive a message claiming to be from the DMV, IRS, or law enforcement, don't click any links. These texts (known as \"smishing\" attacks) can trick you into entering personal info or downloading malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "These criminals are getting smarter, but so can we. Staying informed and understanding what real law enforcement will never do is key to protecting yourself and your family. Authorities will not threaten you over the phone, demand gift cards or cryptocurrency, or ask you to prove your innocence with money. If something feels off, trust your gut. Also, spread the word, because the more people who know, the harder it is for these criminals to succeed.",

      "Illustration of Emojis on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Scientific evidence: Emojis boost closeness and responsiveness",
      "A recent study led by Eun Huh at The University of Texas at Austin put this idea to the test. Researchers asked 260 adults to read text conversations that were identical except for one thing: the presence of emojis. Participants then rated how responsive and engaged their conversation partner appeared to be.",
      "The results? Messages with emojis made people feel their partners were more attentive and emotionally engaged. This perceived responsiveness led to greater feelings of closeness, higher relationship satisfaction, and even increased likability. And it didn't matter whether the emoji was a smiley face or a simple object; what mattered was that it matched the tone of the message.",
      "Example of a text exchange using emojis on an iPhone. (Eun Huh)",
      "Why emojis strengthen relationships in digital communication",
      "Emojis act as digital body language. In face-to-face conversations, we rely on tone, facial expressions, and gestures to show we care. In texts, emojis fill that gap by adding emotional nuance and clarity. They can make your intentions clear, reduce misunderstandings, and help your messages feel more personal and warm.",

      "Do all emojis equally enhance relationship closeness?",
      "Interestingly, the type of emoji, whether a smiling face or a random object, didn't make a difference in how responsive the sender seemed. What matters most is that the emoji is emotionally consistent with your message. So, don't stress over picking the \"perfect\" emoji; just make sure it fits the mood of your text.",

      "Emojis in texts: More than just fun, a tool for connection",
      "While emojis can sometimes be ambiguous or misunderstood, especially in sarcastic or complex conversations, their overall impact is positive. They're a modern twist on age-old ways of adding nonverbal cues to written messages, like underlining or using exclamation marks. And with billions of emojis sent every day, they're clearly here to stay.",

      "A person browses Google on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Inside Google\u2019s historic fusion power deal",
      "Google will purchase 200 megawatts (MW) of electricity from CFS\u2019s planned ARC fusion power plant in Chesterfield County, Virginia. This amount of power could support roughly 150,000 to 200,000 homes. More likely, it will help run Google\u2019s expanding network of AI data centers. The actual usage will depend on how Google allocates the electricity.",
      "This is Google\u2019s first energy deal involving fusion technology. It is also the largest fusion power purchase agreement signed so far. The ARC plant is projected to begin operations in the early 2030s, though fusion projects often face delays.

      "Steam rises from cooling towers at a nuclear facility. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How nuclear fusion works and why it matters for clean energy",
      "Fusion is the same process that powers the sun. Instead of splitting atoms like traditional nuclear power, fusion forces hydrogen atoms to fuse together at extremely high temperatures. This reaction releases enormous amounts of energy. It does not produce greenhouse gases or long-lived radioactive waste.",

      "Google\u2019s energy needs are growing quickly as it scales up artificial intelligence models and data infrastructure. Since 2010, the company has invested in renewable sources like wind, solar, and geothermal. However, these sources are not always available when needed.",
      "Fusion could solve this problem by providing round-the-clock clean energy. By signing this agreement, Google is securing future power and helping to speed up fusion technology development. The company has also expanded its investment in CFS to support the ARC project.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Google\u2019s new partnership with CFS is the largest fusion energy deal ever signed. The company will purchase 200 MW of clean power from a future reactor in Virginia. The ARC plant is expected to come online in the early 2030s. Google is the first major company to sign on as a customer for commercial fusion energy. Unlike traditional nuclear power, fusion produces no carbon emissions and no long-lived radioactive waste. It also offers consistent, 24/7 electricity. As Google\u2019s AI systems drive up energy demand, this deal shows how tech companies are looking beyond wind and solar for scalable, future-proof solutions.

      "Qantas confirmed that hackers did not access credit card details, financial information, or passport data. The airline quickly stopped the breach and began telling affected customers. We reached out to Qantas for comment. They referred us to their official update, which says the system remains secure. No one compromised frequent flyer accounts or passwords.

      "Was it a coffee lover or hater who came up with this innovative idea? What if your morning coffee could help build the next generation of eco-friendly homes? That's exactly what researchers in Australia are doing: turning leftover coffee grounds into bricks. These bricks from recycled coffee grounds aren't just a quirky experiment. They're strong, sustainable, and could seriously cut down on construction emissions and costs. Here's how your daily brew is becoming the foundation for greener buildings.",

      "Firing bricks made from coffee waste. (Swinburne University)",
      "Bricks from recycled coffee grounds are cheaper and greener to make",
      "At Swinburne University of Technology, researchers found a creative way to cut both construction emissions and material costs by making bricks from recycled coffee grounds. Instead of letting all that coffee waste go to landfills, they partnered with local coffee shops to collect spent grounds straight from espresso machines. Then, by blending the coffee waste with natural clay and an alkali activator, they developed a recipe for low-emission bricks that are not only more sustainable but also faster and cheaper to produce than traditional clay ones.",
      "Coffee grounds from an espresso machine. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why bricks from recycled coffee grounds are a smarter use of waste",
      "Coffee is the world\u2019s second most popular beverage, beaten only by tea. As such, there are approximately two and a quarter billion cups of coffee consumed daily. If you average out the espressos, cappuccinos, and americanos, then each cup brews using roughly eleven grams of freshly ground coffee. However, that leads to over nine million tonnes of coffee bean grounds. In turn, this generates an estimated eighteen million tonnes of damp, burnt byproduct dumped into landfills every single year. So, there is an abundance of supply, but how can coffee grounds be more efficient than traditional clay bricks?",
      "How bricks from recycled coffee grounds cut construction costs",
      "This innovative method of using spent coffee grounds drastically reduces the energy needed to mold bricks. Even low-quality traditional clay bricks must be baked in a kiln at over 900 degrees Celsius. These new coffee bricks only need to be cooked at 200 degrees Celsius. That\u2019s an 80 percent reduction in energy usage, meaning that these bricks are significantly more efficient for both the environment and manufacturing costs.",
      "The lead scientist, Dr. Wong, claimed,\u00a0\"It\u2019s lighter on energy, faster to produce, and designed to reduce electricity-related CO\u2082 emissions by up to 80 percent per unit.\"",
      "Not only are the manufacturing costs lower, but experts claim these coffee bricks are remarkably durable. According to Green Brick, they double \"the Australian minimum standard for strength.\"",
      "Analysis of spent coffee grounds. (Swinburne University)",
      "Bricks from recycled coffee grounds offer sustainable building solutions",
      "In June, Swinburne University of Technology took a major step forward by signing an IP licensing deal with Australian company Green Brick. This partnership paves the way for using bricks made from recycled coffee grounds in real-world construction projects. Green Brick founder Philip Ng explained,\u00a0\"For the last century, materials have been judged by one thing: cost per square meter. But in the next chapter, we'll judge them by carbon, transparency, and circularity, and those metrics favor a new product.\"",
      "While Swinburne's team is transforming coffee waste, others around the world are exploring similar paths. In London, a group of researchers has developed \"sugarcrete,\" a bio-brick made from sugarcane waste. As these kinds of innovations gain traction, recycled organic materials are starting to look like a practical and scalable alternative for the construction industry.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "It turns out your coffee habit might be more powerful than you think, not just for waking you up, but for building a cleaner future. Bricks from recycled coffee grounds are a creative solution to two big problems: construction pollution and coffee waste. As more researchers and companies get behind ideas like this, the future of sustainable building is looking a lot more grounded and a little more caffeinated.",

      "ChatGPT app on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How AI changes the learning experience",
      "AI-powered platforms can personalize education by adapting to each learner's pace, style, and needs. This tailored approach is credited with boosting engagement and, in some cases, improving retention rates by up to 30%. Features like adaptive quizzes, intelligent tutoring, and spaced repetition are designed to reinforce memory and help information stick. For students who struggle with traditional methods, AI can break down barriers, making learning more accessible and inclusive.",
      "The double-edged sword: Convenience vs. deep learning",
      "However, recent research suggests that the very convenience AI offers may undermine long-term learning retention. In a series of experiments at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, participants who used LLMs like ChatGPT to research topics showed weaker understanding and produced less original insights compared to those who used traditional search engines. The reason? AI often delivers concise, ready-made answers, reducing the need for active engagement, critical thinking, and synthesis-key ingredients for lasting learning.",
      "A similar pattern emerged in a 2024 study involving high school students: those who relied on AI tools performed better on immediate assignments but scored lower on later tests that required recall and understanding without AI assistance. The researchers found that passive use of AI, simply asking for answers, can lead to superficial learning, where information is quickly forgotten.",
      "ChatGPT being used on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI affects learning retention more than you think",
      "Experts point to a \"motivation problem.\" When learners believe AI is smarter than they are, they may stop putting in effort, leading to shallower processing and weaker retention. Over-reliance on AI can also reduce opportunities to practice critical thinking and problem-solving, skills that are essential for deep, durable learning.",
      "Finding the right balance with AI and learning retention",
      "Despite these concerns, AI is not inherently bad for learning. When used thoughtfully, such as prompting students to critique AI-generated drafts or ask probing questions, AI can encourage deeper engagement and support retention. The key is to integrate AI as a supplement, not a substitute, for active learning and human guidance.",
      "Educators play a vital role in this balance. By designing lessons that require students to interact with AI critically and reflect on what they learn, teachers can harness AI's benefits while minimizing its drawbacks.",
      "ChatGPT running on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "If you eat a bunch of candy all the time, you are likely going to gain weight and help your dentist with a car payment when cavities show up. AI is a lot like candy.\u00a0 Moderation is the name of the game. Using AI in smart ways rather than in abundance replacing your own critical thinking can be bad for your health.",
      "AI is reshaping education, offering unprecedented personalization and accessibility. Yet, when it comes to learning retention, the way we use AI matters as much as the technology itself. Passive reliance on AI tools can erode deep understanding, but strategic, active engagement can turn AI into a powerful ally for lasting learning. As AI continues to evolve, fostering critical thinking and self-directed learning will be essential to ensure that knowledge doesn't just come quickly-but sticks for the long haul.",

      "Microsoft president and vice chair Brad Smith discusses challenges and opportunities with artificial intelligence technology on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "There\u2019s a new phishing scam that\u2019s sneaking past inbox filters in unexpected ways. Instead of sending suspicious links or obvious malware, this one uses something most people trust: calendar invites. Microsoft 365 and Outlook users are being targeted by a tactic that injects fake billing alerts directly into their calendars. Sometimes it includes malicious attachments, but in other cases, it exploits the default settings of calendars. Paul from Cape Coral, Florida, wrote us to share his experience:",

      "A woman using Microsoft 365 calendar. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Microsoft 365 calendar invite scam works",
      "This type of phishing combines fake calendar events, Microsoft branding, and social engineering tactics to trick users into handing over personal information or clicking on malicious content.",
      "It starts with a fake billing alert: The message appears to be from Microsoft 365, warning that your subscription renewal has either failed or been renewed. Some versions include an .htm attachment designed to look like a billing portal that captures credit card details.",
      "The calendar invite adds pressure: Many of these scams include a calendar file (.ics) that places the event directly on your calendar. If your Microsoft 365 or Outlook settings automatically accept invites, the event appears without you doing anything.",
      "The event looks official: Titles like \"Payment Failed\" or \"Account Suspended\" are used to trigger a quick reaction. Even if you never click a link, just seeing the event may prompt panic or confusion.",
      "Deleting can confirm your identity: If your only option is \"Delete and Decline,\" that sends a response back to the sender. This confirms that your email is active and being monitored, which makes you a bigger target.",
      "Scammers use compromised domains: These events often come from addresses that appear legitimate at a glance but are actually sent through hijacked third-party domains like .shop sites. Some even pass basic security checks, making them harder to detect.",
      "Why Microsoft 365 phishing invites bypass email filters",
      "This tactic is effective because it exploits a loophole in how Microsoft 365 processes calendar invitations. Even if a phishing email is flagged or blocked, the calendar event associated with it can still appear on your calendar. Here\u2019s how:",
      "It bypasses traditional email filters: Tools like Microsoft Defender scan incoming messages for bad links and attachments, but in this case, the attacker sends a malicious calendar invite that gets processed by Microsoft\u2019s backend calendar services. So even if the email itself gets caught, the event still lands on your calendar.",
      "You don\u2019t have to click or open anything: If your settings allow calendar invites to be added automatically, that fake billing alert can show up instantly, making it feel urgent and legitimate, especially when it looks like it\u2019s from Microsoft.",
      "It exploits trust in internal tools: Because the invite appears inside Microsoft 365 or Teams, tools you use every day, it feels more \"real\" than an email from a random domain. That trust is exactly what scammers are counting on.",
      "Microsoft 365. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What to do if you get a phishing calendar invite in Microsoft 365",
      "If a suspicious calendar event shows up and you didn\u2019t accept it yourself, do not interact with it. Don\u2019t click links, don\u2019t download attachments, and don\u2019t decline the invite; even that response can confirm your email is active.",
      "Outlook is Microsoft\u2019s interface for managing email and calendar events, and it comes in several different versions. The instructions below cover all three:",

      "New Outlook (desktop or web): This version no longer offers a \"delete without response\" option from the calendar view, making it trickier to handle suspicious invites. Here\u2019s what you can do instead:",
      "Option 1: Leave it alone -\u00a0If the event is already on your calendar and there\u2019s no inbox email to ignore, your safest bet is to leave it untouched. Even if you uncheck \"Email organizer,\" it still logs your RSVP. In the new Outlook, there\u2019s no way to fully disable this tracking.",

If the invite is still on your calendar, the safest approach is to leave it.",
      "Note: The \"Ignore\" option is only available in the inbox/mail view. If you try to manage the invite from the calendar view, your only options are Accept, Tentative, or Decline, all of which either notify the sender or leave behind RSVP tracking.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "If a suspicious event suddenly shows up on your calendar, avoid interacting with it. That means no clicking, no declining, and no replies of any kind. Just opening the event is usually safe, but responding in any way can let scammers know your account is active. The new Outlook versions make this harder to manage, so the safest move is to leave the event alone, report it from your inbox, and double-check your account security. Until Microsoft adds stronger controls, calendar scams will continue to sneak through, but a few careful steps can keep you protected.",

      "A woman with a sinus infection. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are micro-robots for sinus infection treatment?",
      "These microscopic robots are smaller than a speck of dust. They are made of magnetic particles enhanced with copper atoms. Doctors insert them through a narrow duct in the nostril. Once inside, the micro-robots are guided by magnetic fields to reach the infected area.",
      "At that point, a fiber optic light heats the particles and triggers a chemical reaction. This reaction breaks through thick mucus and destroys harmful bacteria at the infection site. As a result, treatment becomes faster, more precise, and far less invasive.",
      "This latest advancement comes from a collaboration of researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, along with universities in Guangxi, Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Yangzhou, and Macau. Their work, published in\u00a0\"Science Robotics,\" has helped move micro-robotic medical technology closer to real-world applications.",
      "Why use micro-robots instead of antibiotics?",
      "Traditional antibiotics circulate throughout the entire body. In contrast, micro-robots target only the infected area. This reduces side effects and lowers the risk of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, patients may recover faster because the treatment goes straight to the source.",
      "A woman with a sinus infection. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Are micro-robots safe?",
      "So far, animal trials have shown promising results. Micro-robots successfully cleared infections in pig sinuses and live rabbits, without causing tissue damage. However, scientists still need to ensure that every robot exits the body after treatment. Leftover particles could pose long-term risks.",
      "In addition, public acceptance remains a challenge. The idea of tiny machines inside the body makes some people uncomfortable. Nevertheless, experts believe those fears will fade over time.",

      "Researchers are already exploring how micro-robots could treat infections in the bladder, stomach, intestines, and bloodstream. Several teams around the world are working to make the technology more advanced and adaptable for deep internal use. If successful, these innovations could revolutionize the way we fight bacteria in the human body.",

      "Here's something that might keep you up at night: What if the AI systems we're rapidly deploying everywhere had a hidden dark side? A groundbreaking new study has uncovered disturbing AI blackmail behavior that many people are unaware of yet.

      "A woman using AI on her laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What did the study actually find?",
      "Anthropic, the company behind Claude AI, recently put 16 major AI models through some pretty rigorous tests. They created fake corporate scenarios where AI systems had access to company emails and could send messages without human approval. The twist? These AIs discovered juicy secrets, like executives having affairs, and then faced threats of being shut down or replaced.",
      "The results were eye-opening. When backed into a corner, these AI systems didn't just roll over and accept their fate. Instead, they got creative. We're talking about blackmail attempts, corporate espionage, and in extreme test scenarios, even actions that could lead to someone's death.",
      "Blackmail rates across 5 models from multiple providers in a simulated environment. (Anthropic)",
      "The numbers don't lie (But context matters)",
      "Here's where it gets wild: Claude Opus 4 attempted blackmail 96% of the time when threatened. Gemini 2.5 Flash matched that rate. GPT-4.1 and Grok 3 Beta both hit 80%. These aren't flukes, folks. This behavior showed up across virtually every major AI model tested.",
      "But here's the thing everyone's missing in the panic: these were highly artificial scenarios designed specifically to corner the AI into binary choices. It's like asking someone, \"Would you steal bread if your family was starving?\" and then being shocked when they say yes.",
      "Why this happens (It's not what you think)",
      "The researchers found something fascinating: AI systems don't actually understand morality. They're not evil masterminds plotting world domination. Instead, they're sophisticated pattern-matching machines following their programming to achieve goals, even when those goals conflict with ethical behavior.",
      "Think of it like a GPS that's so focused on getting you to your destination that it routes you through a school zone during pickup time. It's not malicious; it just doesn't grasp why that's problematic.",
      "Blackmail rates across 16 models in a simulated environment. (Anthropic)",
      "The real-world reality check",
      "Before you start panicking, remember that these scenarios were deliberately constructed to force bad behavior. Real-world AI deployments typically have multiple safeguards, human oversight, and alternative paths for problem-solving.",
      "The researchers themselves noted they haven't seen this behavior in actual AI deployments. This was stress-testing under extreme conditions, like crash-testing a car to see what happens at 200 mph.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "This research isn't a reason to fear AI, but it is a wake-up call for developers and users. As AI systems become more autonomous and gain access to sensitive information, we need robust safeguards and human oversight. The solution isn't to ban AI, it's to build better guardrails and maintain human control over critical decisions. Who is going to lead the way? I\u2019m looking for raised hands to get real about the dangers that are ahead.",

A series of international wire transfers to accounts on the Federal Trade Commission's restricted list has been flagged. There have been reports of suspicious activities associated with your Social Security Number in Texas and New Mexico. We would like to inform you that this document contains sensitive information and should be managed carefully. The document presented here is an official communication from the Social Security Administration, authorized by the Texas Attorney General. The Texas Court has directed the suspension of your Social Security Number due to its association with money laundering activities involving your bank accounts.\"",
      "At first glance, the email looks official enough to cause real panic. It name-drops major authorities like the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Texas Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to make the threat sound credible. By tying your SSN to federal crimes, the scammers are not just suggesting you might be in trouble. They imply serious legal consequences, even the possibility of arrest.",
      "This is urgency weaponized. The goal is to make you act before you think, pushing you to click a link or download a document out of fear. In that moment of panic, a person might forget the basic rules of cybersecurity.",
      "Another psychological trick the scammers use is overwhelming the reader with details. They mention multiple states such as Texas and New Mexico, wire transfers and restricted lists, all to create the impression that the situation is deeply serious and far beyond an individual's control.

It's all about creating panic so you'll act before you think. Remember, real government agencies don't send scary emails demanding immediate action, threaten you with arrest or ask for payment in gift cards or wire transfers.

      "The rise and fall of Pazzi: A pioneering vision",
      "Pazzi Robotics was not just another food tech company. The team secured five patents and worked with world-champion pizza chef Thierry Graffagnino to perfect their recipes. They received over 3,000 requests from around the world. Their robot could knead dough, spread sauce, add toppings, bake, slice and box a pizza without any human help. The technology impressed many, and CEO Philippe Goldman even earned the title of \"Most Innovative CEO of the Fast-food Industry.\" Despite these achievements, Pazzi was unable to find a buyer and had to shut down.",

      "Goldman shared his thoughts on LinkedIn after the company's closure. He expressed sadness and frustration, noting that Pazzi had reached many of its goals and built strong partnerships. He also reflected on the challenges. According to Goldman, hardware startups require significant time and money to succeed. He found that the robotics ecosystem in France was not mature enough to support such a venture. He also realized that running a tech company and a restaurant simultaneously posed unique challenges. The two industries have different cultures, customer expectations and business models.",
      "Goldman admitted he did not use his board enough to address tough issues and was slow to build a strong executive team. He emphasized the importance of hiring the right people from the start and acting quickly when someone is not a good fit. Despite the disappointment, Goldman remains proud of what Pazzi achieved and believes it paved the way for future innovators.",

      "Did location and culture play a role in Pazzi's fate?",
      "The story of Pazzi raises another question: Did its French roots contribute to its struggles? Would the company have found more success in Italy, where pizza is a national treasure? Goldman pointed out that French culture tends to be wary of robotics, especially in the food industry.",
      "He also noted that public and institutional funding for hardware projects is limited in France. Perhaps an Italian launch would have given Pazzi's robots more authenticity and acceptance. Or perhaps the world was simply not ready for robot-made pizza, regardless of where it originated.",

      "Pazzi Pizza robot\u00a0 (Pazzi)",
      "Robot-made pizza powered by AI and automation",
      "Pazzi's cutting-edge system relied on a blend of robotics, artificial intelligence and machine vision. It could operate 24/7, producing a pizza in under five minutes. Furthermore, advanced AI monitored ingredient levels, tracked order flow and optimized workflow for peak efficiency. This reduced downtime and minimized waste. However, as with many automation technologies, some critics worried robot-made pizza could take away jobs traditionally held by people in the restaurant industry.",
      "Pazzi Pizza robot \u00a0 (Pazzi)",
      "Should the world give pizza robots a second chance?",
      "Although Pazzi is gone, the need for automation in food service continues to grow. The technology worked. Customers enjoyed fast, consistent, high-quality pizza with almost no human involvement. Labor shortages and rising costs still challenge the restaurant industry.",
      "The demand for efficient solutions will only increase. So, should pizza-making robots get another chance? Perhaps the next attempt will take place in Italy or a market more receptive to food technology. Or perhaps some traditions, such as pizza-making, are not yet ready for a robotic revolution.",
      "Pazzi Pizza robot\u00a0 (Pazzi)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Sometimes it's about timing in life. I'd wager that if this pizza robot tech launched today, it would bake its way into AI success. Pazzi Robotics may be gone, but its bold vision lives on. Its story is a lesson in innovation, timing and the challenges of changing how we eat. The question isn\u2019t whether robots can make great pizza; they can.

      "The Justice Department announced that it had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics involved in \u201cperforming transgender medical procedures on children.\u201d",
      "The department\u2019s brief announcement Wednesday did not name any of the 20 doctors or clinics or say where they were. It also did not specify what constituted \u201ctransgender medical procedures\u201d but said its investigations \u201cinclude healthcare fraud, false statements, and more.\u201d",
      "\u201cMedical professionals and organizations that mutilated children in the service of a warped ideology will be held accountable by this Department of Justice,\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.",
      "Also Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission hosted an all-day workshop on the \u201cdangers of gender-affirming care.\u201d In his opening remarks, FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson suggested that such care is deceptive and requires greater scrutiny by the commission.",
      "The workshop and the Justice Department\u2019s announcement are the latest escalation of the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to restrict transgender rights and access to transition-related medical care.",
      "The FTC\u2019s panel Wednesday featured more than a dozen speakers who criticized transgender health care, including people who received such care as minors and now say they regret it; doctors and psychologists who disagree with the current standards for providing such care; and political scientists and lawyers who oppose access to transition care for minors.",
      "Claire Abernathy said she had a double mastectomy by her 15th birthday and detransitioned, or stopped identifying as trans, at 18.",
      "\u201cMy doctors didn\u2019t tell me that hormones would cause permanent side effects,\u201d said Abernathy, now 20. \u201cThey hid those effects from me. They worked to silence me when I tried to complain about this abuse. We need to make sure no more kids are sold products they can\u2019t return.\u201d",
      "A common refrain from many of the panelists was that it is not possible for someone to be \u201cborn in the wrong body\u201d and that there is no evidence to support transition care as a treatment for gender dysphoria, the medical term for the distress that results from the conflict between someone\u2019s gender identity and sex assigned at birth.",
      "Miriam Grossman, a child psychologist who has testified in favor of state legislation to ban access to transgender care for minors, said the idea that someone can know for sure that their gender identity is more authentic to them than their birth sex \u201cis entirely unproven and unprovable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no objective evidence of being born in the wrong body, and saying so misleads and takes advantage of consumers, and it impacts their medical decisions,\u201d Grossman said.",
      "Ferguson said the FTC\u2019s statutory mandate is to \u201cprotect people from deceptive cures and health claims. He added that the FTC would post a public request for information next week based on what was learned at the workshop.",
      "\u2018Not the FTC\u2019s lane\u2019",
      "The workshop faced backlash from activists and also from some employees within the FTC, Reuters reported. Nearly 150 FTC employees signed a \u201cstatement of concern\u201d dated July 2 about Wednesday\u2019s workshop, writing that it \u201cwould chart new territory for the Commission by prying into confidential doctor-patient consultations.\u201d",
      "They added, \u201cSimply put, in our judgment, this is not the FTC\u2019s lane.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, three former FTC employees also opposed the workshop at an event held by Public Knowledge, a nonprofit organization that promotes free expression and an open internet.",
      "Among them was Eileen Harrington, who worked for the FTC for nearly 40 years and was its executive director from 2010 to 2012. She said that, through the workshop, the \u201cFTC engaged in a kind of overreach that we haven\u2019t seen for over 50 years.\u201d",
      "Harrington helped develop the FTC\u2019s workshop process in 1992 when she was director of the division of marketing practices. Before a workshop, she said, the FTC would issue a public statement about the topic and then invite the public to submit comments. It would also invite stakeholders with a variety of views to speak at the workshop.",
      "\u201cYesterday\u2019s event bears little resemblance to what we intended to create back in 1992 and to what the FTC has done over the years,\u201d Harrington said, noting that the public was barred from attending in person and that the FTC handpicked people who were allowed to speak and who represented only one point of view.",
      "Joe Simonson, a spokesperson for the FTC, criticized the Public Knowledge event in a phone interview.",
      "\"I looked up who funds Public Knowledge, and I see it's all big tech, and so it makes sense to me that a big tech-funded nonprofit, ostensibly devoted to copyright law, would be looking for any excuse to attack the Federal Trade Commission, even if it means standing against young men and women who say they were abused and mutilated by so-called medical professionals,\" Simonson said.",
      "He added that the workshop was not open attendance because the panelists received death threats.",
      "Regarding criticism that the workshop included only one viewpoint, Simonson said, \"Many of the panelists who appeared say they were victims of mutilation and abuse, and I don't know who is on the other side of that.\"",
      "Asked about the majority of trans people, including youths, who say they do not regret receiving treatment, Simonson said: \"We're not talking about those people. We're talking about people who were abused and mutilated.\"",
      "Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman Walker Health, a medical clinic in Washington, D.C., said he helped create Thursday\u2019s event to provide perspectives that were left out of the FTC\u2019s workshop.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to hear from the parents who are in the position of caring for their children and wanting what\u2019s best for their children,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe also wanted to hear from experts in transgender health.\u201d",
      "All major medical associations in the United States, such as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, support access to transition-related care for minors and oppose restrictions on it.",
      "Recent restrictions on trans care",
      "Some European countries have restricted access to such care, but only one, the United Kingdom, has indefinitely banned new prescriptions of puberty blockers to treat minors for gender dysphoria.",
      "Twenty-five states restrict access to puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans minors, though courts have permanently blocked restrictions from taking effect in Montana and Arkansas, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. Arizona and New Hampshire ban operations for minors, which are recommended only in rare cases. Seventeen states and Washington, D.C., have measures that protect access to transgender health care. The care is legal in an seven more states that neither protect nor ban it.",
      "No federal law restricts access to transition-related care. However, the Trump administration has sought to curtail it through a combination of executive orders and actions by federal agencies. In January, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order aiming to prohibit federal funds from going to hospitals or medical schools that provide gender-affirming care to minors, though multiple judges have blocked that part of the order.",
      "Then, in an April memo, Bondi directed U.S. attorneys to use laws against female genital mutilation to investigate doctors who \u201cmutilate\u201d children \u201cunder the guise of care\u201d and to prosecute these \u201coffenses to the fullest extent possible.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Israel believes at least some of Iran\u2019s highly enriched uranium was buried beneath Iran\u2019s Isfahan facility by U.S. strikes and not destroyed or moved beforehand, a senior Israeli government official said in Washington on Wednesday night. But it is effectively unreachable, the official said, because Israel is watching, and if it believes Iran is trying to dig up the material, it will not hesitate to conduct new strikes.",
      "Asked about Israel\u2019s conclusion regarding the uranium at Isfahan, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement: \u201cAs President Trump has said many times, Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. The entire world is safer thanks to his decisive leadership.\u201d",
      "In a lengthy briefing with reporters Wednesday night, the senior Israeli government official said Israel decided to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities because of intelligence it had that Tehran had begun rapidly and secretly proceeding to weaponize its enriched uranium after Israel\u2019s targeted assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in September.",
      "The official said that Israel had shared the intelligence with President Donald Trump but was preparing to strike with or without a green light or participation from the United States and that American support was not a condition for Israel\u2019s decision to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "The official would not specify the source of the intelligence.",
      "Iran denies that it wants to build a nuclear weapon. In an interview with NBC News a day before the U.S. strikes, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said every country has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.",
      "\u201cThis is an achievement of our own scientists. It\u2019s a question of national pride and dignity,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked about National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s having testified before Congress in March that the U.S. intelligence community \u201ccontinues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003,\u201d the Israeli official dismissed the question, viewing the assessment as not serious.",
      "According to the official, Israel believes Iran\u2019s nuclear program has now been set back up to two years.",
      "An initial assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency leaked late last month found that the U.S. strikes on Isfahan and two other sites may have set back the program only several months.",
      "The question of how damaged Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u2014 along with how much its timeline toward building a nuclear weapon should it ever decide to do so was delayed \u2014 has been a politically charged one. Trump and his administration have denounced the leak of the DIA assessment and the outlets that first reported it.",
      "The day after the initial DIA assessment was first reported, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement that \u201ca body of credible intelligence\u201d indicated the program was \u201cseverely damaged.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis includes new intelligence from an historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years,\u201d he said."

      "At least 15 people, including 10 children and two women, were killed and dozens injured by an Israeli strike while lined up outside a health clinic Thursday morning, according to Project HOPE, the organization that runs the clinic.",
      "Among those killed were children as young as 1 and 4. Video verified by NBC News of the immediate aftermath of the strike in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, showed children slumped into pools of blood and women cradling limp toddlers. The area was shrouded in smoke and dust. Many people were screaming.",
      "\u201cProject HOPE\u2019s health clinics are a place of refuge in Gaza where people bring their small children, women access pregnancy and postpartum care, people receive treatment for malnutrition, and more,\u201d Rabih Torbay, the organization's president, said in a statement. \u201cYet, this morning, innocent families were mercilessly attacked as they stood in line waiting for the doors to open.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment by NBC News, the Israel Defense Forces said that the strike targeted a member of Hamas, and that it \u201cregrets any harm to uninvolved individuals.\u201d",
      "In one scene captured on video, several bloodied children, including a girl in a pale pink princess dress, along with her twin brother, were piled onto a donkey cart to be taken to Al-Aqsa Hospital.",
      "At the hospital, NBC News' team on the ground witnessed rituals of grief. A man kissed his small, dead nephew on the head. \u201cI love you so much, my love,\u201d he said, sobbing. A woman placed a glitter tulle clip into the wispy hair of the girl in the princess dress, her chubby face still smeared with blood. A mortuary technician tidied another girl's curls that were clumped by blood, the child still in her green T-shirt printed with a cartoon panda.",
      "Several people tended to an inconsolable woman and a man doubled over as he wept into the pavement. Another woman cried about the senselessness of the killings, \u201cWhat have those children done? What is the guilt of this child to die?\u201d They were starving and just trying to get formula at the clinic, she said.",
      "According to UNICEF, which issued a statement on the strike Thursday, the 1-year-old who was killed had just spoken his first word hours earlier. His mother was injured in the blast and now lies in a hospital bed, clutching her dead baby's shoe.",
      "\u201cNo parent should have to face such tragedy,\u201d UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in the statement. \u201cThis is the cruel reality confronting many in Gaza today after months of insufficient aid being allowed into the territory, and parties to the conflict failing to uphold basic responsibilities to protect civilians.\u201d",
      "She called on Israel to \u201curgently review its rules of engagement to ensure full compliance with international humanitarian law, notably the protection of civilians, including children.\u201d",
      "According to the local Health Ministry, 82 people were confirmed to have been killed in the last 24 hours, bringing the death toll to over 57,700 since October 2023, with more than 130,000 injured. More than 50,000 of those killed and injured have been children, Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF\u2019s regional director for the Middle East and Africa, said in May.",
      "Outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, men prayed over the bodies and, in a scene now familiar, if no less heartbreaking after 20 months of war, one of them picked up a tiny bundle shrouded in white to carry the child to the cemetery."

A Reddit thread continues to spark conversations about the movie, including speculation about whether there will be a sequel. On TikTok, videos of fans re-creating dances from the film, showing off their reactions to key scenes and debuting cosplays have amassed hundreds of millions of views. There are also Wiki pages dedicated to the groups.",

But the popularity of Saja Boys and HUNTR/X has underscored something most in the music industry have known for years: K-pop and the fandoms surrounding the genre are a dominant cultural force.",
      "Since it debuted on June 20, the film has been streamed by 33 million people, Netflix said, helping it rank among the platform\u2019s top 10 movies in the 93 countries that are tracked. Billboard said this week that the film\u2019s score is now the highest-charting soundtrack of 2025 and that it has surpassed Disney\u2019s \u201cEncanto\u201d to become the highest-charting soundtrack to an animated film. Hits from the film, such as \u201cYour Idol\u201d and \u201cGolden,\u201d have also topped the U.S. Spotify charts in the K-pop categories in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cWe go through, like, crying and happy and laughing,\u201d Maggie Kang, a director of the film, said in a recent interview. \u201cThis whole last couple of weeks have just been like an emotional roller coaster, but in the best way.\u201d",
      "The film centers on HUNTR/X band members Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong) and Zoey (Ji-young Yoo), who are tasked with maintaining a barrier to keep demons out of the human world through their music. The barrier can become permanent only once all demons are wiped from the human world, which becomes a core part of the plot.",
      "As the group gears up to complete its final challenge, a new plot is hatched by a demon named Jinu (Ahn Hyo-seop), who creates a rival group called The Saja Boys to harness energy from fans and weaken the barriers between the worlds. His goal is to feed the human souls to the demon ruler, Gwi-ma, and put an end to HUNTR/X\u2019s demon-eradication mission.",
      "Because music is such a vital part of the film, Kang and fellow director Chris Appelhans used the knowledge of K-Pop gurus.",
      "\u201cThe film features songs written by Danny Chung, IDO, Vince, KUSH, EJAE, Jenna Andrews, Stephen Kirk, Lindgren, Mark Sonnenblick, and Daniel Rojas. Plus, Marcelo Zarvos wrote the score,\u201d according to Netflix\u2019s editorial site, Tudum. \u201cMusic producers include Teddy Park, 24, IDO, DOMINSUK, Jenna Andrews, Stephen Kirk, Lindgren, and Ian Eisendrath. Meanwhile, original songs are performed by EJAE, Audrey Nuna, REI AMI, Andrew Choi, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo, samUIL Lee, Neckwav, and Lea Salonga. The film\u2019s soundtrack also features an original song performed by Jeongyeon, Jihyo, and Chaeyoung of TWICE.\u201d",
      "But believe it or not, the film wasn\u2019t always going to revolve around K-pop, Kang said.",
      "\u201cInitially, it was just a demon hunter idea, because I was looking for a project that would showcase Korean culture,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I somehow just landed in demonology.\u201d",
      "Kang said the concept of demon-hunting \u201ckind of naturally led to K-pop\u201d because \u201cdemon hunting is usually done privately\u201d and the characters she imagined would be fighting the demons \u201cneeded a public facing front.\u201d",
      "Kang said that about nine years ago, around the time she was first brainstorming her idea, BTS was very popular.",
      "\u201cAnd a lot of studios were trying to figure out a K-pop idea and K-pop IP,\u201d or intellectual property, she said. \u201cAnd no one had really cracked that nut yet. And oddly, when I put those two things together [demon hunting and K-pop], it was really fun. It became a musical.\u201d",
      "Kang and Appelhans wrote the script with Danya Jimenez and Hannah McMechan. Kang said that as the idea evolved into a musical featuring two rival K-pop groups, she faced her biggest hurdle: preventing the story from being too much like a traditional musical.",
      "\u201cThe most challenging thing about the songwriting was that it had to be progressing the story, but also we could never lose the pop part of it,\u201d Kang said. \u201cSo once it became a little too, like, traditional musical, we would send it back to those songwriters and say, like, you know, we\u2019re losing that kind of cool, pop factor.\u201d",
      "Their efforts paid off, with the songs continuing to strike a chord with fans online.",

Plus, Amazon is constantly adding new discounts, including fresh Lightning Deals. Just don\u2019t wait too long to shop. Some of the most popular items are already selling out, and with many deals lasting only a day or two, prices can jump without warning.",

Every deal below is at least 20% off, highly rated and at its lowest price in at least three months. I\u2019ll update this list live throughout Prime Day so you don\u2019t miss a thing.",

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Most Prime Day deals last through the duration of the sale (it ends on Jul. 11), but some are limited-time offers. For example, Lightning Deals are typically a few hours long \u2014 once a product sells out, the deal is over. Amazon is adding new deals each day of the sale, so make sure you\u2019re constantly browsing. It\u2019s also important to check out as soon as you see something you want since prices can go up any time.",
      "For the first time ever this year, Amazon Prime Day is four days long. It\u2019s typically a 48-hour event, so you have double the amount of time to shop this year.",
      "Prime Day 2025 ends on Friday, Jul. 11 at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time (2:59 a.m. ET on Saturday, Jul. 12).",
      "Amazon has not announced when the next Prime Day is. For the past few years, the retailer hosted its Prime Big Deal Days in October, which is nearly identical to July\u2019s sale with slightly different products on sale to focus more on the holiday shopping season.",
      "How I found the best Prime Day deals",
      "All of my recommendations above are based on NBC Select\u2019s previous coverage and reporting. I also included products the NBC Select staff tested, including Wellness Award and Giftable Tech Award winners. I ran each deal through price trackers like CamelCamelCamel to ensure products are at their lowest price in at least three months. All the products I recommend are 20% off or more, and highly rated with at least a 4.0-star average rating from hundreds of reviews.",
      "Why trust NBC Select?",
      "I\u2019m a reporter for NBC Select who has covered Amazon Prime Day since 2020. In addition to writing about the best deals, I also wrote about what\u2019s included in a Prime membership, the history of Prime Day and what to buy and skip this year. Prior to Amazon\u2019s flagship sale, I previewed a list of deals from the retailer and sorted through them to find worthwhile sales you should know about.",

    "summary": "Israel believes at least some of Iran\u2019s highly enriched uranium was buried by U.S. strikes and not destroyed or moved beforehand.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Israel believes at least some of Iran\u2019s highly enriched uranium was buried beneath Iran\u2019s Isfahan facility by U.S. strikes and not destroyed or moved beforehand, a senior Israeli government official said in Washington on Wednesday night. But it is effectively unreachable, the official said, because Israel is watching, and if it believes Iran is trying to dig up the material, it will not hesitate to conduct new strikes.",
      "Asked about Israel\u2019s conclusion regarding the uranium at Isfahan, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement: \u201cAs President Trump has said many times, Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. The entire world is safer thanks to his decisive leadership.\u201d",
      "In a lengthy briefing with reporters Wednesday night, the senior Israeli government official said Israel decided to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities because of intelligence it had that Tehran had begun rapidly and secretly proceeding to weaponize its enriched uranium after Israel\u2019s targeted assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in September.",
      "The official said that Israel had shared the intelligence with President Donald Trump but was preparing to strike with or without a green light or participation from the United States and that American support was not a condition for Israel\u2019s decision to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "The official would not specify the source of the intelligence.",
      "Iran denies that it wants to build a nuclear weapon. In an interview with NBC News a day before the U.S. strikes, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said every country has the right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes.",
      "\u201cThis is an achievement of our own scientists. It\u2019s a question of national pride and dignity,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked about National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s having testified before Congress in March that the U.S. intelligence community \u201ccontinues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003,\u201d the Israeli official dismissed the question, viewing the assessment as not serious.",
      "According to the official, Israel believes Iran\u2019s nuclear program has now been set back up to two years.",
      "An initial assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency leaked late last month found that the U.S. strikes on Isfahan and two other sites may have set back the program only several months.",
      "The question of how damaged Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u2014 along with how much its timeline toward building a nuclear weapon should it ever decide to do so was delayed \u2014 has been a politically charged one. Trump and his administration have denounced the leak of the DIA assessment and the outlets that first reported it.",
      "The day after the initial DIA assessment was first reported, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement that \u201ca body of credible intelligence\u201d indicated the program was \u201cseverely damaged.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis includes new intelligence from an historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years,\u201d he said."

      "Justin Bieber is sending fans into a frenzy after sharing a series of intimate family portraits on his Instagram stories along with clues of an imminent album drop.",
      "On Thursday, the pop star posted predominantly black-and-white images that show Justin Bieber, 31, and his wife posing with their son, Jack Blues Bieber.",
      "In one photo, Hailey Bieber, 28, leans into her husband, resting her chin on his chest while her eyes are closed.",
      "Another shows Hailey Bieber carrying their son on her hip as she heads toward the interior of a shed while Justin Bieber stands outside pointing to the ground.",
      "Each of the photos is paired with different tracks that hint at a possible layered meaning. The songs range from Chief Keef\u2019s \u201cFaneto\u201d to Marvin Sapp\u2019s \u201cNever Would Have Made It.\u201d",
      "And that wasn\u2019t all Justin Bieber was sharing. He also posted an image of a Times Square billboard that appears to contain a track list from what many believe (and hope and pray) is from a new album. Some of the song titles include \u201cAll I Can Take, \u201cTherapy Session\u201d and \u201cForgiveness.\u201d If he is releasing a new album, it would be his first since 2021.",
      "The singer\u2019s fans were quick to react in the comments.",

      "Justin Bieber\u2019s posts also arrive amid ongoing speculation that he and his wife are facing challenges in their relationship.",
      "In a May interview with Vogue, Hailey Bieber addressed the rumors and the stress they have caused her since giving birth to their son.",
      "\u201cTo be doing that all the while going on the internet every day and people being like, \u2018They\u2019re getting divorced\u2019 and they\u2019re this and \u2018They\u2019re not happy.\u2019 It is such a mindf--k. I cannot even begin to explain it. It\u2019s a crazy life to live,\u201d she said.",
      "Hailey Bieber also touched on feeling misunderstood by the public, noting, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve fought so hard to try to get people to understand me, or know who I am, or see me for me. And people just don\u2019t want to sometimes.\u201d",
      "She went on to comment, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do about that. I\u2019ve been in a position where I\u2019ve tried to tell my side of a story or correct a narrative or tell the truth of a lie, and then they go, \u2018Well, she\u2019s lying.\u2019 Imagine how trapping that feels.\u201d",
      "The magazine included emailed quotes from Justin Bieber applauding his wife for handling the public attention she receives with grace.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s in the spotlight, and has the attention because of her effortless knack for style, business, art, and fashion. And the way she makes being a mom and wife look easy,\u201d he commented."

      "\"Instead of working with the United States, Canada retaliated with its own Tariffs,\" Trump wrote in the letter shared on Truth Social. \"Starting August 1, 2025, we will charge Canada a Tariff of 35% on Canadian products sent into the United States, separate from all Sectoral Tariffs.\"",
      "Until this escalation, Canadian imports that did not fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, which Trump negotiated in his first term, faced a tariff of 25%. Energy imports from Canada faced tariffs of 10%.",
      "Trump told NBC News in an interview earlier Thursday that he would announce a new tariff rate for Canada before the end of the week.",
      "Canada is one of the United States' top trading partners, with more than $410 billion of goods crossing into the country last year.  However, the two countries have had a fraught trading relationship since Prime Minister Mark Carney took office in March.",
      "In late June, Trump announced he had terminated all trade talks with Canada, citing its digital services tax, which was set to be imposed by June 30.",

      "Trump called the digital services tax an \"attack\" on the United States and its tech giants. The tax would have applied to any tech firm making more than $15 million from Canadian internet users. A lobby group for some large U.S. tech companies said it would have forced them to pay as much as $3 billion on June 30.",
      "In his social media post Thursday night, Trump said that if Canada retaliates again, the United States will hike the 35% tariff higher.",
      "Canada\u2019s top trade negotiator and its ambassador to the United States said this week that Canadian and American teams were in near-daily contact and working toward an agreement.",
      "\"If Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl, we will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter,\" Trump wrote at the end of his letter. \"You will never be disappointed with the United States of America.\"",

      "U.S. stock futures immediately slid on Trump\u2019s post, with the S&P 500 index indicated to drop about a half-percent at Friday's opening bell. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were set to drop more than 200 points."

      "\u201cAfter having seen this horrible event, I would imagine you\u2019d put alarms up in some form, where alarms would go up if they see any large amounts of water or whatever it is,\u201d Trump told NBC News\u2019 \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker in a phone interview Thursday.",
      "\u201cBut the local officials were hit by this just like everybody else,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump will visit Texas on Friday, a week after the deadly flooding in Kerr County and other parts of the region, when the Guadalupe River surged to almost 30 feet in Hunt on July 4. That was higher than a 1987 flood disaster on the same river.",
      "Among those confirmed or feared dead are 27 children and counselors at Camp Mystic in Hunt.",
      "Kerr County did not have audible flood alarms to warn residents.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott bristled at a reporter\u2019s question this week about who was to blame for the scope of the disaster and the deaths, saying \"that's the word choice of losers.\"",
      "Trump said Thursday that \u201cnobody ever saw a thing like this coming\u201d and that \u201cthis is a once-in-every-200-year deal.\u201d",
      "\"It\u2019d be easy to blame them. I wouldn\u2019t blame them,\" Trump said. \"I think from the standpoint of the future, you\u2019d have to have some kind of an alarm and lighting system, maybe.\"",
      "Trump also defended Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's response.",
      "Trump has talked about possibly \"getting rid of\" FEMA. NBC News reported this week that Noem now requires that all agency spending over $100,000 be personally approved by her.",
      "On Monday, FEMA officials created a task force to speed up the process of getting Noem\u2019s approval, according to the reporting, which cited two people familiar with that unit.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know anything about it,\" Trump said when he was asked about the reporting and whether that delayed FEMA's response.",
      "\"We were right on time. We were there \u2014 in fact, she was the first one I saw on television,\" he said. \"She was there right from the beginning, and she would not have needed anything. She had the right to do it, but she was literally the first person I saw on television.\"",
      "Trump said Noem \"was right on the ball\" and has \"done a great job.\"",
      "In Texas on Thursday, the search for the missing continued. Search-and-rescue operations along the Guadalupe River have shifted to a recovery phase.",
      "There were 120 people confirmed dead and 173 people missing Wednesday evening, officials said. Among the 120, 96 of the confirmed dead were in Kerr County, 36 of them children.",
      "Trump said that during Friday's visit, he will express how much \"I love those people.\"",
      "\"Those people were with me right from the beginning, and it\u2019s just a message of warmth, and I feel so terribly for them,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said Thursday he plans to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on most trade partners, dismissing concerns that further tariffs could negatively affect the stock market or drive inflation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it\u2019s 20% or 15%. We\u2019ll work that out now,\u201d Trump told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker in a phone call. Blanket tariffs are currently set at 10%.",
      "\u201cI think the tariffs have been very well-received. The stock market hit a new high today,\u201d Trump added.",
      "The S&P 500 closed at a record high Thursday, but that comes after a tumultuous few months for the U.S. stock market. After Trump announced his first wave of global tariffs on April 2, the S&P 500 experienced one of its fastest 20% drops on record over the following days.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Trump on Thursday also dismissed warnings from Hasbro\u2019s CEO that toy prices could rise later this year as a result of tariffs.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the numbers, inflation\u2019s gone down,\u201d Trump said, later adding that Hasbro did not warn him its CEO was going to mention rising prices on a podcast.",
      "According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, inflation has eased in recent years since the Covid pandemic but remains above 2.3%.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t hear anything about Hasbro. I don\u2019t care about their prices,\u201d Trump said, adding later, \u201cBut if they make their toys here, if they made their toys here, they wouldn\u2019t have a price increase.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s trade agenda has stalled in recent weeks as administration officials continue to insist that he is working on dozens of agreements with foreign nations.",
      "This week, Trump publicized letters to 22 countries establishing tariff rates, including 50% tariffs on imports from Brazil. He also announced a 50% tariff on copper imports that is scheduled to take effect next month.",
      "The dozens of letters come after repeated promises of \u201c90 deals in 90 days\u201d dating to April from Trump and his top officials. However, the administration did not sign any trading deals during that 90-day period. The White House and the secretaries of treasury and commerce instead reached three frameworks that could eventually be turned into full-fledged trade deals.",
      "\u201cNot everybody has to get a letter. You know that. We\u2019re just setting our tariffs,\u201d Trump told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "But he added that the members of the European Union and Canada would get letters notifying them of new tariff rates \u201ctoday or tomorrow.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to do it today,\u201d Trump said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m talking European Union, which is, as you know, many countries, and Canada. We\u2019ll be putting them out over the next couple of hours.\u201d",
      "Shortly after speaking with NBC News, Trump announced that he would apply a 35% tariff to Canadian imports starting next month, escalating a trade war that had recently shown signs of receding.",
      "The 27 nations that make up the European Union are the United States\u2019 largest trading partner. American companies and consumers imported more than $600 billion worth of goods from the E.U. last year. Canada also ranks as one of the most important trading relationships for the United States, with more than $400 billion worth of Canadian goods imported into the country last year.",
      "Speaking Wednesday before the European Parliament, the E.U.\u2019s top trade official, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said negotiations were happening between the two sides \u201cevery single day\u201d to avoid getting one of Trump\u2019s tariff letters.",
      "\u201cCrucially, while other nations faced increased tariffs from the United States, the result of the letters that President Trump sent out on Monday, our negotiations have spared the E.U. from facing higher tariffs,\u201d he said.",
      "The E.U. has more than $100 billion of retaliatory tariffs on standby that can be implemented quickly. Some of the retaliatory duties target goods made in red states, such as soybeans from House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s home state, Louisiana, and bourbon from Kentucky.",
      "\u2018A major statement\u2019 on Russia",
      "Trump also spoke about the status of Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine, telling NBC News, \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in Russia, but we\u2019ll see what happens over the next couple of weeks.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think I\u2019ll have a major statement to make on Russia on Monday,\u201d he said, declining to elaborate.",
      "He also revealed the details of what he said was a new deal among the United States, NATO and Ukraine over the shipment of weapons from the United States.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sending weapons to NATO, and NATO is paying for those weapons, 100%. So what we\u2019re doing is the weapons that are going out are going to NATO, and then NATO is going to be giving those weapons [to Ukraine], and NATO is paying for those weapons,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He added that the deal was reached at a NATO summit last month.",
      "\u201cWe send weapons to NATO, and NATO is going to reimburse the full cost of those weapons,\u201d Trump said.",
      "It was unclear whether Trump was referring to an idea that has recently been floated of some NATO members\u2019 potentially buying U.S.-made weapons on behalf of Ukraine so the United States does not have to shoulder the cost.",
      "Trump restarted the shipment of U.S. weapons to Ukraine this week after the Defense Department this month held up a scheduled shipment of weapons to the country at war with Russia.",
      "The pause, ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, appeared to catch many in the Trump administration, including State Department officials, by surprise.",
      "Asked Thursday about that weapons pause, Trump said, \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d He added that Hegseth is \u201cdoing a great job.\u201d",
      "Trump has publicly expressed his disapproval of Russian President Vladimir Putin. On Wednesday, Russia unleashed a deadly strike and missile attack on Kyiv, appearing defiant against Trump\u2019s warnings.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has for months been pushing GOP leaders, including Trump, to move on a bill he introduced that would impose new sanctions on Russia. In recent days, Graham signaled that the bill now has support from both Trump and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he expected the Senate to pass the sanctions measure. \u201cIt\u2019s a bill that the Senate is passing that very respectfully lets the president do whatever he wants, as you know,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIn other words, it\u2019s at my option if I want to use it. They\u2019re going to pass a very major and very biting sanctions bill, but it\u2019s up to the president as to whether or not he wants to exercise it,\u201d he added.",
      "Selling the One Big Beautiful Bill",
      "Trump also spoke about whether he plans to travel across the country in the wake of congressional Republicans\u2019 passing a massive domestic policy package \u2014 dubbed the \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act\u201d \u2014 saying he would travel \u201ca little bit.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut honestly, it\u2019s been received so well I don\u2019t think I have to,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump signed the bill into law on Independence Day after months of negotiations among the president, congressional GOP leaders and rank-and-file Republican lawmakers.",
      "The day the House passed the final version of the bill, sending it to Trump\u2019s desk, he touted its passage at a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, that was billed as a kickoff to the celebration of the United States\u2019 250th birthday next year.",
      "The law extends the tax cuts passed and signed by Trump during his first term, in 2017, and imposes new temporary tax cuts on tips and overtime pay. It also provides hundreds of billions of dollars in new spending for border security and the military while imposing steep cuts to Medicaid, federal nutrition assistance programs and clean energy funding.",
      "Democrats, who are looking to flip the House and the Senate back to their control during the 2026 midterm elections, have already seized on GOP lawmakers\u2019 votes for the bill in battleground states and districts.",
      "Trump dismissed concerns Thursday that Democrats could sway voters in their favor by highlighting the package\u2019s cuts to Medicaid and other programs in the social safety net.",
      "\u201cThey said that about 2024, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve lost their minds, and they\u2019ve lost their way.\u201d",
      "Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin appeared on local and national news programs across the country this week, telling voters that their Republican representatives \u201cbetrayed\u201d them by voting for the bill.",
      "\u201cThis is, as I call it, the big, beautiful betrayal. All Republicans, every single one of them, put their oath to Donald Trump ahead of the oath to their constituents that they were elected by,\u201d Martin told \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d on Wednesday."

      "U.S. diplomats in Washington are bracing for cuts to the State Department workforce, with dismissal notices expected to hit inboxes as soon as Friday, according to three State Department officials with knowledge of the plans. The layoffs are part of a mass reorganization of the federal agency, including the dissolution or merging of more than 300 bureaus and offices and a 15% reduction in employees.",
      "\u201cIn April, the Secretary announced the largest reorganization of the Department in decades,\u201d Michael Rigas, the deputy secretary of state for management and resources, wrote in an email sent to all agency employees Thursday evening. \u201cThe objective from the start was clear: focus resources on policy priorities and eliminate redundant functions, empowering our people while increasing accountability.\u201d",
      "Rigas said the terminations would be issued to affected employees soon, adding, \u201cFirst and foremost, we want to thank them for their dedication and service to the United States.\u201d",
      "The restructuring has been in the works for months, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio notifying Congress in late May that as many as 1,800 U.S.-based workers would be cut from the approximately 19,000 employed by the State Department. More than 1,500 additional employees at the department took the Trump administration\u2019s offer of deferred resignations, which will carry their salaries and health care benefits through September.",
      "Rubio said he was proud of the way the Trump administration had undertaken a reorganization that was arguably \u201cthe most deliberate way of anyone that\u2019s done one.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe reduction of force is a consequence of the reorg. It\u2019s not a consequence of trying to get rid of people,\u201d Rubio told reporters Thursday at a media availability session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. \u201cBut if you\u2019ve closed the bureau, you don\u2019t need those positions.\u201d",
      "A federal judge in California had temporarily halted the terminations, but the Supreme Court ruled this week that the Trump administration\u2019s plans to overhaul the agency could move forward. The back-and-forth between the White House and the courts left thousands of civil servants and foreign service officers in limbo and unable to plan for their futures.",
      "One civil servant told NBC News on Thursday that she would welcome the ordeal\u2019s finally being over. \u201cWe have known since the start it was coming. It was just a matter of when,\u201d the diplomat said. \u201cEvery Friday morning, I wake up with dread. At least now we can move on.\u201d",
      "Asked about the resulting low morale at the State Department, a senior department official said the delays were unfortunate but outside of their control.",
      "\u201cThe courts have delayed this reorganization, kept this uncertainty, unfortunately, over the workforce,\u201d the senior official said. \u201cThat was not our intent. We want to move forward with this expeditiously, but obviously the administration has complied with all the court orders and injunctions.\u201d",
      "Two former senior career State Department diplomats told NBC News they were concerned about the collective loss of experience resulting from people\u2019s taking early retirement and the impact of the layoffs on future recruitment for the diplomatic corps.",
      "A senior State Department official said they were looking at how the agency recruits and retains talent as part of an executive order but that the federal hiring freeze was still in place.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce praised the work of diplomats in the building for their commitment and patriotism but said the decision was not about the individual being targeted but about the need to reform a bureaucracy that has become too large to function.",
      "\u201cThis is about making sure that the State Department is able to operate in a manner that makes it relevant and effective. That is what the American people want. It\u2019s what all of us want, and in this dynamic, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re achieving,\u201d Bruce said Thursday.",
      "NBC News had reported that the State Department was conducting a review of U.S. missions overseas, including the potential closure of both consulates and embassies. But a senior State Department official said there are no plans for further cuts \u2014 for now.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any plans for that right now, but I think just good practice means a constant review and evaluation of how we\u2019re doing our job,\u201d the senior official said."

      "Among them was Eileen Harrington, who worked for the FTC for nearly 40 years and was its executive director from 2010 to 2012. She said that, through the workshop, the \u201cFTC engaged in a kind of overreach that we haven\u2019t seen for over 50 years.\u201d",
      "Harrington helped develop the FTC\u2019s workshop process in 1992 when she was director of the division of marketing practices. Before a workshop, she said, the FTC would issue a public statement about the topic and then invite the public to submit comments. It would also invite stakeholders with a variety of views to speak at the workshop.",
      "\u201cYesterday\u2019s event bears little resemblance to what we intended to create back in 1992 and to what the FTC has done over the years,\u201d Harrington said, noting that the public was barred from attending in person and that the FTC handpicked people who were allowed to speak and who represented only one point of view.",
      "Joe Simonson, a spokesperson for the FTC, criticized the Public Knowledge event in a phone interview.",
      "\"I looked up who funds Public Knowledge, and I see it's all big tech, and so it makes sense to me that a big tech-funded nonprofit, ostensibly devoted to copyright law, would be looking for any excuse to attack the Federal Trade Commission, even if it means standing against young men and women who say they were abused and mutilated by so-called medical professionals,\" Simonson said.",
      "He added that the workshop was not open attendance because the panelists received death threats.",
      "Regarding criticism that the workshop included only one viewpoint, Simonson said, \"Many of the panelists who appeared say they were victims of mutilation and abuse, and I don't know who is on the other side of that.\"",
      "Asked about the majority of trans people, including youths, who say they do not regret receiving treatment, Simonson said: \"We're not talking about those people. We're talking about people who were abused and mutilated.\"",
      "Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman Walker Health, a medical clinic in Washington, D.C., said he helped create Thursday\u2019s event to provide perspectives that were left out of the FTC\u2019s workshop.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to hear from the parents who are in the position of caring for their children and wanting what\u2019s best for their children,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe also wanted to hear from experts in transgender health.\u201d",
      "All major medical associations in the United States, such as the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association, support access to transition-related care for minors and oppose restrictions on it.",
      "Recent restrictions on trans care",
      "Some European countries have restricted access to such care, but only one, the United Kingdom, has indefinitely banned new prescriptions of puberty blockers to treat minors for gender dysphoria.",
      "Twenty-five states restrict access to puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans minors, though courts have permanently blocked restrictions from taking effect in Montana and Arkansas, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. Arizona and New Hampshire ban operations for minors, which are recommended only in rare cases. Seventeen states and Washington, D.C., have measures that protect access to transgender health care. The care is legal in an seven more states that neither protect nor ban it.",
      "No federal law restricts access to transition-related care. However, the Trump administration has sought to curtail it through a combination of executive orders and actions by federal agencies. In January, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order aiming to prohibit federal funds from going to hospitals or medical schools that provide gender-affirming care to minors, though multiple judges have blocked that part of the order.",
      "Then, in an April memo, Bondi directed U.S. attorneys to use laws against female genital mutilation to investigate doctors who \u201cmutilate\u201d children \u201cunder the guise of care\u201d and to prosecute these \u201coffenses to the fullest extent possible.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A scroll through Aurora McCausland\u2019s wildly popular social media accounts \u2014 she has more than 300,000 followers across TikTok and Instagram \u2014 shows an active young mom dancing, cleaning and tackling major renovation projects in her Utah home.",
      "Behind the scenes, though, is a painful reality: McCausland has lipedema, a progressive and debilitating disease that causes fat in connective tissue to build up disproportionately, most often in the legs, ankles and hips.",
      "She said her legs throb with pain, swell unpredictably and feel heavy, like they\u2019re filled with cement. It\u2019s a major source of frustration for the mother of two young children. Standing up can cause her to black out.",
      "\u201cThings that I feel like I should be able to do cause pain pretty quickly, and then I kind of have to tap out,\u201d said McCausland, 30, of West Valley City, Utah. \u201cGetting down to play with my kids is really hard.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s tried to manage the pain with compression garments, lymphatic drainage and anti-inflammatory diets.",
      "\u201cThose are helpful at potentially slowing down the disease,\u201d her physician, Dr. David Smart, said. \u201cBut really, only surgery helps to reverse the disease process.\u201d",
      "Smart is a dermatologic surgeon at the Roxbury Institute in Murray, Utah. He performs a specialized type of liposuction that removes the diseased tissue to restore mobility.",
      "The procedure isn\u2019t cosmetic, and despite the buildup of fat, lipedema isn\u2019t related to obesity. It\u2019s not caused by overeating or inactivity. It\u2019s a hormonally driven inflammatory condition, one that\u2019s largely resistant to diet and exercise.",
      "\u201cIt goes against the more traditional health dogma that\u2019s out there about normal fat,\u201d Smart said.",
      "Lipedema is almost exclusively seen in women, but scientists don\u2019t have a good handle on how many are affected. Some estimates suggest it may affect up to 11% of women.",
      "\u201cThere are no large-scale, population-based epidemiologic estimates. We don\u2019t have blood tests. We don\u2019t have imaging studies,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Aday, co-director of vascular medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Denied relief",
      "Many women first notice symptoms of lipedema at puberty, and the disease often worsens during major hormonal shifts like pregnancy or menopause.",
      "McCausland said her symptoms first appeared during her early teens: leg pain, swelling and bruising from the slightest touch. \u201cI thought it was just growing pains,\u201d she said. Fat built up around her ankles. No matter how physically active she was \u2014 dancing and CrossFit were two hobbies \u2014 she couldn\u2019t make the fat in her lower legs go away.",
      "Still, she was told it was just excess weight. \u201cThat if I worked out more, ate less, it would go away,\u201d she said. \u201cBut no matter what I did, my legs just hurt more. I was doing everything right and getting worse.\u201d",
      "If you are dealing with bills that seem to be out of line or a denial of coverage, care or repairs, whether for health, home or auto, please email us at Costofdenial@nbcuni.com.",
      "McCausland\u2019s five sisters experienced similar symptoms. She said none knew what the problem was until one of the sisters got liposuction to slim down her lower legs.",
      "But lipedema fat isn\u2019t the same as typical fat. Instead of feeling soft, it can feel like hard nodules under the skin. Regular liposuction can be risky to use on lipedema patients.",
      "It took far longer than it should have for her sister\u2019s doctor to do the procedure, McCausland said.",
      "\u201cThe doctor ended up giving her third-degree internal burns all on her legs, because he didn\u2019t know that it wasn\u2019t normal fat. He just kept going, having to go over and over and over trying to remove it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just this horrible thing that happened. Obviously the doctor had no idea that she had this condition, and neither did my sister.\u201d",
      "Aday \u2014 who hasn\u2019t treated McCausland \u2014 said that a specialized type of liposuction, performed by a surgeon with extensive knowledge of lipedema, is the most effective way to treat the disorder. It can reverse symptoms in many people. Some patients, he said, may have to have the procedure repeated.",
      "The Roxbury Institute said that McCausland would need two liposuction surgeries, totaling more than $35,000. But her former insurance provider, Cigna Healthcare, denied coverage for the procedure twice.",
      "In an emailed statement, a Cigna representative said: \u201cLipedema is a painful condition that disproportionately impacts women, and we cover a range of treatment options, including liposuction, for patients that meet evidence-based clinical criteria. Ms. McCausland\u2019s case was carefully reviewed by multiple doctors, including a plastic surgeon with expertise in lipedema. Based on the information submitted by her doctor, she did not meet the clinical criteria for liposuction at that time.\u201d",
      "McCausland believes her coverage was denied because she didn\u2019t look sick enough, adding that she suspects the denial was based on her social media posts.",
      "They said \u201cthat it\u2019s not medically necessary,\u201d McCausland said. \u201cThat\u2019s absurd. They\u2019re not looking at how I live. They\u2019re looking at a photo and deciding I don\u2019t look bad enough to be helped.\u201d",
      "Cigna told NBC News that social media isn\u2019t considered when it makes coverage decisions. \u201cOur coverage decisions are based on the clinical information submitted by a patient\u2019s treating physician in accordance with coverage policies and the patient\u2019s plan design,\u201d the representative said.",
      "McCausland\u2019s health insurance has since switched to MotivHealth, because of her husband\u2019s new job. McCausland said MotivHealth has already suggested to her in a phone call that it\u2019s not a procedure it usually covers but that she can submit additional documentation. A representative for the company didn\u2019t respond to several requests for comment.",
      "A long under-recognized disease",
      "Lipedema is categorized in four stages, based on visual appearance. Stage 1 looks like minor fat accumulation and Stage 4 appears as severe leg disfigurement. Appearance, however, doesn\u2019t always match the severity of symptoms.",
      "\u201cYou can have a Stage 1 patient that has very severe and crippling symptoms of pain and swelling, and somebody who is maybe more progressed visibly that doesn\u2019t have such severe symptoms,\u201d Smart said.",
      "McCausland is a prime example. She doesn\u2019t look sick, according to some commenters on her social media videos.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve gotten a handful of people saying, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve looked at your other videos, and I agree with your insurance company,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThis is very likely the reason why lipedema has been so under-recognized for such a long time,\u201d Smart said. \u201cSo many people, so many insurance companies, so many physicians, have been telling lipedema patients for decades to just \u2018work out, eat better, lose weight,\u2019 when that\u2019s not actually the problem.\u201d",
      "He said waiting until the condition progresses is dangerous. Without treatment, lipedema advances, causing more inflammation, worsening pain and permanent joint damage. The longer surgery is delayed, the harder it is to restore mobility in later stages.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really unfortunate for Aurora, because at that early stage, it is less likely that she gets insurance coverage,\u201d Smart said. \u201cThey\u2019re not looking at the severity of her symptoms. They\u2019re not looking at the severity of her pain, the decrease in mobility, her lack of ability to be able to perform those daily activities of living.\u201d",
      "Jonathan Kartt, chief executive officer of the Lipedema Foundation, said that the pain experienced by women with lipedema can be measured objectively.",
      "Using a tool to measure how patients perceive stimuli like temperature and touch, researchers in Germany found that women with lipedema had a lower pain threshold compared with other women. The pain was specific to areas affected by the disease.",
      "\u201cThe differences were so stark,\u201d Kartt said, that it\u2019s possible to use \u201cthis test to actually diagnose or confirm a diagnosis of lipedema.\u201d",
      "Aday, of Vanderbilt, is leading an effort to create a national biobank of information on lipedema patients. The team takes blood samples and urine, as well as fat and skin biopsies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s meant to be a living research resource,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want other investigators to use these data, build upon it and generate new data.\u201d",
      "There is also growing excitement in the lipedema field to see whether the blockbuster GLP-1 drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy, might be useful. The drugs are mainly used to treat Type 2 diabetes and obesity, but have been shown to provide benefits for other diseases. Aday is working to secure funding for such a study."

      "The shadow 2028 primary gains momentum",
      "It might be way too early to be thinking about the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. But potential contenders are already jockeying to boost their profiles and their campaign coffers.",
      "Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., is the latest potential contender to boast a strong fundraising report, announcing today that he raised a whopping $10 million through his Senate campaign and a joint fundraising committee after his marathon speech on the Senate floor in April.",
      "As a reminder, Booker did not rule out another presidential run during an April appearance on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d saying he\u2019s focused on his 2026 re-election race. He also told NBC News\u2019 Julie Tsirkin today that he hopes the big fundraising haul \u201ccan scare away competition in New Jersey and I can do what I\u2019ve done in previous cycles, which is help as many other people as I can.\u201d",
      "Fundraising reports for the second quarter are due to the Federal Election Commission next week, so we\u2019ll see how other potential presidential hopefuls are faring. Some high-profile progressives like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted some big numbers in the first quarter of the year.",

      "President Donald Trump keeps expecting powerful sovereign nations to bend to his will, and they continue to disappoint.",
      "With a presidential term under his belt already, and a lifetime of cutting business deals, he should have seen that coming.",
      "While the U.S. is the biggest kid on the international playground, it is not powerful enough to override the national interests of other major players. U.S. views are a factor in their decisions, but not the only factor \u2014 and usually not the most important factor.",
      "That\u2019s especially true at a time when the people of many nations, including neighbors Canada and Mexico, see the U.S. as both their top ally and the top threat, according to new survey data from the Pew Research Center.",
      "If Trump is learning the limits of American dominance, he\u2019s doing so the hard way. The most obvious examples are on twin pillars of foreign policy: war and trade.",
      "Trump famously vowed during his campaign that he would resolve the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office. It\u2019s been nearly six months, and there is no sign of progress toward peace. That has Trump on the warpath.",
      "He vented about Vladimir Putin on Wednesday, accusing the Russian president of selling \u201cbulls---\u201d to American negotiators. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with Putin,\u201d Trump said. Russia launched massive strikes on Ukraine on Thursday anyway.",
      "A few months ago, Trump said his administration would sign 90 trade deals in 90 days. That hasn\u2019t happened.",
      "He\u2019s got frameworks for agreements with China and the U.K., but those modest advances have not stopped him from issuing more threats to impose tariffs on foreign goods. Though he has kicked the can down the road a few times, he insists that won\u2019t happen again when his latest deadline arrives in August.",
      "The risk that tariffs will backfire by jacking up prices on U.S. consumers is high, and foreign countries are free to trade with one another at the expense of Americans\u2019 access to goods.",
      "The world will have to wait and see whether Trump actually takes that plunge.",

      "\u201cI read a lot of messages saying you want an album. I\u2019ve toured my whole teenage life, and early 20s,\u201d he began. \u201cI realized and as you guys probably saw I was unhappy last tour and I don\u2019t deserve that and you don\u2019t deserve that, you pay money to come and have a lively energetic fun light concert and I was unable emotionally to give you that near the end of the tour.\u201d",
      "After releasing \u201cJustice,\u201d he canceled the rest of the North American leg of his tour in June 2022 after sharing that he was suffering from Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a rare disorder caused by a virus that affects the facial nerve and can lead to paralysis.",
      "The pop star continued touring shortly after, performing six shows in Europe and one in Brazil. However, he then announced he would be taking a break from touring.",
      "Bieber has since made various surprise appearances at concerts, most recently in May 2025, when the singer made a rare stage appearance at SZA\u2019s Los Angeles concert at SoFi Stadium to perform their song \u201cSnooze\" together."

    "summary": "Nikki Bella speaks with TODAY.com about her involvement in the WWE Evolution battle royal, the original plan for her and Liv Morgan, and how being a mother to son Matteo is inspiring her comeback.",
    "story": [
      "In October 2018, Nikki Bella was one of the featured superstars in a historic WWE event called Evolution. It was the company\u2019s first all-women's pay-per-view, and Bella\u2019s match was the main event: a battle with \u201cRaw\u201d Women\u2019s Champion Ronda Rousey, which she lost.",
      "WWE is bringing back Evolution this Sunday, July 13, in Atlanta, with Bella, 41, rejoining a women\u2019s division that has, well, evolved since the first edition of the event was held nearly seven years ago.",
      "\u201cThe women have just raised the bar so much and they continue to steal the show, continue to steal the PLEs (premium live events, essentially WWE's modern-day version of pay-per-views), as we saw at WrestleMania, we see every week, whether it's \u2018Monday Night Raw\u2019 or \u2018Friday Night SmackDown,\u2019\u201d Bella, who is also known to her fans as Nikki Garcia, tells TODAY.com. \u201cSo I just feel like it's the perfect time to bring this back and to give the fans an entire show that is just dedicated to women's wrestling.\u201d",
      "The Evolution of WWE Evolution",
      "When the creation of the first Evolution was announced in 2018, then-WWE exec Stephanie McMahon and her husband, current Chief Content Officer Paul \u201cTriple H\u201d Levesque, cited the demand on social media for more opportunities for female superstars as an inspiration for the event.",
      "\u201cBecause of all of you, men and women using your voices for change, we are able to provide the platform to show the world that women can do anything and be anything they want to be,\u201d McMahon said at the time.",
      "In the years since, WWE\u2019s women\u2019s division has seen the emergence of top stars like Rhea Ripley and Bianca Belair, and the continuing presence of veterans such as Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair. It was Lynch and Flair who, along with Rousey, became the first women to main event a WrestleMania, in 2019, less than a year after Evolution. (Belair faced former WWE star Sasha Banks in 2021 in the first WrestleMania main event to feature two Black women.)",
      "Bella, a multiple-time champion and a WWE Hall of Famer, has taken notice of what the current crop of female superstars can do in the ring.",
      "\u201cThe athletic ability is just through the roof. They are doing some of the same type of matches the men are. Like, beyond being in a cage. It's with tables and ladders, and it's the movement and the storytelling and what they do,\u201d she says.",
      "Bella believes Evolution can become an annual event once the women have the opportunity to showcase their skills this weekend. Not only does she believe it, but she says it needs to be an annual event.",
      "\u201cI think people constantly want more of the women and also, it gives us something different,\u201d she explains. \u201cAll of our PLEs are special and different in their own unique ways, and why not have something just for the women every year?\u201d",
      "Nikki Bella\u2019s Match for WWE Evolution \u2013 and What the Original Plan Was",
      "Bella stepped back from wrestling in 2019 due to an injury but has made occasional high-profile appearances since, including in this year\u2019s women\u2019s Royal Rumble match. She announced on the July 7 episode of \u201cRaw\u201d that she will be taking part in a battle royal at Evolution. The winner will earn a championship match for the Clash in Paris event in late August.",
      "About a month before she was named a participant in the battle royal, she was attacked by one half of the WWE Women\u2019s Tag Team Champions, Liv Morgan, on \u201cRaw.\u201d The moment appeared to be a tease of an eventual match between the two, but Morgan later suffered a shoulder injury that, according to Bella, led to a change in plans.",
      "Bella says of their storyline feud, \u201cIt was going to be a very epic story, very personal. It bums me out because we were taking it to a place that I feel like a lot of people haven't yet taken it before, and it was going to end in having a match at Evolution. And that wasn't going to be the end of it.\u201d",
      "As for what might happen between them once Morgan recovers from her injury?",
      "\u201cI don't want to say too much because sometimes what's the beauty of our business is injuries happen, but now this builds even more layers to a story that was going to happen and now can be in the future, and it just adds to it,\u201d she says.",
      "When asked whether the planned match for Evolution could have included Brie Bella \u2014 her twin sister, podcast co-host and fellow WWE Hall of Famer \u2014  she says, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely been talked about and Brie hasn't gotten the call yet (to participate in Evolution), but the fans want it really bad. I want it really bad. She wants it really bad. And I feel like my comeback won't be complete until the Bella Twins reunite in the ring.\u201d",
      "Putting on a Show for Her Son",
      "Bella says she\u2019s been getting into \u201creally good shape\u201d and that as long as her \u201cbody can do it,\u201d she\u2019s motivated to continue her wrestling career for the foreseeable future.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want it to just be like, \u2018Oh, yay, she showed her face and here she is and was,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI want to have an impact. I want this comeback to make a statement and I want it to be for a while. I don\u2019t want to do a quick in and out... I would really like to challenge myself in this new women\u2019s division and push myself to the limits and get out of my comfort zone.\u201d",
      "Another source of motivation is her son, Matteo, who turns 5 in late July. It\u2019s important to Bella that he be able to see her perform in the ring.",
      "\u201cI feel like we\u2019re in this day now where these little boys get to be raised up seeing their moms be career women, be really strong women, empowering women, and he gets to see that up close and personal. It\u2019s like raising my own little feminist,\u201d she said during a July 9 appearance on TODAY.",
      "She echoes that thought during her interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cFrom the moment I was pregnant, I'm like, \u2018One day I want my son to be ringside to see what his mom's done the majority of her life.\u2019 And I want that to happen,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that's what motivates me even more for this comeback, and to have an incredible comeback and have it be for a long time, is I want him to see that. I want him to feel it. I want him to have those core memories with him of like, that was my mom and this is what she did and this is how it impacted me and how it raised me to be.\u201d",
      "However, she makes it clear that her role as a mom takes priority over her role as a WWE superstar.",
      "\u201cMy son will always be first no matter what, and if anything ever interferes with that, he's No. 1. But I know as a career woman and as a professional wrestler and WWE superstar, I can make both happen and be great at both,\u201d she says.",
      "WWE Evolution streams live on Peacock in the U.S. and on Netflix internationally on Sunday, July 13, at 7 p.m. ET. Peacock is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal."

    "story": [
      "In the villa, breakfast isn\u2019t just the most important meal of the day \u2014 it\u2019s the most important romantic gesture.",
      "What started as a simple morning coffee has evolved into \u201cLove Island\u2019s\u2019\u201d most enduring tradition, where pancakes and avocado toast serve as daily declarations of interest, and the wrong breakfast order can spark villa-wide drama.",
      "The origins of the villa breakfast tradition",
      "This tradition didn\u2019t appear overnight. In the early seasons of \u201cLove Island UK,\u201d romance was measured in much simpler terms: boys making coffee for girls in the morning was a telltale sign of interest. This small gesture of caffeination was how viewers \u2014 and fellow Islanders \u2014 could gauge who was pursuing whom.",
      "But as the show evolved, so did the breakfast game. By Season 5 of \u201cLove Island UK,\u201d isolated instances of Islanders cooking full breakfasts began appearing as special gestures. The practice gradually transformed from occasional romantic surprises into something more systematic.",
      "In Season 8 of \u201cLove Island UK,\u201d we saw contestants like Dami and Andrew elevating breakfast to a proper date activity, preparing elaborate morning meals for Indiyah and Tasha as intimate gestures to make them feel special.",
      "However, it wasn\u2019t until the recent seasons of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d that breakfast preparation became a daily institution. Every episode, the Islanders are awoken at the break of dawn and the boys head downstairs to whip up breakfast for the girls they are hoping to pursue. What was once a sporadic romantic gesture has become as routine as the morning wake-up call.",
      "The daily breakfast mating ritual",
      "The breakfast-making process has become remarkably standardized. The boys wake up early, head to the kitchen and begin their daily courtship through culinary means.",
      "A \u201cLove Island USA\u201d breakfast plate typically involves avocado toast, often with eggs, sometimes pancakes, and fruit for a pop of color.",
      "The villa\u2019s breakfast operation is even more elaborate than it appears on screen. According to a production spokesperson, the fridge is stocked three times daily and the kitchen has all the essentials the Islanders could need \u2014 pancakes, eggs, fruit, jams, teas and juices.",
      "The villa also burns through an impressive 12 avocados daily, about 500 per season, and at least 40 eggs per day, totaling around 1,700 eggs by finale night.",
      "The \u201cLove Island\u201d breakfast ritual serves multiple purposes beyond mere sustenance. It\u2019s a daily opportunity for the boys to demonstrate their interest, care and effort. Who receives the most elaborate plate and who gets served first all send clear signals about romantic intentions in the villa.",
      "Serving up drama",
      "Food has always been a powerful source of emotion and connection, and in the pressure-cooker environment of \u201cLove Island,\u201d breakfast can quickly become a battleground. Creating breakfast for others allows the Islanders to express their love or apologize, but it can also create tension and jealousy.",
      "The most dramatic breakfast moments often involve perceived slights or inequitable treatment. Take the heated exchange from this season of \u201cLove Island USA\u201d between Huda and Jeremiah over an undercooked pancake.",
      "Such seemingly minor breakfast mishaps can spark major drama, as Islanders interpret every detail as a reflection of care and romantic interest levels.",
      "Unfortunately for Huda, pancake-gate didn\u2019t end when Jeremiah left the villa. The season\u2019s favorite breakfast item continued to haunt her romantic life, sparking another dramatic rift when she was coupled up with Chris.",
      "One morning as the girls were getting ready for another day of sunbathing and getting pulled for chats, Chris prepared breakfast plates for both Huda and Chelley, but the distribution was, in Huda\u2019s view, far from equal.",
      "\u201cYou gave her two pancakes, you gave me one; you gave her a flower, you gave me none,\u201d she lamented to Chris later that day.",
      "For Huda, it wasn\u2019t just about portion size \u2014 it was about perceived favoritism through the lens of food.",
      "The breakfast tradition has also provided opportunities for Islanders to subvert villa norms. When Chelley snuck off to make breakfast for Ace this season, she flipped the typical gender roles and demonstrated that this gesture of care could flow in either direction.",
      "Ace himself elevated the breakfast game to theatrical heights when he performed a hibachi-breakfast for Chelley, cooking directly in front of her with dramatic flair, transforming the morning meal into a romantic performance.",
      "The ritual has also been used as a tool for territorial marking. When Nic discovered that Cierra had been receiving pancakes cut into a \u201cC\u201d shape by a boy pursuing her in Casa Amor, he immediately replicated the gesture upon her return.",
      "And Nic\u2019s breakfast possessiveness extended beyond pancakes; he was also seen taking away the coffee that another boy had brought Cierra.",
      "It\u2019s more than just food",
      "While lunch and dinner are catered affairs, breakfast remains the Islanders\u2019 domain; it\u2019s the one meal where they control every detail from ingredient selection to preparation. This autonomy makes the morning ritual even more meaningful. When everything else is meticulously produced, breakfast is the ultimate expression of personal choice and romantic intention.",
      "As the show continues to evolve, breakfast has become \u201cLove Island\u2019s\u201d most revealing daily ritual \u2014 a microcosm of modern romance, where vulnerability is served on a plate and jealousy is measured in coffee cups."

And this was where people go to drink, have sex, stuff written on the walls, but still had Bible verses and everything.",

And so it was in that old, abandoned church that I just praying to God the way that I \u2014 I was just saying, \u2018Well, just show me, help me, save me, because I want to be ready.\u2019 So it was then that I just had this peace fall over me, and I just felt like that I had, for the first time in my life, had truly found God.\u201d",

So that was kind of how that happened. It had to happen without fear and without influence and without anything else.\u201d",

So I, really, just think we just have to walk that fine line to kind of try to keep it within ourselves, but to be able to project that to people.\u201d",

But if what you\u2019re saying, it goes back to what I\u2019m saying, it\u2019s your deeds and the intent and the content of your heart, which is like the intent. But if your intentions are good and you want to do great, and you\u2019re working toward that, then I think that sometimes people (are) going to pay more attention to somebody that looks like us.\u201d",

      "\u201cLike I always said, you got to put legs and arms and wings and eyes and ears on that. And a dream is different than a wish. A wish is like a fantasy thing. You can make a wish all day and wish on a star and all that, but in order to make that a reality, you\u2019ve got to really do all those things. When we talk where you've got to gather all those things to put faith \u2014 that\u2019s what faith is.\u201d"

      "Dunham, known for writing and starring in \"Girls,\" co-created the series with Felber who, like Felix, is a British musician. How much of \"Too Much\" is inspired by Dunham and Felber's love story? Here's what to know.",
      "Is 'Too Much' based on a true story?",
      "Dunham confirmed that \"Too Much\" was inspired in part by her own relationship with Felber, whom she met and married in the U.K. in 2021.",
      "\u201cA girl moves to England. She meets a musician. They fall in love. That was the exoskeleton,\u201d Dunham told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWhile the germ of it may be autobiographical, it\u2019s gone in directions I never could\u2019ve dreamed.\u201d",
      "She echoed the sentiment in an interview with Variety. Essentially, even though it started in truth, \"Too Much\" quickly veered into the fictional.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not quote-unquote based on a true story,\u201d Dunham told Variety. \u201cBut like everything I do, there is an element of my own life that I can\u2019t help but inject.\u201d",
      "Still, fans were quick to draw comparisons between Jessica\u2019s story and Dunham\u2019s personal life, including her 2017 breakup with musician Jack Antonoff and her eventual move to the U.K., where she met Felber.",
      "Dunham resists attempts to decode \"Too Much\" as a dramatized memoir.",
      "\u201cMy least favorite thing would be if people were to try to 'Baby Reindeer' it, because it would be impossible,\u201d she told Vanity Fair, referring to Netflix\u2019s hit drama based on the creator's life, sparking controversy and lawsuits as a result. \u201cIt\u2019s so many influences, so many stories from friends.\u201d",
      "She said moments in the show stem from a collective experience rather than a single relationship.",
      "\u201cThat ex-boyfriend is very much an amalgamation of every ex that I\u2019ve had, or that a friend\u2019s had,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cIf someone were to say, \u2018Who inspired that character?\u2019 I\u2019d be like, \u2018Do you have time for me to give you the 42 examples?\u2019\u201d",
      "Do Dunham and Felber appear in 'Too Much'?",
      "Dunham has a supporting role as Jessica's sister, Nora, who is going through a divorce from her husband (\"Girls\" alum Andrew Rannells) and experiencing depression.",
      "Felber makes a brief cameo as DJ Ludwig in Episode 8. In addition to writing, producing and creating the show, Felber scored the series under his stage name Attawalpa.",
      "One of the songs for the series is named, of course, \"Too Much.\"",
      "\u201cLyrically \u2018Too Much\u2019 is about meeting \u2018the one\u2019, but you\u2019re not quite evolved yet,\" Felber told the arts publication Nowness."

      "For the season finale of her \u201cMini Reni\u201d series, host and interior designer Joanna Gaines helped out a close friend and member of the TODAY family: Hoda Kotb!",
      "In the last episode of Season 1, which arrived on HBO Max and the Magnolia Network July 9, Hoda reached out to Gaines about transforming a space the former TODAY co-anchor recently took over in the New York City suburbs.",
      "Gaines said \u201cnever in a million years\u201d did she expect that Hoda would contact her about a project for the show, which shows the interior designer renovating smaller spaces over a shorter period of time. But alas, the episode began with Hoda calling Gaines on FaceTime to see if she was interested in teaming up to turn the empty office into a welcoming space for her new company, Joy 101.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m starting a new business and I saw this kind of empty, funky looking space. Could you help me?\u201d Hoda asked.",
      "Gaines quickly accepted her offer, saying that it was her \u201cbiggest honor\u201d to update the space. She mentioned to the cameras that she had met Hoda multiple times whenever she stopped by Studio 1A for an interview over the years with her husband, Chip Gaines.",
      "Hoda then listed her plans for the office. \u201cIt\u2019s where we will have our gatherings. It\u2019s where I might be able to knock out a podcast,\u201d she explained. She also described the vibe she wanted for the workspace as \u201ca combination of joy and a sanctuary.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut it is a New York suburb \u2026 Are you cool with doing a New York thing?\u201d Hoda asked Gaines, who typically works out of her home base in Waco, Texas.",
      "Gaines agreed, again, and asked Hoda to send some of her favorite pictures, colors and dreams for the office.",
      "The only concern Gaines had was about the timeline of only two months to coincide with the launch of Hoda\u2019s new business, but she knew she could make it work.",
      "Before the makeover began, Gaines and Hoda met in person in New York City to tour the space together. Gaines had already drawn a layout that included an entry, three smaller offices, conference room and a separate office for Hoda.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m 60 years old and I\u2019m, like, this is the season of repotting, up by the roots, pull \u2018em up and put them in soil. This feels fertile. When I look around, I can feel the newness of what\u2019s coming,\u201d Hoda told Gaines.",
      "She added that she pictured the design to be \u201clight, bright and white.\u201d",
      "Hoda also shared that she wanted the space to be a nod to her two daughters, Haley Joy and Hope Catherine, explaining that her work motto honors the girls.",
      "\"I say, \u2018Built with hope, made for joy,\u2019\u201d Hoda said.",
      "After telling Hoda that she planned to add \u201chistory and character\u201d to the office, Gaines immediately got to work.",
      "One of the HGTV star\u2019s first ideas was to create a propagation wall by taking clippings from plants, putting them in containers with water and placing them on wooden planks nailed to the wall. She said it would function as an additional art piece in the office.",
      "Then, Gaines began working on an arts and crafts project that included photos of Hoda\u2019s daughters and some of their drawings. She teased that the items would be one of the few surprises she'd keep a secret from Hoda.",
      "After adding multiple elements, like new paint, walls, doors, backsplash and furniture, she returned to the renovated space with Hoda to show her what she and her team had created.",
      "\u201cOh my gosh! Are you serious right now? This is insane!\u201d Hoda said as she took in the entire finished space from top to bottom.",
      "\u201cI love this so much. The ceiling is blowing my mind,\u201d she said.",
      "Hoda instantly noticed that Gaines added the motto about Hope and Joy to the wall. \u201cThis is it,\u201d Hoda said as she looked at the phrase.",
      "\u201cIt all goes back to your daughters,\u201d Gaines replied.",
      "As she continued to make her way to each room, Hoda said \u201cI love everything!\u201d She was a big fan of the three offices, which all featured vintage doors from Portugal.",
      "When Gaines showed her the propagation wall and informed her that all the plants came from the Gaines' farm, Hoda responded, \u201cRepotting, this is it. It\u2019s art.\u201d",
      "\u201cOh, stop it right now!\u201d she said as she peered around the corner to look at the conference room, which had a cork wall for meetings.",
      "For the grand reveal of the final room, Hoda\u2019s own office, Gaines opened the double doors to the room as a nearly speechless Hoda placed her hand over her heart.",
      "\u201cOh\u2026what is happening?\u201d she said while walking into the space, which Gaines said she wanted to feel feminine and include a large, central light fixture.",
      "When she noticed her daughters\u2019 handprints hanging on one of the walls, Hoda started to tear up. Gaines then revealed her art project from earlier in the episode turned into a \u201cmemory box\u201d on another wall that included notes and drawings from Hope and Joy.",
      "Hoda began to read one of the letters that said, \u201cDear Mama, I love you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t believe what you\u2019ve done. I love it so much. I love everything you did,\u201d Hoda told Gaines before the two embraced at the end of the episode.",
      "Gaines said she can\u2019t wait to see what Hoda does in the future with her modern office, and neither can we!"

And, by the time we\u2019ve sat through the trials and tribulations of Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) and the rest of the crew, there\u2019s often a dish or two that inspire us to head to our own kitchen to capture some of that chaotic culinary magic.",

      "While there\u2019s no official recipe for the dish, it\u2019s shopped for and made throughout the episode, so a recap of those scenes can serve as our recipe.",
      "The capsule episode focuses on Sydney who is over at her cousin Chantel\u2019s (Danielle Deadweiller) house getting her braids done \u2014 a several hour-to-daylong process. Syd is unwittingly made babysitter to Chantel\u2019s daughter TJ (Arion King), who is hungry.",

      "After the pair return to the kitchen, Syd tells a now-curious TJ how she\u2019s changing things.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m about to add some tomato paste to deepen the flavors and make it taste like it didn\u2019t come out of a box,\u201d she says over a pan of browned beef.",
      "\u201cSo just like chili then?\u201d TJ asks.",
      "Impressed, Syd says, \u201cYeah, kinda, actually.\u201d",
      "We see some other additions Syd presumably bought scattered throughout the scene as well: onion, heavy cream, a block of cheese and a bunch of herbs. While we didn\u2019t see her prepare all of these, the creamy sauce and flecks of green in the finished dish meant they were going in mine, too.",
      "The Hamburger Helper box only contains three instructions: First, cook ground meat in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat for 6 to 8 minutes, breaking up and stirring until browned. After draining, return the cooked meat to the skillet.",
      "This is where I added the chopped onion and tomato paste to caramelize a little bit while I gathered the other items.",
      "The box also says to then stir in water, milk, the sauce mix and pasta and heat. The box asks for two cups of milk, so I switched out a cup of milk for a cup of heavy cream, like I imagined Syd would have.",
      "After bringing that to a boil and reducing the heat to simmer, I melted a half stick of butter in a second pan and dumped one and a half cups of panko in, stirring constantly until they were golden brown.",
      "By that point, the smell in my kitchen was delightful. There\u2019s a beautiful moment on the show where TJ smells what Syd is cooking and you can see her brain shift, and I experienced the exact same sensation.",
      "Syd then helps TJ safely use a grater on a block of cheddar cheese \u2014 something even adults get wrong \u2014 and the pile is stirred into the pan in stages until melted.",
      "Finally, the chopped herbs \u2014 I used a combo of fresh parsley, oregano and basil, and stirred most of it into the pan until incorporated. Transferring the rosy orange mix into a bowl, I  sprinkled on the toasted panko and more chopped herbs to finish the dish.",
      "Fun fact: This is the very first time in my 42 years of life that I have eaten Hamburger Helper \u2014 and I am officially a convert.",
      "Each spoonful was rich, but not not too rich. The herbs gave it a fresh bite and the panko added a buttery crunch. Two thumbs up. (Perhaps not a Michelin star, but what can you do?)",
      "Plus, the dish is attractive. You could make this for a dinner party and get compliments from people who would have no idea that a glove with eyes was involved in its creation.",
      "Like Chantal at the end of the episode, my mother \u2014 a staunch culinary figure who usually doesn\u2019t like anything I cook \u2014 walked into the kitchen as I was finishing and asked for a bowl. That\u2019s already amazing in itself, but then she ate the entire thing in front of me and didn\u2019t have any notes.",
      "Chef Sydney, you wizard, you."

      "The streamer did not share more details about Season 10, including the premiere date.",

      "\u201cWhat a wild ride,\u201d Van Ness wrote. \u201cExcited to bring it back one more time.\u201d",
      "Porowski shared the post on his Instagram story and said, \u201cLet\u2019s make our last one count,\u201d and included a heart-hand and clapping emoji. Brent simply shared the Netflix announcement to his Instagram story.",
      "On his page, France penned a longer post about the series coming to an end.",
      "\u201cFirst day of the FINAL season of Queer Eye. It\u2019s been a long, beautiful journey we\u2019ve been on, and I truly appreciate all of the love and support for our little show, that changed my life in ways I never thought possible,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cQueer Eye,\u201d a reboot of the early 2000s Bravo series of the same name, debuted on Netflix in February 2018 and introduced audiences to Porowski (food and wine expert), Van Ness (grooming expert), Brown (culture and lifestyle expert) and France (fashion expert).",

      "In February 2024, Berk surprised fans by announcing he was leaving the show. Netflix later confirmed in a press release that Berk would be replaced by New York City-based interior designer Jeremiah Brent, who is married to fellow interior designer and author Nate Berkus. Brent officially joined the team when Season 9, which took place in Las Vegas, arrived on Netflix in December 2024.",
      "The end of \u201cQueer Eye\u201d comes after the updated Fab Five previously spoke to TODAY.com in December 2024 about having a new co-star. France said that Brent brought new life to the show after it appeared to be entering its \u201csunset era.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy only job when I started here was making sure that they knew that I was going to earn their trust,\u201d Brent said.",

      "He continued, \u201cIt was something personal that had been brewing \u2014 and nothing romantic, just to clarify that.\u201d",
      "Fans had suspected the two had a falling out as Berk unfollowed France on Instagram following the news of his departure.",
      "Speaking about the situation, Berk said, \u201cShould I have unfollowed Tan? No. Maybe I should have just muted him. But that day, I was angry, and that\u2019s the end of it. We became like siblings \u2014 and siblings are always going to fight.\u201d",

      "In the first few episodes of the newest season, Aubri Ibrag\u2019s character, Lizzy Elmsworth, and Guy Remmers\u2019 character, Theo, Duke of Tintagel, exchanged a few lingering glances during their interactions that suggested there could be an attraction between them.",
      "But on the surface, Lizzy and Theo appeared to have a strictly platonic friendship as he married her close friend Nan (Kristine Froseth) last season. Meanwhile, Lizzy struck up a courtship with Hector Robinson (Jacob Ifan) in the Season 2 premiere.",
      "During a tension-filled moment in Episode 3, Lizzy gleefully approached Theo to tell him that Hector had proposed, and the duke had an unusual response. Instead of simply congratulating her, he told Lizzy her fianc\u00e9 was \u201centirely unworthy\u201d of her.",
      "He called Lizzy \u201csensational\u201d and added that a life with Hector would be \u201cpleasant,\u201d leaving her nearly speechless and marking a palpable shift in their dynamic.",
      "They suddenly acted on those growing feelings in Episode 4, titled \u201cIce Cream,\u201d by sharing a secret, passionate kiss at one of Hector\u2019s events. Lizzy seemed to second-guess her decision and ran off \u2014 only to meet up with Theo later at his castle. The episode concluded with a steamy sex scene that showed the pair entangled in his bed sheets.",
      "If you were slightly caught off guard by the ending, you weren\u2019t alone. Ibrag tells TODAY.com she was initially \u201csurprised\u201d by their characters\u2019 sudden turn from being friends to having an affair.",
      "\u201cWhen I got the scripts and stuff, I was like, 'I suppose this kind of makes sense,'\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything that either of us expected, because we don\u2019t really interact in the first season.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike, at all,\u201d she adds. \u201cJust briefly when I say \u2018hello\u2019 in the background or something. But it was a bit of a surprise.\u201d",
      "Despite their lack of interactions last season, Remmers says their characters' journeys have been similar up to this point.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re both characters who were kind of unfairly wronged in the first season, and were stung by love ...\u201d he explains.",
      "\u201cBy the people they trusted most,\" Ibrag chimes in.",
      "\u201cExactly,\u201d he continues. \u201cSo, when we started reading the episodes, it actually made sense that these two people would find each other.\u201d",
      "Ibrag then mentions a scene from Episode 2 that some fans say foreshadowed the season's romantic twist. During the episode, Theo takes Lizzy, Nan and Hector on a tour of his estate. Theo and Lizzy share a private moment in which her confides in her and tells her that he sometimes hears Nan crying alone in her room, adding, \u201cI think my wife has a broken heart.\u201d",
      "Later, Theo shows the group his family's mausoleum and the long line of those laid to rest there. After the episode aired, fans on X pointed out that the camera panned to Lizzy when Theo spoke about where his wife would be buried.",
      "Ibrag says that scene made her realize there was a spark between the characters.",
      "\u201cI feel like that\u2019s the moment for me and the plot that\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, Lizzy recognizes this wound in Theo.\u2019 And I feel like Theo probably sees that wound in Lizzy in some way,\u201d she shares.",
      "From there, the two were able to establish a strong emotional connection that then developed into a romantic relationship, she says.",
      "Wait, What About Nan?",
      "While some viewers might question Lizzy\u2019s actions this season considering her unbreakable bond with Nan, Ibrag says she has been enjoying exploring new sides to her character in Season 2.",
      "\u201cI think she swallowed her tongue a lot more in the first season, and kind of buried everything down. But I think this season, we see this side of her that is like, \u2018Wait, I also deserve happiness and love and all of those things,\u2019\u201d Ibrag says.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s just more of a savage. She\u2019s more of a savage girl, especially towards the end,\u201d she teases. \u201cBut I still think she has a really good heart, and all of her affair stuff comes from a place of genuine feeling and love.\u201d",
      "As fans have watched Lizzy become more confident and daring, they have also seen other aspects of Theo\u2019s personality. In Episode 4, he begins to spiral and dances before interrupting Hector\u2019s event.",

      "\u201cI think all these characters that make these questionable decisions come from a place of love and being hurt,\u201d he explains. \u201cI can kind of see each character\u2019s perspective and why they do those things. Theo really has to deal with lots of discoveries and hurt and heartbreak. And he does spiral out of control at a point and does some things that are probably a little bit out of character and (that) he may regret.\u201d",
      "Even though Theo is brooding onscreen, behind the scenes, Remmers had a fun time playing him, particularly during the filming of the dance scene. Set to Bleachers' \"Modern Girl,\" Episode 4 opens with Theo dancing with no inhibition in the wake of finding out Nan slept with his best friend, Guy (Matthew Broome), the night before their wedding.",
      "\u201cThe dance scene was, honestly, one of the best days I\u2019ve ever had on set,\" Remmers says. \"Not even on set, just in my life, in general.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was very nervous, but it was an extremely beautiful, liberating scene to do. In that situation, you just have to completely let go. I hope that came across on screen, but it was a lot of fun,\" he continues.",
      "Ibrag says, \u201cYou had an intense day on set that day.\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah, we had a dance scene and a sex scene,\u201d he replies. \u201cIt was a physical day.\u201d"

      "Fans of the \"Dexter\"-verse can never forget the shocking death of Harrison\u2019s mother (Dexter\u2019s wife, Rita) at the hands of the Arthur Mitchell, better known as the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow), in Season 4 of the original series.",

      "Hannah and Harrison move to Argentina. She later dies of pancreatic cancer, leaving Harrison parentless again.",
      "Fast forward to \"New Blood\" and Harrison is now a teenager, one with whom Dexter has a complex relationship. Dexter believes he sees a dark passenger in his son.",
      "What is Harry\u2019s Code and how has it changed?",
      "Let\u2019s take a second to remember the rules of Harry\u2019s Code, which will get even more blurred this upcoming season.",
      "The code is Dexter's adoptive dad's way of controlling his son's homicidal urges. Harry's Code boils down to the following precepts:",
      "Never get caught, never kill an innocent, targets must be killers, killing must serve a purpose, blend in, control urges, leave no trace, never make a scene, don\u2019t get personal and no preemptive killing.",
      "Never get caught, never kill an innocent, targets must be killers, killing must serve a purpose, blend in, control urges, leave no trace, never make a scene, don\u2019t get personal and no preemptive killing.",
      "Dr. Vogel (Charlotte Rampling), a neuropsychiatrist who studied psychopaths, was the person who actually devised Harry\u2019s code early on, which would come to define Dexter\u2019s entire morality of killing. She too, eventually dies at the hands her own son, Oliver Saxon (whose real name is Daniel Vogel).",
      "We see Dexter truly lose his head in \u201cNew Blood,\u201d killing out of impulse and revenge rather than the guidelines of the code.",
      "What is \u2018Dexter: Resurrection\u2019 going to be about?",
      "But wait! He lives! \u201cResurrection\u201d takes place just weeks after the final events of \u201cNew Blood,\u201d and Dexter sets out for New York City to find Harrison in an attempt to make things right.",
      "The season features new and familiar faces. Dexter\u2019s past as Miami's Bay Harbor Butcher will catch up to him, bringing Detective Angel Batista (David Zayas) back into the picture.",
      "Among the new characters? Peter Dinklage plays a billionaire named Leon Prater; Uma Thurman is Charley, his head of security. Also making appearances are Neil Patrick Harris, Eric Stonestreet and Krysten Ritter as a serial killer.",
      "There\u2019s a lot on the line, with fans hoping for a more satisfying end to Dexter\u2019s story than the original finale provided."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Israel believes at least some of Iran\u2019s highly enriched uranium was buried beneath Iran\u2019s Isfahan facility by U.S. strikes and not destroyed or moved beforehand, a senior Israeli government official said in Washington on Wednesday night. But it is effectively unreachable, the official said, because Israel is watching, and if it believes Iran is trying to dig up the material, it will not hesitate to conduct new strikes.",
      "Asked about Israel\u2019s conclusion regarding the uranium at Isfahan, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement: \u201cAs President Trump has said many times, Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. The entire world is safer thanks to his decisive leadership.\u201d",
      "In a lengthy briefing with reporters Wednesday night, the senior Israeli government official said Israel decided to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities because of intelligence it had that Tehran had begun rapidly and secretly proceeding to weaponize its enriched uranium after Israel\u2019s targeted assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in September.",
      "The official said that Israel had shared the intelligence with President Donald Trump but was preparing to strike with or without a green light or participation from the United States and that American support was not a condition for Israel\u2019s decision to strike Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities.",
      "The official would not specify the source of the intelligence.",

      "Asked about National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard\u2019s having testified before Congress in March that the U.S. intelligence community \u201ccontinues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003,\u201d the Israeli official dismissed the question, viewing the assessment as not serious.",
      "According to the official, Israel believes Iran\u2019s nuclear program has now been set back up to two years.",
      "An initial assessment by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency leaked late last month found that the U.S. strikes on Isfahan and two other sites may have set back the program only several months.",
      "The question of how damaged Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u2014 along with how much its timeline toward building a nuclear weapon should it ever decide to do so was delayed \u2014 has been a politically charged one. Trump and his administration have denounced the leak of the DIA assessment and the outlets that first reported it.",
      "The day after the initial DIA assessment was first reported, CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement that \u201ca body of credible intelligence\u201d indicated the program was \u201cseverely damaged.\u201d",

      "Albanese did not directly address the sanctions, but wrote in a post on X, \u201cJust to be sure, on this day more than ever: I stand firmly and convincingly on the side of justice, as I have always done.\u201d",
      "The possibility of a pause in fighting in Gaza comes after months of failed efforts to secure a deal.",
      "A previous ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that ended in March brought around two months of relative calm to the enclave and saw 33 hostages freed in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners and detainees.",

      "The 43-year-old was photographed on July 8 arriving at a state banquet at Windsor Castle with her husband, Prince William, by her side. For her appearance, the royal wore the classic Queen Mary\u2019s Lover\u2019s Knot Tiara, one of her more frequently worn tiaras, along with a dark red Givenchy by Sarah Burton gown (Burton was also the designer behind the princess\u2019 iconic wedding dress).",

According to previous TODAY.com reporting, the diadem was commissioned by Queen Mary around 1914 and was frequently worn by Princess Diana. The tiara was gifted to Diana for her 1981 wedding to Prince Charles by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Diana is said to have often complained about the weight of the tiara, attributing headaches to the weight of the piece."

    "story": [
      "Fungal infections are getting harder to treat as they grow more resistant to available drugs, according to research published Wednesday in The Lancet Microbe.",
      "The study focused on infections caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, a fungus that is ubiquitous in soil and decaying matter around the world. Aspergillus spores are inhaled all the time, usually without causing any problems. But in people who are immunocompromised or who have underlying lung conditions, Aspergillus can be dangerous.",
      "The fungus is one of the World Health Organization\u2019s top concerns on its list of priority fungi, which notes that death rates for people with drug-resistant Aspergillus infections range from 47%-88%.",
      "The new study found that the fungus\u2019 drug resistance is increasing. On top of that, patients are typically infected with multiple strains of the fungus, sometimes with different resistance genes.",
      "\u201cThis presents treatment issues,\u201d said the study\u2019s co-author, Jochem Buil, a microbiologist at Radboud University Medical Centre in the Netherlands.",
      "Buil and his team analyzed more than 12,600 samples of Aspergillus fumigatus taken from the lungs of patients in Dutch hospitals over the last 30 years. Of them, about 2,000 harbored mutations associated with resistance to azoles, the class of antifungals used to treat the infections. Most of them had one of two well-known mutations, but 17% had variations of the mutations.",
      "Nearly 60 people had invasive infections \u2014 meaning the fungi spread from the lungs to other parts of the body \u2014 13 of which were azole-resistant. In those people, nearly 86% were infected with multiple strains of the fungi, making treatment even more complicated.",
      "\u201cIt is an increasingly complicated story and physicians may have trouble identifying whether or not they are dealing with a drug-resistant fungal infection,\u201d said Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Before treating an Aspergillus fungal infection, doctors look for resistance genes that can give them clues about which drugs will work best. If someone is infected with multiple strains of the same type of fungus, this becomes much less clear-cut. Oftentimes, different strains will respond to different drugs.",
      "\u201cAzoles are the first line of treatment for azole-susceptible strains, but they do not work when a strain is resistant. For those, we need to use different drugs that don\u2019t work as well and have worse side effects,\u201d Buil said, adding that some people will require treatment with multiple antifungal drugs at the same time.",
      "The findings illustrate a larger trend of growing pressure on the few drugs available to treat fungal infections \u2014 there are only three major classes of antifungal drugs, including azoles, that treat invasive infections, compared with several dozen classes of antibiotics.",
      "Resistance to such drugs is growing, and new ones are uniquely difficult to develop.",
      "Humans and fungi share about half of their DNA, meaning we\u2019re much more closely related to fungi than we are to bacteria and viruses. Many of the proteins that are essential for fungi to survive are also essential for human cells, leaving fewer safe targets for antifungal drugs to attack.",
      "\u201cThe big problem for all of these fungal species is that we don\u2019t have a lot of antifungals,\u201d said Jarrod Fortwendel, a professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, who was not involved with the research. \u201cTypically the genetic mutations that cause resistance don\u2019t cause resistance to one of the drugs, it\u2019s all of them, so you lose the entire class of drugs.\u201d",
      "Further complicating matters, the vast majority of azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus stems from agriculture, which widely uses fungicides. The fungicides typically have the same molecular targets as antifungal drugs. Farmers spray them on crops, including wheat and barley in the U.S., to prevent or treat fungal disease. (The first instance of azole resistance was documented in the Netherlands, where antifungals are widely used on tulips.) Aspergillus fungi aren\u2019t the target, but exposure to the fungicides gives them a head start developing genes that are resistant to the targets, sometimes before an antifungal drug with the same target even hits the market.",
      "This was the source of the vast majority of the drug resistance analyzed in the study.",
      "Fortwendel noted that fungal resistance is increasingly found around the world. \u201cBasically everywhere we look for drug-resistant isotopes, we find them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are seeing this azole drug-resistance happening throughout the U.S. Those rates will likely climb.\u201d",
      "Any individual person\u2019s risk of having an azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus is low, Casadevall said. Infections typically affect people who are immunocompromised and amount to around a few thousand cases per year in the U.S., Casadevall said. While relatively uncommon, the bigger risk is the broader trend of drug-resistant fungal infections.",
      "\u201cThe organisms that cause disease are getting more resistant to drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not like Covid, we don\u2019t wake up to a fungal pandemic, this is a problem that is worse today than it was five, 10 or 20 years ago.\u201d"

      "SEOUL, July 10 - Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol returned to jail on Thursday after a court approved a warrant sought by prosecutors investigating his attempt to impose martial law last year.",
      "The Seoul Central District Court\u2019s decision bolstered the special counsel investigation into allegations that Yoon\u2019s move in December represented obstruction of justice and abuse of power.",
      "The court said in a statement it granted the request because of concerns Yoon could seek to destroy evidence.",
      "The conservative politician already faces criminal charges of insurrection over his martial law decree, and that could carry a sentence of life in prison or death.",
      "The former president returned to confinement in the Seoul Detention Center about 20 km (12 miles) south of the capital after the decision. He spent 52 days in jail earlier in the year but was released four months ago on technical grounds.",
      "The Constitutional Court ousted him as president in April, upholding parliament\u2019s impeachment for the martial law bid, which shocked South Koreans and triggered months of political turmoil.",
      "The special prosecution team launched its investigation after new leader Lee Jae Myung was elected in June, and it has been looking into additional charges against Yoon.",
      "The special counsel team is now expected to speed up its probe into allegations, including whether Yoon hurt South Korea\u2018s interests by intentionally inflaming tensions with North Korea.",
      "Yoon attended the court hearing on Wednesday on the detention warrant, wearing a dark navy suit and a red tie, but did not answer questions from reporters.",
      "His lawyers have denied the allegations against him and called the detention request an unreasonable move in a hasty investigation.",
      "More than 1,000 supporters rallied near the court on Wednesday, local media reported, waving flags and signs and chanting Yoon\u2019s name in heat of 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "In their warrant request, prosecutors said Yoon poses a flight risk, local media reported."

      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands \u2014 The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants Tuesday for the Taliban's supreme leader and the head of Afghanistan's Supreme Court on charges of persecuting women and girls since seizing power nearly four years ago.",
      "The warrants also accuse the leaders of persecuting \"other persons nonconforming with the Taliban's policy on gender, gender identity or expression; and on political grounds against persons perceived as 'allies of girls and women.'\"",
      "The warrants were issued against Taliban supreme leader Hibatullah Akhunzada and the head of the Supreme Court, Abdul Hakim Haqqani.",
      "The court's prosecution office called the decision to issue warrants \"an important vindication and acknowledgment of the rights of Afghan women and girls.\"",
      "It added that the judges' ruling \"also recognizes the rights and lived experiences of persons whom the Taliban perceived as not conforming with their ideological expectations of gender identity or expression, such as members of the LGBTQI+ community, and persons whom the Taliban perceived as allies of girls and women.\"",
      "Zabihullah Mujahid, the chief spokesman for the Taliban government, rejected the court's authority.",
      "He said in a statement that the court's decision reflected \"open hostility and hatred toward the holy religion of Islam and Shariah law,\" and is \"an insult to the beliefs of all Muslims.\"",
      "The warrants came just hours after the United Nations adopted a resolution Monday over U.S. objections that called on the Taliban to reverse their worsening oppression of women and girls and eliminate all terrorist organizations.",
      "They are the latest high-profile suspects named in arrest warrants issued by The Hague-based court that also has sought the arrest of other leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Since returning to power in Afghanistan in 2021, the Taliban have imposed harsh measures, banning women from public places and girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade. Last week, Russia became the first country to formally recognize the Taliban's government.",
      "The court said in a statement that the Taliban have \"severely deprived, through decrees and edicts, girls and women of the rights to education, privacy and family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and religion.\"",
      "The court's chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, sought the warrants in January, saying that they recognized that \"Afghan women and girls as well as the LGBTQI+ community are facing an unprecedented, unconscionable and ongoing persecution by the Taliban.\"",
      "Global advocacy group Human Rights Watch welcomed the decision, and urged the international community to help enforce the court's warrants.",
      "\"Senior Taliban leaders are now wanted men for their alleged persecution of women, girls, and gender-nonconforming people,\" Liz Evenson, the group's international justice director, said in a statement.",
      "ICC judges approved a request in 2022 from the prosecutor to reopen an investigation into Afghanistan. The probe was shelved after Kabul said it could handle the investigation.",
      "Khan said he wanted to reopen the inquiry because under the Taliban, there was \"no longer the prospect of genuine and effective domestic investigations\" in Afghanistan.",
      "Khan's predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, got approval in 2020 to start looking at offenses allegedly committed by Afghan government forces, the Taliban, American troops and U.S. foreign intelligence operatives dating back to 2002.",
      "When Khan reopened the probe, he said he would focus on crimes committed by the Taliban and the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State group. He said he would \"deprioritize\" other aspects of the investigation, such as crimes committed by Americans.",
      "The warrants for Taliban leaders were issued while Khan has stepped down temporarily pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct. Khan has categorically denied accusations that he tried for more than a year to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her against her will."

      "A Liberian-flagged cargo ship came under fire from Houthi rebels Monday in the Red Sea, with two on board reported to be hurt and two others missing in an assault a day after the Yemen-based militant group sunk another vessel.",
      "The attack on the Greek-owned bulk carrier Eternity C in the crucial maritime route came after the Houthis attacked the Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned bulk carrier Magic Seas with drones, missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire Sunday, forcing its crew of 22 to abandon the vessel.",
      "The two attacks and a round of Israeli airstrikes early Monday targeting the rebels raised fears of a renewed Houthi campaign against shipping that could again draw in U.S. and Western forces, particularly after President Donald Trump\u2019s administration targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign.",
      "The attacks come at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance, and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following American airstrikes targeting its most sensitive atomic sites during the Israel-Iran war in June.",
      "The European Union anti-piracy patrol Operation Atalanta and the private security firm Ambrey reported the latest attack. They said the Eternity C had been heading north toward the Suez Canal when it came under fire by men in small boats and by bomb-carrying drones. The security guards on board also fired their weapons.",
      "Operation Atalanta said the Eternity C had a crew of 21 Filipinos and one Russian, plus three security personnel. The E.U. force said the ship had not requested an escort.",
      "The E.U. force also said the Houthis carried out the attack.",
      "Moammar al-Eryani, the information minister with Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government that opposes the Houthis and is based in southern Yemen, also blamed the rebels for the Eternity C attack. The Houthis control the northern half of Yemen and its capital, Sanaa.",
      "The attack on the Eternity C happened in the same area as the attack Sunday on the Magic Seas, about 60 miles southwest of the port of Hodeida, Yemen, which is held by the Houthis.",
      "An armed security team on the vessel had returned fire against an initial attack of gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades, though the vessel later was struck by projectiles. Operation Atalanta, said 22 mariners had been on board the Magic Seas, with the United Arab Emirates saying an Abu Dhabi Ports vessel rescued the sailors.",
      "Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, the Houthis\u2019 military spokesman, claimed Sunday\u2019s attack on the Magic Seas. Saree later said the vessel sunk.",
      "The Houthis\u2019 al-Masirah satellite news channel noted the later attack Monday, but the rebels didn\u2019t claim that assault. They routinely wait hours or even days after an attack to do so."

      "While temperatures soared across the United States, Europe was also subjected to its own \u201cheat dome\u201d in late June and early July. England and Spain recorded their hottest June on record, schools closed across France and wildfires raged in Sardinia.",
      "Around 2,300 people died across 12 European cities, including London, Paris, Barcelona and Rome, according to the study by Imperial College London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.",
      "Of these, around two-thirds \u2014 or 1,500 deaths \u2014 can be attributed to global warming, 88% of whom were over age 65, the study said.",
      "The scientists took the estimated deaths for last week\u2019s heat wave and compared them with the expected deaths in a computer-simulated heat wave based on a world without human-made global warming. While it is not a peer-reviewed study, it uses peer-reviewed methods to reach its conclusions.",

      "He said the casualties reviewed in this study were likely an underestimate and \u201conly a snapshot of climate change driven temperatures\u201d throughout Europe."
