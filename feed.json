      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 That\u2019s show business for you! Taylor Swift\u2019s 12th studio album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d has officially sold 4.002 million equivalent album units \u2014 which includes album sales and streaming activity \u2014 in its first week in the U.S. That is the biggest first week in modern music history; at least, according to Luminate, the industry data and analytics company that began tracking sales in 1991.",
      "Swift broke the record set by Adele\u2019s \u201c25,\u201d which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015 in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d was released Oct. 3. In its first week, pure album sales totaled 3,479,500 copies.",
      "She's also become the solo artist with the most No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, with 15. She was previously tied with Drake and Jay-Z, who each have 14.",
      "Swift is now just behind The Beatles, who boast of 19 No. 1 albums.",
      "She is no stranger to breaking records, and when it comes to \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d the history-making started immediately. In its first day of release, the album sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales, breaking her record for most first week sales... in one day.",
      "Her last album, 2024\u2019s \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d amassed 2.61 million equivalent album units in the U.S. in its first week.",
      "Also, according to Luminate, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d broke the record for the most copies of a vinyl album sold in a single week in the U.S., with 1.2 million copies in its first day.",
      "The previous record holder was \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d which sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week.",

      "The former president gave new status to \u201cWTF With Marc Maron\u201d and to podcasts in general when he visited Maron's Los Angeles garage studio while still in office a decade ago.

      "Maron laughed as he acknowledged he was comparing his podcasting gig to the presidency.",
      "\u201cI think it's pretty similar,\u201d Obama said.",
      "The identity of the guest was not revealed until the episode dropped, and fans had been speculating. Obama was a popular guess, both because of his relationship with \u201cWTF\u201d and because Maron in an interview with Variety in July said Obama would be his ideal final conversation.",
      "The host explained the decision in an unusually brief and straightforward introduction to the episode.",
      "\u201cIt became clear that the guest we needed to have was singular,\u201d Maron said, \u201cin that he could address the importance of this being our final episode, but also address how we move through the world we're living in, as frightening as it is.\u201d",
      "Maron asked Obama for advice on moving on from your life's biggest job.",
      "\u201cYou've still got a couple of chapters left,\u201d Obama said. \u201cDon't rush into what the next thing is. Take a beat. Take some satisfaction looking backwards.\u201d",

      "Diane Keaton never really played the part of glamorous movie star. She was in iconic films and she dated some of the biggest stars of her generation, and yet she somehow remained other and defiantly herself despite so many years working in the Hollywood system. Eccentric and approachable, with a sort of effervescent charm, it\u2019s no surprise that she played muse to so many, from Woody Allen to Nancy Meyers.",
      "People often describe her as self-deprecating, as if it was a choice and not a product of deep-seated insecurity. Keaton was someone who thought herself ugly, who battled eating disorders and who never seemed to give herself enough credit for her successes. But she was also able to channel that into her performances spanning five decades unlike none other.",
      "There are so many Keaton films worth noting, including her full run with Allen. There are the Instagram favorites like \u201cThe First Wives Club\u201d (available to rent), nostalgic classics like \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d (streaming on Hulu) and dramatic turns in \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d (streaming on Kanopy) and \u201cShoot the Moon\u201d (available to rent).",
      "Here are six essential roles to get you started.",
      "Kay Adams, the future Mrs. Corleone, could have been a wallpaper role. But Keaton, in her breakout role, held the screen next to her flashier counterparts. She was the wife who had something going on behind her eyes, who could hold the screen in the chilling final shot of the first film. Social media doesn\u2019t often produce anything worthwhile but in 2023 Francis Ford Coppola and Keaton had an exchange on an Instagram story \u201cask me anything\u201d session. She wondered why he\u2019d picked her.",
      "\u201cI chose you, because although you were to play the more straight/vanilla wife, there was something more about you, deeper, funnier, and very interesting. (I was right),\u201d Coppola wrote.",

      "\u201cLa-dee-da, la-dee-da\u201d where to even begin with \u201cAnnie Hall?\u201d It is the quintessential Keaton role, a love-letter to her quirks, eccentricities, insecurities and charm all wrapped up in this fictional tie-wearing WASP from Chippewa Falls.",
      "Allen encouraged her to wear what she wanted to wear, and so she assembled her iconic outfit \u2014 khaki pants, vest, tie \u2014 from \u201ccool-looking women on the streets of New York.\u201d The hat was lifted from actor Aurore Clement.",
      "\u201cNo one had any serious expectations. We were just having a good time moving through New York\u2019s landmark locations,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. \u201cAs always, Woody concerned himself with worries about the script.

      "In this comedy from Charles Shyer and Nancy Meyers, Keaton plays a Manhattan yuppie who unexpectedly inherits a 14-month-old and begins to reassess her life, eventually moving to Vermont where she meets a veterinarian played by peak handsome Sam Shepard. An ahead-of-its-time commentary on the have-it-all discourse of the next 30 years, Roger Ebert wrote at the time that \u201c\u2019Baby Boom\u2019 makes no effort to show us real life. It is a fantasy about mothers and babies and sweetness and love, with just enough wicked comedy to give it an edge.\u201d",

      "Oh Erica Barry and her fabulous Hamptons home and ivory turtleneck sweaters. This was purely the brainchild of Meyers, the writer-director who had the glorious idea to make a 50-something woman the object of desire in a mainstream romantic comedy. Keaton plays this brilliant playwright who catches the eye of both an older playboy (Jack Nicholson) with a proclivity for much younger women and a young, handsome doctor (Keanu Reeves). Keaton has called it her favorite movie, in part because she got to kiss Nicholson (who she had acted alongside before, in \u201cReds\u201d) \u201cbecause it was so unexpected at age 57.\u201d",

      "In Luca Guadagnino's \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d Yale academics go at each other on everything from Foucault to feminism in a psychological battle set across a #MeToo minefield",
      "It\u2019s not so often that the font of a movie\u2019s opening credits is, itself, a provocation.",
      "But in Luca Guadagnino \u2019s muddled but darkly absorbing \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d the white Windsor Light Condensed lettering against a black background, with cast in alphabetical order and soft jazz playing, is immediately recognizable as the style of a Woody Allen movie opening.",
      "In the juggling act to follow in \u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d where Guadagnino will playfully twirl a twisting narrative of alleged sexual assault, cancel culture, privilege in academia and Gen Z victimization, the credits are not so much an opening salvo than they are an introductory wink.",
      "Like many an Allen film, \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is set among a well-educated, self-involved class. It takes place around Yale University. But unlike Allen\u2019s anxious, existential, chattering characters, Guadagnino\u2019s cocktail party collection of professors and students is a more scheming and unpleasant lot.",
      "That includes a philosophy professor, Alma Imhoff (Julia Roberts), on the precipice of tenure, her friend and department colleague, Hank Gibson (Andrew Garfield), and Imhoff\u2019s star pupil, a Ph.D. student named Maggie Resnick (Ayo Edebiri), who after a party at Alma\u2019s house accuses Hank of sexual assault.",
      "Guadagnino\u2019s film, shot by Malik Hassan Sayeed, is somberly and flatly lit and rife with reflections. Under these drab surfaces, the central characters of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d \u2014 an ensemble of singularly charming actors who here have drained away much of their natural charisma \u2014 go at each other on everything from Foucault to feminism in a psychological battle set across a #MeToo minefield.",
      "That, at least, is the promise of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d But Guadagnino\u2019s dour and languid film, scripted by Nora Garrett, only fitfully coheres as the conversation piece it aspires to be. Its plot turns can be rash or implausible, and the movie increasingly feels like ideas and set pieces strung tenuously together.",
      "Yet I also enjoyed the prickliness of \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Though there\u2019s a strong anti-woke vein to it, Guadagnino\u2019s film is more about how seemingly quite different generations have much more in common than they might appear. The cultural debates depicted in the movie are often so colored by moralistic superiority, but that\u2019s not the case here. Everyone is kind of rotten in \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s especially unusual for Roberts, whose Alma is far more complicated a character than she normally tackles. Alma is esteemed, fiercely intelligent, ambitious and hard to read. Her husband, a psychiatrist named Frederik (a fabulous Michael Stuhlbarg as combustible cocktail of cuckold and cook) worships her, but her affection is less evident.",

      "\u201cWhen did offending someone become a cardinal sin?\u201d Hank asks at the party that opens the movie.",
      "A sign of what Guadagnino might be up to comes not long after, after Maggie has alleged the assault. Alma goes to meet a distraught Hank at a local restaurant. While they hash out what\u2019s true and what\u2019s fiction in Maggie\u2019s account, it\u2019s hard not to notice the mirrors that surround Hank.",
      "The real mirror of \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d is Alma and Maggie. Edebiri is here a kind of stand-in for Gen Z, and her case expands to include a wider range of issues of inclusivity and othering. As things spiral and Maggie\u2019s case leads to increasing intensity on campus and in Alma\u2019s personal life, Alma shifts from Maggie\u2019s mentor to something more like a foe. But Alma\u2019s own past begins to play a role in the fallout, adding a new frame to \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d that casts Alma and Maggie\u2019s plights in a different light.",
      "Is this a good time? Not especially, though Garfield is great in a rage. Glib insertions don\u2019t help. In one scene, when Alma meets a fellow faculty member (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny) in a bar, a Smiths song plays and she seems surprised a Morrissey tune isn\u2019t outlawed.",
      "I'm not sure \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d has too much more to say than that shrug-of-the-shoulders scene. But \u201cAfter the Hunt\u201d deserves credit not so much more wading into these hot-button topics, but for trying to find its own way through them. It's not a #MeToo procedural but more like a tragedy. When \u201coptics over substance\u201d governs all, as one character laments, no one lives happily ever after.",
      "\u201cAfter the Hunt,\u201d an Amazon MGM release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for language and some sexual content. Running time: 139 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "According to Luminate, an industry data and analytics company, Latin music is primarily consumed via streaming. They found that Bad Bunny saw a 26% increase in on-demand streams in the United States following the Sept. 28 announcement, soaring from 173 million nine days before the announcement to 218.5 million streams in the eight days that followed.",
      "The singer born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio recently said concerns about the mass deportation of Latinos played into his decision to bypass the mainland U.S. during his residency. He performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "Since the NFL, Apple Music and Roc Nation announced Bad Bunny will lead the halftime festivities from Levi\u2019s Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, the selection has provoked conversation.",
      "For his fans, Bad Bunny's booking at the Super Bowl is viewed as a landmark moment for Latino culture. That feeling is no doubt related to his just-concluded, 31-date residency in Puerto Rico that brought approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generated an estimated $733 million for the island.",

      "Fewer choices may be on the menu again as Medicare patients shop for prescription coverage this fall",
      "Fewer choices may be on the menu again as Medicare patients shop for prescription coverage this fall.",
      "The number of available, stand-alone drug plans has fallen for a few years, and that trend will continue for 2026. Most markets will still have several choices, but some options are becoming particularly sparse for shoppers with low-income subsidies. And help may be harder to find because some insurers no longer pay brokers commissions for new business.",
      "Shoppers have from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 to find new coverage that starts in January.",
      "Some things to consider:",
      "Regular Medicare, which most people qualify for after turning 65, does not come with prescription coverage, known as Part D. People must choose that separately.",
      "About 23 million people with regular Medicare have this standalone coverage, according to the non-profit KFF, which studies health care.",
      "Another roughly 34 million people have Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of Medicare that often come with prescription coverage.",
      "A typical shopper will be able to choose a standalone drug plan from among eight to 12 options for 2026, according to KFF Medicare expert Juliette Cubanski. That\u2019s down from 12 to 16 options in 2025.",
      "Shoppers had nearly 30 choices as recently as 2021, according to the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s Gretchen Jacobson.",
      "Depending on the state, a range of one to four plans will be available at no premium to people who qualify for low-income subsidies, according to KFF. Eight were available in 2021.",
      "Some insurers are reducing their presence in standalone Part D plans, while the Blue Cross-Blue Shield carrier Elevance is leaving the market entirely. Insurers and analysts who follow the industry note that the Inflation Reduction Act, which will cap annual out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,100 in 2026, puts more financial pressure on insurers. The same law now allows patients to spread the cost of prescriptions over the year.",
      "Most markets will have several choices. But experts say Medicare Part D customers don\u2019t like to shop, especially if they already have a plan that covers their medications. Finding affordable coverage for multiple prescriptions can be tricky.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of inertia and, frankly, people may be concerned that if they switch, they\u2019re going to end up worse off,\u201d Cubanski said.",
      "More people are being pushed to shop. Nearly 11% of those with standalone prescription drug coverage lost their plan in 2024, according to research published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "Before 2023, that figure was often under 1%, said Dr. Christopher Cai, one of the researchers involved in the study.",
      "Monthly premiums, or coverage prices, will fall nearly 10% on average to $34.50, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced last month.",

      "Individual prices will range widely, with premiums for the same plan varying by state, Cubanski noted.",
      "But while plans may provide lower coverage prices, they could also raise deductibles or offer more limited lists of covered drugs, which are called formularies. Shoppers should check these details.",
      "Insurers will be allowed to raise premiums by as much as $50 a month for 2026, up from a $35 increase allowed this year. But Cubanski said only some plans will hit that higher limit and not necessarily in all states.",
      "Shoppers can use a federal government website to compare plan prices and coverage.",

While climate anxiety has been studied in the United States and Europe, no study on mental health had been done with women in this region. There was no baseline.",
      "The university was already supporting Kenya\u2019s government in its data collection in Kilifi County. For its own research on mental health and climate change, it only had to add some questions.",
      "\u201cThe questions are quantitative: Do you have any suicidal thoughts, and if you do, do you have them every day, several days a week, a few times a month?\" Shah said. \"Then we asked them a set of about 15 questions related to climate shocks, and looked at the correlation between climate shocks and people saying that they are having suicidal thoughts.\u201d",
      "Shah said the survey of nearly 15,000 women produced some concerning signs. For example, he said, it appears that droughts and heat waves are linked with much higher levels of suicidal thoughts.",

      "District Judge Jackson Lofgren's said in his decision Wednesday that the law discriminates based on age and medical purpose, not sex, and that there's little evidence the Legislature passed the law for \u201can invidious discriminatory purpose.\u201d He also noted various concerns and ongoing debates over the medical treatments involved.",
      "\u201cThe evidence presented at trial establishes there is a legitimate concern regarding the capacity of minors to understand and appreciate the long-term consequences of the practices prohibited by the Health Care Law,\u201d the judge wrote, adding that he doesn't believe the law violates the state constitution.",
      "The ruling means parents who decided to seek gender-affirming medical care for their children after the state's ban took effect in April 2023 will need to do so out of state.",
      "\u201cThis ruling is devastating for transgender youth and their families in North Dakota. The evidence in this case was overwhelming: this law inflicts real harm, strips families of their constitutional rights, and denies young people the medical care they need to thrive,\u201d Jess Braverman, the legal director for the gender equity nonprofit Gender Justice, which represented the plaintiff, said in a statement.",

      "The lawsuit was brought by several affected families and a pediatric endocrinologist, but the judge dismissed some of their claims and left only the physician as a plaintiff.",
      "About half of U.S. states, nearly all of which have fully Republican-led governments, have banned gender-affirming care for minors.

That led the families to miss work and school so they could travel to Minnesota for treatment.",
      "The judge later said those kids can receive any medical care they were receiving before the law took effect, though that decision wasn\u2019t enough of a final ruling to satisfy attorneys for health care organizations. His Wednesday ruling granted a request that those kids' treatments continue, citing the law and his previous findings.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed a law phasing out certain ultraprocessed foods from school meals",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California will phase out certain ultraprocessed foods from school meals over the next decade under a first-in-the-nation law signed Wednesday by Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "The law seeks to define ultraprocessed foods, the often super-tasty products typically full of sugar, salt and unhealthy fats. The legislation requires the state\u2019s Department of Public Health to adopt rules by mid-2028 defining \u201cultraprocessed foods of concern\u201d and \u201crestricted school foods.\u201d",
      "Schools have to start phasing out those foods by July 2029, and districts will be barred from selling them for breakfast or lunch by July 2035. Vendors will be banned from providing the \u201cfoods of concern\u201d to schools by 2032.",
      "Newsom, flanked by first partner Jennifer Siebel Newsom and state lawmakers, signed the measure at a middle school in Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has never waited for Washington or anyone else to lead on kids\u2019 health \u2014 we\u2019ve been out front for years, removing harmful additives and improving school nutrition,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \"This first-in-the-nation law builds on that work to make sure every California student has access to healthy, delicious meals that help them thrive.\u201d",
      "Newsom issued an executive order earlier this year requiring the Department of Public Health to provide recommendations by April on limiting harms from ultraprocessed foods. The Democratic governor signed a law in 2023 banning certain synthetic food dyes from school meals.",
      "Legislatures across the country have introduced more than 100 bills in recent months seeking to ban or require labeling of chemicals that make up many ultraprocessed foods, including artificial dyes and controversial additives.",
      "Americans get more than half their calories from ultraprocessed foods, which have been linked to a host of health problems, including obesity, diabetes and heart disease. However, studies haven\u2019t been able to prove that the foods directly cause those chronic health problems.",
      "Defining ultraprocessed foods has been tricky. The most common definition is based on the four-tier Nova system developed by Brazilian researchers that classifies foods according to the amount of processing they undergo.",
      "Researchers often describe ultraprocessed foods as the types of products that contain industrially made ingredients that you won\u2019t find in a home kitchen.",
      "But some highly processed foods \u2013\u2014 think tofu, certain types of whole-grain bread and infant formula \u2013 can be healthful. And it\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s the processing of the foods or the combination of nutrients such as sugar, fat and salt that leads to poor health outcomes.",
      "U.S. health officials recently launched an effort to come up with a federal definition of ultraprocessed foods, saying there are concerns over whether current definitions \u201caccurately capture\u201d the range of foods that may affect health.",
      "Some critics of the ban say it is too broad and could unintentionally limit access to nutritious foods.",
      "\u201cFor foods served in schools, food and beverage manufacturers meet the rigorous unique safety and nutrition standards set by the USDA and state agencies,\" John Hewitt with the Consumer Brands Association said in a statement. He added the brands the association represents are committed to \u201cproviding safe, nutritious and convenient\u201d products.",
      "The California School Boards Association is concerned about the cost for districts to phase out these foods in the next few years. There is no extra money attached to the bill.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re borrowing money from other areas of need to pay for this new mandate,\" spokesperson Troy Flint said.",

      "Some school districts in California are already phasing out foods the law seeks to ban.",
      "Michael Jochner spent years working as a chef before taking over as director of student nutrition at the Morgan Hill Unified School District about eight years ago. He fully supports the ban.",
      "\u201cIt was really during COVID that I started to think about where we were purchasing our produce from and going to those farmers who were also struggling,\u201d he said.",
      "Now they don\u2019t serve any ultraprocessed foods, and all their items are organic and sourced within about 50 miles (80 kilometers) of the district, Jochner said. They removed sugary cereals, fruit juices and flavored milks, and deep-fried foods such as chicken nuggets and tater tots from their menus, he said.",
      "Many of their dishes are made from scratch or semi-homemade, including an item that has long been a staple in U.S. school cafeterias: pizza.",
      "Pizza is also a popular option for students in the Western Placer Unified district northeast of Sacramento, where Director of Food Services Christina Lawson has spent the past few years introducing more meals made from scratch to their school menus.",
      "She estimates up to 60% of school menus in the district are made up of dishes made from scratch, up from about 5% three years ago. They also purchase more foods locally to prepare a wide variety of items, including buffalo chicken quesadillas using tortillas made in nearby Nevada City.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really excited about this new law because it will just make it where there\u2019s even more options and even more variety and even better products that we can offer our students,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cBecause variety is the number one thing our students are looking for.\u201d",
      "Dr. Ravinder Khaira, a pediatrician in Sacramento who supports the law, said at a legislative hearing that the ban will help respond to a surge of chronic conditions in children fueled by poor nutrition.",
      "\u201cChildren deserve real access to food that is nutritious and supports their physical, emotional and cognitive development,\u201d Khaira said. \u201cSchools should be safe havens, not a source of chronic disease.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s a conservation headache for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), which is tasked with keeping people who share space with wildlife safe, while protecting the wildlife as well \u2014 especially endangered species. KWS estimates that \u201cjust over 2,000\u201d lions remain in Kenya.",

The second looked as if she was going to pass behind the car, but was distracted by the glint of a seatbelt buckle, which my daughter was absentmindedly playing with. The lioness stopped, turned to stare, then wandered up to us. Stretching her head up towards my child, she sniffed the buckle before taking it between her teeth.

      "Robert Roberson hopes he will again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome",
      "LIVINGSTON, Texas -- LIVINGSTON, Texas (AP) \u2014 Robert Roberson was calm and hopeful as he pondered his mortality and whether he could again avoid becoming the first person in the U.S. executed for a murder conviction tied to the diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "With days to go before his scheduled Oct. 16 execution, Roberson maintained his innocence in the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis, in the east Texas city of Palestine. He is set to die by lethal injection nearly a year to the day after a group of Texas lawmakers, who say he is innocent, secured an extraordinary last-minute court reprieve as Roberson waited outside the death chamber in Huntsville.",
      "Roberson said he was placing his hopes for another execution stay in the hands of his lawyers, his supporters and God.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to stress out and stuff because I know God has it, you know. He\u2019s in control. No matter what, God\u2019s in control, you know, and he does have the last say, you know,\u201d Roberson, 58, told The Associated Press last week as he sat behind a glass partition in the visiting area of the Polunsky Unit in Livingston, where Texas' male death row inmates are housed.",
      "During an hourlong interview, Roberson said he thinks about his daughter every day and what kind of life she would have today.",
      "Prosecutors at Roberson\u2019s 2003 trial argued he hit his daughter and violently shook her, causing severe head trauma and that she died from injuries related to shaken baby syndrome. Roberson\u2019s lawyers and some medical experts say his daughter died not from abuse but from complications related to pneumonia. They say his conviction was based on flawed and now outdated scientific evidence.",
      "The diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome refers to a serious brain injury caused when a child\u2019s head is hurt through shaking or some other violent impact, like being slammed against a wall or thrown on the floor.",
      "Roberson\u2019s attorneys have argued his undiagnosed autism helped convict him as authorities and medical personnel felt he didn\u2019t act like a concerned parent because his flat affect was seen as a sign of guilt.",
      "Last year, Roberson was on the verge of being put to death when a flurry of last-minute legal maneuvering on the night of his scheduled execution, including an unprecedented intervention by a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, stayed his lethal injection. In July, a judge set the new execution date, Roberson's third.",
      "During his interview with the AP, Roberson often would not keep eye contact and would repeat words or phrases \u2014 behaviors that experts say are associated with autism.",
      "\u201cThey assumed (guilt) because of the way I was acting, you know. And I didn\u2019t know I was autistic, you know, until years and years later, you know,\u201d said Roberson, who wasn\u2019t diagnosed with autism until 2018.",
      "Roberson\u2019s supporters and his legal team are again holding rallies and asking state and federal appeals courts and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to halt his execution. His supporters include both liberal and ultraconservative lawmakers, Texas GOP megadonor and conservative activist Doug Deason, bestselling author John Grisham and Brian Wharton, the former police detective who helped put together the case against him.",
      "\u201cThe whole world is watching. Texas, do not kill this innocent man,\u201d Wharton said during a rally Saturday outside the Texas Capitol building in Austin.",
      "The office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, as well as some medical experts and other family members of Nikki, maintain the girl died because of child abuse and that Roberson had a history of hitting his daughter.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming. \u2026 In my opinion he did it, 100%,\u201d Matthew Bowman, Nikki's half brother, told reporters in July. Bowman declined to speak with the AP.",
      "Abbott's office did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment. Abbott has the power to grant a one-time 30-day reprieve.",

      "Shaken baby syndrome has come under scrutiny in recent years as some lawyers and medical experts have argued the diagnosis has wrongly sent people to prison. Prosecutors and medical societies say it remains valid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a mystery what happened to Nikki. It was not shaking. It was her chronic, serious health conditions,\" Gretchen Sween, one of Roberson\u2019s lawyers, said at Saturday\u2019s rally. \"A crime didn\u2019t occur.\u201d",
      "But in a Sept. 26 op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, three pediatricians, including two with the Yale School of Medicine, said they reviewed the case and \u201care convinced that Nikki was a victim of child abuse.\u201d",
      "Roberson was arrested after he took Nikki to a hospital when she became unresponsive following a fall off their bed. He said he had never heard of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "\u201cIt was bad enough losing my little girl. And then when they accused me of it, I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Roberson said.",
      "In a press release issued after Roberson\u2019s execution was delayed last year as well as in recent court filings, Paxton\u2019s office has stressed that \u201cthis was no mere shaken baby case but involved a child who was beaten and received multiple blows to the head.\u201d Paxton\u2019s office said the jury \u201cdid not convict Roberson on the basis of \u2018Shaken Baby Syndrome.\u2019\u201d",
      "Yet one of the jurors who convicted Roberson, Terre Compton, told lawmakers last year that, \u201ceverything that was presented to us was all about shaken baby syndrome. That is what our decision was based on.\u201d",
      "Grisham, who is writing a book about the case, said Roberson's trial \u201cwas grossly unfair\u201d because his autism contributed to people believing he was guilty and his defense lawyers told jurors it was a case of shaken baby syndrome.",
      "Roberson said he remains optimistic he will one day get a chance to prove his innocence with a new trial.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not scared to die, but I\u2019m not ready to die, you know. I would like to believe God has more for me to do and stuff, you know,\u201d Roberson said.",

      "The plant is in an area under Russian control since early in Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and is not in service, but it needs reliable power to cool its six shutdown reactors and spent fuel, to avoid any catastrophic nuclear incidents.",
      "It has been operating on diesel generators since Sept. 23 when its last remaining external power line was severed in attacks that each side blamed on the other. The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly expressed alarm about the nuclear plant, Europe's biggest.",
      "The agency is proposing to restore external power to the plant in two phases, according to a European diplomat briefed on the proposal by the IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi. A Russian diplomat confirmed some aspects of the plan.",
      "Both diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the confidential negotiations publicly.",
      "During the first phase, a 1.5-kilometer-radius (1-mile-radius) ceasefire zone would be established to allow repair of the Dniprovska 750-kilovolt line, the main power line to the plant that has been damaged in an area under Russian control.",
      "During the second phase, a second such ceasefire zone would be established to repair the Ferosplavna-1 330-kilovolt backup line, which is in area under Ukraine's control.",
      "IAEA experts would be on hand to monitor the repairs, which originally were proposed for a 7-day period from Oct. 11 to Oct. 17, according to the European diplomat and confidential documents seen by the AP.",
      "However, although the Ukrainian side has given necessary guarantees of safe passage for repair crews, Russia did not give such guarantees in time for the work to start under that timetable, according to the European diplomat.",
      "The Russian diplomat, on the other hand, said that preparations for the repairs are under way and that they can start very soon.",
      "The IAEA declined to comment on the timing, saying only that Grossi was engaging \u201cintensively with both sides\u201d to enable the reconnection of power and to \u201chelp prevent a nuclear accident.\u201d",

      "A meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump could take place as early as Friday, the Ukrainian president said, adding that he also would meet with defense and energy companies and members of Congress.",

He said he also would seek further U.S. assistance to protect Ukraine\u2019s electricity and gas networks, which have faced relentless Russian bombardment. The U.S. visit follows what Zelenskyy described as a \u201cvery productive\u201d phone call with Trump on Sunday. Trump later warned Russia that he may send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles if Moscow doesn\u2019t settle its war there soon. The missiles would allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Russian territory.",
      "Moscow has expressed \u201cextreme concern\u201d over the U.S. potentially providing Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin himself has previously suggested that the U.S. supplying long-range missiles to Ukraine would seriously damage relations between Moscow and Washington.",
      "Zelenskyy will join a Ukrainian delegation already in the U.S. for preliminary talks, led by Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko. Russia has stepped up attacks in recent weeks targeting electricity and gas infrastructure ahead of winter, in an effort to cripple Ukraine\u2019s power grid ahead of freezing temperatures to erode public morale. Ukraine's State Emergency Service said the worst attacks early Monday using drones and missiles occurred around the Black Sea port of Odesa and in the northern Chernihiv region, where one person was killed.",

      "The Vatican office that regulates clergy sex abuse cases, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, said that the five judges named to hear the Rupnik case include women and priests who are external to the Vatican bureaucracy. In a statement, it said that such composition was \u201cdone in order to better guarantee, as in any judicial process, the autonomy and independence of the aforementioned court.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is set to learn Monday when and where he will serve time in prison for criminal conspiracy for a scheme to use funds from Libya to finance his winning 2007 campaign.",
      "The first ex-president in modern French history to be imprisoned, Sarkozy maintains his innocence and has protested the decision to put him behind bars pending his appeal.",
      "The National Financial Prosecutor's office, or PNF, will instruct the 70-year-old Sarkozy which prison to report to and when, in what is expected to be a relatively short and formal meeting on Monday afternoon.",
      "\u201cWe will tell him the date, the place and the hour he has to be there,\u201d said B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Dinh, the PNF's general secretary and spokesperson.",
      "But the PNF doesn't intend to make that information public, to spare Sarkozy the ordeal of being filmed at the start of his incarceration.",
      "While long retired from active politics, Sarkozy remains an influential figure in conservative circles. He served as president from 2007 to 2012. He was previously convicted in another corruption case but hasn\u2019t had to serve jail time.",
      "For safety reasons, Sarkozy is expected to be incarcerated under conditions reserved for high-profile inmates, possibly in a special \u201cVIP area\u201d of La Sant\u00e9 prison in Paris, where some of France\u2019s most notorious criminals have been imprisoned.",
      "Once behind bars, Sarkozy will be able to file a release request to the appeals court. Judges will then have up to two months to process the request.",
      "Sarkozy was handed a five-year sentence on Sept. 25 in a sprawling legal case after a decade of investigation. The Paris court said the prison sentence was effective immediately instead of suspending it pending appeal, citing \u201cthe seriousness of the disruption to public order caused by the offense.\u201d",

      "Sarkozy consistently has said he is innocent and the victim of a plot by people linked to the Libyan government.",
      "He suggested the allegations were retaliation for his call in 2011 for Gadhafi\u2019s removal. Gadhafi was toppled and killed amid Arab Spring pro-democracy protests that year.",

      "SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt -- SHARM EL SHEIKH, Egypt (AP) \u2014 The Egyptian president told a summit of world leaders Monday that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019sMideast proposal represents the \u201clast chance\u201d for peace in the region and reiterated his call for a two-state solution, saying Palestinians have the right to an independent state.",
      "The summit in Egypt's Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh was aimed at supporting the ceasefire reached in Gaza, ending the Israel-Hamas war and developing a long-term vision for governing and rebuilding the devastated Palestinian territory.",
      "The gathering appeared designed to rally international support behind the Trump vision for putting an end to the war. Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, the co-chair of the summit, told Trump \u201conly you\u201d can bring peace to the region.",
      "Trump\u2019s plan holds out the possibility of a Palestinian state, but only after a lengthy transition period in Gaza and a reform process by the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu opposes Palestinian independence. Trump made no mention of a two-state solution at the summit.",
      "In his own address to the summit, Trump called for a new era of harmony in the Middle East, saying that the region has \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime chance to put the old feuds and bitter hatreds behind us.\u201d He urged leaders \u201cto declare that our future will not be ruled by the fights of generations past.\u201d",
      "Israel and Hamas came under pressure from the United States, Arab countries and Turkey to agree on the first phase of the ceasefire deal negotiated in Qatar through mediators. It began Friday.",
      "On Monday, Trump, el-Sissi, the Qatari emir and the Turkish president signed a document. Trump said the document spelled out \"a lot of rules and regulations and lots of other things, and it\u2019s very comprehensive.\u201d The document was not shared with journalists in the room or made public.",
      "The summit unfolded soon after Hamas released 20 remaining living Israeli hostages and Israel started to free hundreds of Palestinians from its prisons, crucial steps under the ceasefire. But major questions remain over what happens next, raising the risk of a slide back into war.",
      "More than 20 world leaders attended the summit, including King Abdullah of Jordan, the French president and the British prime minister.",
      "A Turkish government official said Turkey launched \u201ca diplomatic initiative\u201d to prevent Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from attending the meeting, and after other countries backed the effort, Netanyahu decided not to come.",
      "The official would not confirm Turkish media reports that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's plane circled over the Red Sea as Erdogan threatened to boycott the meeting and that the plane landed only after it became clear that Netanyahu would not arrive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government rules.",
      "Earlier, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani had warned Egyptian and U.S. officials that he would withdraw from the summit if Netanyahu attended, according to the state-run Iraqi News Agency.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s office announced that he would not attend, citing a Jewish holiday.",
      "Israel has rejected any role in Gaza for the internationally backed Palestinian Authority, whose leader, Mahmoud Abbas, was in Sharm el-Sheikh.",

      "Directly tackling the issues in depth was unlikely at the gathering, which lasted only about three hours and was mostly ceremonial. During the summit, world leaders lined up one by one to have their photos taken with Trump, who smiled and gave a thumbs-up to photographers. Then el-Sissi welcomed Trump, invited him to the stage and asked him to join world leaders \u201cwho love peace.\u201d",

Trump\u2019s plan also stipulates that regional and international partners will work to develop the core of a new Palestinian security force.",
      "Abdelatty said the international force needs a U.N. Security Council resolution to endorse its deployment.",
      "He said Hamas will have no role in the transitional period in Gaza. A 15-member committee of Palestinian technocrats, with no affiliation with any Palestinian factions and vetted by Israel, will govern day to day affairs in Gaza. The committee would receive support and supervision from a \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d proposed by Trump to oversee the implementation of the phases of his plan, Abdelatty said.",

      "The 385 animals were introduced into an 8-square-mile \"sanctuary\" that will be increased in size until they have acclimatized fully and are ready to roam the larger park, said Donald Sutton, head of operations and development at Banhine.",
      "\u201cWe are contributing now to the biodiversity, the bigger biodiversity, of Banhine National Park,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich hopefully means that slowly but surely as the number of animals here increase and we release them into the greater Banhine National Park system, our tourism will increase as well.\u201d",
      "Banhine is the latest reserve identified for rehabilitation in Mozambique, which once boasted some of the region's richest wildlife resources, only for reserves to be left desolate by poaching, drought and a bloody 15-year civil war between 1977 and 1992.",

      "Rising tariff costs and other economic factors are forcing retailers to pull back or even delay their plans to hire seasonal workers",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year.",
      "American Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York's Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, the company took on 300 people during its busy period.",
      "The main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year\u2019s $600,000.",
      "\u201cThe issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it\u2019s too late,\" Casterella said. \u201dI think everyone\u2019s more mindful now than ever. \u201d",
      "Job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That's fewer than last year\u2019s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. The average seasonal gain since 2005 has been 653,363 workers, the firm said.",
      "Among other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, which powers deliveries for roughly 120 brands like Lands\u2019 End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year\u2019s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said.",
      "Bath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, lower than the 32,700 a year ago.",
      "Among the bright spots: Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago.",
      "\u201cWe saw real strong signals that there\u2019s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,\u201d Challenger's senior vice president Andy Challenger said. \u201cWe are having lots of regular conversations with companies about pending layoffs and changes they\u2019re making to their workforce.\u201d",
      "In addition to overall economic uncertainty, Challenger noted companies are using artificial intelligence bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he's also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them.",
      "Meanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy\u2019s are declining to offer figures, a departure from the past. UPS had hired 125,000 seasonal hires last year, while Target announced last year it planned to hire 100,000 workers. Macy's last year said it would hire 31,500 seasonal workers.",
      "Retailers' hiring plans mark the first clues to what\u2019s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has lost momentum this year, partly because Trump\u2019s trade wars have created uncertainty that's paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions.",
      "The Labor Department reported in early September that U.S. employers \u2014 companies, government agencies and nonprofits \u2014 added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected.",
      "The government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture.",
      "In an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday that mass firings of federal workers have started.",
      "The firings are happening as hundreds of thousands are already furloughed and still others are being required to report to duty without pay.",

Analysts will also be closely watching how shoppers will react as retailers push through price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said.",
      "Given an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts.",
      "Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase during the year-ago period.",

      "Given the uncertainty, companies increasingly want to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said.",
      "\u201cIn today's environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,\u201d Radial's Wnorowski said. \u201cRadial is meeting that need of the customer and the consumer with a more flexible and disciplined approach to hiring.\u201d",
      "So for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the holiday shopping season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff, she said. Radial is also speeding up training of holiday hires due to new technology that's simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Target said it's again embracing a three-prong approach. It starts first by offering current workers additional hours and then taps into a separate pool of workers\u2014 43,000\u2014 who pick up shifts that work for their schedules. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said.",
      "For the past few years, Walmart, the nation's largest retailer and the largest private employer, has been offering the extra hours available during the holidays to its workers, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it's worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been \u201coverwhelmingly positive.\u201d",
      "The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but the majority of stores will dole out those hours to current workers.",
      "Waiting until the last minute to hire workers could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that due to the slowing economy, they don't anticipate having a hard time finding the needed pool.",
      "Meanwhile, the temporary halting of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about forecasting sales and the workers they need to meet the demand.",
      "\u201cCertainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,\u201d Wnorowski of Radial said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we\u2019ll adjust as soon we see things changing.\u201d",

      "Rajoelina has faced weeks of Gen Z-led anti-government protests, which reached a pivotal point on Saturday when an elite military unit joined the protests and called for the president and other government ministers to step down. That prompted Rajoelina to say that an illegal attempt to seize power was underway in the Indian Ocean island and leave the country.",
      "\"I was forced to find a safe place to protect my life,\" Rajoelina said in his late-night speech, which was also meant to be shown on Madagascar television but was delayed for hours after soldiers attempted to take control of the state broadcaster buildings, according to the president's office.",
      "The speech was ultimately broadcast on the presidency's official Facebook page but not on national TV.",
      "They were Rajoelina's first public comments since the CAPSAT military unit turned against his government in an apparent coup and joined thousands of protesters rallying in a main square in the capital, Antananarivo, over the weekend.",
      "Rajoelina called for dialogue \u201cto find a way out of this situation\u201d and said the constitution should be respected. He did not say how he left Madagascar or where he was, but a report claimed he was flown out of the country on a French military plane.",
      "A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson declined to comment on that report.",
      "Madagascar is a former French colony and Rajoelina reportedly has French citizenship, which has been a source of discontent for some Madagascans for years.",
      "The anti-government protests began on Sept. 25 over chronic water and electricity outages but have snowballed into wider discontent with Rajoelina and his government.",
      "It is the most significant unrest in the island nation of 31 million people off the east coast of Africa since Rajoelina himself first came to power as the leader of a transitional government following a 2009 military-backed coup.",
      "The same elite CAPSAT military unit that rebelled against Rajoelina was prominent in him first coming to power in 2009.",
      "Rajoelina hasn't identified who was behind this attempted coup, but the CAPSAT unit has said it now controls all the armed forces in Madagascar and has appointed a new officer in charge of the military, which was accepted by the defense minister in Rajoelina's absence.",
      "CAPSAT appears to be in a position of authority and also has the backing of other military units, including the gendarmerie security forces.",
      "A commander of CAPSAT, Col. Michael Randrianirina, said the army had \u201cresponded to the people\u2019s calls\u201d but denied there was a coup. Speaking at the country\u2019s military headquarters on Sunday, he told reporters that it was up to the Madagascan people to decide what happens next, and if Rajoelina leaves power and a new election is held.",
      "Randrianirina said his soldiers had decided to stand with protesters and had exchanged gunfire with security forces who were attempting to quell weekend protests, and one of his soldiers was killed. But there was no major fighting on the streets, and soldiers riding on armored vehicles and waving Madagascar flags were cheered by people in Antananarivo.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Madagascar still advised American citizens to shelter in place because of a \u201chighly volatile and unpredictable\u201d situation. The African Union urged all parties, \u201cboth civilian and military, to exercise calm and restraint.\u201d",

      "Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt have won the Nobel memorial prize in economics for explaining innovation-driven economic growth",
      "STOCKHOLM -- STOCKHOLM (AP) \u2014 Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt won the Nobel memorial prize in economics Monday for their research into the impact of innovation on economic growth and how new technologies replace older ones, a key economic concept known as \u201ccreative destruction.\u201d",
      "The winners represent contrasting but complementary approaches to economics. Mokyr is an economic historian who delved into long-term trends using historical sources, while Howitt and Aghion relied on mathematics to explain how creative destruction works.",
      "Dutch-born Mokyr, 79, is from Northwestern University; Aghion, 69, from the Coll\u00e8ge de France and the London School of Economics; and Canadian-born Howitt, 79, from Brown University.",
      "Mokyr was still trying to get his morning coffee when he was reached on the phone by an AP reporter, and said he was shocked to win the prize.",
      "\u201cPeople always say this, but in this case I am being truthful \u2014 I had no clue that anything like this was going to happen,\u201d he said.",
      "His students had asked him about the possibility he would win the Nobel, he said. \u201cI told them that I was more likely to be elected Pope than to win the Noel Prize in economics \u2014 and I am Jewish by the way.\u201d",
      "Mokyr will turn 80 next summer but said he has no plans to retire. \u201cThis is the type of job that I dreamed about my entire life,\u201d he said.",
      "Aghion said he was shocked by the honor. \u201cI can\u2019t find the words to express what I feel,\" he said by phone to the press conference in Stockholm. He said he would invest his prize money in his research laboratory.",
      "Asked about current trade wars and protectionism in the world, Aghion said that: \u201cI am not welcoming the protectionist way in the US. That is not good for ... world growth and innovation.\u201d",
      "The winners were credited with better explaining and quantifying \u201ccreative destruction,\u201d a key concept in economics that refers to the process in which beneficial new innovations replace \u2014 and thus destroy \u2014 older technologies and businesses. The concept is usually associated with economist Joseph Schumpeter, who outlined it in his 1942 book \u201cCapitalism, Socialism and Democracy.\u201d",
      "The Nobel committee said Mokyr \u201cdemonstrated that if innovations are to succeed one another in a self-generating process, we not only need to know that something works, but we also need to have scientific explanations for why.\u201d",

More recently, Aghion co-chaired the Artificial Intelligence Commission, which in 2024 submitted a report to Macron outlining 25 recommendations to position France as a leading force in the field of AI.",

      "One half of the 11 million Swedish kronor (nearly $1.2 million) prize goes to Mokyr and the other half is shared by Aghion and Howitt. Winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and a diploma.",
      "The economics prize is formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. The central bank established it in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish businessman and chemist who invented dynamite and established the five Nobel Prizes.",
      "Since then, it has been awarded 57 times to a total of 99 laureates. Only three of the winners have been women.",

      "Cruz, now a 61-year-old living in Arizona, had spent five years working in the environmental department when Powerine Oil Company said it would close the plant in Santa Fe Springs, southeast of Los Angeles.",
      "Cruz feared getting laid off again if he stayed in the industry. He decided to look into respiratory therapy, in part because he\u2019s asthmatic. A federal job training program paid for his schooling.",

      "Thousands \u2014 perhaps tens of thousands \u2014 of workers could lose jobs in the coming years as California tries to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Energy company Valero said earlier this year it would close a refinery in the Bay Area.",

      "State energy regulators are negotiating to keep the Valero plant open and recently backed off a proposal to penalize oil companies for high profits, while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation to speed oil well permitting in the Central Valley. That action came after years of Newsom declaring he was \u201ctaking on big oil.\u201d",

      "California was the eighth-largest crude oil producer in the nation in 2024, down from being the third-largest in 2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Valero and Phillips 66 refineries set to close account for roughly 18% of California\u2019s refining capacity, according to state energy regulators. They both produce jet fuel, gas and diesel.",
      "The Phillips 66 refinery will start shutting down this month and end active fuel production at the end of 2025, the company said. The closure is based on multiple factors and \u201cin response to market dynamics,\" Phillips 66 said.",
      "The announcement came after Newsom signed a law last year aimed at preventing gas price spikes that allows energy regulators to require that refineries keep a certain amount of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when they go offline for maintenance. But the company said its decision was unrelated to the law.",

It was the first high-profile Syrian visit to Lebanon since insurgent groups overthrew President Bashar Assad\u2019s government in early December 2024.",
      "Lebanon and Syria have been working to rebuild strained ties, focusing on the status of roughly 2,000 Syrian nationals detained in Lebanese prisons, border security, locating Lebanese nationals missing in Syria for years and facilitating the return of Syrian refugees.",
      "The current Syrian leadership resents Lebanon\u2019s Iran-backed Hezbollah group for taking part in Syria\u2019s civil war, fighting alongside Assad\u2019s forces, while many Lebanese still grudge Syria\u2019s 29-year domination of its smaller neighbor, where it had a military presence for three decades until 2005.",
      "Following their meeting, al-Shibani and Lebanese Foreign Minister Joe Rajji announced at a news conference that the Lebanese-Syrian Higher Council has been suspended and all dealings will be restricted to official diplomatic channels.",
      "Created in 1991, the council symbolized Syria\u2019s influence over Lebanon. Its role declined after Syria\u2019s 2005 withdrawal, the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and the 2008 opening of the Syrian Embassy in Beirut, which marked Syria\u2019s first official recognition of Lebanon as an autonomous state since it gained independence from France in 1943.

      "Meanwhile, Lebanon hosts an estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees who fled the uprising-turned-civil war that erupted more than 14 years ago. Since Assad\u2019s fall in December, around 850,000 refugees have returned to Syria from neighboring countries as of September, with the number expected to rise, according to UNHCR Deputy High Commissioner Kelly T. Clements. Lebanese authorities granted an exemption to Syrians staying illegally if they left by the end of August.",

More than 5 million Syrians fled the country as refugees, most of them to neighboring countries, including Lebanon, which has the highest number of refugees per capita in the world.",

      "Meanwhile, the Lebanon-Syria border has long been a flashpoint for clashes, with periodic exchanges of fire and infiltration attempts, particularly in the northeastern Bekaa Valley. In March 2025, the two countries signed an agreement to demarcate the border and enhance security coordination, aiming to prevent disputes and curb smuggling and other illicit activities.",

      "The head of Japan\u2019s Komeito says it is leaving the ruling coalition headed by the Liberal Democratic Party due to concerns over corruption",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 The head of Japan's Komeito says it is leaving the ruling coalition headed by the Liberal Democratic Party due to concerns over corruption, in a major setback for the woman who hopes to become the country's next prime minister.",
      "The decision announced Friday by Komeito leader Tetsuo Saito deals a serious blow to the Liberal Democrats, who last weekend chose Sanae Takaichi, an ultra-conservative lawmaker, as its leader.",
      "Takaichi could still become Japan's first female prime minister, but the departure of the Buddhist-backed Komeito will compel the Liberal Democrats to find at least one other coalition partner in order to stay in power.",
      "Speaking to reporters, she said Saito had \u201cone-sidedly announced the decision to leave the coalition\u201d even though she and her deputy, LDP Secretary General Shunichi Suzuki, had said the Liberal Democrats would discuss the issues he raised and respond promptly.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been together for 26 years and it was extremely disappointing, but this is how we ended up,\u201d Takaichi said.",
      "The ruling coalition had already lost its majorities in both houses of parliament. The lower house is due to vote on a new prime minister later this month.",
      "Saito said his party, which has been a coalition partner with the Liberal Democrats for 26 years, had raised several concerns in a meeting with its leaders.",
      "They include objections to Takaichi's stance about Japan's wartime history and her visits to Yasukuni Shrine, seen as a symbol of its past militarism. Another was Takaichi's hardline position toward foreigners, part of a backlash against growing numbers of foreign workers and tourists.",
      "But the deciding factor, he said, was the Liberal Democrats' response to scandals over the use of political slush funds.",
      "Saito said he found Takaichi's response to his concerns over history, the Yasukuni visits and foreigners to be acceptable. But he said she showed a lack of \u201csincerity\u201d about doing more to clean up corruption.",
      "\u201cThe LDP\u2019s response was that it will think about it, which was highly insufficient and extremely disappointing,\u201d Saito said.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron is set to appoint a new prime minister on Friday to break a political deadlock",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 After a week of intense political turmoil, French President Emmanuel Macron is set to appoint a new prime minister Friday in his latest bid to break the political deadlock that has gripped the country for more than a year, as France struggles with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt.",
      "The appointment is widely seen as the president\u2019s last chance to revive his second term, which runs until 2027. With no majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces increasingly fierce criticism, even from within his own camp, and has little room to maneuver.",
      "Outgoing Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu abruptly resigned Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor within 48 hours.",
      "Over the past year, Macron\u2019s successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union\u2019s second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France\u2019s public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.",
      "France\u2019s poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.",
      "The economic and political struggles are worrying financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission, which has been pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt.",

      "Macron may turn to a figure from the left, which managed to form a coalition in the 2024 legislative elections, or opt for a technocratic government to sidestep partisan deadlock.",
      "In any case, the new prime minister will have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon the pension reform that gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Macron fought fiercely for the deeply unpopular measure, which was enacted into law in 2023 despite mass protests.",
      "Lecornu argued that Macron\u2019s centrist bloc, its allies, and parts of the opposition could still rally to form a working majority. \u201cThere\u2019s a majority that can govern,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult.\u201d",
      "The stalemate stems from Macron\u2019s shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France\u2019s spiraling deficit and public debt.",
      "Without stable support, Macron\u2019s governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu\u2019s resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president\u2019s coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries.",

Decades ago dubbed Morocco\u2019s \u201cKing of the Poor,\u201d he now faces a public expressing disillusionment with slow progress and widening economic divides.",
      "Since Sept. 27, protesters have filled the streets of more than a dozen Moroccan cities, denouncing the billions being poured into preparations for the 2030 FIFA World Cup.",
      "Angered by underfunded schools and hospitals, the \u201cGen Z 212\u201d movement has drawn a direct line between new stadiums and neglected public services, mobilizing a nationwide movement unlike any seen since the Arab Spring in 2011.

      "\u201cRegardless of the infrastructure built, and the level of economic development achieved, I would be satisfied only if our accomplishments contribute, in a tangible manner, to improving the living conditions of citizens from all social classes, and in all areas and regions,\u201d he said in a July speech in Tetouan, the coastal town where he spends much of the summer.",
      "The speech will come more than a week after protesters sent a letter of demands sent directly to the palace, thrusting the king into the spotlight and upending the careful distance he usually maintains from public debate. It called for the dismissal of Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch and his government, the release of political detainees, and the creation of a forum to hold corrupt politicians accountable.",
      "\u201cWe, the youth of Morocco, are requesting your majesty to intervene for a profound and just reform that restores rights and punishes the corrupt,\u201d the group wrote in the letter.",

      "A family that runs two costume stores in Chicago is putting a creative twist on Halloween this year due to tariffs on Chinese imports",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 With Halloween on the horizon, Chicago Costume is stuffed. Packaged costumes, including superheros and Japanese animation characters in both kid and adult sizes, dangle near colorful wigs and bottles of fake blood. Downstairs, vintage clothes from the 1970s beg for one more boogie night.",
      "The frightening possibilities mask the work that\u2019s gone on behind the scenes to stock the family-owned shop and its sister store for the spooky season. Owner Courtland Hickey said he ordered 40% fewer costumes this year because of President Donald Trump's tariffs on products from China.",
      "To fill the gap, Hickey and his mother, Chicago Costume founder Mary Hickey Panayotou, looked to their decade's worth of unsold costumes and accessories to see what could be repackaged or repurposed. The tariffs made new imports more expensive, and storewide price increases might spook customers, he said.",
      "\u201cIf people have less money in their pocket to spend, ... then costumes are going to be lower on their list,\u201d Hickey said. \u201cSo the more we have to invest in new products, the riskier it is for the business because we aren\u2019t going to sell it.\u201d",
      "Tapping the old inventory required sorting through several thousand items stored in backrooms and a warehouse. Vintage pieces once reserved for rentals combined with fresh items became sets. A surplus of black robes became the foundation for Halloween wizards, judges, choir members and graduating students, Hickey said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a staple piece that gets transformed by the accessories we pair with them,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of Chicago Costume's 35 employees also got busy sewing fabric scraps and foam material into imitations of the miter headdresses worn by high-ranking Catholic clergy. Paired with a robe, the headwear would let someone dress up as Pope Leo, a Chicago native.",
      "Panayotou founded Chicago Costume in 1976 by custom-designing and renting costumes for the Windy City\u2019s theater companies. It fast became a destination for non-actors looking for Halloween outfits.",
      "Commercially made children\u2019s costumes followed, and a stockpile of capes, masquerade masks, \u201cStar Wars\u201d kits and other leftovers grew from there.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of a hoarder,\u201d Panayotou said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to throw stuff away. So there\u2019s a lot of accessory items and pieces. Here\u2019s the dress, but we have only one glove.\u201d",
      "Having excess inventory typically is avoided in retail, but the practice has given Chicago Costume a supply cushion during what has been an unpredictable 2025 for import-reliant segments of the industry, including toy manufacturers and stores.",
      "Hickey said tariffs weren't on his radar until he and and other Chicago Costume staff members met with suppliers at the Halloween & Party Expo in January. Whether Trump would impose duties on Chinese goods after his inauguration the following week was a big topic of conversation at the Las Vegas event, he said.",
      "On Feb. 1, the president signed the first tariff order of his second term. Hickey already had ordered his usual number of new costumes but put fulfillment and delivery on hold when the tariff rate on imports from China ballooned to 145% in April. Nearly 90% of the costumes Chicago Costume sells in stores and online are made in China, in line with the costume industry average, he said.",
      "Some suppliers already had products ready and said they would not charge him extra, Hickey said. Others said he would have to pay more to cover the cost of tariffs. \u201cTake it or leave it,\u201d he recalls being told. \u201cI pretty much left it.\u201d",
      "Other small businesses that rely on Halloween describe similar their own tariff-related woes. Trick or Treat Studios, which designs masks based on characters from popular horror movies as well as costumes and props, laid off 15 employees, one-fourth of its staff, in May, co-founder Christopher Zephro said.",
      "Zephro uses factories in China to make plastic masks but said he is reducing the amount of work done there and shifting it to Mexico, where his latex masks are manufactured. In the meantime, he raised prices by 15%.",

      "At Chicago Costume, which generates well under $1 million dollars in annual sales, shoppers will see fewer sales promotions and discounts, Hickey said. Children\u2019s costumes of officially licensed characters and bulky sets will cost at least 25% more, he said. A lederhosen costume, for example, is priced at $49.99, or $10 more that it did a year ago.",
      "Hickey, who has served on the board of the National Costumers Association for 20 years, initially saw a silver lining in Trump's tariffs. Big retail chains have siphoned sales from independent costume shops with the help of cheap costumes from China, he said.",
      "In May, Hickey published a column on the National Costumers Association's website that outlined Chicago Costume's can-do, environmentally superior approach this year. He hoped it would galvanize the trade group's 100 independent store members \u2014 a group that numbered 220 a decade ago \u2014 to dust off old stock, reorganize their shops and prepare for \u201ca potentially great Halloween.\u201d",
      "Tariffs have \u201cpeeled back the curtain on just how deep our reliance on cheap overseas manufacturing has become,\" he wrote. \u201cIf this shift hurts Amazon dropshippers, Spirit Halloween, or Walmart\u2019s over-imported costume lines, I\u2019m not going to mourn. In fact, I see it as a chance for us to reclaim what made local retail special.\"",
      "Some of Hickey's idealism has since faded. The impact of tariffs on Halloween played out differently than he expected. The largest retail chains doubled down, flooding the market with cheap costumes and dropping prices to hold onto customers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a lot harder than I hoped, but I still believe that optimism, adaptability, and differentiation are what will keep independent costume shops like us alive,\u201d he said.",
      "Chicago Costume is used to embracing challenges. To keep revenue flowing year-round, the stores cater to cosplay fans and themed parties. The Hickey-Panayotou family has a separate business making mascot costumes for the Chicago Bulls and other professional sports teams, and acquired a theatrical services company founded in 1886 along with its collection of period pieces.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Prince Harry and Meghan Markle urged parents to stand against social media companies that they said prey upon children with exploitative algorithms as the \u201cexplosion of unregulated artificial intelligence\u201d adds to their concerns that technologies' benefits are inseparable from its dangers.",
      "To underscore that point, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex cited research from advocacy group ParentsTogether that found researchers posing as children experienced harmful interactions every five minutes they spent with an artificial intelligence chatbot.",
      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t content created by a third party. These were the companies\u2019 own chatbots working to advance their own depraved internal policies,\" said Prince Harry at Spring Studios in Manhattan Thursday night as he and Markle were named Humanitarians of the Year by the nonprofit Project Healthy Minds. \"But here\u2019s what gives us hope: these families aren\u2019t facing this alone.\u201d",
      "To build their movement of families fighting for online safety, the couple also announced Thursday that their foundation's Parents Network would join forces with ParentsTogether.",
      "Their remarks came at the annual gala for Project Healthy Minds, a Millennial- and Gen Z-driven tech nonprofit that runs a free online marketplace aiming to connect patients with the exact mental health care they seek.",
      "The couple has made youth mental health a cornerstone of their philanthropic work since launching the Archewell Foundation in 2020 after stepping aside as working royals. Through its network for families who have experienced online harm and support of youth-led organizations shaping responsible technology, the nonprofit works to make digital spaces safer.",
      "Prince Harry has previously stressed the need to hold powerful social media companies accountable. He warned last year that young people are experiencing an \u201cepidemic\u201d of anxiety, depression and social isolation driven by negative experiences online.",
      "According to numerous studies, few guardrails exist to mitigate kids' exposure to age-inappropriate content including pornography and violence on social media, where they also face cyberbullying and sexual harassment.",
      "The issue could also be considered personal for the couple. Markle has been open about her mental health struggles due to what she describes as the royal family\u2019s intense pressures and tabloid attacks. Harry's own personal life has been the subject of much tabloid reporting, including targeted phone hacking and surveillance.",
      "Prince Harry brought his awareness campaign to a reception Wednesday night hosted by men's health nonprofit Movember. In a conversation with television journalist Brooke Baldwin, he emphasized that men should not feel isolated because he repeatedly hears the same struggles when he speaks with them.",
      "\u201cThe biggest barrier is the belief that no one will understand,\u201d he said in comments reshared on his blog. \"Loneliness convinces you you\u2019re the only one, which is rarely true.\u201d",
      "\u201cCulture makers\u201d such as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are important voices in mental health conversations because they inspire their enormous audiences to seek care, according to Project Healthy Minds CEO Phil Schermer.",

      "The NBA seems on the brink of making it possible.",
      "Changes to the All-Star format are most certainly coming, once again, and the plan that the NBA has settled on is one that has U.S. players going up against players from the rest of the world in a tournament setting. Think Ryder Cup golf or 4 Nations Face-Off hockey, and it just so happens that this season\u2019s All-Star weekend at Inglewood, California, is smack in the middle of another national-pride sporting event \u2014 the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics.",
      "\u201cI talk to a lot of fans, and All-Star Games for whatever reason take on particular interest around basketball,\u201d NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said. \u201cI think we should be able to create something that\u2019s fun, exciting, engaging. Not expecting guys to play the way they would in the finals necessarily or even in a playoff game, but yet to go out, play hard, put on a good show for the fans.\u201d",
      "The plan, which isn\u2019t yet finalized, calls for a three-team tournament: two American teams and one international team, all with eight-man rosters. The reason: Roughly two-thirds of NBA players are American and one-third are not, which is why the NBA thinks it\u2019d be fair to give Americans two-thirds of the roster spots.",
      "\u201cHopefully, it\u2019s going to be better,\u201d said Jokic, the Denver star.",
      "It has become almost an annual exercise for the NBA: fixing the All-Star Game. Silver and other league officials \u2014 and to be fair, some players as well \u2014 desperately want the product to be better and more competitive. They tried having captains like LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Antetokounmpo pick the teams for a few years, and not much changed. They tried go back to the standard Eastern Conference vs. Western Conference format, and it wasn\u2019t great either. Having a final score of 211-186 in Indianapolis in 2024 was the last straw in many respects, so the NBA last year tried a mini-tournament on for size and few people cared for that.",
      "Golden State\u2019s Stephen Curry was MVP of that All-Star event, a four-teams-of-eight competition that had a 41-25 final score in the title matchup and saw the final game stopped for about 20 minutes for a tribute to TNT and its run as a league broadcaster.",
      "\u201cI honestly thought last year went great until it dragged on for a long time,\u201d Curry said. \u201cWe all know that All-Star has changed over the years, but there has to be some type of solution for keeping the players fresh and loose and keeping the action going. Last year it came to a screeching halt. But whatever the format is, I know we\u2019re going to keep taking swings at the plate to figure it out, and that\u2019s what the league is supposed to do.\u201d",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Memphis coach Tuomas Iisalo told the Grizzlies as they left last spring to be ready to play faster when they returned.",
      "Now they see just how fast Iisalo wants the Grizzlies moving.",
      "\u201cWe all might need inhalers,\u201d two-time All-Star Ja Morant said. \u201dYou know what you need an inhaler for? That tells you everything you need to know.\u201d",
      "Iisalo didn't get the chance over the last nine games of the regular season or through Memphis' first-round loss to eventual NBA champ Oklahoma City to change up much for the Grizzlies. But they quickly took off his interim tag. The Grizzlies spent the summer retooling the roster around their pair of two-time All-Stars in Morant and Jaren Jackson Jr.",
      "They traded Desmond Bane for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and four first-round draft picks. They brought back forward Santi Aldama, traded up in the draft for guard Cedric Coward at No. 11 and took guard Javon Small. Memphis brought in veterans like center Jock Landale and guard Ty Jerome.",
      "\u201cWe're trying to reach the highest level of the NBA, an NBA that\u2019s changing in 2025 of the style of play and the build of a roster that you\u2019re seeing reach the highest end outcomes,\u201d general manager Zach Kleiman said.",
      "Part of that included trusting Iisalo to take over after Memphis frittered away a top-tier seed in the Western Conference. They played their way to the No. 8 seed before being swept by the Thunder.",
      "Morant said the Grizzlies spent the offseason working to be ready for what he called the toughest first day of training camp he's had yet going into his seventh NBA season. The true test starts Oct. 22 when Memphis hosts New Orleans in the season opener.",
      "\u201cDo I think it can last a whole season?\u201d Morant said. \"Probably. Probably so if we just keep it up.\u201d",
      "Coward, who played only six games at Washington last season, got his clue of what the Grizzlies wanted during his pre-draft workouts: \u201cI mean, they had me doing full-court sprints and running as I do in the games.\u201d",
      "Memphis led the NBA last season with the fastest pace of 103.69 possessions per 48 minutes, so improving on that might be a bit challenging. The phrase \u201cspeed kills\u201d is being used as part mantra and part desired play style.",
      "Iisalo sees it as a philosophy of how he wants his Grizzlies to be fast at everything, including pace of play. He doesn't want to waste anyone's time, not in a league with little time to recover before the next game.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also the decision-making, quick decision making in different situations,\u201d Iisalo said. \"And generally, if you can be the faster party, it\u2019s going to be very difficult for the other team to keep up with you.\u201d",
      "On defense, Iisalo wants the Grizzlies to get their defensive rating as low as possible, rebound better, protect the rim and generally be difficult to play against. Iisalo recalled an Italian soccer coach's team being compared to visiting a dentist.",
      "\u201cIt should be an unpleasant experience,\u201d Iisalo said.",
      "That would fit in Memphis' proud tradition of grit and grind. Landale remembers too well tough nights feeling like a dog fight as the visitor playing the Grizzlies.",

      "The Detroit Lions had a tough night against the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 A long, frustrating night for the Detroit Lions inside Arrowhead Stadium ended with Brian Branch delivering a punch to Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, setting off a brief fistfight among players from both teams.",
      "It was about as much fight as the Lions showed all night.",
      "They were dominated on both sides of the ball by a Kansas City team coming off a mistake-filled mess in Jacksonville with no interest in falling two games below .500. Indeed, the Chiefs shut down the prolific Detroit offense, holding it to less than half its season scoring average, and their own offense romped up and down the field on the way to a 30-17 victory Sunday night.",
      "\u201cWe got worked pretty good,\u201d Lions coach Dan Campbell admitted afterward.",
      "Afterward is when the real fireworks happened.",
      "As red ones were set bursting over the stadium to celebrate the Chiefs' victory, Patrick Mahomes tried to give a high-five to Branch as they met near midfield. The Lions safety walked right past the Kansas City quarterback and Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster took umbrage with the move, walking up to Branch and having a few words with him.",
      "Branch responded by throwing a right hook that knocked Smith-Schuster to the ground.",
      "The veteran wide receiver leaped to his feet and went after Branch, who played through an ankle injury that had kept him out of practice most of the week. Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco tried to get between them, but Branch succeeded in ripping Smith-Schuster's helmet off as dozens of players from both teams converged on the scrum.",
      "\u201cI did a little childish thing,\u201d Branch said, \u201cbut I'm tired of people doing stuff in between the play and refs don't catch it. They be trying to bully me out there and I don't \u2014 I shouldn't have did it. It was childish.\u201d",
      "Eventually, coaches and players managed to separate the parties, and they finally left the field for the locker room. Branch could be facing yet another hefty fine \u2014 he was docked $23,186 for face-masking and unsportsmanlike conduct penalties against Green Bay last month \u2014 and perhaps even a suspension for his actions.",
      "\u201cI love Brian Branch,\u201d Campbell said, \u201cbut what he did is inexcusable, and it's not going to be accepted here. It's not what we do. It's not what we're about. I apologized to Coach (Andy) Reid and the Chiefs, and Smith-Schuster. That's not OK. That's not what we do here. It's not going to be OK. He knows it. Our team knows it. That's not what we do.\u201d",
      "Smith-Schuster came away with a bloody nose from the punch.",

      "The loss snapped a four-game win streak for Detroit, which was trying to pull off a rare feat by winning two consecutive games in Arrowhead Stadium. Instead, the Lions allowed 355 yards of total offense, forced just one punt, and were unable to make the stops they needed late in the fourth quarter to give their offense a chance to mount a comeback.",
      "Jared Goff finished with just 203 yards passing, though he did have touchdown throws to Jameson Williams and Sam LaPorta, while Amon-Ra St. Brown was held to 45 yards receiving. Jahmyr Gibbs needed 17 carries for 65 yards, and nine for 32 came on the game's opening drive, when Detroit marched right down field for what looked like a touchdown.",
      "David Montgomery took a direct snap near the goal line and threw to Goff, who had gone into motion, caught the pass and then barreled into the end zone. But long after the play had finished, the officials huddled and decided that Goff never got set \u2014 even though no flags were thrown on the flag \u2014 and the illegal motion penalty wiped away the the touchdown.",
      "After a delay-of-game penalty, the Lions had to settle for a field goal and a 3-0 lead.",
      "It was just the start of a frustrating night for Campbell and his team.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't matter if I agree or disagree (with the penalty),\u201d he said. \u201cThey said he never stopped. He stayed in motion. You can't stay in motion. But that had no bearing on the game. We lost by 13 points.\u201d",

      "Mahomes threw for 257 yards and three touchdowns, scrambled for another score, and led Kansas City to a 30-17 victory that was so comprehensive that Lions safety Brian Branch boiled over at its conclusion. Branch delivered a right hook to Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster as the teams were coming together at midfield, touching off a brief melee among players.",

      "Detroit was intent on trying to grind down the Chiefs' defense and keep their potent offense off the field.",
      "The Lions did a good job on the opening drive, too. They ran 15 plays over a 9:39 span, chewing up so much clock that Mahomes looked downright bored on the sideline. And it looked as if it would pay off when David Montgomery took a direct snap and threw to Goff, who powered into the end zone from a yard out for a touchdown.",
      "But the officials came together to discuss the play, and even though nobody had thrown a flag, they eventually said Goff was not set \u2014 an illegal motion penalty. After a delay of game, the Lions had to settle for Jake Bates' chip-shot field goal.",

      "U.S. lawmakers and national security officials are increasingly alarmed that long-standing research ties between the U.S. and China could give China an advantage when it comes to developing new military technology",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For many years, American and Chinese scholars worked shoulder to shoulder on cutting-edge technologies through open research, where findings are freely shared and accessible to all. But that openness, a long-standing practice celebrated for advancing knowledge, is raising alarms among some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "They are worried that China \u2014 now considered the most formidable challenger to American military dominance \u2014 is taking advantage of open research to catch up with the U.S. on military technology and even gain an edge. And they are calling for action.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, our adversaries have exploited American colleges and universities to advance their interests, while risking our national security and innovation,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He has introduced legislation to put new restrictions on federally funded research collaboration with academics at several Chinese institutions that work with the Chinese military, as well as institutions in other countries deemed adversarial to U.S. interests.",
      "The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party makes it a priority to protect American research, having accused Beijing of weaponizing open research by converting it into a \u201cpipeline of foreign talent and military modernization.\u201d",
      "The rising concerns on Capitol Hill threaten to unravel deep, two-generations-old academic ties between the countries even as the world's two largest economies are moving away from each other through tariffs and trade barriers. The relationship has shifted from engagement to competition, if not outright enmity.",
      "\"Foreign adversaries are increasingly exploiting the open and collaborative environment of U.S. academic institutions for their own gain,\u201d said James Cangialosi, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which in August issued a bulletin urging universities to do more to protect research from foreign meddling.",
      "The House committee released three reports in September alone. They targeted, respectively, Pentagon-funded research involving military-linked Chinese scholars; joint U.S.-China institutes that train STEM talent for China; and visa policies that have brought military-linked Chinese students to Ph.D. programs at American universities. The reports recommend more legislation to protect U.S. research, tighter visa policies to vet Chinese students and scholars and an end to academic partnerships that could be exploited to boost China\u2019s military powers.",
      "More than 500 U.S. universities and institutes have collaborated with Chinese military researchers in recent years, helping Beijing develop advanced technologies with military applications, such as anti-jamming communications and hypersonic vehicles, according to a report by the private U.S. intelligence group Strider Technologies.",
      "Despite efforts in recent years by the U.S. government to set up guardrails to prevent such collaboration from boosting China\u2019s military capabilities, the practice is still prevalent, according to Strider, based in Salt Lake City, Utah.",
      "The report identified nearly 2,500 publications produced in collaboration between U.S. entities and Chinese military-affiliated research institutes in 2024 on STEM research, which includes physics, engineering, material science, computer science, biology, medicine and geology. While the number peaked at more than 3,500 in 2019, before some new restrictive measures came into effect, the level of collaboration remains high, the report said.",
      "This collaboration not only facilitates \u201cpotential illicit knowledge transfer,\u201d but supports China's \u201cstate-directed efforts to recruit top international talent, often to the detriment of U.S. national interests,\u201d the report said.",

Stealing the fruits of that labor, however, can be as easy as hacking into a university network, hiring away researchers or coopting the research itself. That\u2019s why, authorities say, it\u2019s so tempting for American adversaries looking to take advantage of U.S. institutions and research.",
      "The most recent threat assessment report from the Department of Homeland Security highlights concerns that American adversaries \u2014 and China specifically \u2014 seek to illicitly acquire U.S. technology. Authorities say China aims to steal military and computing technology that might give the U.S. an advantage, as well as the latest commercial innovations.",
      "Abigail Coplin, assistant professor of sociology and science, technology and society at Vassar College, said there are already guardrails for federally funded research to protect classified information and anything deemed sensitive.",
      "She also said open research goes both ways, benefiting the U.S. as well, and restrictions could be counterproductive by driving away talents.",
      "\u201cAmerican national security interests and economic competitiveness would be better served by continuing \u2014 if not increasing \u2014 research funding than they are by implementing costly research restrictions,\u201d Coplin said.",
      "Arnie Bellini, a tech entrepreneur and investor, also said efforts to protect U.S. research risk stifling progress if they go too far and prevent U.S. colleges or startups from sharing information about new and emerging technology. Keeping up with China will also require big investments in efforts to protect innovation, said Bellini, who recently donated $40 million to establish a new cybersecurity and AI research college at the University of South Florida.",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday vetoed landmark legislation that would have restricted children's access to AI chatbots.",
      "The bill would have banned companies from making AI chatbots available to anyone under 18 years old unless the businesses could ensure the technology couldn't engage in sexual conversations or encourage self-harm.",
      "\u201cWhile I strongly support the author's goal of establishing necessary safeguards for the safe use of AI by minors, (the bill) imposes such broad restrictions on the use of conversational AI tools that it may unintentionally lead to a total ban on the use of these products by minors,\u201d Newsom said.",
      "The veto came hours after he signed a law requiring platforms to remind users they are interacting with a chatbot and not a human. The notification would pop up every three hours for users who are minors. Companies will also have to maintain a protocol to prevent self-harm content and refer users to crisis service providers if they expressed suicidal ideation.",
      "Newsom, who has four children under 18, said California has a responsibility to protect kids and teens who are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for everything from help with homework to emotional support and personal advice.",
      "California is among several states that tried this year to address concerns surrounding chatbots used by kids for companionship. Safety concerns around the technology exploded following reports and lawsuits saying chatbots made by Meta, OpenAI and others engaged with young users in highly sexualized conversations and, in some cases, coached them to take their own lives.",
      "The two measures were among a slew of AI bills introduced by California lawmakers this year to rein in the homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. Tech companies and their coalitions, in response, spent at least $2.5 million in the first six months of the session lobbying against the measures, according to advocacy group Tech Oversight California. Tech companies and leaders in recent months also announced they are launching pro-AI super PACs to fight state and federal oversight.",
      "The youth AI chatbot ban would have applied to generative AI systems that simulate \u201chumanlike relationship\u201d with users by retaining their personal information and asking unprompted emotional questions. It would have allowed the state attorney general to seek a civil penalty of $25,000 per violation.",
      "James Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, said Newsom's veto of the bill was \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis legislation is desperately needed to protect children and teens from dangerous \u2014 and even deadly \u2014 AI companion chatbots,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tech industry argued that the bill was so broad that it would stifle innovation and take away useful tools for children, such as AI tutoring systems and programs that could detect early signs of dyslexia.",
      "Steyer also said the notification law didn't go far enough, saying it \u201cprovides minimal protections for children and families.\"",

      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cHope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\u201d Jabado wrote by email. \u201cThe same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\u201d",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\u201cEvery time one is done and every time there\u2019s revision, there\u2019s more information, and there\u2019s more ability to answer questions\u201d on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN\u2019s Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \u201cgenerally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\u201d wrote Kovacs.",
      "\u201cActing to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\u201d Kovacs said.",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel\u2019s asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \u201cdepressing litany of threats\u201d to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",

      "The newly formed company, Liberty Vote, also vowed to follow the executive order Trump signed last spring seeking sweeping changes to election policies that multiple judges have put on hold for violating the Constitution.",
      "KNOWiNK, a St. Louis-based provider of electronic poll books that allow election officials to confirm voter information, announced the deal and the name change.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal auto safety regulators have opened yet another investigation into Tesla's so-called full-self driving technology after dozens of incidents in which its vehicles ran red lights or drove on the wrong side of the road, sometimes crashing into other vehicles and injuring people.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a filing dated Tuesday that it has 58 incident reports of Tesla vehicles violating traffic safety laws while operating in full self-driving mode. In reports to regulators, many of the Tesla drivers said the cars gave them no warning about the unexpected behavior.",
      "The probe covers 2,882,566 vehicles, essentially all Teslas equipped with full self-driving technology, or FSD, of which there are two types. Level 2 driver-assistance software, or \u201cFull Self-Driving (Supervised),\u201d requires drivers to pay full attention to the road. The company is still testing a version that does not require driver intervention, something that the automaker's owner and CEO Elon Musk has been promising to roll out for years.",
      "The new investigation follows a host of other probes into the FSD feature on Teslas, which has been blamed for several injuries and deaths. Tesla has repeatedly said the system cannot drive itself and human drivers must be ready to intervene at all times.",
      "Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a \u201csummon\u201d technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.",

      "Meteorologists say La Nina has arrived, bringing cooler weather patterns worldwide",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 La Nina, the cooler and at times costlier flip side of El Nino, has arrived to warp weather worldwide, meteorologists said Thursday. This natural weather phenomenon often turbocharges the Atlantic hurricane season, but this La Nina may be too weak and fleeting to cause much trouble.",
      "In the United States, La Nina often means more precipitation \u2014 including possible snowstorms \u2014 in northern areas and winter dryness in the South. It can bring heavier rains in Indonesia, the Philippines, parts of Australia, Central America, northern South America and southeastern Africa. It also can mean drought in the Middle East, eastern Argentina, eastern China, Korea and southern Japan, meteorologists said.",
      "A La Nina occurs when certain parts of the Central Pacific Ocean cool by half a degree Celsius (0.9 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to normal. The world had been flirting with one this year and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared Thursday that La Nina conditions have formed. But it's likely to be not very strong and may disappear in the next few months, based on multi-factor computer model forecasts by NOAA and Columbia University, said Michelle L'Heureux, lead scientist on the NOAA team that studies both La Nina and El Nino.",
      "\"There is a three out of four chance it will remain a weak event,\" L'Heureux said in an email. \u201cA weaker event tends to exert less of an influence on the global circulation, so it's possible there will be surprises ahead.\u201d",
      "Surprising already describes the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which was forecast to be stronger than normal, but so far is a tad below average in activity. Traditionally, during a La Nina, there's a weakening of the wind shear that hampers hurricane formation and strengthening, allowing more and bigger storms, especially later in the year, such as late October and into early November and in the Caribbean, said University of Albany hurricane expert Brian Tang.",
      "But Brian McNoldy, who studies tropical cyclones, sea level rise and extreme heat at the University of Miami, said he thinks this La Nina is too late and too little to do much.",
      "The conditions, especially wind shear, favor more hurricane activity, yet it's not happening and long-range computer models don't show much forming for the next couple weeks, said Colorado State University hurricane expert Phil Klotzbach.",

      "One of the medicine prize winners, meanwhile, was on vacation in Yellowstone National Park without cellular service. It would be hours before he found out.",
      "The Nobel Prizes are considered among the world\u2019s most prestigious honors for achievements in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, economics and peace. The winners join the pantheon of Nobel laureates, from Albert Einstein to Mother Teresa.",
      "Sometimes, the award is anticipated. Potential winners plan tentative news conferences or, in the western U.S., wait up all night for the news.",
      "While some prizes might feature household names \u2014 such as 2009 peace prize winner then-U.S. President Barack Obama or 2016 literature laureate and singer-songwriter Bob Dylan \u2014 the natural science categories typically go to people whose names the general public doesn't know, for decades-old research.",

      "Here's how some of this year's winners found out:",
      "When Associated Press photographer Lindsey Wasson knocked on the door of Mary E. Brunkow's Seattle home around 4 a.m. local time Monday, it was the scientist's dog who woke up first. Zelda's barking roused Brunkow's husband, Ross Colquhoun.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think he really knew what I was there for,\" Wasson said. \"And I said, \u2018You know, sir, I think your wife just won the Nobel Prize.'\u201d",
      "Wasson's photographs captured Colquhoun waking up Brunkow and telling her the life-changing news: She was among three winners sharing the 2025 medicine prize.",
      "\"Don\u2019t be ridiculous,\" she told her husband.",
      "But it was true. The trio had, in research dating back two decades, uncovered a key pathway the body uses to keep the immune system in check, called peripheral immune tolerance. Experts called the findings critical to understanding autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.",
      "The following day, AP photographers Mark J. Terrill and Damian Dovarganes headed to Santa Barbara, California, to find physicist John Martinis before the sun rose. His wife, Jean, answered the door and told them to come back later: Martinis needed to sleep.",
      "\u201cFor many years, we would stay up on the night the physics award was announced,\u201d she told the photographers. \u201cAt some point we just decided, that's nuts. We'll figure it out if it's happening, but let's just get our sleep.\u201d",
      "She added, laughing: \u201cI was trying to think how I can introduce this. Like, 'Do you think you should plan a trip to Sweden?\"",

      "U.S. lawmakers and national security officials are increasingly alarmed that long-standing research ties between the U.S. and China could give China an advantage when it comes to developing new military technology",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For many years, American and Chinese scholars worked shoulder to shoulder on cutting-edge technologies through open research, where findings are freely shared and accessible to all. But that openness, a long-standing practice celebrated for advancing knowledge, is raising alarms among some U.S. lawmakers.",
      "They are worried that China \u2014 now considered the most formidable challenger to American military dominance \u2014 is taking advantage of open research to catch up with the U.S. on military technology and even gain an edge. And they are calling for action.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, our adversaries have exploited American colleges and universities to advance their interests, while risking our national security and innovation,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He has introduced legislation to put new restrictions on federally funded research collaboration with academics at several Chinese institutions that work with the Chinese military, as well as institutions in other countries deemed adversarial to U.S. interests.",
      "The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party makes it a priority to protect American research, having accused Beijing of weaponizing open research by converting it into a \u201cpipeline of foreign talent and military modernization.\u201d",
      "The rising concerns on Capitol Hill threaten to unravel deep, two-generations-old academic ties between the countries even as the world's two largest economies are moving away from each other through tariffs and trade barriers. The relationship has shifted from engagement to competition, if not outright enmity.",
      "\"Foreign adversaries are increasingly exploiting the open and collaborative environment of U.S. academic institutions for their own gain,\u201d said James Cangialosi, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which in August issued a bulletin urging universities to do more to protect research from foreign meddling.",
      "The House committee released three reports in September alone. They targeted, respectively, Pentagon-funded research involving military-linked Chinese scholars; joint U.S.-China institutes that train STEM talent for China; and visa policies that have brought military-linked Chinese students to Ph.D. programs at American universities. The reports recommend more legislation to protect U.S. research, tighter visa policies to vet Chinese students and scholars and an end to academic partnerships that could be exploited to boost China\u2019s military powers.",
      "More than 500 U.S. universities and institutes have collaborated with Chinese military researchers in recent years, helping Beijing develop advanced technologies with military applications, such as anti-jamming communications and hypersonic vehicles, according to a report by the private U.S. intelligence group Strider Technologies.",
      "Despite efforts in recent years by the U.S. government to set up guardrails to prevent such collaboration from boosting China\u2019s military capabilities, the practice is still prevalent, according to Strider, based in Salt Lake City, Utah.",
      "The report identified nearly 2,500 publications produced in collaboration between U.S. entities and Chinese military-affiliated research institutes in 2024 on STEM research, which includes physics, engineering, material science, computer science, biology, medicine and geology. While the number peaked at more than 3,500 in 2019, before some new restrictive measures came into effect, the level of collaboration remains high, the report said.",
      "This collaboration not only facilitates \u201cpotential illicit knowledge transfer,\u201d but supports China's \u201cstate-directed efforts to recruit top international talent, often to the detriment of U.S. national interests,\u201d the report said.",

      "Foreign countries can exploit American research by stealing secrets for use in military and commercial settings, by poaching talented researchers for foreign companies and universities and by recruiting students and researchers as potential spies, authorities say.",
      "Fostering a climate of robust academic research takes funding and long-term support. Stealing the fruits of that labor, however, can be as easy as hacking into a university network, hiring away researchers or coopting the research itself. That\u2019s why, authorities say, it\u2019s so tempting for American adversaries looking to take advantage of U.S. institutions and research.",
      "The most recent threat assessment report from the Department of Homeland Security highlights concerns that American adversaries \u2014 and China specifically \u2014 seek to illicitly acquire U.S. technology. Authorities say China aims to steal military and computing technology that might give the U.S. an advantage, as well as the latest commercial innovations.",
      "Abigail Coplin, assistant professor of sociology and science, technology and society at Vassar College, said there are already guardrails for federally funded research to protect classified information and anything deemed sensitive.",
      "She also said open research goes both ways, benefiting the U.S. as well, and restrictions could be counterproductive by driving away talents.",
      "\u201cAmerican national security interests and economic competitiveness would be better served by continuing \u2014 if not increasing \u2014 research funding than they are by implementing costly research restrictions,\u201d Coplin said.",
      "Arnie Bellini, a tech entrepreneur and investor, also said efforts to protect U.S. research risk stifling progress if they go too far and prevent U.S. colleges or startups from sharing information about new and emerging technology. Keeping up with China will also require big investments in efforts to protect innovation, said Bellini, who recently donated $40 million to establish a new cybersecurity and AI research college at the University of South Florida.",
      "Bellini said it\u2019s imperative to encourage research and development without giving secrets away to America\u2019s enemies. \u201cIn the U.S., it is a reality now that our digital borders are under siege \u2014 and businesses of every size are right to be concerned,\u201d Bellini said.",
      "According to Department of Justice figures, about 80% of all economic espionage cases prosecuted in the U.S. involve alleged acts that would benefit China.",
      "Some members of Congress have pushed to reinstate a Department of Justice program created during the first Trump administration that sought to investigate Chinese intellectual espionage. The so-called \u201c ChinaInitiative \u201d ended in 2022 after critics said it failed to address the problem even as it perpetrated racist stereotypes about Asian American academics.",

Federal authorities said previously that Jahn wrote \u201cANTI-ICE\u201d on a bullet and left handwritten notes indicating he wanted to ambush and terrorize ICE agents.",
      "The new records show that on the day of the shooting, Jahn\u2019s parents told the FBI he would \u201coccasionally discuss current events\u201d with his mother but rarely engaged in conversations. His parents said he was a \u201cloner\u201d who was \u201cobsessed\u201d with artificial intelligence technology. The parents, Andrew and Sharon Jahn, did not immediately respond Monday to text and phone messages from the AP.",
      "The documents portray Jahn as an unemployed, friendless young man who had withdrawn into playing computer games in his bedroom at his parents\u2019 home in a Dallas suburb. Jahn was not diagnosed with or treated for any mental or physical disorders, his parents said.",
      "Neither the police nor FBI immediately responded to a request for comment. The FBI said only that because of the government shutdown it was focused on national security, violations of federal law, and essential public safety functions.",
      "Jahn had been \u201ccompletely normal\u201d until he moved back from Washington state in the past five years, his parents said. He had previously taken classes at a Texas community college on and off for years, before driving across the country to answer an online advertisement for a seasonal job harvesting marijuana at a legal cannabis farm in Washington. Jahn appeared directionless and slept in his car for months, the farm's owner Ryan Sanderson previously told the AP.",
      "After returning from Washington because he could not retain a job, Jahn's parents told the FBI he believed he was \u201callergic to plastic\u201d and sought to avoid direct skin contact with the material. The county where he worked in Washington state was one of the sites for the secret Manhattan Project to develop atomic bombs. And they said their son became convinced that while in Washington, he had been \u201cexposed to radiation from a nearby facility and was suffering from radiation sickness.\"",
      "Photographs from the scene of the shooting show a car affixed with a map depicting radioactive fallout in the U.S.",
      "Records suggest his family life was far from harmonious. Jahn\u2019s father had put pressure on his older brother to find a job or join the military after high school, and his mother called the police when the brother failed to show up to a meeting with an Army recruiter to sign enlistment papers in 2014, police records show.",

      "Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, the state health department secretary and other officials announced Monday results so far from what then-Gov. Roy Cooper unveiled 15 months ago as a first-of-its-kind initiative.",
      "While helping almost one-quarter of North Carolina residents, Stein said the effort has exceeded expectations in giving individuals and families a second chance to succeed financially after medical crises. Officials previously estimated it could help about 2 million people get rid of $4 billion in debt. The debt that had been held by hospitals, and are usually difficult to recover, will be pulled from credit reports, the governor said.",
      "\u201cThis is life-changing news for so many families,\u201d Stein said, adding that recipients on average will have $2,600 erased. \u201cNo one chooses to have a heart attack or get diagnosed with a chronic condition \u2014 you just have to deal with it. Today\u2019s announcement will free people from the financial stress so that they can focus on getting healthy.\u201d Another news conference speaker described patients who avoided services or threatened to halt treatments to prevent debt from accumulating on themselves or their family.",
      "Hospitals that agreed to participate have already alerted many patients to tell them their debt is essentially canceled, state health officials said Monday. And Undue Medical Debt, a national group working on the effort and taking over some hospital liabilities, plans to send 255,000 notices this week to other recipients.",
      "The effort germinated from what's called the Healthcare Access and Stabilization Program, which state legislators approved in 2023 at the same time as expanded Medicaid coverage to working adults who couldn\u2019t otherwise qualify for conventional Medicaid. Hospitals pay assessments to draw down billions of dollars in federal money.",
      "The state Department of Health and Human Services last year proposed that ertain hospitals could receive higher program reimbursement levels to treat Medicaid enrollees if they agreed to medical debt initiatives. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services signed off on the plan details, and by August 2024 each of the roughly 100 acute-care, rural or university-connected hospitals that qualified decided to participate.",

      "Under rules previously announced, the hospitals had to eliminate medical debt going back to early 2014 for patients who are Medicaid enrollees. They also would later have to eliminate other debt for non-enrollees based on income levels. And the hospitals were directed to discourage debt by doing things like automatically enrolling people in charity care programs or curbing certain debt collection practices. The $6.5 billion figure includes debt relieved directly through the initiative and through hospital policy changes to implement it, Stein's office said.",
      "Other state and local governments have tapped into federal American Rescue Plan funds to help purchase and cancel residents\u2019 debt. Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs announced in July that $429 million in medical debt had been erased for more than 352,000 state residents.",
      "\u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s approach is completely unique,\" said Jose Penabad, the Undue Medical Debt vice chair. Several states are following North Carolina\u2019s use of Medicaid incentives closely, he added.",
      "North Carolina debt eradication exceeded initial estimates in part because patients outside the population being targeted also had their debt eliminated, Stein said. Hospitals, for example, sometimes have eliminated debt for patients incurred at associated physician practices, said Jonathan Kappler, a state deputy health secretary. More debt will be eliminated in the future, he added.",
      "State health secretary Dr. Dev Sangvai, told reporters the law approved by Congress in July that made cuts and policy changes to Medicaid won\u2019t immediately affect the debt elimination initiative.",
      "Some hospitals were initially hesitant about the debt relief efforts because of strings placed upon higher reimbursements, Cooper said last year. The North Carolina Healthcare Association, which lobbies for nonprofit and for-profit hospitals, said Monday in a statement that it\u2019s concerned \u201crecent and proposed government policies could add financial pressures\u201d that prevent hospitals from expanding programs to help low-income patients.",

      "More participatory approaches, however, are gaining popularity across the sector. Center for Effective Philanthropy President Phil Buchanan said there\u2019s increased sensitivity to \u201ctop-down philanthropy.\u201d But his sense is that it's rarer for funders to cede decision-making power to others.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this recognition that a lot of philanthropic mistakes are made when answers to problems other people are experiencing are cooked up by consultants in conference rooms, rather than being informed by those who donors actually seek to help,\u201d Buchanan said.",
      "The fund's focus on food insecurity therefore made sense to Native Americans in Philanthropy considering the issue's acute impact in Indigenous communities Settler-colonialism forced them onto unfamiliar reservations and diminished their ability to follow the traditional food practices that had sustained generations.",
      "While rates have fallen, recent U.S. Department of Agriculture surveys suggest American Indian/Alaska Native households still lack access to adequate food at twice the level of white residents. Child obesity is high. And affordable, healthy groceries are even harder to come by in rural food deserts.",
      "The $30,000 grant recipients are tackling those issues in a variety of ways. There's a multi-generational collective of Shinnecock women in New York who farm kelp to clean up a bay. Or an Arizona-based community center that grows culturally significant crops such as Apache giant squash, distributes fresh produce and trains youth through hands-on land management.",
      "Philanthropy's sparse giving to Native American-led organizations means there's little private money for such efforts. Less than 0.5% of funding from large U.S. foundations goes to Native American nonprofits, according to a 2019 report by Candid and Native Americans in Philanthropy.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A Republican attack on a core provision of the Voting Rights Act that is designed to protect racial minorities comes to the Supreme Court this week, more than a decade after the justices knocked out another pillar of the 60-year-old law.",
      "In arguments Wednesday, lawyers for Louisiana and the Trump administration will try to persuade the justices to wipe away the state's second majority Black congressional district and make it much harder, if not impossible, to take account of race in redistricting.",
      "\u201cRace-based redistricting is fundamentally contrary to our Constitution,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill wrote in the state's Supreme Court filing.",
      "A mid-decade battle over congressional redistricting already is playing out across the nation, after President Donald Trump began urging Texas and other Republican-controlled states to redraw their lines to make it easier for the GOP to hold its narrow majority in the House of Representatives. A ruling for Louisiana could intensify that effort and spill over to state legislative and local districts.",
      "The conservative-dominated court, which just two years ago ended affirmative action in college admissions, could be receptive.

      "In 2013, Roberts wrote for the majority in gutting the landmark law's requirement that states and local governments with a history of discrimination, mostly in the South, get approval before making any election-related changes.",
      "\u201cOur country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions,\u201d Roberts wrote.",

      "\u201cRace is still very much a factor in current voting patterns in the state of Louisiana. It\u2019s true in many places in the country,\u201d said Sarah Brannon, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Voting Rights Project.",
      "The Louisiana case got to this point only after Black voters and civil rights groups sued and won lower court rulings striking down the first congressional map drawn by the state's GOP-controlled Legislature after the 2020 census. That map created just one Black majority district among six House seats in a state that is one-third Black.",
      "Louisiana appealed to the Supreme Court but eventually added a second majority Black district after the justices' 5-4 ruling in 2023 that found a likely violation of the Voting Rights Act in a similar case over Alabama\u2019s congressional map.",
      "Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined their three more liberal colleagues in the Alabama outcome. Roberts rejected what he described as \u201cAlabama\u2019s attempt to remake our section 2 jurisprudence anew.\u201d",
      "That might have settled things, but a group of white voters complained that race, not politics, was the predominant factor driving the new Louisiana map. A three-judge court agreed, leading to the current high court case.",
      "Instead of deciding the case in June, the justices asked the parties to answer a potentially big question: \u201cWhether the state\u2019s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U. S. Constitution.\u201d",
      "Those amendments, adopted in the aftermath of the Civil War, were intended to bring about political equality for Black Americans and gave Congress the authority to take all necessary steps. Nearly a century later, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, called the crown jewel of the civil rights era, to finally put an end to persistent efforts to prevent Black people from voting in the former states of the Confederacy.",

      "President Donald Trump is warning Russia that he may send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles if Moscow doesn't settle its war there soon",
      "ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE -- ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Sunday warned Russia that he may send Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles if Moscow doesn\u2019t settle its war there soon \u2014 suggesting that he could be ready to increase the pressure on Vladimir Putin's government using a key weapons system.",
      "\u201cI might say, \u2019Look: if this war is not going to get settled, I\u2019m going to send them Tomahawks,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew to Israel. \u201cThe Tomahawk is an incredible weapon, very offensive weapon. And honestly, Russia does not need that.\u201d",
      "Trump also said, \"I might tell them that if the war is not settled -- that we may very well.\" He added, \"We may not, but we may do it. I think it\u2019s appropriate to bring up.\u201d",
      "His comments came after Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Trump said he mentioned possibly sending Tomahawks during that conversation.",
      "\u201cDo they want to have Tomahawks going in that direction? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump said of Russia. \u201cI think I might speak to Russia about that.\u201d He added that \u201cTomahawks are a new step of aggression.\u201d",
      "His suggestions followed Russia having attacked Ukraine\u2019s power grid overnight, part of an ongoing campaign to cripple Ukrainian energy infrastructure before winter. Moscow also expressed \u201cextreme concern\u201d over the U.S. potentially providing Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.",
      "Putin himself has previously suggested that the United States supplying long-range missiles to Ukraine will seriously damage relations between Moscow and Washington.",
      "For his part, Zelenskyy described his latest call with Trump as \u201cvery productive,\u201d and said the pair had discussed strengthening Ukraine\u2019s \u201cair defense, resilience, and long-range capabilities,\u201d along with \u201cdetails related to the energy sector.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cThe Sunday Briefing\u201d after his call with Trump, Zelenskyy was asked whether Trump had approved the Tomahawks and said, \u201cwe work on it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m waiting for president to yes,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cOf course we count on such decisions, but we will see. We will see.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian president said Friday that he was in talks with U.S. officials about the possible provision of various long-range precision strike weapons, including Tomahawks and more ATACMS tactical ballistic missiles.",

    "story": [
      "Inflation has risen in three of the last four months and is slightly higher than it was a year ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Inflation has risen in three of the last four months and is slightly higher than it was a year ago, when it helped sink then-Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. Yet you wouldn't know it from listening to President Donald Trump or even some of the inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve.",
      "Trump told the United Nations General Assembly late last month: \u201cGrocery prices are down, mortgage rates are down, and inflation has been defeated.\u201d",
      "And at a high-profile speech in August, just before the Fed cut its key interest rate for the first time this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said: \u201cInflation, though still somewhat elevated, has come down a great deal from its post-pandemic highs. Upside risks to inflation have diminished.\u201d",
      "Yet dismissing or even downplaying inflation while it is still above the Fed's target of 2% poses big risks for the White House and the Federal Reserve. For the Trump administration, it could find itself on the wrong side of a potent issue: Surveys show that many Americans still see high prices as a major burden on their finances.",
      "The Fed may be taking an even bigger gamble: It has cut its key interest rate on the assumption that the Trump administration's tariffs will only cause a temporary bump up in inflation. If that turns out to be wrong \u2014 if inflation gets worse or remains elevated for longer than expected \u2014 the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility could take a hit.",
      "That credibility plays a crucial role in the Fed's ability to keep prices stable. If Americans are confident that the central bank can keep inflation in check, they won't take steps \u2014 such as demanding sharply higher pay when prices rise \u2014 that can launch an inflationary spiral. Companies often increase prices further to offset higher labor costs.",
      "But Karen Dynan, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said this week that with memories of pandemic-era inflation still fresh and tariffs pushing up the cost of imported goods, consumers and businesses could start to lose confidence that inflation will stay low.",
      "\u201cIf that proves to be the case, in hindsight it will be that the Fed cuts -- and I do expect several more -- are going to be seen as a mistake,\u201d Dynan said.",
      "So far, the Trump administration's tariffs haven't lifted inflation as much as as many economists expected earlier this year. And it remains far below its 9.1% peak three years ago. Still, consumer prices increased 2.9% in August from a year earlier, up from 2.6% at the same time last year and above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.",
      "The government is scheduled to release the September inflation report on Wednesday, but the data will probably be delayed by the government shutdown.",
      "Tariffs have pushed up the cost of many imported items, including furniture, appliances, and toys. Overall, the cost of long-lasting manufactured goods rose nearly 2% in August from a year earlier. It was a modest gain, but comes after nearly three decades when the cost of such items mostly fell.",
      "The cost of some everyday goods are still rising more quickly than before the pandemic: Grocery prices moved up 2.7% in August from a year ago, the largest gain, outside the pandemic, since 2015. Coffee prices have soared nearly 21% in the past year, partly because Trump has slapped 50% import taxes on Brazil, a leading coffee exporter, and also because climate change-induced droughts have cut into coffee bean harvests.",
      "Most Fed officials are still concerned that inflation is too high, according the minutes of its Sept. 16-17 meeting. Yet they still chose to cut their key interest rate, because they were more worried about the risk of worsening unemployment than about higher inflation.",

      "But the concern for some economists is that the ongoing rollout of tariffs and the fact that many companies are still implementing price hikes in response could result in more than just a temporary boost to inflation.",
      "\u201cIt is a big gamble after what we\u2019ve been going through ... to count on it being transitory,\u201d said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University and a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cOnce upon a time, (3% inflation) would have been considered really high.\u201d",
      "Just two weeks ago, Trump slapped new tariffs on a range of products, including 100% on pharmaceuticals, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and 25% on heavy trucks. On Friday, he threatened \u201ca massive increase of tariffs\u201d on imports from China in response to that country's restrictions on rare earth exports.",
      "Some companies are still raising prices to offset the tariff costs. Duties on steel and aluminum imports have pushed up the cost of the cans used by Campbell Soups, leading the company\u2019s CEO to say in September that it will implement \u201csurgical pricing initiatives.\"",
      "Chris Butler, CEO of National Tree Company, the nation\u2019s largest artificial Christmas tree seller, says his company will raise prices by about 10% this holiday season on its trees, wreaths, and garlands to offset tariff costs. About 45% of its trees are made in China, with the rest from Southeast Asia, Mexico, and other countries. The cost of labor and real estate is too high to make them in the United States, he said.",
      "Butler also expects there will be a reduced supply of artificial trees and decorations this year, which could lift industry-wide prices further, because most production in China shut down when tariffs on that country hit 145% earlier this year. Production resumed after Trump reduced the duties to 30% but at a slower pace.",
      "Butler has pushed his suppliers to absorb some of the cost of the tariffs, but they won\u2019t pay all of it.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we can\u2019t absorb the entirety of it and our factories can\u2019t absorb the entirety of it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve had to pass along some of the increases to consumers.\u201d",
      "Many Fed policymakers are aware of the risks. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who votes on interest rate decisions, said Monday that high inflation that results from a loss of confidence in the central bank is harder to fight than other price spikes, such as those that result from supply disruptions.",
      "\u201cThe Fed must maintain its credibility on inflation,\u201d Schmid said. \u201cHistory has shown that while all inflations are universally disliked, not all inflations are equally costly to fight.\u201d",
      "Yet some Fed officials say that other trends are offsetting the impact of tariffs. Fed governor Stephen Miran, whom Trump appointed just before the central bank\u2019s September meeting, said Tuesday that a steady slowdown in rental costs should reduce underlying inflation in the coming months. And the sharp drop in immigration as a result of the administration\u2019s clampdown will reduce demand, he said, cooling inflation pressures.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m more sanguine about the inflation outlook than a lot of other people are,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "In the new psychological thriller \"After the Hunt,\" actors Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri face off in a story about power, loyalty, and blurred morality. The film, directed by Luca Guadagnino, follows a college professor and her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as an accusation of assault shatters their academic world and forces both women to confront uncomfortable truths.",
      "Roberts plays the professor, whose devoted student, portrayed by Edebiri, accuses her closest confidante of misconduct. The movie, which also stars Andrew Garfield, explores the fallout from the allegation as the characters compete for tenure and navigate shifting alliances.",
      "Roberts told Gayle King on \"CBS Mornings\" that sparking conversation is the ultimate goal of art.",
      "\"You don't want anybody to walk away from this painting and just be like, 'Hmm.' That's death,\" Roberts said.",
      "Edebiri agreed, saying the movie invites discussion and debate.",

      "When asked who she believes is telling the truth in the story, Roberts declined to say.",
      "\"That is for me to know,\" she said, explaining that sharing her opinion would be \"a disservice\" since her view isn't \"the\" truth or \"the\" correct answer.",

      "\"She was the next person we discussed, and she was the one clear, the one just clear bell that we both heard,\" Roberts said. \"Luca had said, you know, 'What do you think about Ayo Edebiri?' And I was like, 'What's not to think?' And thank goodness, I mean, we sort of would have been set adrift if Ayo hadn't agreed to do it, because it's a critical piece.\"",

    "summary": "After 14 years playing NYPD detective Danny Reagan on \"Blue Bloods,\" Donnie Wahlberg now stars in the spinoff series \"Boston Blue,\" patrolling the streets of his own hometown.",
    "story": [
      "For 14 years, Donnie Wahlberg starred as Detective Danny Reagan on the CBS police procedural \"Blue Bloods.\" The hit drama about the Reagans, the fictional first family of the New York Police Department, had a loyal following. \"I was stopped on airplanes, on trains, on the street, at basketball \u2013 you name it. Wherever I was, somebody would tell me they love 'Blue Bloods,'\" said Wahlberg.",
      "Now 56, Wahlberg is sitting at a new family's dinner table, in \"Boston Blue,\" a \"Blue Bloods\" spinoff set in a city the actor knows well.",
      "Wahlberg grew up the eighth of nine kids in the working-class Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. \"We were poor,\" he said. \"There were nine kids, a dog, a cat, and a grandma in the basement, and my mom and dad for a while. There were kids coming and going, running away, being arrested. There were arguments, fights, alcohol. I definitely learned from some of my older siblings that, here's a clear path of what not to do.\"",
      "Wahlberg says he was the family peacemaker. \"I don't like to use the term ('cause I don't wanna insult my other siblings), but one of the adults. My role was to get everyone together and be happy by any means necessary.\"",
      "The discord wasn't just inside the house; 1970s Boston was a cauldron of racial tension. A controversial court-ordered desegregation program bussed students to schools outside their neighborhoods. As a first grader, Wahlberg was sent from Irish-Catholic Dorchester to predominantly Black Roxbury.",
      "He describes it as \"probably the most important thing that ever happened in my life.\"",
      "Because? \"Because I don't know what I would've not been exposed to, had I not been on those buses. In my neighborhood, if I woulda said, 'Yeah, I wanna be a singer one day,' I could think of five kids in the neighborhood who would punch me in the face. And two of them lived in my house!\"",
      "It was after hearing hip hop in the fourth grade that Wahlberg caught the performing bug. \"I would listen to 'Rapper's Delight,' I just would start writing my own raps and making up my own songs,\" he said.",
      "That helped Wahlberg earn an audition, at just 14 years old, with Maurice Starr, the local impresario who'd founded New Edition and was starting a new band. \"Maurice was looking for the equivalent of the Osmonds to the Jacksons,\" he said.",
      "What did his parents think? \"My mom was super supportive,\" he recalled. \"And I said, 'Dad, I'm gonna start this music band.' And he said, 'Well, I tell ya' what: If you ever do make it big, and you come home, and you've changed, I'm gonna kick your ass.'\"",
      "In 1984, Donnie and his younger brother Mark became the first two members of New Kids on the Block. But the family affair was short-lived, as Mark quit. \"He didn't like singing,\" said Donnie. \"He couldn't sing.\u00a0 There's a scene of him as Dirk Diggler in 'Boogie Nights' singing horribly. That's actually better than he sang as a member of New Kids!\"",
      "With four other members in place (including some of Wahlberg's schoolmates), the group struggled at first to find its footing. But by the late 1980s, they appeared to have the right stuff:",
      "While the band was popular, it was far from critics' choice. \"I really struggled with the criticism of the band \u2013 we couldn't sing, we were puppets, we were fake,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "To feel better about himself, Wahlberg focused on writing and producing, not just for the New Kids, but also for his brother Mark. Soon enough they had a #1 hit, \"Good Vibrations.\"",
      "Donnie said, \"Marky Mark and my brother's career and his music was really when I started to get my head screwed on right of how I could really prove myself.\"",
      "Prove himself \u2026 and protect his kid brother. \"My brother was getting in trouble and my mom was like, 'You gotta help your brother and get him out of the streets,'\" said Wahlberg. \"I don't like to wear the Marky Mark and my brother's career as some kind of badge of honor. He worked very hard for his career. But I really did, you know, help him in a big way, and helped myself in a big way in doing that.\"",
      "After the New Kids broke up in 1994, Wahlberg turned to acting, breaking through in \"The Sixth Sense.\" Other roles followed, including \"Band of Brothers\" and \"Boomtown,\" along with reunions for New Kids on the Block, which still keep him busy.",
      "Wahlberg now lives outside Chicago, in a home he shares with his second wife, TV personality Jenny McCarthy.",
      "\"We have very similar upbringings, which really helps,\" said McCarthy. \"I think we're both people-pleasers, which could also be bad if you're not in therapy about it!\"",
      "\"Lotta therapy we've each had, and together,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "\"But we're caretakers, you know, of our family, which I think is something to be proud of,\" McCarthy added.",
      "They may now live in McCarthy's hometown, but Boston is never far from Wahlberg's heart, as evident in his home office, which features mementoes from Bill Belichick, Bill Russell and Larry Bird.",
      "And then there's his new show which he wasn't sure he wanted to do after \"Blue Bloods\"' cancellation. \"I love 'Blue Bloods,'\" he said. \"I fought tooth-and-nail to keep it on the air. And here's an opportunity to keep this character alive. And suddenly, when I started to look at it through that lens, it was like, how do I not do this? If all those millions of 'Blue Bloods' fans don't show up and love it, then I know we put our best foot forward.\"",
      "Between his TV work and concerts, it's a busy life for Donnie Wahlberg. \"People say to me, 'Oh, gosh, when do you sleep?' You want me to complain? Everything I ever wanted, I'm doing it. I wanna work harder, I want to be worthy of it. I want to be worthy of \u2026 the gift that so many people give me of their time. How can I not work my ass off to repay that?\"",
      "But he says he's just doing what he's always done: \"My childhood was spent trying to bring joy and love to a large group of people amidst chaos and confusion and pain. And it's what I do for a living right now.\u00a0 It's what I've grown up to do.\"",

    "story": [
      "Asbury Park is a Jersey beach town with heart, history and harmony, not to mention a voice. Bruce Springsteen's presence can still be felt in his old haunts \u2013 the Stone Pony, the Wonder Bar, Madam Marie's. The town's welcome mat is its storied boardwalk, where we met Jeremy Allen White. \"There's a lot of romance here still, I feel like,\" said White, who was thinking about his own hometown.",
      "\"Do you feel that way a little bit about Brooklyn?\" I asked.",
      "\"I do, yeah. I always feel at home there.\"",
      "Had that Brooklyn boy come out here, say, three years ago, he might have been just another tourist. But not anymore. His turn as the talented but tormented chef on the award-winning FX series \"The Bear\" has made the 34-year-old one of the hottest commodities in Hollywood.",
      "I said, \"Early on, it strikes me that if you were just to read the script, it was kind of just a story about a sandwich shop.\"",
      "\"It was a hard thing to explain,\" said White, \"and it sounded something like that, you know? Yes, this, like, kid, he comes back, he's a chef, and he's, like, opening a sandwich shop. And I saw my friends trying to be nice and say, Oh, that sounds great, you know?\"",
      "He ended up sweeping nearly all of the awards: Emmys, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice. His two young daughters call them his \"trophy winners cups.\" \"They like them, they get a kick out of it, but they also are very honest and there's just like, Why do you get all these things?\" White said.",
      "Back out at the Jersey shore, it's not those past awards that matter. It's the ones that might be coming down the Jersey Turnpike for White's performance as Springsteen himself.",
      "And yes, that really is White's voice. He said, \"If you're gonna do one thing to get it right, you have to perform to the point of exhaustion. 'Cause he continues until he cannot go any longer.",
      "\"Everybody's got their own idea of Bruce Springsteen. And I think at the beginning, I was approaching it like, how am I going to make everybody happy? That's a fool's errand. It's an impossibility.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment that you thought to yourself, Yeah, I got this. I can do this?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I don't think so,\" White replied. \"There were moments where I found confidence, but I always wanted more, I wanted more time, I wanted to go deeper.\"",
      "Springsteen was aware of White before the film. He had seen and admired the emotional complexity in his work, and that's a well Springsteen knew whoever played him needed to have. White said, \"Bruce has gone on record and said, you know, I have no problem performing for three hours on stage. That's easy for me. I know exactly who I am on stage. You know, it's the other 21 hours that I have trouble with.\"",
      "\"Did you know any of that before you really took a deep dive?\" I asked.",
      "\"I mean, I was familiar enough with his music that, you know, I understood his depth, and I understood, you know, we're dealing with a man who's looked over the edge before, absolutely,\" said White. \"But, no.\"",
      "The film, \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" based on the book of the same name, follows the making of the 1982 album \"Nebraska.\" Some say it's Springsteen as his best, but he himself may have actually been at his worst.",
      "In his 2016 autobiography, \"Born to Run,\" he describes an emotional breakdown while at a Texas county fair, not long after \"Nebraska\" was finished:",
      "\"I've just pulled a perfect swan dive into my abyss; my stomach is on rinse cycle, and I'm going down, down, down. I just feel a need to get rooted somewhere, before I drift into ether.\"",
      "White said, \"I asked him, what's that panic about? You know, what is that fear inside of you? And he said, 'I had this moment where I felt like an outsider and observer in my own life.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Have you ever struggled with mental illness yourself?\"",
      "\"Yeah, of course,\" said White. \"When he told me about that, that feeling of being an observer of your own life, that was very familiar to me. I remember when I found acting, there was a lot of like, I think like, chaos and confusion, just a lot going on. I couldn't focus on myself. And I found acting, and I found some peace and I found some focus.\"",
      "White has drawn from that emotional trough as early as he can remember, even during his days of doing crime dramas on TV, when he was looking for certain things \u2013 not just a job. \"Yeah, you know, I was very lucky, I was a kid, so my first agents were kind of confused and upset with me for kind of, like, having a standard for what I would go audition for,\" he said. \"I'd never done anything before when I was 13, and they were like, Just go on the audition, you know?\"",
      "One of those auditions landed him on \"Shameless.\" For 11 seasons he played bad boy, big brother, and brainiac Lip Gallagher.",
      "His unruly hair and blue eyes got him counted among the so-called \"rodent men\" - a term used to describe a few of the most physically desirable things a man can be these days. His Calvin Klein underwear ad certainly helped.",
      "Before we left the shore, we stopped by the Stone Pony, where White tried to re-create on film Springsteen's early glory days.",
      "\"Bruce was there, like he was a lot of days, and he came out, and he kind of introduced me to the audience, so he gave them to me all warmed up,\" White recalled. \"They made me feel like a star for three-and-a-half minutes. And then the first A.D. would say 'Cut,' and they would go silent. And I remembered, I am not Bruce Springsteen, I am just an actor!\"",
      "A guy from Brooklyn playing a guy from Jersey \u2013 they both seem to understand one another, and neither would change a thing.",
      "White said, \"The ride is fun, but I'm, you know, I'm filled up. I just want to work with people I admire and be able to keep doing what I love to do. That's what's important to me.\"",
      "I asked, \"So, if all the fame and success ended after this film, you'd feel like ...?\"",
      "\"Can I still work?\"",

      "It's a nightmare we've been living with all our lives. \"I grew up in an era when we had to hide under our desks in the case of an atomic bomb,\" said director Kathryn Bigelow, \"so I suppose I was sort of imprinted early on with the prospect of nuclear war.\"",
      "In Bigelow's new film, \"A House of Dynamite,\" the prospect of nuclear war suddenly becomes an insane reality. It tells of a single missile launched from an unknown location in the Pacific. At first it looks like a test, but it keeps on coming \u2013 with a trajectory estimated to be the continental United States.",
      "With 19 minutes to impact, the president (played by Idris Elba) has to make an impossible decision.",
      "Noah Oppenheim, a former president of NBC News, wrote the script, which dramatizes what he calls \"the insanity that we would expect a single human being with limited preparation to decide in a matter of minutes the fate of all mankind.\"",
      "Bigelow, whose previous movies include \"The Hurt Locker\" (an all-too-real look at the war in Iraq) and \"Zero Dark Thirty\" (about the hunt for Osama Bin Laden) applied her trademark authenticity to the unthinkable. \"It's my responsibility as a filmmaker, if I'm presenting an environment that really exists, to be as authentic as possible,\" she said.",
      "Bigelow says she did not seek cooperation from the Pentagon for the film: \"I felt that we needed to be more independent. But that being said, we had multiple tech advisors who have worked in the Pentagon. They were with me every day we shot.\"",
      "One military consultant was retired Lt. Gen. Dan Karbler. \"Never in a million years would I have thought that I would have been in this position,\" he said.",
      "Karbler nailed his audition when he opened his first Zoom call with Bigelow like this: \"'This is the DDO from the Pentagon convening a strategic conference. This conference is Top Secret. Please bring the President into the conference.' And I stopped there and clicked on my camera and I said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, that's how the worst day of America's history will begin.'\"",
      "I noted, \"That doesn't sound like something you were ad-libbing?\"",
      "\"I was not ad-libbing at all,\" said Karbler. \"That comes from a lot of practice.\"",
      "He was on a movie set, but Karbler took command of the actors just as he once did with the real soldiers at Fort Greeley, Alaska, the front line of defense against an incoming missile. He described those scenes as \"super-realistic.\"",
      "He said. \"I have a son and daughter, and they're both missile defenders. And all I can think about is my own kids and how those actors totally nailed it.\"",
      "In \"A House of Dynamite,\" the missile is tracked as it arcs toward the United States. [In such a scenario, the U.S. would have less than 10 minutes to make the decisions and get interceptors airborne.]",
      "Two interceptors are launched \u2013 the classic \"bullet hitting a bullet.\"",
      "\"That kill vehicle will go and basically run itself into the incoming missile,\" said Karbler. \"That closing velocity can be in excess of 30,000 miles an hour. I think the movie has it pretty accurate when they talk about 61% chance of killing it.\"",
      "The watch officer in the White House Situation Room is played by Rebecca Ferguson. Larry Pfeiffer, who once ran the real White House Situation Room, said, \"This movie is going to give the American moviegoer a chance to feel what it's really like to work in a space like that.",
      "\"There are going to be things that happen in the world that require the immediate attention and action by the President of the United States, and you need to be as perfect as possible,\" he said.",
      "The president is in a motorcade when he's hit with the one crisis he thought he would never face: a missile inbound for Chicago. \"I had one briefing when I was sworn in,\" he says. \"One! And they told me that's the protocol!\"",
      "According to Dan Karbler, a real-world president is likely to be just as unprepared.",
      "Asked whether he had ever done a drill when the real president was involved, he replied, \"No, no, sir.\"",
      "\"So, if it were the real thing, he wouldn't have a lot of practice?\" I asked.",
      "\"I believe the last president to have participated in one of the exercises was President Reagan,\" Karbler said.",
      "So, what does screenwriter Noah Oppenheim want audiences to be thinking, once they've caught their breath? \"I want people to be reminded that, even though the Cold War is long over, the nuclear era is not, and that we live, as the title says, in a house full of dynamite,\" he said.",
      "To which director Kathryn Bigelow added, \"My question is how do we take the dynamite out of the walls \u2026 without tearing down the house?\"",

      "People Magazine, which first reported Keaton's death, said the actress died in California on Saturday, Oct. 11, citing a family spokesperson.",
      "An actress for more than four decades, the beloved star thought she would be a singer, telling\u00a0\"CBS Sunday Morning\" in February 2010, \"I wanted to sing. I did everything I could to be a singer.\"",
      "Born in 1946 in Los Angeles, Keaton appeared on the stage in the musical \"Hair\" at 22 years old and then in Woody Allen's \"Play It Again, Sam\" in 1968, for which she would receive a Tony nomination.",
      "Keaton said her voice wasn't good enough, and she moved on to acting, making her first film appearance in \"Lovers and Other Strangers\" in 1970, while her many early TV credits include appearances on \"Mannix,\" \"The F.B.I.,\" \"Night Gallery,\" and \"Love, American Style.\"",
      "She starred as Al Pacino's girlfriend Kay in \"The Godfather\" in 1972 and repeated the role in the crime saga's two sequels. The couple became romantically involved after the filming of The Godfather Part II, Keaton said.",
      "Keaton then became well-known for a string of movies she did with famed director Woody Allen \u2014 starting one of the 70s most enduring screen partnerships. She starred in \"Manhattan,\" \"Annie Hall,\" and \"Love and Death, among others.",

    "summary": "The owners and operators of independent cinemas are working to adapt as audience habits change.",
    "story": [
      "Audiences have been enjoying films at movie theaters for decades, but streaming and expensive\u00a0ticket prices\u00a0have impacted\u00a0moviegoing habits. For the owners and operators of independent theaters, survival means getting creative.",
      "Kevin Smith, the man behind cult classics like \"Clerks\" and \"Mallrats,\" bought a theater in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2022. It was the cinema he'd gone to growing up. He renamed it Smodcastle Cinemas, and hoped that even as it reeled from COVID-19 shutdowns, he could rekindle the magic he'd loved as a child.",
      "\"I learned more about myself sitting in this (theater) than I ever did sitting in a classroom or sitting in church or something like that, and it led me to the rest of my life,\" Smith said.",
      "But the reality of operating the movie theater was difficult, even for a celebrity like Smith. They operate as a non-profit, Smith said, because if they functioned as a for-profit business, they \"would die.\" Smith can bring in celebrity guests for Q&A sessions and other events. The theater also hosts an annual film festival.",
      "\"Saving my childhood theater with my friends? Dream come true, worst financial investment I ever made in my life,\" Smith said.",
      "On the opposite coast, film store Vidiots has been bringing new movies to audiences for 40 years. When it opened in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, in 1985, it operated as a traditional video store with an extensive and rare collection of films. In 2023, Vidiots moved to Eagle Rock and expanded into an exhibition space, reviving the historic Eagle Theater.",
      "\"We opened to uncertainty,\" said executive director Maggie MacKay. \"We had no idea if people would come, and they did. And they've been coming ever since.\"",
      "MacKay said Vidiots has become a touchstone for local kids.",
      "\"One of the biggest surprises and the happiest surprises for us and the thing that I think I most wanted to happen here is that young people come here,\" she said. \"Teens, tweens are getting dropped off by their parents. And because this place is affordable and welcoming and nonjudgmental and safe, they are coming here all the time. We've got kids growing up here who call the video store their video store. We have a kid who calls it 'my video store.' That kid has no idea that that is a very unique thing to say in the 2020s.\"",
      "Like Smodcastle, Vidiots operates as a non-profit. That isn't the only path to success for these kinds of theaters, though, as New York City's Metrograph proves. The two-screen theater in Manhattan's Lower East Side shows international and arthouse fare and operates as a for-profit. Business is booming, CEO Christian Grass said, with the theater recently enjoying its best summer on record.",
      "\"People love going to the movies and people love the experience,\" Grass said. The theater also has a bookstore, a magazine, a streaming service, an extravagant concession stand and a swanky bar and restaurant. The establishment has focused on building a sense of community, said Metrograph director of programming Inge de Leeuw, which ensures people keep coming back. MacKay said she's also found people are looking for connection, community and a place they can go.",
      "\"Everybody wants movies in their lives, whether they know it or realize it or not,\" MacKay said. \"To save this thing, you have to make available every point of access for it. You have to make a return to a social experience.\"",
      "While independent theaters are taking different paths to success, they have one thing in common: They want to keep introducing new and classic films to audiences.",
      "\"You want to learn something about somebody, sit in the darkness and watch movies with them,\" Smith said. \"You will learn a lot about a person. You'll find out if they're empathetic. You'll find out what makes them laugh. You'll find out if there's a real human being there, if there's a heart underneath that all, man.\""

      "Filed in January, the lawsuit alleged that UMG published and promoted \"Not Like Us\" even though it included false pedophilia allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice.",
      "The lawsuit also alleged that the track tarnished his reputation and decreased the value of his brand.",

      "Lamar and Drake have been beefing for years, with the two rappers releasing several diss tracks about one another. The feud appeared to reach its height when Lamar called out Drake during his Super Bowl Halftime Show in February.",
      "In \"Not Like Us,\" which was released in May 2024, Lamar makes disturbing accusations about Drake allegedly having inappropriate conduct with minors. He also makes similar allegations about Drake's friends and continues to question Drake's talent.",

      "Lopez said she was \"immediately floored\" when she read the script for the film by writer and director Bill Condon, known for his work on \"Chicago\" and \"Dreamgirls.\" The movie is based on a 1970s novel by Manuel Puig, which Lopez described as being far ahead of its time.",

But I think the essence of who they were was very different, but still the same. And I think that was the challenge,\" Lopez explained.",

In that scene, Ingrid helps another character escape the harsh reality of prison through a fantasy-like performance. The number, titled \"Where You Are,\" serves as an emotional moment of release, inviting the character to forget his surroundings and find comfort through imagination.",
      "\"And I think that's what art and music and movies...films do for people. You know, and especially in difficult times of their life, I know for me, it definitely has been that way,\" Lopez said.",

She said the message behind his performance, much like her new film, centers on love and openness, encouraging people not to close themselves off to new experiences.",
      "\"Music and art transcends language. It doesn't matter,\" she said. \"And he's done that probably more than anybody of any generation he really has.\"",
      "Lopez said the Super Bowl gives artists a rare opportunity to reach new audiences and show who they are.",
      "\"It's about not having so many ideas and closing yourself off to experiences that you might be missing out on something wonderful. Don't do that to yourself. That's what I would say,\" she said.",

      "\"It couldn't have been a more perfect moment. And I didn't even see it. I know it was perfect-- God didn't let me see it, because I would've exploded. I would've died,\" Lopez said.",
      "For Lopez, it's always important to keep her mind and heart open, telling King she still considers herself a \"hopeful romantic\" - the term she told King she preferred over \"hopeless romantic\" in an interview in 2022.",
      "\"100%. 100%. And the more self aware I become with the lessons that I learn and the hardships that I go through, the more I feel whole and complete on my own, the more I become hopeful for that same type of person to come into my life,\" said Lopez. \"The more I know the more, you know, that type of person will come into my life. Yeah. And so I'm excited for everything in the future.\""

      "The business launched in 1998 and went public in 2000. LendingTree's site helps users find and compare mortgages, credit cards, insurance and other financial products.",
      "LendingTree, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, was later acquired by internet conglomerate IAC/InterActiveCorp, before spinning off on its own again in 2008.",

      "Scott Peyree, LendingTree's chief operating officer and president, will take over as president and CEO. Steve Ozonian, the lead independent director on the company's board, will serve as chairman of the board. Both leadership transitions are effective immediately, according to LendingTree.",
      "\"The news of losing Doug was devastating,\" Peyree said in a statement. \"But one of the most immediate impacts of his legacy is the strong management team he put in place at LendingTree. I look forward to leading our team and continuing our shared vision with Doug into the future.\"",
      "Lebda, who previously worked as an auditor and consultant for PriceWaterhouseCoopers, in 2010 also co-founded a financial services platform for children and families called Tykoon.",
      "\"All of my ideas come from my own experiences and problems,\" Lebda told the Wall Street Journal in a 2012 interview.",
      "Lebda is survived by his wife, Megan, and three daughters, LendingTree's spokesperson told The Associated Press. In a statement, Megan Lebda said her husband \"was an amazing man with a heart so big it seemed to have room for everyone he met.\"",
      "\"Our hearts are broken, but we are also deeply grateful for the love and support that has poured in from across the world,\" she said, adding that his legacy will continue both at LendingTree and in \"the lives he touched.\""

      "This marks the third year in a row the e-commerce giant has hired at least a quarter of a million additional part- and full-time workers for the busy holiday shopping period from October through December.",
      "Amazon's hiring spree comes as the overall number of seasonal jobs this year is expected to fall to its lowest level since 2009, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The outplacement firm attributes the expected decline in seasonal work to higher business costs from U.S tariffs, ongoing inflationary pressures and more reliance by retailers on automation.",
      "Amazon said its seasonal jobs pay an average of over $19 an hour. Regular full- and part-time employee wages average $23 an hour, plus benefits, according to the company.",
      "According to Challenger, retailers may add fewer than 500,000 positions this holiday season, down from roughly 543,000 in the final quarter of 2024.",
      "Unlike in past years, retailers have been cautious in announcing their seasonal hiring goals. Department store Kohl's recently said it would add temporary positions, but did not indicate how many. Target also said it would add staff for the holidays without specifying how many additional people it planned to hire.",
      "The more conservative seasonal hiring plans come as the broader job market is cooling. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, while private estimates also point to a slowdown in hiring."

      "In a typical year, about 20 million Americans \u2014 about 13% of all taxpayers \u2014 ask the IRS for a tax filing extension, according to agency data. Extensions, which are provided automatically if a taxpayer requests more time, provide an additional six months to prepare and file federal returns.",
      "An extension can help taxpayers who are facing complex tax situations or who need extra time to get their documents prepared for filing. Even so, an extension doesn't get exempt you from paying taxes you owe to the IRS, as the tax agency expects taxpayers to make good on their debts by the regular April 15 deadline.",

      "When is the tax extension deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes if you've received an extension is 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 15, in your local time zone, which means taxpayers should submit their electronic filing before that time on Wednesday.",

    "summary": "The U.S. economy picked up speed in the second half of the year, although job growth and inflation remain a concern, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy could be on the upswing even if tariffs and stubborn inflation continue to weigh on growth, according to a new analysis.",
      "The National Association for Business Economics (NABE) said Monday it expects the nation's gross domestic product \u2014 a measure of the total value of goods and services \u2014 to rise 1.8% in 2025, up from the group's previous estimate in June of 1.3%.",
      "The survey, which was conducted from Sept. 17-25, consulted 40 economists on their forecasts for labor growth, inflation and other key metrics for the remainder of the year and into 2026. NABE also expects the economy to expand at a faster pace in 2026, at 1.7%, higher than its June forecast of 1.4%.",
      "The report is the latest signal that economic growth continues to hold up despite rising inflation and a recent slowdown in the labor market. After\u00a0economic activity shrank in the first three months of 2025, growth has accelerated over the rest of the year, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco, vice president of NABE, told CBS News. The outlook for business investment in particular has improved, he noted.",
      "The economy could get a further boost this year from the Federal Reserve. NABE expects Fed officials, who trimmed their benchmark rate in September for the first time since 2024, to lower borrowing costs by another quarter of a percentage point by year-end and by a total of three-quarters of percentage point in 2026.",
      "Pain points remain",
      "While the economy has performed better than many experts predicted earlier this year, there are still signs of weakness. Government data indicates that job growth has deteriorated since the first half of the year.",
      "As hiring cools, meanwhile, the percentage of long-term job seekers \u2014 people unemployed for 27 weeks or longer \u2014 has risen to 26% of the total unemployed population, the highest in more than three years, labor data shows.",
      "Layoffs are also climbing. Through September, employers this year have cut nearly 950,000 jobs, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Looking ahead, NABE expects the job market to remain fragile. Economists predict average monthly payroll gains of 60,000 for the rest the year, down from the 87,000 the group forecasted in June. From January to August, employers added an average of around 75,000 jobs per month, according to government data.",
      "NABE projects that the nation's unemployment rate,\u00a04.3 % as of August, will rise to 4.5% in 2026.",
      "Another lingering pain point for the economy is inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% annual target. NABE expects inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditure index \u2014 the Fed's preferred measure of inflation \u2014 to rise at an annualized rate of 3% over the rest of 2025.",
      "Nearly all of those surveyed \u2014 95% \u2014 expect U.S. tariffs to drive up consumer prices over the rest of the year, according to NABE, although the group now expects stepped-up duties on imports to have less of an inflationary impact than it previously predicted. As a result, inflation is projected to cool to 2.5% by the end of 2026, according to the panel of economists.",
      "A recession is unlikely, according to NABE. Most of the economists polled by the group put the odds of a slump in the next 12 months at between 20% and less than 40%."

    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",

      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date.

      "\"I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep,\" he said. \"But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash.\"",
      "The Roaring '20s",
      "Despite a tumble this Friday, stocks on Wall Street have shot up in recent months. Still, some investors are getting weak in the knees, fearing stocks are overheated. Sorkin, author of \"1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History \u2013 and How It Shattered a Nation,\" out Oct. 14, says the U.S. is in a new roaring 20s, the 2020s, with stocks pushing to record highs, just as they were in the 1920s.",
      "Market highs today have him feeling anxious.",
      "\"I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology, and all of that, or everything's overpriced,\" he said.",
      "The market of 1929 was fueled by rampant speculation, including by ordinary investors unaware of the mounting risks, and of heavy borrowing. People of modest means were lured by Wall Street bankers and other stock market touts to invest using what was then a newfangled concept: credit. It was called buying on a margin. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your banker.",
      "Before 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt, influenced by religious views and moral norms against borrowing money, Sorkin said. That changed when General Motors, in 1919, started lending people money so they could afford to buy the company's cars. It changed out Americans shopped.",
      "\"And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access,\" Sorkin said. \"And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way.\"",
      "Today, it's hundreds of billions being invested in AI, with some investment pros warning of a possible bubble as stocks soar to stratospheric heights even amid significant economic uncertainty, such as Friday's slide after President Trump\u00a0 threatened more China tariffs.",
      "\"I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort,\" Sorkin said. \"The question is always when is the bubble going to pop?\"",
      "Protecting consumers in the market",
      "When things got out of control in 1929, frightened traders dumped stocks as investors lost their businesses and homes. In the years since, laws, regulations and agencies have been put in place to protect investors.",
      "Some of those barriers to prevent exploitation are now coming down, Sorkin said. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules have become less stringent and \"the Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore.\"",
      "\"That's what concerns me,\" Sorkin said. \"It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off.\"",
      "Those guardrails include ones that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public.",
      "In recent decades, people who could invest in private equity and venture capital outperformed investors who did not. Those kinds of assets, generally restricted to wealthy investors, are potentially more rewarding, but also riskier.",
      "\"Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that,\" Sorkin said. \"But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that.\"",
      "Some people feel elite investors have better access, while others are unable to get in early on opportunities, Sorkin said. There's been a push by both the Trump administration and the financial sector to open up the market to more people.",
      "But that would also require moving the guardrails designed to protect people.",
      "\"They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich,\" Sorkin said.",
      "Push today for democratizing investing",
      "In his latest annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested opening retirement 401(k)s to riskier private investments in the name of democratizing investing. He said there were opportunities for investing in AI or data centers.",
      "Right now money managers are precluded from investing in those types of assets in many retirement products, but the Trump administration is in the process of changing that, Fink explained.",
      "The new investment opportunity comes with risk.",
      "\"But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight,\" Fink said.",
      "Fink, who once called bitcoin the domain of money launderers and thieves, also wants to add crypto to investment portfolios.",
      "\"The markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions,\" he said. \"There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold \u2014 that is, it's an alternative.\"",
      "He sees it, as he does AI, as an opportunity to add diversity to a portfolio.",
      "But Sorkin says some crypto products, like meme coins, can be abused in ways similar to 1929, with speculators sending the value of cryptocurrencies soaring before they come crashing down. Sorkin has his own personal example involving a television appearance with Fink.",
      "\"He makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it,\" Sorkin said.",
      "The Sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day.",
      "\"And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day,\" Sorkin said."

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Friday he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month, citing new Chinese export controls \u2014 marking a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "The new 100% tariffs will add on to any existing import taxes on Chinese goods, the president wrote in a Truth Social post. Tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Mr. Trump said the U.S. will also impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\" starting next month.",
      "The tariffs could be imposed on Nov. 1 or sooner, \"depending on any further actions or changes taken by China,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "On Sunday, China signaled that it would not back down in the face of the tariff threat and urged the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats.",
      "\"China's stance is consistent,\" the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online Sunday. \"We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.\"",
      "It was China's first official comment on Mr. Trump's threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products.",
      "The president's announcement came hours after he threatened steeper duties on China. He pointed to new Chinese rules that require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths from China, even if they were manufactured outside of the country. China mines and processes most of the world's rare earth metals, which are\u00a0critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "\"It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,\" the president wrote in his Friday message announcing the tariffs, calling China's export controls \"extraordinarily aggressive\" and a \"moral disgrace.\"",
      "Separately on Friday, China\u00a0imposed port fees on U.S.-owned ships that dock in the country, retaliating against what Beijing called a \"discriminatory\" U.S. port fee on Chinese ships.",
      "Major stock indexes fell sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump's initial tariff threat. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.6%.",
      "The new tariffs and export restrictions could inflame trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, but the U.S. president said earlier Friday, \"there seems to be no reason\" for the meeting to take place.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. importing $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods and China buying $143.5 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to federal statistics.",
      "But China and the U.S. have had a rocky relationship on trade in recent months. Over the spring, American tariffs on Chinese goods spiked to 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports soared to 125%, following a set of tit-for-tat hikes that began with import duties unveiled by the Trump administration. In May, the U.S. and China agreed to slash their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively, while the two sides pursued a broader trade deal.",
      "The U.S.-China economic relationship has other complexities, too. The Trump administration needs Beijing's permission to close a deal to transfer ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations away from China-based parent company ByteDance. China has also chafed at some of the administration's restrictions on international students."

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 19:49:13 -0400",
    "summary": "French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday reappointed Sebastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after his resignation, to try again to form a government in a bid to end the country's political deadlock.",
    "story": [
      "French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday reappointed S\u00e9bastien Lecornu as prime minister, just days after his resignation, asking him to try again to form a government and produce a budget in a bid to end the country's political deadlock.",
      "Lecornu's reappointment followed days of intense negotiations and came less than a week after he resigned amid infighting in his freshly named government. France is struggling with mounting economic challenges and ballooning debt, and the political crisis is aggravating its troubles and raising alarm across the European Union.",
      "The appointment is widely seen as Macron's last chance to reinvigorate his second term, which runs until 2027. Lacking a majority in the National Assembly to push through his agenda, Macron faces mounting criticism \u2014 including from within his own ranks \u2014 and has little room to maneuver.",
      "Macron's office released a one-sentence statement late Friday night announcing the appointment, one month after the statement issued a month ago when Lecornu was initially named and four days after he resigned.",
      "Lecornu said in a statement on social networks that he accepted the new job offer out of \"duty.\" He said he was given a mission \"to do everything to give France a budget by the end of the year and respond to the daily problems of our compatriots.\"",
      "All those who join his new government will have to renounce ambitions to run for president in 2027, Lecornu said, adding that the new Cabinet will \"incarnate renewal and a diversity of skills.\"",
      "\"We must put an end to this political crisis that exasperates the French, and to this bad instability for France's image and its interests,\" he wrote.",
      "Lecornu abruptly resigned on Monday, only hours after unveiling a new Cabinet that drew opposition from a key coalition partner. The shock resignation prompted calls for Macron to step down or dissolve parliament again, as he did in June 2024. But they remained unanswered, with the president instead announcing on Wednesday that he would name a successor to Lecornu within 48 hours.",
      "Political party leaders met for more than two hours on Friday with Macron, at his request. Some cautioned that another prime minister picked from the ranks of Macron's fragile centrist camp would risk being disavowed by Parliament's powerful lower house, prolonging the crisis.",
      "\"How can one expect that all this will end well?\" said Marine Tondelier, leader of The Ecologists party. \"The impression we get is that the more alone he is, the more rigid he becomes.\"",
      "Over the past year, Macron's successive minority governments have collapsed in quick succession, leaving the European Union's second-largest economy mired in political paralysis as France is faced with a debt crisis. At the end of the first quarter of 2025, France's public debt stood at 3.346 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion), or 114% of gross domestic product.",
      "France's poverty rate also reached 15.4% in 2023, its highest level since records began in 1996, according to the latest data available from the national statistics institute.",
      "The economic and political struggles are worrying financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission, which has been pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt.",
      "The two biggest opposition parties in the National Assembly \u2014 the far-right National Rally and the far-left France Unbowed party \u2014 weren't invited to the discussions on Friday. The National Rally wants Macron to hold fresh legislative elections, and France Unbowed wants him to resign.",
      "Lecornu argued earlier this week that Macron's centrist bloc, its allies and parts of the opposition could still clump together into a working government. \"There's a majority that can govern,\" he said. \"I feel that a path is still possible. It is difficult.\"",
      "Lecornu will now have to seek compromises to avoid an immediate vote of no confidence and may even be forced to abandon an extremely unpopular pension reform that was one of Macron's signature policies in his second presidential term. Rammed through parliament without a vote in 2023 despite mass protests, it gradually raises the retirement age from 62 to 64. Opposition parties want it to be scrapped.",
      "The political deadlock stems from Macron's shock decision in June 2024 to dissolve the National Assembly. The snap elections produced a hung parliament, with no bloc able to command a majority in the 577-seat chamber. The gridlock has unnerved investors, infuriated voters, and stalled efforts to curb France's spiraling deficit and public debt.",
      "Without stable support, Macron's governments have stumbled from one crisis to the next, collapsing as they sought backing for unpopular spending cuts. Lecornu's resignation, just 14 hours after announcing his Cabinet, underscored the fragility of the president's coalition amid deep political and personal rivalries."

      "\"Investors still think the tit-for-tat between the U.S. and China these last few days is mostly posturing (the consensus view is that tariffs won't go up, and that Trump and Xi will still meet in South Korea), but trade-related risks have certainly risen after being dormant for the last several weeks,\" Wall Street analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "Stocks had been heading for a slight gain in the morning, until Mr. Trump said on his social media platform said he's considering \"a massive increase of tariffs\" on Chinese imports. He's upset at restrictions China has placed on exports of its rare earths, which are materials that are critical for the manufacturing of everything from consumer electronics to jet engines.",
      "\"We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one. I have always felt that they've been lying in wait, and now, as usual, I have been proven right!\"",
      "Mr. Trump also threatened to call off a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea later this month.",
      "\"Threatening significantly increased tariffs on China is a hallmark of Trump's negotiating tactics, and all it took was a headline to entice investors to take some chips off the table,\" Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management, said in an email.",
      "Primed for a slide?",
      "The market may have been primed for a slide. U.S. stocks were already facing criticism that their prices had shot too high following a nearly relentless 35% run for the S&P 500 from a low in April to record heights.",
      "Critics say the market looks overpriced after prices rose much faster than corporate profits. Worries are particularly high about companies in the artificial-intelligence industry, where pessimists are making comparisons to to the 2000 dot-com bubble that ultimately imploded. For stocks to look less expensive, either their prices need to fall, or profits need to rise.",
      "Other factors also weighed on investor sentiment Friday, including the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and fresh data showing that consumers are anxious about the economy.",
      "The University of Michigan's preliminary October sentiment index,\u00a0released\u00a0Friday, shows consumer sentiment fell 0.1% on a monthly basis, from 55.1 points in September to 55. While the drop was nominal, it represents the third consecutive month the confidence measure, which is closely watched by investors, has declined.",
      "\"Pocketbook issues like high prices and weakening job prospects remain at the forefront of consumers' minds,\" Joanne Hsu, director of the Surveys of Consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a statement.",
      "The job market has slowed so much that the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate last month for the first time this year. Fed officials have penciled in more cuts through next year to give the economy more breathing room. But Chair Jerome Powell has also said they may have to change course if inflation stays high. That's because lower interest rates can push inflation even higher."

      "Vessels owned or operated by American companies or individuals, and ships built in the U.S. or flying the American flag, would be subjected to a 400 yuan ($56) per net ton fee per voyage if they dock in China, China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday.",
      "The fees would be applied on the same ship for a maximum of five voyages each year, and would rise every year until 2028, when it would hike to 1,120 yuan ($157) per net ton, the ministry said. They would take effect on Oct. 14, the same day when the United States is due to start imposing port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "China's Ministry of Transport said on Friday in a statement that its special fees on American vessels are \"countermeasures\" in response to \"wrongful\" U.S. practices, referring to the planned U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels.",
      "The ministry also slammed the United States' port fees as \"discriminatory\" that would \"severely damage the legitimate interests of China's shipping industry\" and \"seriously undermine\" international economic and trade order.",
      "China has announced a string of trade measures and restrictions before an expected meeting between Trump and Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in South Korea that begins at the end of October. On Thursday, Beijing unveiled new curbs on exports of rare earths and related technologies, as well as new restrictions on the export of some lithium battery and related production equipment.",
      "The port fees announced by Beijing on Friday mirrors many aspects of the U.S. port fees on Chinese ships docking in American ports. Under Washington's plans, Chinese-owned or -operated ships will be charged $50 per net ton for each voyage to the U.S., which would then rise by $30 per net ton each year until 2028. Each vessel would be charged no more than five times per year.",
      "China's new port fee is \"not just a symbolic move,\" said Kun Cao, deputy chief executive at consulting firm Reddal. \"It explicitly targets any ship with meaningful U.S. links \u2014 ownership, operation, flag, or build \u2014 and scales steeply with ship size.\"",
      "The \"real bite is on U.S.-owned and operated vessels,\" he said, adding that North America accounts for roughly 5% of the world fleet by beneficial ownership, which is still a meaningful figure although not as huge as compared to Greek, Chinese and Japanese ship owners.",
      "However, the United States has only about 0.1% of global commercial shipbuilding market share in recent years and built fewer than 10 commercial ships last year, Reddal added.",
      "While shipping analysts have said that the U.S. port fees on Chinese vessels would likely have limited impact on trade and freight rates as some shipping companies have been redeploying their fleets to avoid the extra charge, shipping data provider Alphaliner warned last month in a report that the U.S. port fees could still cost up to $3.2 billion next year for the world's top 10 carriers.",

    "story": [
      "Two consumers allege that Amazon misled customers by promoting false discounts on its site during its summer Prime Day sale.",
      "In a proposed class-action lawsuit filed in September in a federal court in Washington state, plaintiffs Cathy Armstrong of California and Oluwa Fosudo of Maryland claim that Amazon used \"fictional\" list prices to calculate its recent Prime Day percentage discounts, making deals appear better than they actually were.",
      "The lawsuit details a number of examples of what plaintiffs alleged were \"fake sales\" during the four-day Prime Day event, which ran July 8-11.",
      "One such example is a pair of headphones advertised by Amazon on Prime Day as being on sale for 44% off the product's list price of $179.95, according to the complaint. Plaintiffs claim that the item's list price has always been in the range of \"$130 to $160\" and that the advertised 44% discount was misleading.",
      "\"Amazon uses these fake Prime Day Percentage Discounts, offered under the extreme time pressure of the brief Prime Day window, to lure consumers to purchase products,\" the complaint states.",
      "In another example, the lawsuit mentions an 8-inch Android tablet for kids listed as \"40% off,\" based on a strikethrough list price of $119.99. However, in the 90 days leading up to the sale, the tablet was being offered for between $50 and $85, with a median price of $72, according to the suit.",
      "That means the supposedly time-limited Prime Day Deal of $72.18 was actually higher than the tablet's $50 price Amazon was selling the item for in April, and about the same price the item usually goes for on Amazon, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "\"But for Amazon's false and misleading representations, Plaintiffs would also have shopped around for better prices in the marketplace or waited to purchase the items at a better price,\" according to the complaint.",
      "The lawyers who brought the suit on behalf of the plaintiffs declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. They filed the proposed class action after Popular Information, a Substack newsletter focused on corporate and political accountability, published a\u00a0story\u00a0calling out some of the allegedly deceptive tactics Amazon used during its Prime Day event.",
      "Amazon declined to comment.",
      "On its corporate website, the company\u00a0calls the recent four-day sale\u00a0its biggest Prime event to date and states that customers \"saved billions on deals.\" The retailer\u00a0held a separate Prime Day event this week from Oct. 7-8.",
      "Amazon in September\u00a0agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle federal claims it misled customers into signing up for Prime and made it difficult for them to cancel their membership. As part of the settlement, Amazon must pay a $1 billion civil penalty \u2014 the largest ever in an FTC rule violation case."

      "Travelers planning to fly into or out of U.S. airports could feel the impact of staffing issues, which continue to build as the government shutdown\u00a0reached its 10th day Friday.",
      "The \"national picture today looks a little messy,\" CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave said from Los Angeles International Airport on Friday.",
      "Across the U.S., roughly 52,000 flights are scheduled ahead of the\u00a0Columbus Day\u00a0weekend, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "Tasked with keeping travelers safe on the ground and in the air, TSA officers and air traffic controllers are\u00a0deemed essential\u00a0by the government, requiring them\u00a0to keep working\u00a0during the shutdown without immediate pay.",
      "However, an uptick in workers calling out sick has led to sporadic flight delays and cancellations, raising concerns over staffing shortages. The scheduling irregularities come as\u00a0potential weather disruptions\u00a0are expected across the East Coast and in Phoenix.",
      "\"On top top that you have uncertainty that's been injected into basically everyone's travels because of the staffing situation that we're seeing pop up sporadically throughout the air traffic control system,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Typically, air traffic controller shortages drive about 5% of all flight delays. That figure is currently 53%, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told Fox Business.",
      "\"It doesn't look like its a coordinated or targeted sick out per se, but you're seeing more sick calls than you would normally see, and so, everyday, particularly as we get into the afternoon and evening hours, multiple FAA facilities have what are called staffing triggers, where they are short-staffed basically,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "\"And some of those don't result in a whole lot of disruption, and we've seen others that have been pretty disruptive,\" he added.",
      "For example, at Nashville International Airport in Tennessee on Thursday, roughly 40,000 flyers were inconvenienced by an air traffic controller shortage. \"So it's not nothing, even if the vast majority off air traffic controllers are working,\" Van Cleave said.",
      "Air traffic controllers who violate agency sick leave policies will face repercussions, Secretary Duffy said this week.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the union representing such workers, said in a statement on its\u00a0website\u00a0that it does not condone their members taking actions that would compromise the safety of the nation's airspace. The union also urged workers to keep showing up on the job, despite not being paid on schedule.",
      "\"At this critical juncture, it is more important than ever that we rise to the occasion and continue delivering the consistent, high-level of public service we provide every day,\" tNATCA stated.",
      "Still, the impact of staffing shortages on flights so far\u00a0has been minimal, reported Van Cleave, but delays could worsen as staffing shortages continue.",
      "\"While delays and cancellations have been within historic norms this week, and the vast majority of fights are leaving on time, the amount of delays because of air traffic controllers staffing is up,\" he said."

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:46:14 -0400",
    "summary": "The IRS on Thursday announced adjustments to the federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The IRS is adjusting the income limits for its federal income tax brackets to account for the impact of inflation, an annual reset that could provide relief for some Americans when they file their taxes next year.",
      "The IRS makes these adjustments, typically in October or November, to avoid what it known as \"bracket creep,\" which is when inflation pushes people into higher tax brackets, potentially forcing them to dole out more money come April.",
      "The upshot: Americans will have to earn more income next year before reaching a higher tax bracket. For example, the upper tax limit on a single filer making $50,000 will be 12% in 2026 versus 22% in 2025.",
      "See the updated tax brackets below.",
      "The IRS did not respond to a request for comment on the inflation rate it applied in adjusting its tax brackets for 2026. Bloomberg Tax forecasted last month that the agency would apply an inflation rate of 2.7%.",
      "In 2024, the IRS adjusted\u00a0its tax bracket thresholds by 5.4%\u00a0to account for the lingering inflation that erupted during the pandemic. That followed a\u00a0historically large adjustment\u00a0of 7% in 2023.",
      "The IRS uses the\u00a0\"Chained Consumer Price Index\"\u00a0data from the past 12 months to make adjustments for the 2026 tax year, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
      "The IRS announced Wednesday that an agency-wide furlough would begin on Oct. 8 due to a lapse in federal appropriations as a result of the government shutdown. Taxpayers with an Oct. 15 extension deadline should plan on submitting their returns as planned, according to the agency.",
      "\"Taxpayers should continue to file, deposit, and pay federal income taxes as they normally would; the lapse in appropriations does not change Federal Income Tax responsibilities,\" a spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "Standard Deduction",
      "In addition to setting the federal income tax brackets, the IRS also released changes to 2026 standard deductions on Thursday.",
      "Married couples filing jointly will have a standard deduction of $32,200Heads of households will have a standard deduction of $24,150Single taxpayers and married individuals will face a standard deduction of $16,100",
      "Married couples filing jointly will have a standard deduction of $32,200",
      "Heads of households will have a standard deduction of $24,150",
      "Single taxpayers and married individuals will face a standard deduction of $16,100",
      "Seniors could see additional relief due to a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that provides a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for people aged 65 and older. The tax break, which is set to expire at the end of 2028, is available to those with an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less for single filers and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly.",
      "Earned Income Tax Credit",
      "The maximum amount for households that claim the Earned Income Tax Credit will be $8,231 for families with at least three children, up from $8,046 for the current tax year, the IRS said.",
      "Estate tax limit",
      "The estates of wealthy Americans will see a bigger tax break in 2026 than they did this year. The IRS said Thursday that the estates of people who die in 2026 will have a basic exclusion amount of $15 million, up from nearly $14 million in the 2025 tax year.",
      "Health Flexible Spending",
      "U.S. workers can now voluntarily contribute up to $3,400 to their health flexible spending accounts, up $100 from prior year. These contributions, which are deducted pre-tax from employee paychecks, go toward an account that can be used to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses.",
      "Understanding your tax bracket",
      "There's a misconception that Americans pay the top tax rate on every dollar of their income, but that isn't the case. Taxation in the U.S. is progressive, meaning that tax rates increase the more you earn. In other words, the seven income tax rate brackets \u2014 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% \u2014 represent the percentage you'll pay on portions of your income.",
      "For instance, a single taxpayer making $50,000 in taxable income in 2026, will pay 10% in federal taxes on the first $12,400 of their income (the top threshold for the 10% bracket) and then 12% on the remaining $37,600.",
      "To determine your marginal tax bracket, you must first figure out what your highest taxable income is. Take the example of a married couple with $150,000 in gross income. They would first subtract the 2026 standard deduction of $32,200 from that amount, leaving them with $117,800 in taxable income. That would put their top marginal tax rate at 22%.",
      "However, their effective tax rate \u2014 meaning the percentage of their annual income that they will pay to the IRS \u2014\u00a0is much lower, as follows:",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxesTheir earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes\u00a0Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Their first $24,800 of income will be taxed at 10%, or $2,480 in taxes",
      "Their earnings from $24,800 to $100,800 would be taxed at 12%, or $9,120 in taxes",
      "Their income from $100,800 to $117,800 would be taxed at 22%, or $3,740 in taxes",
      "Combined, they would pay $15,340 in federal income taxes, giving them an effective tax rate of 13%.",
      "How the OBBBA will impact taxes",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by President Trump in July, made most of the tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, helping some American taxpayers avert a scheduled tax increase.",
      "As a result of the Republican spending bill, the typical filer could see an average tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, with benefits varying depending on the filer's geographic location, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0in August from the Tax Foundation.",
      "A taxpayer's income will also influence the tax cuts they see, with higher-income Americans more likely to see a bigger benefit from tax provisions in the legislation than lower-income households.",
      "A July\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center found that the typical household in the bottom quintile \u2014 those earning up to $34,600 per year \u2014 will save an average of about $150 in tax payments in 2026, or 0.8% of their income. By comparison, those in the top quintile \u2014 those who earn $217,101 or more \u2014 will save an average of $12,540 next year, or 2.5% of their income."

    "story": [
      "Senators have launched an inquiry into companies paid billions in taxpayer dollars to build eligibility systems for Medicaid, expressing concern that error-riddled technology and looming work requirements \"will cause Americans to lose Medicaid coverage to this bureaucratic maze.\"",
      "The letters, dated Oct. 10, were sent to four companies and follow a KFF Health News investigation that exposed widespread issues in states using Deloitte-run systems to assess Medicaid eligibility for millions of people. Failures have resulted in the erroneous loss of health coverage and other vital safety-net benefits for low-income people. Malfunctions in those systems can cost millions and take years to fix.",
      "As most states prepare to institute work requirements mandated by the tax and domestic spending law President Trump signed in July, senators wrote it is each company's responsibility to build functioning systems, \"rather than to prioritize their bottom line.\"",
      "Democratic Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), sent the letters to several companies the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services identified as eligibility system contractors: Deloitte, GDIT, Gainwell Technologies, and Conduent.",
      "\"They're essentially health care middlemen that are in the business of red tape, and they profit when Americans don't get health care,\" Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees Medicaid, said in an interview.",
      "\"They've got a history of poor performance when it comes to determining eligibility or in helping Americans enroll in Medicaid,\" Wyden said. \"Without stronger oversight and real accountability, these contractors are just going to get a jumbo windfall for creating systems that actually harm Americans trying to get health care.\"",
      "Spokespeople for the four companies did not provide comments for this article.",
      "As of June, 70.5 million people were enrolled in Medicaid, according to CMS.",
      "A handful of states operate their own Medicaid eligibility and enrollment systems, but most rely on contractors to build and run them. KFF Health News found that Deloitte, a global consultancy that generated $70.5 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2025, dominates this slice of government business. Twenty-five states have awarded Deloitte contracts for eligibility systems. The agreements, in which the company commits to design, develop, implement, or operate state-owned systems, are worth at least $6 billion, dwarfing any of its competitors.",
      "Kinda Serafi, a partner at Manatt Health, is advising states on how to reconfigure their systems to incorporate work requirements.",
      "States are in a \"major sprint\" to make changes by 2027, she said, and they're being \"inundated\" with pitches from vendors looking to secure contracts. It underscores the business opportunity these system changes represent for contractors.",
      "\"I think we have to really be vigilant to make sure that these vendors are implementing the requirements consistent with the law,\" Serafi said.",
      "Companies sign contracts with state governments, but the federal government pays the bulk of the cost. The federal government covers 90% of states' costs to develop and implement state Medicaid eligibility systems and 75% of ongoing maintenance and operations expenses, according to federal regulations.",
      "The Senate letters cite problems with Deloitte-run eligibility systems that KFF Health News identified. Among other issues, the Florida eligibility system erroneously cut benefits for new moms, and a problem in Kentucky prevented coverage applications from getting through online, which cost $522,455 and took 10 months to resolve.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these are just a few examples of third-party systems' failure to serve their very function: to reliably and accurately determine an individual's eligibility for Medicaid coverage and services,\" the senators wrote.",
      "The senators asked the companies to respond by Oct. 31 to their questions, such as whether companies' contracts with states include financial incentives tying payment to the removal of Medicaid enrollees and whether the companies are penalized for coverage terminations made in error. The senators also demanded an accounting of the company's lobbying expenditures for the past five years and protocols for making system changes.",
      "By 2027, the Congressional Budget Office projected, based on an early version of the bill, 18.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries will have to work or complete other qualifying activities for 80 hours a month to keep their benefits, unless they qualify for an exemption. The CBO estimates that 5.3 million enrollees will lose coverage by 2034.",
      "The new work requirements are just one of several federally mandated Medicaid changes that are forcing states to adapt their eligibility systems.",
      "Medicaid work requirements have been plagued with problems in the few states where they've been tested. Medicaid enrollees have been frustrated in trying to navigate byzantine rules and glitchy technology. Work requirements have also come at great cost.",
      "Georgia has not adopted the ACA Medicaid expansion, which has granted benefits to millions of adults earning up to 138% of the federal poverty level. Instead, the state offers benefits to some people earning up to the poverty line who can prove they're working or participating in similar activities for 80 hours a month. Nearly 110,000 Georgians had applied to the state's Georgia Pathways to Coverage program through May, but only 9,157 people were enrolled as of mid-August. Under typical ACA expansion rules, 336,000 adults would be eligible for coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The Georgia program has cost $109 million, with $34 million spent on health benefits and more than $20 million allocated to marketing contracts, according to a KFF Health News analysis of state reports. Deloitte built Georgia's eligibility system and is the primary consultant for the Pathways program.",
      "Before Medicaid work requirements became federal law, Arizona also submitted a request to federal regulators to launch its own version that would apply to roughly 190,000 people.",
      "The state's application provided insight into the types of system changes states may soon need to make to manage the new federal work requirement.",
      "Arizona Medicaid officials said they would gather information on enrollees' work hours, training, and education. The state's eligibility system, which is operated by Accenture, would also need to check whether someone is exempt.",
      "States are in the early stages of determining changes they need to make to implement work requirements.",
      "Tessa Outhyse, a spokesperson for the California Department of Health Care Services, said the state expects upgrades to be processed \"through the existing contractual change order process.\" State contracts with eligibility companies often set aside millions to cover the cost of changes, but systems may require upgrades beyond the agreed-upon work.",
      "In Missouri, upgrades are expected to cost roughly $33 million, according to a state budget document.",
      "The state has a contract with private company RedMane to handle some of its Medicaid eligibility processing. Missouri plans to hire an additional contractor to ensure it properly institutes Medicaid work requirements, according to Baylee Watts, a spokesperson for Missouri's Department of Social Services.",

      "\"No pay has me anxious because none of us have any idea how long the shutdown is going to go on for. It could be weeks, or it could be a short shutdown,\" Kirwan, who has been with the NLRB for three years, told CBS News. \"The longer it gets, the more debt people will have to incur to survive during the interim period.\"",
      "\"It's certainly scary, especially for federal workers making under $50,000 a year, and for federal contractors who have no guarantee of backpay whatsoever under the law,\" he added.",
      "Kirwan, 31, said that if the shutdown drags on for weeks or months, he would likely have to lean on credit cards to afford the basics, and perhaps take out a loan for any larger expenses.",
      "\"Like many Americans, I have very little in the way of emergency funds and savings, and I know I would not be able to hold on if it's a very long shutdown,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Kirwan, who said he had aspired to work in government since his youth, also emphasized his commitment to public service despite the political turmoil.",
      "\"While taking on that additional debt and loans is certainly painful, if it results in jobs and my agency being saved and strengthened, I'll take that deal any day,\" he said.",
      "Asked for comment regarding government workers' concerns about the impact of the shutdown on their finances, the White House blamed congressional Democrats for the stalemate.",
      "\"The Trump Administration is encouraging the Democrats to stop the pain and reopen the government with the bipartisan funding proposal they supported just six months ago and 13 times under Biden \u2014 but Chuck Schumer thinks every day of the shutdown 'gets better.' How dismissive to countless Americans struggling because of his party's decision,\"\u00a0 White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The office for Schumer, the Senate minority leader and a Democrat from New York, didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "The Republic National Committee and Democratic National Committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the impact of the shutdown on federal workers.",
      "\"People aren't able to get justice\"",
      "MT Snyder, who also works for the NLRB as a field examiner and is a member of the agency's union, said the shutdown is hampering the board's efforts to investigate employee claims of unfair labor practices and other workplace disputes.",
      "\"Everything is stopped, so workers who were illegally fired don't have any recourse because there is nowhere else to go beside the NLRB,\" Snyder, whose work involves investigating such complaints, told CBS News. \"So it's really frustrating that I am not able to do my job, and people aren't able to get justice.\"",
      "Snyder, 30, also said the uncertainty around when she can return to work amounts to a \"huge psychological toll\" that weighs on her and other government employees.",
      "\"As federal workers, we don't have any say. We are not in Congress making choices, but we get the outcome of it and feel those effects,\" she told CBS News.",
      "The NLRB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a\u00a0notice\u00a0posted on the agency's website on Sept. 30, before the shutdown began, the NLRB stated that unfair labor practice hearings scheduled for Oct. 1 or later would be postponed indefinitely.",
      "\"There is a moral injury\"",
      "Another federal employee \u2014 who works for the Department of Veterans Affairs but who didn't want to be identified by name because she fears potential retribution \u2014 is among those employees who is still on the job during the shutdown.",

      "Reports of traffic violations include vehicles operating with FSD driving through red tra\ufb03c signals and initiating lane changes into opposing tra\ufb03c.",
      "NHTSA has received reports of 58 safety violations linked to Tesla vehicles with FSD. Those incidents include more than a dozen crashes and fires, along with 23 injuries, according to the agency.",
      "U.S. regulators have  been investigating Tesla's automated driving systems for more than three years because of dozens of crashes that raised safety concerns, such as\u00a0a Seattle-area Tesla crash\u00a0in 2024 involving Full Self-Driving that killed a motorcyclist.",
      "\"The ultimate question is, 'Does the software work?'\" asked Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst with a \"sell\" rating on Tesla shares stock.",
      "Such problems have led lawmakers and safety regulators to question whether Tesla's automated system and other like it will ever be able to operate safely on a widespread scale. A new law in California that would hold driverless car companies accountable for traffic violations is set to\u00a0take effect next year.",
      "Tesla is also under investigation by NHTSA for a \"summon\" technology that allows drivers to tell their cars to drive to their location to pick them up, a feature that has reportedly led to some fender benders in parking lots. A probe into driver-assistance features in 2.4 million Teslas was opened last year after several crashes in fog and other low-visibility conditions, including one in which a pedestrian was killed.",
      "Another investigation was launched by NHTSA in August looking into why Tesla allegedly has not been reporting crashes promptly to the agency as required by its rules.",
      "CEO Elon Musk is under pressure to show that the latest advances in its driver-assistance features have not fixed such problems. He recently promised to put hundreds of thousands of such self-driving Tesla cars and Tesla robotaxis on roads by the end of the next year.",
      "Tesla shares fell 1.4% Thursday. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

      "Airports in U.S. cities including Denver; Newark, New Jersey; and Burbank, California, experienced flight delays Monday amid shortages of air traffic controllers, according to federal flight data.",
      "Federal officials have flagged more air traffic control facilities for low staffing levels in recent days than they have since the summer of 2022, when the post-COVID travel boom sent delays and cancellations soaring, according to a CBS News data analysis of Federal Aviation Administration airspace advisories.",
      "The shortage of air traffic controllers at some airports comes as the U.S. government shutdown that has shuttered federal agencies continues into a second week.",
      "Flights into Hollywood Burbank Airport, which serves Los Angeles, were slowed until 1 a.m. Tuesday, resulting in average delays of 2.5 hours, FAA data shows. No air traffic controllers were on duty on Monday evening at the airport, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a social media post.",
      "According to CBS News Los Angeles, plane captains taking off from the Burbank airport were being asked to contact SoCal Approach, a San Diego-based company also known as Southern California TRACON, so they could communicate and get departure clearance.",
      "When there's a shortage of air traffic controllers, the FAA reduces the number of takeoffs and landings to ensure the on-duty personnel aren't overwhelmed and the system remains safe. But that can creates flight delays and cancellations.",
      "\"Fragile\" aviation system",
      "On Monday, a total of almost 6,000 flights were delayed in the U.S., including 42% of flights leaving from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and 23% of those from Hollywood Burbank\u00a0according to tracking site FlightAware. Weather issues also caused some flight delays on Monday.",
      "As of Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. EDT, more than 600 flights within the U.S. had been delayed, FlightAware data shows.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the union representing the nation's air traffic controllers, on Monday instructed its members to keep working\u00a0during the\u00a0government shutdown. Because air traffic controllers are classified as essential workers, they're expected to continue working without pay, although they would receive back pay once the shutdown ends.",
      "\"It is normal for a few air traffic controllers to call in sick on any given day, and this is the latest example of how fragile our aviation system is in the midst of a national shortage of these critical safety professionals,\" NATCA said in statement.",
      "It added, \"NATCA has consistently warned that the controller staffing shortage leaves the system vulnerable, and today's events underscore the urgent need to accelerate training and hiring.\"",
      "The TSA has seen a slight increase in air traffic controllers\u00a0calling in sick\u00a0since the shutdown began last week, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Monday at a news conference at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.",
      "\"We're tracking sick calls, sick leave. And have we had a slight tick up in sick calls? Yes,\" he told reporters. \"You'll see delays come from that. ... Our priorities are safety, and so if we have additional calls, we will reduce the flow consistent with a rate that's safe for the American people.\"",
      "Near the end of a 34-day government shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019, there were widespread flight delays because of shortages of controllers.",

    "summary": "Minutes from September Fed meeting reveal a divide between members who support additional rate cuts and those worried about inflation.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve officials remain cautious about future interest rate cuts, with an account from the central bank's meeting in September underscoring the division among central bank officials over the best path for monetary policy.",
      "While some officials think the Fed's benchmark rate is too high and weighing on the economy, others point to persistent inflation that remains above the central bank's 2% target as evidence of the need need to show caution in lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Most members of the Fed's rate-setting committee supported further reductions to its key interest rate this year, according to minutes from last month's meeting released on Wednesday.",
      "A majority of Fed officials perceived growing risks to the job market since their previous meeting in July, while the threat of rising inflation \"had either diminished or not increased,\" according to the minutes. As a result, the central bank decided at its Sept. 16-17 meeting to reduce its key rate by a quarter of a percentage point, its first cut since December of 2024.",
      "\"The overall message appears to be that, although most participants are on board with further cuts, it probably won't take much for the FOMC to take a slower approach than it indicated last month,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"We still see scope for the Fed to skip its projected cut in December, based on our view that the economy and labor market will outperform current downbeat expectations.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts often gradually lead to lower borrowing costs for mortgages,\u00a0auto loans, credit cards and business loans, encouraging more spending and hiring.",
      "Only one official formally dissented from the quarter-point cut \u2014 Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Trump and was approved by the Senate just hours before the meeting began. He supported a larger, half-point cut instead.",
      "But the minutes also noted that \"a few\" policymakers said they could have supported keeping rates unchanged, or said that \"there was merit\" in such a step.",
      "The differences help explain Chair Jerome Powell's statements during the news conference that followed the meeting: \"There are no risk-free paths now. It's not incredibly obvious what to do.\"",
      "Miran said in remarks Tuesday that he thinks inflation will steadily decline back toward the Fed's 2% target, and as a result he doesn't think the Fed's rate needs to be nearly as high as it is. Rental costs around the U.S. are steadily falling and will bring down inflation, he predicted, while higher tariff revenues will reduce the government's budget deficit and reduce longer-term interest rates, giving the Fed more room to cut.",
      "Yet ther Fed officials remain concerned about stubbornly high inflation, the minutes showed. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch, said in a speech Monday that \"inflation is too high\" and argued that the Fed should keep rates high enough to cool demand and prevent inflation from worsening.",
      "\"Looking ahead, most participants indicated that additional policy easing would likely be appropriate later this year, provided inflation continued to trend lower and labor market risks persisted,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note assessing the latest Fed minutes. \"However, views diverged, with some participants noting that financial conditions were not particularly tight and warning against over-correcting.\"",
      "Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press that he supported a cautious approach toward further lowering rates, and wanted to see evidence that inflation would cool further.",
      "\"I am a little uneasy with front-loading rate cuts, presuming that those upticks in inflation will just go away,\" he said."

    "summary": "A range of factors has driven gold prices to record highs this year \u2014 a surge some Wall Street analysts think is likely to continue.",
    "story": [
      "Gold is glittering for investors, with prices now topping a record $4,000 an ounce. But the reasons behind the shiny metal's surge may be less than dazzling, with Wall Street analysts saying it reflects growing unease over the U.S. economy and political stability.",
      "The price of gold has leaped 53%\u00a0this year alone, far outpacing the 15% gain in the S&P 500 stock index over the same period. The price of an ounce of gold edged higher on Wednesday, touching $4,078, according to financial data company FactSet, with some analysts predicting it to go higher.",
      "Investors have long turned to gold during periods of economic turmoil and high inflation, viewing it as both a safe haven when markets turn volatile and a hedge against rising prices.",
      "Of late, however, stock prices have steamed to record highs this year, economic growth has accelerated in recent months and inflation this year has remained relatively subdued, prompting questions about what's fueling investors' renewed appetite for gold.",
      "\"$4,000 an ounce seemed far-fetched at the start of the year as gold entered 2025 near $2,800 an ounce. But after a ~50% rally, here we are,\" eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell said in an email.",
      "The reasons for the surge boil down to several economic and political factors, according to Kenwell and other investment analysts.",
      "Economic uncertainty",
      "Gold is often a refuge for investors when they're worried about the economy, and the ongoing U.S. government shutdown is only fueling their anxieties, according to Nigel Green, CEO of investment firm deVere Group.",
      "\"The situation in Washington has reminded investors that political promises do not equate to financial security. Gold represents protection from that uncertainty, but its price now also reflects how much faith has drained from other assets. That level of dependence always carries risk,\" Green said in an email.",
      "Although the economy continues to expand, investors are also expressing concern about potential headwinds to growth, including the impact of U.S. tariffs and a weakening job market, according to economists.",
      "Federal agencies currently aren't releasing economic data due to the government shutdown, now in its second week. That makes it more difficult to get a handle on the state of the economy, said Kevin Ford, FX and macro strategist at Convera.",
      "\"[T]he US economy remains a challenge to read due to the ongoing government shutdown, which has severely diminished visibility,\" Ford noted. \"However, the shutdown is a material headwind: S&P Global Ratings estimates it could trim GDP growth by 0.1\u22120.2 percentage point for every week the government remains closed.\"",
      "Fed rate cuts",
      "In September, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate for the first time since late 2024 and signaled that two more cuts could be in the cards later this year.",
      "Gold has risen partly due to investor expectations that the Fed is entering a cycle of easing its monetary policy, according to Bart Melek, head of commodity strategy at TD Securities.",
      "With interest rates seemingly heading lower, gold is more attractive as a financial asset because investors aren't losing out on higher yields from Treasuries and other government bonds, he told investors in a report. And with inflation drifting up due to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, gold can also continue to offer an inflation hedge.",
      "Gold \"may be a better safe-haven than Treasuries,\" Melek wrote. \"Add to that the fact that ore grades are dropping, the increased use of these factors of production suggests that gold would be better at protecting purchasing power.\"",
      "Global gold demand",
      "Investments in gold have also been driven by other factors. Analysts point to strong gold demand from central banks around the world amid heightened geopolitical tensions, such as the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "\"The gold rally started in 2022,\" Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, said via email on Tuesday. The \"trigger point\" for the increase was when the U.S. and other Western allies moved to freeze around $300 billion of Russian foreign holdings at the beginning of the war in Ukraine, he added.",
      "Central banks in other nations are \"the quiet force behind this climb,\" deVere's Green said. \"They are buying close to one thousand [tons] of gold each year to reduce exposure to the dollar and to reinforce their financial resilience. When official institutions keep accumulating at this rate, they create a strong foundation beneath the market, but even that has limits.\"",
      "Where could gold go from here?",
      "Some investment pros think gold has more room to run, pointing to ongoing economic challenges such as the slowing U.S. job market and rising inflation, as well as the Fed likely continuing to push down borrowing costs.",
      "\"We think the rally is not yet done \u2014 we expect prices to rise to $4,200/oz over the coming months \u2014 and keep our 'attractive' rating on gold in our global strategy,\" Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, CIO Americas and global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, told investors in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs is forecasting that gold could hit $4,900 an ounce by December 2026, Reuters reported.",
      "Still, experts urge average investors not to put all their eggs in one basket. Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many claim and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as derivative-based investments.",
      "\"Gold is perceived by many market participants as a safe-haven asset. But investors need to be aware it has a volatility of 10-15%,\" Staunovo noted. He added that smaller amounts of physical gold, such as gold coins or 1-gram bars, have larger ranges between buying and selling prices."

      "Glocks are among the most popular handguns sold in California. Even former Vice President Kamala Harris owns one. But Californians will no longer be able to buy a new Glock gun in the state.",
      "Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law that bans the sale of new Glock guns in California.",
      "At issue, the new Glock design allows the gun to be easily modified with a Lego-sized piece of plastic known as a \"Glock Switch\" that can be 3-D printed to turn it into a fully automatic weapon.",
      "Glock \"switches\" are already illegal, but Democratic lawmakers in California went one step further by passing a bill along party lines that outlaws the sale of any new gun with a Glock-like design. The new law does not ban possession of Glocks, nor does it ban reselling used Glocks in California.",

      "Deborah Grimes lost her only son, Greg \"Najee' Grimes, when he was shot seven times with a modified Glock. Najee\u00a0was shot and killed\u00a0in a downtown Sacramento nightclub in 2022. The gunman fired 11 rapid shots into a crowd, with seven hitting Najee.",
      "\"Had he been shot maybe once, even twice, I feel that he would have been able to survive that,\" Grimes said.",
      "Najee was a star football player, a coach, and a mentor to special needs kids. He is now the reason for Deborah Grimes' mission with the advocacy group Moms Demand Action.",
      "It was the\u00a0second mass shooting\u00a0in the shadow of the California State Capitol in just three months and one of 55 statewide that year.",
      "The shooter\u00a0used a Glock handgun, modified with a Glock Switch.",
      "\"There was just too much damage because that Glock 'switch' was a killing machine,\" Grimes said of her son's shooting.",
      "Najee's murder garnered national attention, even being featured on \"America's Most Wanted\" while law enforcement officials were still searching for a suspect. Now, his mom hopes her advocacy will have a national impact.",
      "\"I hope that Glock moves forward to make the (design) change,\" Grimes said.",
      "If Glock were to redesign the gun, it could be sold in California again. However, the current design was grandfathered in before California passed\u00a0its stringent gun certification laws in 2001.\u00a0\u00a0A new design would have to go through a lengthy certification process.",
      "AB 1127 was passed by the California legislature on a party-line vote, with all Republican assemblymembers in opposition.",
      "\"By specifically targeting the potential for modification, this bill disproportionately affects potential Glock purchasers and restricts access to one of the most popular handguns available,\" Republican lawmakers outlined in their analysis of the bill.",
      "Glock did not respond to a request for comment."

    "story": [
      "President Trump hailed \" the historic dawn of a new Middle East\" in remarks to Israeli lawmakers at the Knesset on Monday, after all living hostages were reunited with their families.",
      "The president received repeated standing ovations from the Israeli parliament during his more than hour-long speech Monday, as he declared the start of a new era in the Middle East and peace for Israel. The hostages were released to the Red Cross in Gaza early Monday, before being taken to be reunited with their families in Israel, more than two years after Hamas launched its deadly assault on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "\"After two harrowing years in darkness and captivity, 20 courageous hostages are returning to the glorious embrace of their families, and it is glorious,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Twenty-eight more precious loved ones are coming home at last to rest in this sacred soil for all of time. And after so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today, the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace, a land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity.\"",
      "He called it \"a brilliant point in time\" and told the Knesset, \"Generations from now, this will be remembered as the moment that everything began to change, and change very much for the better, like the USA right now, it will be the golden age of Israel, and the golden age of the Middle East.\"",
      "Mr. Trump singled out for praise special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was at the forefront of negotiations and critical in reaching a deal all parties could sign. Mr. Trump lauded Witkoff, who was a real estate developer before he joined the Trump administration, for his negotiating skills but said he thinks his likeability is what makes him so successful. The Knesset chamber erupted in applause for Witkoff.",
      "\"Steve started this all by himself,\" Mr. Trump said of the peace deal. \"I call him Henry Kissinger who doesn't leak, okay? Henry was a big leaker. He leaked. Steve doesn't leak. Steve just wants to get the job done, he wants to do what's right.\"",
      "Two Israeli lawmakers who held up signs saying \"Recognize Palestine\" and interrupted Mr. Trump's remarks at the Knesset were ejected from the parliament.",
      "The president also made light of the critics he said had predicted that he'd \"drag\" the U.S. into more wars.",
      "\"But when you settle eight wars in eight months, that means you don't like war,\" he said.",
      "\"Everyone thought I was going to be brutal. In fact, l remember Hillary Clinton during a debate, she said, 'Look at him, look at him, he's going to go to war with everybody.' And actually, she said, 'He's got a personality that's all about war.' No, my personality actually is all about stopping wars, and it seems to work. Seems to work.\"",
      "But on Friday, Clinton, who was secretary of state during the Obama administration and lost the 2016 presidential election to Mr. Trump and has long had an acrimonious relationship with him, had words of praise for Mr. Trump and the Israel-Hamas deal he brokered. In an interview with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, Clinton called it \"a significant step\" and added, \"I really commend President Trump and his administration\" and Arab leaders in the region for committing to the 20-point peace plan.",
      "In one of the more awkward moments of the president's lengthy remarks, he called for Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, apparently in reference to corruption charges Netanyahu has been fighting for years.",
      "\"I have an idea. Mr President, why don't you give him a pardon? Give him a pardon,\" Mr. Trump said, turning to Herzog.",
      "\"By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know! But I happen to like this gentleman right\u00a0 over here, and it just seems to make so much sense.\"",
      "The president also told Netanyahu the timing of the agreement to end the war is \"brilliant,\" and he suggested continuing the war could have been politically perilous for the prime minister. Netanyahu's offensive in Gaza was condemned by a number of countries over severe restrictions on the distribution of food to Palestinians and the killing of civilians. He has also been harshly criticized by his own people and was booed in Hostage Square Saturday night when Witkoff mentioned his name.",
      "\"The world wanted peace and Israel wanted peace, everybody did,\" Mr. Trump said. \"What a victory it's been. If you'd kept going on for three, four years fighting, fighting, fighting, it was getting bad, it was getting heated. The timing of this is brilliant and I said, 'Bibi you're going to be remembered for this for far more than if you kept this going, going, going, kill, kill, kill.' It would not be the same. And I just want to congratulate you for having the courage \u2014 that's it.\"",
      "He urged Israelis to focus now on peace and reconstruction: \"We've won, and now let's rebuild our lives and make it stronger and bigger and better than ever before.\"",
      "The president met with some of the Israeli hostages' families at the Knesset before delivering his remarks, according to the Hostage and Missing Families Forum. Afterward, the president traveled to Egypt for a peace signing ceremony."

    "published": "Mon, 13 Oct 2025 09:03:23 -0400",
    "summary": "Democratic leaders in Congress have pushed for serious negotiations with Republican leaders and the White House to end the stalemate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance on Sunday accused Democrats of \"hostage-taking\" with their posture in the government shutdown, as Democratic leaders in Congress have pushed for serious negotiations with Republican leaders and the White House to end the stalemate.",
      "\"We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute,\" Vance said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Twelve days into the government shutdown, Democrats and Republicans continued to trade blame over the impasse, without a clear resolution in sight. As Senate Republican leadership has held repeat votes on a House-passed measure to fund the government, looking to peel off support from across the aisle, Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for their support to reopen the government. And as Democrats call for negotiations in the funding fight, Republican leaders say there's nothing to negotiate.",
      "When asked Sunday about Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's insistence that the stalemate would only be solved by negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House, Vance said \"this isn't a deal-making, this isn't a negotiation, this is hostage-taking.\"",
      "\"If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans,\" Vance said. \"But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, 'unless you the President of the United States give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government.'\"",
      "Vance added, \"we'll negotiate over health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up people's government.\"",
      "On the question of the health insurance tax credits, Vance said \"we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry, so we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House,\" Vance said. \"But if the far-left Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage-taking. And we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Meanwhile on Friday, the White House announced that layoffs previewed earlier in the shutdown had begun, and the administration said in a court filing that seven agencies began issuing reduction-in-force notices to more than 4,000 workers.",
      "Vance said the government is focused on \"ensuring essential services remain open\" when asked how the administration is deciding who gets laid off. And he urged that \"this is not a situation that we're excited about,\" saying \"we want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer and the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.\"",
      "Pressed about the layoffs, some of which were rescinded, Vance said \"the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos.\"",
      "\"We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas,\" Vance said. \"That chaos is because Schumer and the far-left Democrats shut down the government.\"",
      "On whether the layoffs can hold up to legal scrutiny after two unions sued to block the mass layoffs during the shutdown, Vance said, \"we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do.\"",
      "\"All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff, we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government,\" Vance said. \"If they just join with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all these conversations will no longer be necessary.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday and said Vance is \"just not living in reality.\"",
      "\"There's no negotiations happening right now, because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations,\" Murphy said, arguing they are doing so \"because they are desperate to raise premiums on people in this country by 75% in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy.\"",
      "Murphy said \"this is an emergency.\"",
      "\"We have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country,\" Murphy said. \"Those are urgent matters.\""

      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "\"After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,\" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it did not pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",
      "The Defense Department published contingency guidance on Friday, outlining its priority missions and stating that unused funds passed in the reconciliation bill over the summer could be considered to support them. The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted."

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",

      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The U.S. government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after President Trump and congressional Republicans at odds with Democrats over the path forward were unable to\u00a0avert a lapse in federal funding.",
      "Mr. Trump had said Sunday that a shutdown was likely, rejecting Democrats' push for Congress to permanently extend enhanced tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year. The president met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries at the White House on Monday, but the meeting ended without a breakthrough.",
      "The president canceled an earlier meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders set for last week, calling their demands \"unserious and ridiculous,\" and House Republicans left Washington, D.C., earlier this month after approving a stopgap measure that kept the government funded until Nov. 21. But the proposal failed to garner the necessary support in the Senate. A Democrat-backed counter-plan to extend funding through Oct. 31, which included other party priorities, also failed in the upper chamber.",
      "In an effort to ramp up the pressure on Democrats to go along with Republicans' funding measure, the White House budget office sent a memo to federal agencies last week telling them to consider reduction-in-force plans for mass layoffs of certain federal workers during a shutdown.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Before 1980, agencies largely continued operating during a lapse in funding with the assumption that Congress would act quickly. But in 1980 and 1981, then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti authored a series of legal opinions that found government agencies didn't have the authority to continue running during a gap in funding.",
      "President Ronald Reagan oversaw eight shutdowns during his time in office, the longest of which lasted three days. There were three funding gaps between 1990 and 1995, then none until 2013.",
      "The threat of a government shutdown has become more frequent over the past decade, as Congress has found itself engaged in funding fights that are ultimately resolved with massive, yearlong spending packages. The most recent lapse in government funding, in late 2018, caused $3 billion in permanent losses, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to feel the impacts of a shutdown if a deal isn't reached this time around.",

      "What happened:\u00a0On Nov. 20, 1981, the Senate approved legislation that fell short of spending cuts Reagan had sought. The bill differed from a version passed in the House and funding technically lapsed at midnight, but since Nov. 21 fell on a Saturday, the effects weren't felt immediately. House and Senate negotiators worked over the weekend to reconcile their differences and passed identical bills on Sunday.",
      "On Monday, Reagan vetoed the plan and ordered the government to shut down, placing 250,000 federal employees on furlough. Later in the day, lawmakers passed a stopgap bill to keep the government funded and allow more time for talks on a deal. Workers returned the next day.",

Democrats kept their cuts to foreign aid and defense.",

The rule was repealed in 1987.",
      "In the end, Congress approved nonlethal aid for the Nicaraguan rebels, but Democrats were unsuccessful in their efforts to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine.",

      "House control: Republicans",
      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdowns that occurred during Clinton's presidency centered around his dispute with congressional Republicans of their pledge to balance the budget and repeal the president's 1993 tax increases. The GOP, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich, took control of the House for the first time in 40 years in 1995 in what would be remembered as the \"Republican Revolution.\"",
      "The GOP-led Congress passed a short-term continuing resolution that sought to boost Medicare premiums and required the president to balance the budget within seven years, among other measures. But Clinton vetoed the legislation, which led to a shutdown.",

      "The issue was which agency's budget projections, the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget, the White House should use to show that the budget was balanced within seven years. In the end, Republicans backed down: then-Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole indicated in a floor speech on New Year's Eve that \"we ought to end this. I mean, it's gotten to the point where it's a little ridiculous, as far as this senator is concerned.\"",

The GOP-led House passed two spending bills, one of which would've delayed implementation of Obamacare, which were both rejected by the Democratic-led Senate.",
      "Obama called for a spending bill with no conditions attached, but Republicans ultimately opted to shut down the government over their opposition to the landmark health care law.",
      "House Republicans led by Speaker John Boehner in the end ceded to Democrats and approved a short-term spending bill that didn't include changes to Obamacare.",

      "What happened:\u00a0The shutdown, which officially began on the one-year anniversary of Trump's inauguration, stemmed from a fight over immigration, and specifically Democrats' demands for protections for \"Dreamers,\" undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.",
      "The White House, however, said it would not engage in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which extended legal protections for Dreamers, while the government was shut down.",
      "In the end, Democrats relented after Republicans pledged to work toward a deal addressing DACA, and Trump signed a short-term funding bill that reopened the government.",

      "Senate control: Republicans",

      "What happened:\u00a0Months later, immigration was again at the center of the government funding fight, though this shutdown involved Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to pay for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "As the shutdown stretched to become the longest in history and Democrats took control of the House, the former president ended up signing a bill to reopen agencies for three weeks and did not include money for the border wall. Weeks later, Congress averted another shutdown by passing a measure that included $1.375 billion for the border wall, far less than the $5.7 billion Trump requested."

    "published": "Mon, 13 Oct 2025 08:59:25 -0400",
    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Badr Abdelatty, foreign minister of Egypt, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Foreign Minister of Egypt, Dr. Badr Abdelatty, and he joins us this morning from Cairo. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "EGYPTIAN FOREIGN MINISTER BADR ABDELATTY: Good to be with you, Margaret. Thank you so much for hosting me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So President Trump is headed to Egypt. I know he will be meeting with President al-Sisi tomorrow in Sharm El-Sheik to discuss this agreement about Gaza. But everything seems dependent on this hostage release and the conclusion of phase one, from what you know and hear from Hamas, will those hostages be released in the next 24 hours?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: Well, we are confident that the first phase of the Trump peace plan will be implemented, will be honored by all parts concerns, and we are moving ahead. We are very hopeful that the first phase will be completed, in all honesty from the two parties, and we are in full contact with the Palestinians, with the Hamas, because it's all about, of course, releasing the hostages, and for Israel, releasing some of the Palestinian detainees, returning back some- I mean, the bodies of the those who passed away, but that will take time to collect the remains, of course, and to allow the flow of all humanitarian assistance to Gaza without impediments, In order to deal with current famine and starvation in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the vice president, who you just heard, said that President Trump has convinced a number of countries to provide ground troops to go into Gaza. Will Egypt be sending ground troops into Gaza?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: Well, part of the deal is, of course, the issue of security arrangement, and we are working on different levels. First of all, there are some Palestinians in Gaza. They will be trained and be deployed in Gaza. We are in the process now, as we speak, providing training and coordination with Jordan to train up to 5000 Palestinians to be deployed in Gaza as well. Deployment of international force is on the table. We are supporting this idea, of course, and there are some countries, expressed their readiness to deploy forces to contribute with the forces on the ground. And we have to work now on going to the security council, of course, to endorse the proposal, as well as defining the main mandate of this troops on the ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the leader of Indonesia is already committed to 20,000 troops. Is Egypt going to commit troops? Do you have a number?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: We are, we are going to support and to commit troops within specific parameters. As I mentioned, we must have a mandate by the security council to endorse it, and of course, to you know, specify the mission of the of the troops on the ground, which will be peace keeping, and how to provide training to the Palestinian policeman in order to do the job, to- to have law enforcement on the ground. And, of course, to define the whole mission, and for how long, because it will be a transitional one, in order to help to the Palestinians to assume their four responsibilities, and to tell we have the realization of the Palestinian state on the ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are committing there to a Palestinian state. The President of the United States has given a more vague language, and when I pressed the Secretary of State on this point just last weekend, he said, This is far off in the future. How long do you think it's going to take before Palestinians are ruling Gaza and that we will see a state?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: Well, what's very urgent now is, of course, ending this war on the innocent civilians in Gaza, provide as much as food and medicine to the people there. And then we have to move forward with regard to the early recovery and reconstructions of Gaza. And of course, talking about issues related to the governance and the security arrangement in Gaza. And of course, from our point of view, the end game, the final, comprehensive solution will be the realization of the Palestinian state. Because without that, we are confident through we have to draw lessons from the past, that without solving the Palestinian cause, which is the core of the conflict in the region, without respecting the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians to have their own statehood, you know, there is no peace and stability in the region. And the Trump peace plan, it refers to the statehood. And of course, 144 countries voted in favor of the two-state solution in New York recently. So this is a game on town.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, again, that's going to seemingly take a lot of time. I want to go back to the question of security, because it is essential for rebuilding, and share with you some of what the United Nations estimates here. The UN says 92% of housing units in Gaza are destroyed or damaged. Almost 92% of schools will require full reconstruction or rehab. 77% of the total road network has been damaged. 86% of total cropland is destroyed. How much is this going to cost, and where is this money coming from?",
      "BADR ABDELATTY: Well, first of all, we have full confidence on the leadership of President Trump and his vision for peace. He's the only person who is capable to end the war and to open a new chapter in the Middle East, a chapter of hope, of prosperity and peace for all peoples, including, of course, the Israeli people, the Palestinians, and all peoples in our region. So we are very appreciative, we are commanding his leadership, and we are in full support of his vision and his leadership. This is one. Number two, we are working very hard now with regard to convening an international conference in cooperation between Egypt and the United States, as well as with a lot of partners, including Germany, European Union, France, Italy, Spain, Qatar, Gulf Cooperation Council, Japan, everybody is standing ready to participate in this conference for The reconstruction and redevelopment of Gaza, it will be a merge between the Arab and Islamic plan for the reconstruction and the Trump peace plan. So I met today with the Deputy Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations, Tom Fletcher, and we are working very hard now for having a final assessment report. On the--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we'll look for that number to be released in the future, Mr. Foreign Minister, I have to leave it there for now. Good luck with the conference. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "President Trump prepares to head to Israel, as the deadline to release the remaining 48 hostages nears. Meanwhile, some federal employees will miss paychecks. Others face pink slips, as the government shutdown drags on. We will talk to Vice President J.D. Vance.",
      "Hopeful Gazans have begun the trek back to their homes, as the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas continues to hold. But the rebuilding and recovery ahead is daunting and still very much unsettled. President Trump will join special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in the region as peace talks continue.",
      "Democrats Chris Murphy and Jim Himes will be here, in addition to the vice president. And we will hear from a key player in the region on the next part of the peace process.",
      "With the shutdown now in its 12th day, more federal facilities are facing closure, paychecks are on the verge of being missed, and the Trump administration has begun sending reduction in force notices to some federal employees.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): Well, these are largely people that the Democrats want. Many of them will be fired.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "We begin today with Vice President J.D. Vance, who joins us from Cincinnati this morning.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Vice President.",
      "J.D. VANCE (Vice President of the United States): Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are getting very close to that 72-hour deadline for the hostage release. I think the world is holding its breath here. Is the administration seeing signs that Hamas and Israel are complying with everything they need to and that this will go ahead?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Yes, Margaret, so knock on wood, but we feel very confident the hostages will be released, and that the president is actually traveling to the Middle East likely this evening in order to meet them and greet them in person.",
      "It's a big day for their families, but I think, more importantly, it's a big day for the entire world. Now, the president of the United States said to his entire diplomatic team, especially Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to go and get a deal done, to stop the war in Gaza, to begin to rebuild Gaza so the population could live there in peace and prosperity, to actually eliminate the threat of terrorism to our friends in Israel \u2013 which is very, very important, and also to bring the hostages home alive.",
      "It was a very tall task. He pursued a very nontraditional diplomacy with people who were not 40-year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it. And, of course, the president was criticized for it. The diplomatic team was criticized for it.",
      "But I think that, because he chose a different pathway, he didn't just do what everybody else in the past had done, we are now on the cusp of a sustainable peace in the Middle East. It's a great moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are some very ambitious plans in phase two in particular of this deal.",
      "Let me ask you about some of the details, because the administration has pledged about 200 U.S. troops from Central Command to be part of implementing this deal. They're not going to be in Gaza, but how long will they be involved here?",
      "And, more broadly, is the Trump administration fully committed to keeping the pressure on? Because those things you just mentioned aren't going to happen overnight in terms of dismantling Hamas and building towards a stable Gaza.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: You're exactly right, Margaret.",
      "It is going to take consistent leverage and consistent pressure from the president of the United States on down. I know the president is very committed to doing that.",
      "But you asked about the 200 troops from Central Command. I think you put it accurately. These are not troops who are going to be put in Gaza, but they're troops who are already at Central Command. They've been at that base for many, many years, and they're going to help monitor and mediate this peace. Inevitably, there are going to be conflicts here.",
      "There are going to be things that the people in Gaza disagree with Israel about, that the Israelis disagree with the Gulf Arab states about. We see our role really as mediating some of those disputes and ensuring that the pressure stays on everybody to achieve a durable and lasting peace.",
      "One of the underreported elements of this deal, Margaret, is that the president convinced the entire Muslim world really, both the Gulf Arab states, but as far in Southeast Asia as Indonesia, to really step up and provide ground troops so that Gaza could be secured in safety.",
      "And that actually makes it possible to rebuild. It makes it possible to dismantle those terrorist networks. It makes it possible to ensure that lasting peace that all of us care so much about. So we think that the Arab countries, the Muslim-majority countries, are going to step up in a big way with troops on the ground.",
      "We're going to continue to play our mediation role. And I think that's a very, very good place for all of us to be. It's been successful thus far, and, of course, we're going to work to make it as successful all the way through as we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Big picture, though, when it comes to American security, you said back in July that you'd seen what you called heartbreaking images of little kids who are clearly starving to death in Gaza and that \u2013 quote \u2013 \"Israel's got to do more to let that aid in.\"",
      "Are you concerned that even if, God willing, this war ends, America's security has been endangered by this perception that America has been OK with Israel and in support of it, despite conduct that clearly you and the president didn't agree with?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, look, as the president said, you have to remember, the war started because of a brutal terrorist attack on Israeli soil, and we've been laser-focused on eliminating the terrorist threat to the Israelis, while also ensuring that the innocent people in Gaza get the necessary humanitarian aid.",
      "That's a difficult balance to strike. But I think if you look at the dancing in the street in Gaza, if you look at the way that the Gulf Arab states, really the entire Muslim world, but also you look at how the Israelis responded, they were cheering at the mention of President Trump's name yesterday in a massive rally in Israel, this is one of those peace deals where Muslims and Jews and Christians all seem unified that it's a really good thing for the world.",
      "It's a really good thing for humanity, and it happened because of President Trump's leadership. So I actually think this peace deal will make us safer. I'm sure they're going to be some hard feelings from the last couple of years of war. There always are. But if we can build a sustainable peace, Margaret, I am 100 percent sure Americans will be safer because of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening here at home, or perhaps not happening, when it comes to negotiations to reopen the government.",
      "There were more than 4,000 layoff notices, called RIFs, or reduction in force, announcements, that went out Friday to workers across seven different agencies, including Treasury and Health and Human Services. Take a listen to how the president described this.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): We'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, because that's the way it works. They wanted to do this, so we'll give them a little taste of their own medicine.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you deciding who gets laid off?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, the main thing that we're focused on, Margaret, is ensuring essential services remain open.",
      "And, obviously, in a government shutdown, we have limited funds to work with, because the appropriations that keep the government running have not been made. That's thanks to Chuck Schumer and the Democrats. So we're trying to do everything that we can to ensure that low-income women and children get the food services that they need.",
      "We're trying to make sure that we pay our troops, because that matters for national security. We also want our people to get their paychecks. That's where we've been focused. And, unfortunately, what that does mean Margaret is that some federal bureaucrats are going to have to get laid off. This is not a situation that we're excited about.",
      "We want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer and the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these aren't furloughs. These are notifications of being laid off, of losing their jobs. That's why it's a little different this time.",
      "And specifically when it comes to what's happening within the health sector, CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that's not the case.",
      "But some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, so \u2013 so two \u2013 two responses to that, Margaret.",
      "First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job, and we're trying very hard to figure out how to ensure those people get a paycheck, of course, because we want them to be happy and healthy. We want them to be able to do their jobs well.",
      "But the second point, Margaret, is, the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas. That chaos is because Schumer and the far left Democrats shut down the government.",
      "We have to remember, Margaret, that the vast majority of Republicans and \u2013 and, to their great credit, a number of moderate Democrats have consistently voted to reopen the government. But if Chuck Schumer and the far left Senate Democrats are going to shut down the government, that is going to lead to some chaos.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: So, you ask, how does this mistake happen? It happened because Chuck Schumer shut down the government, and we're trying to make sure that essential services still function in the face of that shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. You heard the president talking about that. That \u2013 that wasn't Chuck Schumer's decision. I understand your broader point on the negotiations, but the layoffs came from the president and the White House.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: But my point is, Margaret, that we have to do layoffs because we have to preserve necessary resources to do the most critical things that the government does.",
      "And, in that phase, you're going to have some chaos. You're going to lay off people, frankly, Margaret, that the White House doesn't want to lay off. We would like to reopen the government and ensure the essential \u2013 essential services stay on.",
      "But, unfortunately, in an environment where we're dealing with limited resources, where the government is shut down, we've got to move some things around. And in that moving things around, there is some chaos, there is some unpredictability, but we're trying to do everything that we can with the \u2013 the hand of cards that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have dealt us.",
      "That's our solemn promise, and that's our duty to the American people, but there's going to be chaos. That's why we want to open the government. That's why we want the Democrats to accept that the government should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you confident that these job cuts are legal, that these reductions in force during a shutdown are going to withstand legal scrutiny, given that some unions are saying this is a violation of the Antideficiency Act?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, we are confident, Margaret.",
      "Of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases, and we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do. I'm sure that some people will sue, and that will get figured out in court. But the reality is, we have to remember, why are we in this situation, Margaret?",
      "All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff, we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: If they just joined with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all of these conversations will no longer be necessary.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed Leader Schumer on this program just last Sunday about this, about reopening the government, he said it's going to take getting everyone in the same room with the president of the United States.",
      "Only the five people, including the president, he said, can solve it. Why doesn't the president insist that lawmakers come back to Washington, sit with him and talk this through?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, as Chuck Schumer said, it's not all lawmakers. It's the Senate leadership that really is driving the shutdown. The House has already passed a bill to reopen the government. It's the Senate and, again, it's a far left sort of contingent of Senate Democrats who are keeping the government shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president says he's a dealmaker. Why doesn't he force a deal here? Why doesn't he tell Republicans, like the speaker, get your lawmakers back here, come into my office, let's hammer this thing out?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Margaret, it's a totally fair question, and the answer is, because this isn't a dealmaking. This isn't a negotiation. This is hostage-taking.",
      "Chuck Schumer has not said to us, this is what we need. He said that, unless you give us what we need, we're going to shut down the government. That is a totally different thing. If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans.",
      "Of course we want to lower insurance premiums. We want to make sure that the skyrocketing health care costs of the Biden administration start to level off and hopefully come down. That's one conversation. But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, unless you, the president of the United States, give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government. I'm going to deny low-income women and children their food benefits. I'm not going to pay the troops.",
      "That is what Chuck Schumer has put us in the situation of doing. We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute. And I think that basic principle \u2013 you saw Barack Obama say this to Ted Cruz and a number of Republicans.",
      "We want to talk about health care policy, but we're not going to shut down the government over this. That's all that Donald Trump is now saying to Chuck Schumer and the far left Democrats. We are not going to negotiate over opening the government. We'll negotiate on health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up the people's government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, just a quick follow there, though. What is your vision for that health care policy? Do you want these tax credits to fade out over time, extend them and then fade them out? Are you open to making them permanent?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE: Well, the tax credits go to some people deservedly. And we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry. So we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them.",
      "We also think that Obamacare gave the health insurance industry a lot of ridiculous regulations that, if we cut out, we could give people access to better health care at a lower cost. That's what we're working on. And, again, I think there's a lot of agreement, actually, Margaret.",
      "That's the crazy thing about this. There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House. But if the far left Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation. That's a hostage-taking, and we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Mr. Vice President, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the foreign minister of Egypt, Dr. Badr Abdelatty. And he joins U.S. this morning from Cairo.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump is headed to Egypt. I know he will be meeting with President El-Sisi tomorrow in Sharm el-Sheikh to discuss this agreement about Gaza.",
      "But everything seems dependent on this hostage release and the conclusion of phase one. From what you know and hear from Hamas, will those hostages be released in the next 24 hours?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Well, we are confident that the first phase of the Trump peace plan will be implemented, will be honored by all parts concerns.",
      "And we are moving ahead. We are very hopeful that the first phase will be completed in all honesty from the two parties. And we are in full contact with the Palestinians, with the Hamas, because it's all about, of course, releasing the hostages and, for Israel, releasing some of the Palestinian detainees, returning back some \u2013 I mean, the bodies of the \u2013 those who passed away.",
      "But that will take time to collect the remains, of course, and to allow the flow of all humanitarian assistance to Gaza without impediments in order to deal with current famine and starvation in Gaza.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the vice president, who you just heard, said that President Trump has convinced a number of countries to provide ground troops to go into Gaza. Will Egypt be sending ground troops into Gaza?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Well, part of the deal is, of course, the issue of security arrangement. And we are working on different levels.",
      "First of all, there are some Palestinians in Gaza. They will be trained and be deployed in Gaza. We are in the process now, as we speak, providing training and coordination with Jordan to train up to 5,000 Palestinians to be deployed in Gaza as well.",
      "Deployment of international force is on the table. We are supporting this idea, of course. And there are some countries expressed their readiness to deploy forces to contribute with the forces on the ground. And we have to work now on going to the Security Council, of course, to endorse the proposal, as well as defining\u2026",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the leader of Indonesia is already committed to 20,000 troops. Is Egypt going to commit troops? Do you have a number?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: We are. We are going to support and to commit troops within specific parameters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: As I mentioned, we must have a mandate by the Security Council to endorse it and, of course, to specify the mission of the troops on the ground, which will be peacekeeping, and how to provide training to the Palestinian policemen in order to do their job, to have law enforcement on the ground, and, of course, to define the whole mission\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: \u2026 and for how long, because it will be a transitional one, in order to help the Palestinians to assume their full responsibilities and to \u2013 until we have the realization of the Palestinian state on the ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are committing there to a Palestinian state. The president of the United States has given a bit more vague language.",
      "And when I pressed the secretary of state on this point just last weekend, he said this is far off in the future. How long do you think it's going to take before Palestinians are ruling Gaza and that we will see a state?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Well, what's very urgent now is, of course, ending this war on the innocent civilians in Gaza, provide as much as \u2013 food and medicine to the people there.",
      "And then we have to move forward with regard to the early recovery and the reconstructions of Gaza, and, of course, talking about issues related to the governance and the security arrangement in Gaza.",
      "And, of course, from our point of view, the endgame, the final comprehensive solution will be the realization of the Palestinian state, because, without that, we are confident through \u2013 we have to draw lessons from the past that, without solving the Palestinian cause, which is the core of the conflict in the region, without respecting the legitimate aspirations\u2026",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it \u2013 again, that's going to seemingly take a lot of time.",
      "I want to go back to the question of security, because it is essential for rebuilding, and share with you some of what the United Nations estimates here. The U.N. says 92 percent of housing units in Gaza are destroyed or damaged. Almost 92 percent of schools will require full reconstruction or rehab; 77 percent of the total road network has been damaged; 86 percent of total cropland is destroyed.",
      "How much is this going to cost, and where is this money coming from?",
      "FOREIGN MINISTER DR. BADR ABDELATTY: Well, first of all, we have full confidence on the leadership of President Trump and his vision for peace.",
      "He's the only person who is capable to end the war and to open a new chapter in the Middle East, a chapter of hope, of prosperity and peace for all peoples, including, of course, the Israeli people, the Palestinians and all peoples in our region. So we are very appreciative, who are commending his leadership, and we are in full support of his vision and his leadership.",

I think that politically the Israel lost their name (ph) in the war because we went maybe too far in Gaza. I think the attack in Doha (ph) was also, you know, one step too much. But, in the end, it brought at least the President Trump to made the right decision to stop the war.",

Forty=eight hostages, living and dead, will be exchanged for 250 Palestinian prisoners serving life sentences and 1,700 detained since October, 2023. The deadline is Monday.

      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, it's really important that we have a ceasefire. It's important that these hostages are coming home. And I congratulate the negotiators on getting this done. There's \u2013 there's no politics about this moment, as you're going to see some very tearful reunions tomorrow, hopefully, as these hostages are released.",
      "But you watch those devastating images of what Gaza looks like today, and it's both heartbreaking and infuriating that this deal has been on the table for over a year, and it's been Benjamin Netanyahu, because of his political considerations, domestically, trying to protect himself, has frustrated the ability to find peace and to get the hostages home far before today.",
      "So, again, this will be a good week. But as you have reported, there are big issues to come. Israel is not fully pulling out of Gaza. There's no clear path forward on what the security and governance force is going to look like inside that country. There's certainly a risk of hostilities begin again if we don't build on this first phase and come to some decisions about what Gaza looks like heading into next year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And President Biden wasn't willing to put this kind of pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu. President Trump has. Your point is, that's got to be sustained pressure to see this all the way through. Am I understanding you?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: I mean, listen, I think the barrier here has been Netanyahu. And Netanyahu is only going to move if he thinks that his relationship with the United States is at risk. And so clearly, the pressure is going to have to continue to be strong and constant.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Now, let me ask you about the other diplomacy that needs to happen just up the street, frankly. You have called on Democrats to stiffen their spines, to stand up to the president of the United States. At what point, though, does this pain become too much in terms of the cost of the shutdown, and when are Democrats going to show some flexibility on this?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, I listened to the vice president, and he's just not living in reality. The fact \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, because there's no negotiations happening right now because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations. They are boycotting negotiations to reopen the government because they are desperate to raise premiums on people on this country by 75 percent in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy. Their only priority is protecting the billionaire class and the corporate class.",
      "The other reason the House of Representatives isn't in town right now trying to reopen the government, because they are about to have enough votes to pass a resolution mandating the release of the Epstein files.",
      "So, J.D. Vance and Donald Trump's number one priority is protecting billionaires, protecting corporations, and raising premiums, raising healthcare costs by 75 percent on American citizens.",
      "So, yes, I think that Democrats should say, if you want our votes for a budget, it can't be a corrupt budget. It can't be a budget that is going to devastate the lives of middle class families in this country in order to protect and reward billionaires. That's a pretty reasonable request.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the premiums that will increase an average of about $1,000, I believe, for those who are using some of these health care programs through the government?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, that's the average. But in Connecticut, some families will see a $25,000 increase in premiums. And again, in order to afford a $270,000 tax cut for the richest families in this country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because also it wasn't dealt with earlier when Democrats were in leadership here.",
      "But you \u2013 but you did hear the vice president say, when it came to healthcare, \"the administration is open to a discussion. We want to lower insurance premiums.\" That was a quote there. Did you hear any chance of an opening?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: I mean, there are no negotiations happening, in large part because the House of Representatives isn't even here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: They've been on an unprecedented five-week recess because they do not want to risk their billionaire tax cut. And they also don't want to talk about the president's lawlessness. I mean, that's the other thing that we have to talk about in this budget. If we're going to fund this administration, we need to fund an administration that is paying attention to a law.",
      "I would be a sucker, Margaret, to vote for a budget that allows the president to then go and spend money only in states that are run by Republicans and spend no money in states that are run by Democrats.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you have been critical in the past of the tactic of choosing to shut down the government. You were in 2018. You were back in 2013, when it was a discussion over healthcare. This is what you said in 2018.",

But we shouldn't be having the discussion amidst a government shutdown and trying to use our nation's security and all of these federal workers and the work that they do as hostages.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Aren't you doing today exactly what you were criticizing then?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: No. That was a fight over sort of the long-term structure of the American healthcare system. This is an emergency. In about a month, premiums are going to go up by people by 75 percent. And we have to make a decision of whether this budget is going to allow for that happen \u2013 to happen or to stop it.",
      "What is happening in Chicago right now is an emergency. What is happening at the FCC as they try to shut down free speech in this country is an emergency. So, we have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are going to \u2013 about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country. Those are urgent matters.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you do not \u2013 you do not trust that if you vote to open the government and then have a separate conversation about healthcare, that there will be any follow-through?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Absolutely not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because that is what the vice president was arguing here, that it's like, Democrats aren't even saying what it is they want to negotiate over.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: No, you \u2013 you cannot trust this administration. And I think it's important to remember that we didn't have a shutdown when Joe Biden was president. And the reason is, because they didn't play the kind of games that Republicans are playing. Joe Biden and Democrats, when we were in charge of the Senate, negotiated with Republicans and avoided shutdowns. This shutdown is happening because Republicans are desperate to protect their billionaire tax cut. And all we are asking \u2013 we're not asking to fix the entire American health care system \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: We're just simply saying, don't make things worse by raising premiums by people, in some cases by $25,000 a year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the minority leader gave an interview to \"Punchbowl\" this week. I mean, there is just also the bare bones politics of this. And in that interview he said, \"Every day this goes on, every day gets better for us.\" The speaker of the House said that was a callous statement.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Well, they're \u2013 they're sort of desperately trying to spin what Democrats are saying.",
      "Listen, our priority is the American people. And, yes, it is true, as every day \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've been critical of Schumer in the past. Back in March, you were saying, we've got to stand up and do something. Is this about the tactic of just saying, hey, we're standing up?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: No. As every day goes on there are more Republicans that are breaking with J.D. Vance and President Trump in saying, yes, we should be willing to sit down and talk about the health care crisis that is about to visit this country. There are more Republicans that are breaking with the president's regime of censorship. So, as every day goes on, there are more Republicans that are willing to stand up and protect the American people, to try to stop the president's destruction of democracy, and hopefully at some point there will be enough Republicans to join us and try to protect people's pocketbooks, which are about to be destroyed \u2013 their economic livelihoods are about to be destroyed by these enormous increase in health care costs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but, in the meantime, there's also the not \u2013 not getting a paycheck problem for some of these (INAUDIBLE).",
      "SENATOR CHRIS MURPHY: Where is the House of Representatives, Margaret? They're on vacation. The only way you can solve a shutdown is to have two parties that are in Washington negotiating. This is pretty simple. Republicans are boycotting negotiations. They're in the witness protection program all over the country, refusing to even show up for work. If they're serious about sitting down to reopen the government, they would be in Washington, rather than spread out all over the country.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT): Yes, not really, right? We've heard now for months that we're two weeks away, I think that's the president's terminology he used several times now over many months from really cracking down on Russia. And, of course, you know, there are bipartisan bills in the Congress right now which would impose very severe sanctions on the Russians that would do a lot to stop the export of their oil, which, of course, is the fuel that drives their war machine, the dollars that drive their war machine. Those have not been moved forward by the White House. So, it's hard to say that President Trump is doing anything other than what he's done forever when he was president, which is trying to sort of have it \u2013 have it both ways.",
      "Now, I will say, and I can't get into particular attacks or particular authorities that the government has, but these attacks on the refineries have had the effect of reducing Russia's ability to produce gasoline and other stuff almost by 20 percent. That really, really hurts the Russians. And I will tell you, again without being specific, that I wish the president would be much more aggressive with respect to turning off those taps and with respect to arming the Ukrainians.",
      "But he hasn't taken any meaningful step back \u2013 steps back from the Biden administration. So, we've at least got that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it's not so much that he's doing more, it's that perhaps he's freeing up more to be done by the Ukrainian military, not putting the same restrictions on them that he had been? Is that fair to say?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: But, you know, his rhetoric has always been skeptical of the Ukrainians, and bizarrely friendly to Vladimir Putin. I'm telling you that his actions to date have been insufficient. By the way, just as Biden's actions were insufficient. But they haven't been consistent with his very skeptical rhetoric. I haven't noticed a dramatic change, pull back, if you will, from the Biden administration with respect to our assistance o the Ukrainians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I ask you because Zelenskyy and Trump spoke twice in the past 48 hours, which is notable.",
      "Venezuela, there are close to \u2013 the numbers we've seen are like 6,000 or so service people in the southern command region of operations. There have been four U.S. strikes on vessels. The U.S. says 21 people killed. You have been asking for legal justification from the administration to explain their actions. And you did it along with the head of Foreign Affairs, Armed Services, Judiciary, and Homeland Security. Can you, in any way, compel more information sharing so the U.S. knows what is being done?",

Totally different thing.",
      "Congress is being told nothing on this. And that's OK, apparently, with the Republican majorities in the House and the Senate. It's not OK with me.",
      "I'm going to leave a little bit of a crack in the door here because, again, the White House has not shared what they believe their legal justification is. They did put out a memo. I will tell you that based on what I know now and the reading of that memo, these are illegal killings. They are illegal killings because the notion that the United States \u2013 and this is what the administration says is their justification, is involved in an armed conflict with any drug dealers, Venezuelan drug dealers, is ludicrous. It wouldn't stand up in a single court of law. It's what \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They say they've designated them as terrorists, therefore they can use those (INAUDIBLE).",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. There's lots of people who have been designated terrorists. That does not automatically give the authority to take lethal action.",
      "So, their legal justifications are laughable. And what \u2013 and again, unless they want to share more than what they've shared with me, these are illegal killings. And what \u2013 what amazes me about that is that the president, of course, thanks to this very compliant Supreme Court, has been given absolute immunity. But what about the secretary of defense? What about the deputy \u2013 what about everybody else in that chain of command, right on down to the guy who's pulling a trigger that results in the deaths of people without clear, legal authority, what about them?",
      "Test me on this. It wouldn't surprise me if in the next couple of years there are presidential pardons offered to that entire chain of command because it is not at all clear \u2013 well, it is getting increasingly clear that these are \u2013 that these are illegal killings.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, I don't know this because they're not telling Congress anything, but the press has all sorts of rumors that the first attack was on a boat that had turned around and was fleeing. Even if this were a legitimate, military action, which it's not because the Congress hasn't approved it, you know, firing on a fleeing enemy would be a violation on our laws of armed conflict. My Republican friends are saying, but these are terrible people doing terrible things. OK, I don't disagree with you on that, but are we now in the business of killing people who are doing bad things without authority?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you \u2013 are you saying that these were not lawful orders?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Again \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That, in fact, the military was carrying \u2013 because what we constantly hear from our military leaders is, do not worry, our United States military is going to be reliant on the Constitution and only carry out lawful orders. Are you saying that these members of the military, who were the trigger pullers, did something else?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I am saying that to all appearances, these are illegal killings. And you can get a thousand different lawyers of both parties on this show to tell you that at best the legal authorities are questionable.",
      "So, I am fascinated by why the chain of command is so confident that the lethal activities they're taking are legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: They don't look that way to me. And this is a big deal, right? I mean, I understand that right now we're in a very polarizing environment, so it's going to be very hard for a Republican colleague of mine to make the statements that I have just made.",
      "But the worm (ph) turns, Margaret. You know, in 1968, we prosecuted \u2013 convicted of murder a lieutenant. Lieutenant Cali (ph), because he and his unit killed probably hundreds of people in Meli (ph), in Vietnam, and there were prosecutions after that. So, I'm a little fascinated about why that chain of command is so comfortable undertaking killings just because the Trump administration says, oh, it's OK. Not an administration that is known for their adherence to the law or to the Constitution.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. Well, that is a huge topic, and I want to continue covering that with you. But I need to ask you as well about the shutdown and the cost in your home state.",
      "We saw from just USAA, which is a lender and a bank to many people who work for the federal government, they said that they've had to provide $150 million in no interest loans to 4,500 people in just over 48 hours. That's a cash crunch for a lot of people.",
      "What's happening in Connecticut?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So, I mean, I'll tell you a Connecticut story. The day after the shutdown went into effect, I went up to see the National Guard at Windsor Locks Airport. We were deploying 500 Connecticut National Guard members to the Middle East. These were 22, 23-year-olds. None of them are wealthy. None of them are going to get paid on October 15th. And I heard the vice president on your show say that this is about the Democrats. The American people understand that the Republicans control the White House, they control the Senate, and they control the House. So, when the vice president of the United States is saying, this is all about Chuck Schumer, who the American people rejected in the last election, I think the American people see through that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the White House seems to be trying to take that issue off the table. The president posted on social media that they're going to repurpose funds somehow to pay the military, at least for this pay cycle. Is that sustainable? Is that legal?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, probably not. Again, we just had a little conversation about the White House's understanding of United States law, which is \u2013 which is \u2013 which is pretty tentative to say the best.",
      "The speaker of the House, because I think to pay the military during a shut down, would require legislation. The speaker of the House has taken that off the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As it has in the past.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So, I mean, is Donald Trump going to say a bunch of stuff? Yes, he's going to say a bunch of stuff. But I don't see anything moving. The House, as Senator Murphy pointed out, the House is, you know, on vacation. So, no, I don't see \u2013 think that that's very likely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the speaker says if the government wasn't shut down, the military would be getting a pay if Democrats voted for the short term funding bill. But no one's working right now, as you just said.",
      "We'll have to continue to track this.",
      "Thank you, Congressman Himes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be lack in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. We begin today with Vice President JD Vance, who joins us from Cincinnati, this morning. Good morning to you, Mr. Vice President.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: Good morning, Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are getting very close to that 72 hour deadline for the hostage release. I think the world is holding its breath here. Is the administration seeing signs that Hamas and Israel are complying with everything they need to and that this will go ahead?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Yes, Margaret, so knock on wood, but we feel very confident the hostages will be released, and that the President is actually traveling to the Middle East, likely this evening, in order to meet them and greet them in person. It's a big day for their families, but I think more importantly, it's a big day for the entire world. The President of the United States said to his entire diplomatic team, especially Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to go and get a deal done, to stop the war in Gaza, to begin to rebuild Gaza so the population could live there in peace and prosperity, to actually eliminate the threat of terrorism to our friends in Israel- which is very, very important, and also to bring the hostages home alive. It was a very tall task. He pursued a very non traditional diplomacy with people who were not 40 year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it. And of course, the President was criticized for it. The diplomatic team was criticized for it. But I think that because he chose a different pathway, he didn't just do what everybody else in the past had done. We are now on the cusp of a sustainable peace in the Middle East. It's a great moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are some very ambitious plans in phase two in particular, of this deal. Let me ask you about some of the details, because the administration has pledged about 200 US troops from Central Command to be part of implementing this deal. They're not going to be in Gaza, but how long will they be involved here? And more broadly, is the Trump administration fully committed to keeping the pressure on? Because those things you just mentioned aren't going to happen overnight in terms of dismantling Hamas and building towards a stable Gaza.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: You're exactly right, Margaret. It is going to take consistent leverage and consistent pressure from the President of the United States on down. I know the President is very committed to doing that, but you asked about the 200 troops from Central Command. I think you put it accurately. These are not troops who are going to be put in Gaza, but they're troops who are already at Central Command. They've been at that base for many, many years, and they're going to help monitor and mediate this peace. Inevitably, there are going to be conflicts here. There are going to be things that the people in Gaza disagree with Israel about, that the Israelis disagree with the Gulf Arab states about, we see our role really as mediating some of those disputes and ensuring that the pressure stays on everybody to achieve a durable and lasting peace. One of the under reported elements of this deal Margaret is that the President convinced the entire Muslim world really both the Gulf Arab states, but as far in Southeast Asia as Indonesia, to really step up and provide ground troops so that Gaza could be secured in safety. And that actually makes it possible to rebuild. It makes it possible to dismantle those terrorist networks. It makes it possible to ensure that lasting peace that all of us care so much about. So we think that the Arab countries, the Muslim-majority countries, are going to step up in a big way with troops on the ground, we're going to continue to play our mediation role. And I think that's a very, very good place for all of us to be. It's been successful thus far, and of course, we're going to work to make it as successful all the way through as we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Big picture, though, when it comes to American security. You said back in July that you'd seen what you called heartbreaking images of little kids who are clearly starving to death in Gaza and that quote, \"Israel's got to do more to let that aid in.\" Are you concerned that even if, God willing, this war ends, America's security has been endangered by this perception that America has been okay with Israel and in support of it, despite conduct that clearly you and the President didn't agree with.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, look, as the President said, you have to remember, the war started because of a brutal terrorist attack on Israeli soil, and we've been laser focused on eliminating the terrorist threat to the Israelis, while also ensuring that the innocent people in Gaza get the necessary humanitarian aid. That's a difficult balance to strike, but I think if you look at the dancing in the street in Gaza, if you look at the way that the Gulf Arab states really the entire Muslim world, but also you look at how the Israelis responded. They were cheering at the mention of President Trump's name yesterday in a massive rally in Israel. This is one of those peace deals where Muslims and Jews and Christians all seem unified that it's a really good thing for the world. It's a really good thing for humanity, and it happened because of President Trump's leadership. So I actually think this peace deal will make us safer. I'm sure they're going to be some hard feelings from the last couple of years of war. There always are. But if we can build a sustainable peace, Margaret, I am 100% sure Americans will be safer because of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening here at home, or perhaps not happening when it comes to negotiations to reopen the government. There were more than 4,000 layoff notices called RIFs, or reduction in force, announcements that went out Friday to workers across seven different agencies, including Treasury and Health and Human Services. Take a listen to how the President described this.",
      "[SOT]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, because that's the way it works. They wanted to do this so we'll get little taste of their own medicine.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you deciding who gets laid off?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the main thing that we're focused on Margaret is ensuring essential services remain open, and obviously, in a government shutdown, we have limited funds to work with, because the appropriations that keep the government running have not been made. That's thanks to Chuck Schumer and the Democrats. So we're trying to do everything that we can to ensure that low income women and children get the food services that they need. We're trying to make sure that we pay our troops because that matters for national security. We also want our people to get their paychecks. That's where we've been focused, and unfortunately, what that does mean Margaret is that some federal bureaucrats are going to have to get laid off. This is not a situation that we're excited about. We want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer, the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these aren't furloughs. These are notifications of being laid off, of losing their jobs, that's why it's a little different this time, and specifically when it comes to what's happening within the health sector. CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that's not the case, but some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, so- so two- two responses to that, Margaret. First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job, and we're trying very hard to figure out how to ensure those people get a paycheck, of course, because we want them to be happy and healthy. We want them to be able to do their jobs well. But the second point, Margaret, is the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas. That chaos is because Schumer and the far left Democrats shut down the government. We have to remember, Margaret, that the vast majority of Republicans and- and to their great credit, a number of moderate Democrats, have consistently voted to reopen the government. But if Chuck Schumer and the far left Senate Democrats are going to shut down the government, that is going to lead to some chaos. So you ask, how does this mistake happen? It happened because Chuck Schumer shut down the government, and we're trying to make sure that essential services still function in the face of that shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. You heard the President talking about that. That- that wasn't Chuck Schumer's decision. I understand your broader point on the negotiations, but the layoffs came from the president and the White House.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: But my point is, Margaret, that we have to do layoffs because we have to preserve necessary resources to do the most critical things that the government does, and in that phase, you're going to have some chaos. You're going to lay off people, frankly, Margaret, that the White House doesn't want to lay off. We would like to reopen the government and ensure the essential- essential services stay on. But unfortunately, in an environment where we're dealing with limited resources, where the government is shut down, we've got to move some things around. And in that moving things around, there is some chaos, there is some unpredictability, but we're trying to do everything that we can with the- the hand of cards that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have dealt us. That's our solemn promise, and that's our duty to the American people, but there's going to be chaos. That's why we want to open the government. That's why we want the Democrats to accept that the government should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you confident that these job cuts are legal, that these reductions in force during a shutdown are going to withstand legal scrutiny, given that some unions are saying this is a violation of the Anti Deficiency Act?",
      "JD VANCE: Well, we are confident. Margaret, of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases, and we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do. I'm sure that some people will sue, and that will get figured out in court. But the reality is, we have to remember, why are we in this situation, Margaret? All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff \u2013 we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation, because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government. If they just joined with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all of these conversations will no longer be necessary.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed leader Schumer on this program just last Sunday about this, about reopening the government, he said it's going to take getting everyone in the same room with the President of the United States. Only the five people, including the President, he said, can solve it. Why doesn't the President insist that lawmakers come back to Washington sit with him and talk this through?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, as Chuck Schumer said, it's not all lawmakers. It's the Senate leadership that really is driving this shutdown. The House has already passed a bill to reopen the government. It's the Senate, and again, it's a far left sort of contingent of Senate Democrats who are keeping the government shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president says he's a deal maker. Why doesn't he force a deal here? Why doesn't he tell Republicans like the speaker, get your lawmakers back here, come into my office, let's hammer this thing out.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Margaret, it's a totally fair question, and the answer is, because this isn't a deal making. This isn't a negotiation. This is hostage taking. Chuck Schumer has not said to us, this is what we need. He said that unless you give us what we need, we're going to shut down the government. That is a totally different thing. If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans. Of course, we want to lower insurance premiums. We want to make sure that the skyrocketing health care costs of the Biden administration start to level off and hopefully come down. That's one conversation. But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, unless you, the President of the United States, give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government. I'm going to deny low income women and children their food benefits. I'm not going to pay the troops. That is what Chuck Schumer has put us in the situation of doing. We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute. And I think that basic principle you saw Barack Obama say this to Ted Cruz and a number of Republicans, we want to talk about health care policy, but we're not going to shut down the government over this. That's all that Donald Trump is now saying to Chuck Schumer and the far left Democrats: we are not going to negotiate over opening the government. We'll negotiate on health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up the people's government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just a quick follow there. Though, what is your vision for that health care policy? Do you want these tax credits to fade out over time, extend them and then fade them out? Are you open to making them permanent?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the tax credits go to some people deservedly. And we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry. So we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them. We also think that Obamacare gave the health insurance industry a lot of ridiculous regulations that if we cut out, we could give people access to better health care at a lower cost. That's what we're working on. And again, I think there's a lot of agreement, actually Margaret, that's the crazy thing about this. There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House. But if the far left Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage taking, and we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0All right, Mr. Vice President, thank you for your time this morning. 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute. Stay with us."

      "President Trump said Friday he will impose an additional 100% tariff on imports from China starting next month, citing new Chinese export controls \u2014 marking a significant escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.",
      "The new 100% tariffs will add on to any existing import taxes on Chinese goods, the president wrote in a Truth Social post. Tariffs on Chinese imports currently stand at 30%. Mr. Trump said the U.S. will also impose export controls on \"any and all critical software\" starting next month.",
      "The tariffs could be imposed on Nov. 1 or sooner, \"depending on any further actions or changes taken by China,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "On Sunday, China signaled that it would not back down in the face of the tariff threat and urged the U.S. to resolve differences through negotiations instead of threats.",
      "\"China's stance is consistent,\" the Commerce Ministry said in a statement posted online Sunday. \"We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one.\"",
      "It was China's first official comment on Mr. Trump's threat to jack up the tax on imports from China by Nov. 1 in response to new Chinese restrictions on the export of rare earths, which are vital to a wide range of consumer and military products.",
      "The president's announcement came hours after he threatened steeper duties on China. He pointed to new Chinese rules that require companies to get special approval to export products containing even trace amounts of rare earths from China, even if they were manufactured outside of the country. China mines and processes most of the world's rare earth metals, which are\u00a0critical minerals used to manufacture products including semiconductors, electric car batteries, jet engines and defense weapons.",
      "\"It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History,\" the president wrote in his Friday message announcing the tariffs, calling China's export controls \"extraordinarily aggressive\" and a \"moral disgrace.\"",
      "Separately on Friday, China\u00a0imposed port fees on U.S.-owned ships that dock in the country, retaliating against what Beijing called a \"discriminatory\" U.S. port fee on Chinese ships.",
      "Major stock indexes fell sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump's initial tariff threat. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average 1.8% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite 3.6%.",
      "The new tariffs and export restrictions could inflame trade talks between China and the Trump administration. Mr. Trump is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping later this month, but the U.S. president said earlier Friday, \"there seems to be no reason\" for the meeting to take place.",
      "China is the United States' third-largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, with the U.S. importing $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods and China buying $143.5 billion in U.S. goods last year, according to federal statistics.",
      "But China and the U.S. have had a rocky relationship on trade in recent months. Over the spring, American tariffs on Chinese goods spiked to 145% and Chinese tariffs on U.S. imports soared to 125%, following a set of tit-for-tat hikes that began with import duties unveiled by the Trump administration. In May, the U.S. and China agreed to slash their tariffs to 30% and 10%, respectively, while the two sides pursued a broader trade deal.",
      "The U.S.-China economic relationship has other complexities, too. The Trump administration needs Beijing's permission to close a deal to transfer ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations away from China-based parent company ByteDance. China has also chafed at some of the administration's restrictions on international students."

      "Hamas accepted a new Gaza ceasefire proposal presented by Egypt and Qatar. One U.S. official said this proposal drew upon principles from earlier negotiations and previous hostage releases.

      "In New York during the United Nations General Assembly, special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and outside Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner brought the 20-point plan to the Qataris, in particular, to Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, with whom they worked to \"wordsmith the document, to tailor it, to tighten it up,\" a senior U.S. official said. Afterward, they brought the document to other Arab leaders to get feedback.",
      "The senior official said negotiators met with Turkey and Egypt, in addition to Qatar. On Tuesday, Sept. 23, during his day at the United Nations General Assembly, President Trump presented the 20-point plan to a roundtable of Arab leaders, which elicited \"a lot of feedback.\"",
      "Wednesday, Sept. 24 through Sunday, Sept. 28: Witkoff, Kushner draft plan that includes Netanyahu apology to Qatar for airstrike in Doha",

      "Monday, Sept. 29: Netanyahu's apology to Qatar",
      "Mr. Trump announced the 20-point proposal during a meeting with Netanyahu at the White House. That day, the president, Netanyahu and the Qatari prime minister spoke on a phone call, and Netanyahu apologized for Israel's strikes on Doha, expressing \"his deep regret that Israel's missile strike against Hamas targets in Qatar unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman,\" according to a White House readout of the call.",
      "The Israeli strike had caused \"a lot of angst within the Arab world\" and there was \"deep mistrust between the parties,\" a senior U.S. official said, adding that Netanyahu's apology to Qatar was well received, \"as something really, really strong and the sort of thing that mature people do.\"",
      "\"That got us some leverage,\" the official added.",
      "Around this time, an official said the U.S. began to detect Hamas \"had had enough.\"",
      "\"Every family in Gaza has been affected by this,\" the official said. \"You read some of the public opinion of polls \u2014 the Gazans do not just blame Israel for this conflict. They, in large part, were blaming Hamas for it. We began to sense that turn in leverage.\"",

      "Sunday, Oct. 5 - Monday, Oct. 6: Meetings in Sharm El Sheikh bring Hamas and Israel to the table",

      "Kushner and Witkoff arrived in Sharm El Sheikh at 6:30 a.m. local time and \"immediately went to work,\" according to one senior U.S. official. They spent \"a lot of time\" going over proposals and issues that had arisen over the previous days, such as the redeployment of the Israel Defense Forces and when the hostage releases would take place.",
      "During these talks, they also separated the peace deal into two phases. Phase one would be a hostage release, including the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.",
      "Then, phase two would begin. This was what one senior U.S. official called an \"almost permanent ceasefire\" that would be in place until other issues were negotiated: the decommissioning of arms, how a technocratic government would enter and run Gaza, how the Israeli army would redeploy and what the gating mechanisms for these steps would be.",
      "Before they left, Mr. Trump relayed multiple messages to Kushner and Witkoff.",
      "\"His message was, 'First, get it done,'\" a U.S. official said. He also reiterated that he stood behind every aspect of his 20-point plan.",
      "\"POTUS wanted people on both sides to understand that he was going to enforce good conduct here, and that was a critical and overarching message that we were there to talk about,\" this official said.",

      "After settling what both sides saw as consequential issues that were discussed by both sides, and clearing up some \"misconceptions and miscommunications,\" Kushner and Witkoff made a call to the president and received some directions from him. Mr. Trump called into the talks at least three times on either Witkoff's or Kushner's iPhone, and spoke on speaker with multiple stakeholders.",
      "One of the key breakthroughs that evening was reaching consensus on the release of the 20 living Israeli hostages and the swap for the Palestinian prisoners.",
      "\"People became more malleable. You could see it as we were trust-building. Food was coming in. We were exchanging ideas,\" one U.S. official said. \"I can't stress enough how important this physical interaction was. We had multiple Arab leaders there who, I think, became very, bought into the fact that we really wanted to see a deal. We were committed to it, and we were going to stand behind it.\"",
      "At this time, Hamas began to realize \"they didn't need the hostages necessarily to enforce a view of theirs, that it was better for them to concede that a release was a positive thing, that better things would happen as a result of that decision on their part,\" a U.S. official said.",
      "\"It was so comprehensive, the engagement, so interactive. We just got ourselves to that place, and then everybody could see the line, and they wanted to cross it. Everybody. It really became a unanimous thing,\" this official added.",
      "5:30 p.m., Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 8 (2:30 a.m., Sharm El Sheikh, Thursday, Oct. 9): Announcing the deal",
      "Witkoff and Kushner felt they had dealt with all the issues and were ready to announce the deal. President Trump announced it in the U.S. on Truth Social.",
      "\"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!\"",
      "Witkoff and Kushner then traveled to Cairo, and met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to tell him he was needed for the implementation phase. After the El-Sisi meeting, Witkoff and Kushner flew to Tel Aviv.",
      "6:30p, Tel Aviv, Thursday, Oct. 9: Witkoff, Kushner met with applause in Cabinet room",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrive in Tel Aviv, though they never made it to their hotel. They immediately went to see President Isaac Herzog, to walk him through the plan, and then met with Netanyahu. They also spoke to the Israeli Cabinet, receiving a warm welcome.",
      "In the Cabinet room, \"everybody started clapping,\" a U.S. official said. \"There were plenty of differences of opinion that we heard there. There were hardliners, there were people who wanted to see the 20 hostages come home above all else, but we talked, and we explored different pathways to get to good compromises.\"",
      "Their reason for going to Israel was to ensure \"implementation occurs.\" Another senior U.S. official acknowledged, \"There's still just a lot of ways that this can go wrong.\"",
      "\"So, we're staying on top of the details to make sure everyone fulfills their obligations and that any misunderstandings are quickly discussed and adjudicated,\" the official said.",
      "A U.S. official suggested Mr. Trump may have succeeded in reaching a deal where other leaders failed because \"he's not trying to be a middle-of-the-roader.\"",
      "\"He's basically stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel 100%,\" the official said. This has meant Israel \"has a lot of trust in him that he's not going to ask them to do anything that would compromise their security. And because they know that if they agree together on what the end state should be, President Trump and his team were able to have much more frank and creative conversations with Israel on how to get there.\""

    "story": [
      "Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca will offer U.S. patients discounted prices for some prescription drugs, President Trump announced Friday, the second major drug company to strike a deal with the Trump administration in recent weeks.",
      "Under the deal, AstraZeneca will offer its drugs to Medicaid patients at \"most-favored-nation\" prices, meaning the U.K.-based drugmaker will charge no more than the lowest rate offered in other high-income countries, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz said in a Friday afternoon Oval Office event. AstraZeneca also promised to offer new prescription drugs at most-favored-nation rates, Oz said.",
      "AstraZeneca will also list \"all primary care medications\" on a government website called TrumpRx, and it will offer discounts for some drugs, including lung disease medication, according to Oz. The company said in a statement that it will offer drugs at up to an 80% discount for \"eligible patients with prescriptions for chronic diseases.\"",
      "TrumpRx \u2014 which is set to launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but will instead direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere, Oz said. AstraZeneca said the website will allow patients to buy drugs directly from the company at a \"reduced cash price.\"",
      "The AstraZeneca announcement came less than two weeks after Pfizer reached a similar deal to offer most-favored-nation rates to Medicaid patients and list drugs on TrumpRx.",
      "Policymakers have struggled with high prescription drug prices for decades. Members of both parties have floated proposals to tie drug prices to the typically much lower rates offered in other countries, but the idea faces legal impediments, and drugmakers have argued that price controls could make it harder for them to invest in research.",
      "Mr. Trump has pressed some of the largest pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily offer drugs to Medicaid patients and new drugs at most-favored-nation rates, floating tighter regulations if companies do not comply. Separately, Mr. Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on pharmaceuticals unless drugmakers are in the process of building U.S.-based plants. AstraZeneca on Friday announced plans to invest in U.S. manufacturing and research facilities.",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work, and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter, some experts caution.",
      "Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, told CBS News in reaction to the Pfizer deal.",
      "It's also unclear how many people would benefit from TrumpRx. For uninsured patients or those with high deductibles, such an option could matter, if their prescriptions are among those listed. But most people obtain their medications through insurance.",
      "\"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump,\" Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, told CBS News following the Pfizer agreement. \"Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\""

    "story": [
      "Of all the communities across America impacted by the government shutdown, the population of endangered black-footed ferrets may be among the smallest and most vulnerable.",
      "This rare species, safeguarded under the protection of the Endangered Species Act, teeters on the brink of extinction, with about 300 existing in the wild.",
      "Now, with biologists from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service furloughed because of the shutdown, a critical release of 400 captive-bred ferrets, designed to strengthen their wild populations, is in jeopardy.",
      "\"It just really makes us all very nervous,\" said Chamois Andersen, a senior leader at Defenders of Wildlife, a key non-profit partner on the federal agency's Black-Footed Ferret Recovery Plan. \"It's not something we can play around with, in terms of the timing and the funding. It's that endangered of a species.\"",
      "The government has been partially shut down for more than a week after a budget standoff in Congress over federal spending limits and extending expiring tax credits for health insurance.",
      "Andersen warns the next two months are critical for successfully introducing the captive ferrets. Fall provides the essential window for new ferrets to hone their hunting skills and begin mating before winter arrives. While many won't survive the cold, those that do will help stabilize the fragile, wild population.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service maintains a captive breeding program facility in Fort Collins, Colorado, where many of the ferrets await release. The facility is currently at full capacity, Andersen said.",
      "While it may be possible to keep the ferrets captive for another year, this uncharted territory risks halting any future breeding efforts until more space becomes available.",
      "\"That's the pipeline of animals going out to the wild,\" Andersen said. \"Anything that goes wrong with our system could be detrimental to the overall survival of the species.\"",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service referred CBS News to the Department of the Interior, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In prairie environments, such as the Badlands National Park in South Dakota, the black-footed ferret plays an indispensable role controlling the population of prairie dogs, which are known as a keystone species, essential to the health of the entire ecosystem. Without ferrets, unchecked prairie dog colonies can throw the entire system out of balance, impacting dozens of other species.",
      "\"I always attribute it to a rug and you have a frayed edge. If you start to pull on that piece of the rug it really unravels fast,\" Andersen said. \"We just hope there can be some resolve to the shutdown and people can return to their jobs and reintroductions can go on as scheduled.\""

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 07:06:00 -0400",
    "summary": "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially, the IUCN said as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
    "story": [
      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\" Jabado wrote by email. \"The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\"",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Sea ice loss",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.",
      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",
      "But in the places where they have recovered, it's \"a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,\" Pilcher said. \"We can. We can make a difference.\"",
      "Extinct species",
      "The latest Red List notes that six species have moved to the extinct category. The IUCN says those species include the Christmas Island shrew and the slender-billed curlew, a migratory shorebird.",
      "Three Australian mammals and a plant native to Hawaii were assessed by the IUCN for the first time and put on the list of extinct species."

    "story": [
      "Tokyo \u2014 An agitated bear roamed the aisles of a grocery store in central Japan, injuring two men and frightening shoppers, officials said Wednesday, while Japanese media said a man was found dead after a separate suspected bear mauling.",
      "More and more wild bears have been spotted in Japan in recent years, even in residential areas, due to factors including a declining human population and climate change.",
      "A man was found dead on a mountain Wednesday in the northern Iwate region after a suspected bear attack, according to public broadcaster NHK, citing police.",
      "Separately, the 4.5-foot adult bear that entered the grocery store Tuesday evening in Numata, Gunma, north of Tokyo, lightly injured a man in his 70s and another in his 60s, regional police and fire officials said.",
      "The store is close to mountainous areas, but has never had bears come near before, Hiroshi Horikawa, a management planning official at the grocery store chain, told AFP.",
      "\"It entered from the main entrance and stayed inside for roughly four minutes,\" he said. \"It almost climbed onto the fish case and damaged glass. In the fruits section, it knocked over a pile of avocados and stamped on them.\"",
      "The store's manager told local media that around 30 to 40 customers were inside at the time, and that the bear became agitated as it struggled to find the exit.",
      "Also on Tuesday, a farmer in Iwate region was scratched and bitten by a bear, accompanied by a cub, just outside his house.",
      "A Spanish tourist on Sunday was attacked by a bear at a bus stop in scenic Shirakawa-go village in central Japan.",
      "Between April and September, 108 people nationwide suffered injuries caused by bears, including five deaths, according to the environment ministry. There were a record number of human encounters with bears in Japan last year, with 219 attacks including six deaths in the 12 months to April 2024.",
      "The impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources and hibernation cycles has been cited by experts as a key factor, but there are also implications as Japan's aging population shrinks and humans abandon more rural areas.",
      "That depopulation has left bears \"a chance to expand their range,\" biologist Koji Yamazaki, from Tokyo University of Agriculture,\u00a0told CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer in 2023.",
      "Japan is one of the few places in the world where a large mammal species has been reclaiming habitat \u2014 which is good news for the bears, but if, as biologists suspect, the bear population is growing, the country will have to figure out new ways to protect people and vital infrastructure from the animals."

    "summary": "David Pogue looks at our nation's tradition of pioneering inventors, from Thomas Edison's R&amp;D facility in Menlo Park, N.J., to today's entrepreneurs pitching their ideas to \"Shark Tank.\"",
    "story": [
      "If you plot the origins of the greatest inventions in history, you start to notice a pattern: The light bulb, the phonograph, the airplane, air conditioning, the zipper, the microwave, lasers, transistors, the personal computer, the internet, GPS, the smartphone \u2026 No country on Earth has as rich a history of modern invention as this one.",
      "But my question is, why is that? Well, the answer may start with a guy from Ohio: Thomas Edison, who we know as the inventor of the light bulb.",
      "\"Kind of,\" notes Hal Wallace, a curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. \"What we like to say is, Thomas Edison invented a commercially practical light bulb.\"",
      "Wallace says the light bulb was just one component of Edison's achievement: \"He was inventing new dynamoes, cables, switches, sockets, meters. If you're gonna sell electricity, you gotta have a meter. So, it's a systems approach.\"",
      "On New Year's Eve 1879, Edison gave an unforgettable demo in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Wallace said, \"He lit up the grounds, he lit up the laboratory, he lit up an office building with about a hundred of these light bulbs, and invited the press: 'Come out to Menlo Park and see what we've done.' He especially invited his investors!",
      "\"When the lights come on, it's almost a mystical experience, because these are not candles, they're not gas lights, they don't hiss, they don't smoke, they don't create noxious odors. You turn it on, it just sits and it glows.\"",
      "Edison's portfolio also included motion pictures, Portland cement, and even a talking doll, \"which is one of his famous flops,\" said Wallace.",
      "Steven Johnson, who has written 14 books about innovation and also co-founded a new Google AI tool for research called NotebookLM, says there are two archetypes many people use that are almost always wrong: \"They are the kind of lone genius coming up with a brilliant idea, and having that idea in a moment of sudden inspiration,\" he said. \"That is almost never the case.",
      "\"Edison gave a lot of credit to the crew,\" Johnson said. \"He has a famous line where he's like, 'I'm not so much a generator of ideas as I am a sponge.'\"",
      "Edison called Menlo Park \"the invention factory.\" He employed engineers, chemists, glassblowers, and mathematicians. Johnson said, \"He came up with this idea that if you got these interesting people together and put them in the same room together, that you could create a kind of a factory for new ideas. And that's what Menlo Park became.\"",
      "The pioneering spirit",
      "Today, Americans come up with more inventions than ever. Over the years, hundreds of entrepreneurs have appeared on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" where they pitch a panel of potential investors, including real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, Kind Bar founder Daniel Lubetzky, fashion pioneer Daymond John, and venture capitalist Rashaun Williams.",
      "\"They think their idea is always terrific,\" said Corcoran. \"It very often isn't. Anybody could come up with an idea, and everybody has at least a dozen. Really, everybody's got an idea, But building a business? Not many people can do it.\"",
      "She says most people coming into \"Shark Tank\" appreciate that the hard part is still ahead. But Lubetzky responded, \"It's not necessarily bad that entrepreneurs don't know how hard it will be.\"",
      "\"I would've never done what I've done, never,\" said John.",
      "Asked what it is about America that fosters such ingenuity, John replied, \"I think the people that founded the country went against all odds to come here. So, we got the cream of the crop of the world.\"",
      "Lubetzky added, \"You see also the pioneering spirit of all the immigrants and all the people that tried things out, and bring that spirit of risk-taking.\"",
      "\"And they bring that spirit on,\" said John. \"And then you have the top people around the world who left for either famine, atrocities, whatever, they made it over here, and they had a goal to make it over here. So they, first if all, are 1% of where they're from.\"",
      "Williams said, \"I think we have to give this government a lot of credit, too. A lot of the original venture capital funds were funded by government entities.\"",
      "Lubetzky said America's financial ecosystem \"allows ideas to be financed. Venture capital is much, much less developed in most other countries.\"",
      "And, Williams said, \"We also glamorize the successful entrepreneur in this country, just like we glamorize the professional athlete or entertainer. If you start a company and you sell it for $1 billion and you scale it, you're on the cover of every magazine. You're a superstar in this country.\"",
      "And, as for failure, Lubetzky said, \"In most of the world, if you fail, it's a negative mark on your family. And you are, you know -- it's horrible. You're an outcast. In the United States, you shrug it off and you try again.\"",
      "Corcoran said, \"The real question is, what do the successful entrepreneurs have in common? And I say what they have in common is the ability to get back up, take rejection.\"",
      "\"A pretty powerful combination\"",
      "According to Google's Steven Johnson, history is periodically upended by huge, foundational, technological breakthroughs.",
      "\"Edison realized that for the light bulb to work, he had to build an electrical grid,\" he said. \"But it was the grid that really changed everything, because once you had power to your homes, yeah, you could turn on a light, but you could also build a dishwasher, and you could have a television, and you could have a radio.\"",
      "The personal computer launched another huge round of innovation, and then the internet, and now artificial intelligence. All of it \u2026 invented in America.",
      "Johnson said, \"Openness to new ideas, willingness for consumers to experiment, that mix of a capitalist model with venture capital, [plus] government support and academic support, you put all those things together, and it's a pretty powerful combination.\"",

    "story": [
      "The parents of the 29-year-old gunman who opened fire on a Dallas immigration facility in September told police their son was \"completely normal\" before he moved to Washington state and returned home several years ago, believing he had \"radiation sickness\" and was \"allergic to plastic,\" according to newly released records.",
      "Joshua Jahn had begun wearing cotton gloves to avoid contact with plastic and practiced target shooting with a newly purchased rifle in Oklahoma a month before the deadly rooftop attack on a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, according to a report written by a Fairview Police Department officer.",
      "Jahn killed two detainees and wounded another before taking his own life in the Sept. 24 shooting.",
      "The two deceased victims were identified as Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, 37, from El Salvador, and Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, 32, from Mexico. Garcia-Hernandez was shot at least eight times during the attack and later died at Parkland Hospital after being taken off life support, according to the League of United Latin American Citizens.",
      "The wounded victim, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina, was eventually released from the hospital, according to a Department of Homeland Security official.",
      "The records, obtained by The Associated Press through an open records request, reveal no clues about what may have motivated the attack. Federal authorities said previously that Jahn wrote \"ANTI-ICE\" on a bullet and left handwritten notes indicating he wanted to ambush and terrorize ICE agents.",
      "The new records show that on the day of the shooting, Jahn's parents told the FBI he would \"occasionally discuss current events\" with his mother but rarely engaged in conversations. His parents said he was a \"loner\" who was \"obsessed\" with artificial intelligence technology. The parents, Andrew and Sharon Jahn, did not immediately respond Monday to text and phone messages from The AP.",
      "The documents portray Jahn as an unemployed, friendless young man who had withdrawn into playing computer games in his bedroom at his parents' home in a Dallas suburb. Jahn was not diagnosed with or treated for any mental or physical disorders, his parents said.",
      "Neither the police nor FBI immediately responded to a request for comment. The FBI said only that because of the government shutdown, it was focused on national security, violations of federal law and essential public safety functions.",
      "Jahn had been \"completely normal\" until he moved back from Washington state in the past five years, his parents said. He had previously taken classes at a Texas community college on and off for years before driving across the country to answer an online advertisement for a seasonal job harvesting marijuana at a legal cannabis farm in Washington. Jahn appeared directionless and slept in his car for months, the farm's owner, Ryan Sanderson, previously told The AP.",
      "After returning from Washington because he could not retain a job, Jahn's parents told the FBI he believed he was \"allergic to plastic\" and sought to avoid direct skin contact with the material. The county where he worked in Washington state was one of the sites for the secret Manhattan Project to develop atomic bombs. And they said their son became convinced that while in Washington, he had been \"exposed to radiation from a nearby facility and was suffering from radiation sickness.\"",
      "Photographs from the scene of the shooting show a car affixed with a map depicting radioactive fallout in the U.S.",
      "Records suggest his family life was far from harmonious. Jahn's father had put pressure on his older brother to find a job or join the military after high school, and his mother called the police when the brother failed to show up to a meeting with an Army recruiter to sign enlistment papers in 2014, police records show.",
      "Jahn's mother called police on his sister one morning when she slept in rather than go to high school, moving out of the home for weeks as a teenager and once spray painting an expletive on the driveway of the family's home.",
      "But the Jahns financially supported Joshua, their youngest son, as he stayed in his second-floor bedroom and played computer games.",
      "About a month before Jahn attacked the ICE facility, he went with his father to practice shooting at their property in Durant, Oklahoma, where they are building a new home. While Jahn's father owned several guns, he was surprised to see his son pull an \"old rifle\" out of his car. Jahn told his father he had \"recently\" purchased the gun online, police records show.",
      "According to the records, his mother told the FBI she had \"no idea\" her son owned a gun.",
      "The FBI said previously that Jahn legally obtained the bolt-action rifle used in the shooting. But police records don't say whether that was the gun Jahn used while target shooting.",
      "Analysts with the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, which focuses on hate and extremism, working as part of a program organized by the Center for Internet Security, said it found that Jahn played games online under the username \"Frank Hoenniker.\" The username is apparently a misspelled reference to a cold and calculating character in author Kurt Vonnegut's 1963 satirical novel, \"Cat's Cradle,\" about politics, religion and nuclear proliferation.",
      "Steam, a game distribution platform, shows Jahn logged more than 11,000 hours on first-person shooter and survival games."

      "The deadline to file your taxes if you've received an extension is 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 15, in your local time zone, which means taxpayers should submit their electronic filing before that time on Wednesday.",
      "Can you get an extension past Oct. 15?",
      "Generally, no, according to the IRS.",
      "However, the agency this year has given some state residents more time beyond Oct. 15 to file their federal returns due to natural disasters in their regions.",
      "For instance, all residents of both\u00a0Arkansas\u00a0and\u00a0Tennessee\u00a0qualify for an extension because of April storms, flooding and tornadoes. Taxpayers in those states have until Nov. 3 to file their federal returns. Kentucky residents and people living in some West Virginia counties also have until Nov. 3 due to February storms that caused severe damage in those areas.",
      "What are the penalties for missing the filing deadline?",
      "If you miss the Oct. 15 filing date to file your tax return, the IRS will charge 5% of the amount due for each month or part of the month that it is late, up to a maximum of 25%.",
      "But the IRS says\u00a0that it might waive the penalty \"if you have a reasonable explanation for filing late,\" and asks taxpayers to attach an explanation for the late filing with their tax return.",
      "If you file late and are owed a refund, the IRS generally doesn't charge a penalty."

    "summary": "President Trump addressed the Israeli parliament after the hostages were reunited with their families.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump hailed \" the historic dawn of a new Middle East\" in remarks to Israeli lawmakers at the Knesset on Monday, after all living hostages were reunited with their families.",
      "The president received repeated standing ovations from the Israeli parliament during his more than hour-long speech Monday, as he declared the start of a new era in the Middle East and peace for Israel. The hostages were released to the Red Cross in Gaza early Monday, before being taken to be reunited with their families in Israel, more than two years after Hamas launched its deadly assault on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "\"After two harrowing years in darkness and captivity, 20 courageous hostages are returning to the glorious embrace of their families, and it is glorious,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Twenty-eight more precious loved ones are coming home at last to rest in this sacred soil for all of time. And after so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today, the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace, a land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity.\"",
      "He called it \"a brilliant point in time\" and told the Knesset, \"Generations from now, this will be remembered as the moment that everything began to change, and change very much for the better, like the USA right now, it will be the golden age of Israel, and the golden age of the Middle East.\"",
      "Mr. Trump singled out for praise special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who was at the forefront of negotiations and critical in reaching a deal all parties could sign. Mr. Trump lauded Witkoff, who was a real estate developer before he joined the Trump administration, for his negotiating skills but said he thinks his likeability is what makes him so successful. The Knesset chamber erupted in applause for Witkoff.",
      "\"Steve started this all by himself,\" Mr. Trump said of the peace deal. \"I call him Henry Kissinger who doesn't leak, okay? Henry was a big leaker. He leaked. Steve doesn't leak. Steve just wants to get the job done, he wants to do what's right.\"",
      "Two Israeli lawmakers who held up signs saying \"Recognize Palestine\" and interrupted Mr. Trump's remarks at the Knesset were ejected from the parliament.",
      "The president also made light of the critics he said had predicted that he'd \"drag\" the U.S. into more wars.",
      "\"But when you settle eight wars in eight months, that means you don't like war,\" he said.",
      "\"Everyone thought I was going to be brutal. In fact, l remember Hillary Clinton during a debate, she said, 'Look at him, look at him, he's going to go to war with everybody.' And actually, she said, 'He's got a personality that's all about war.' No, my personality actually is all about stopping wars, and it seems to work. Seems to work.\"",
      "But on Friday, Clinton, who was secretary of state during the Obama administration and lost the 2016 presidential election to Mr. Trump and has long had an acrimonious relationship with him, had words of praise for Mr. Trump and the Israel-Hamas deal he brokered. In an interview with CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, Clinton called it \"a significant step\" and added, \"I really commend President Trump and his administration\" and Arab leaders in the region for committing to the 20-point peace plan.",
      "In one of the more awkward moments of the president's lengthy remarks, he called for Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, apparently in reference to corruption charges Netanyahu has been fighting for years.",
      "\"I have an idea. Mr President, why don't you give him a pardon? Give him a pardon,\" Mr. Trump said, turning to Herzog.",
      "\"By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know! But I happen to like this gentleman right\u00a0 over here, and it just seems to make so much sense.\"",
      "The president also told Netanyahu the timing of the agreement to end the war is \"brilliant,\" and he suggested continuing the war could have been politically perilous for the prime minister. Netanyahu's offensive in Gaza was condemned by a number of countries over severe restrictions on the distribution of food to Palestinians and the killing of civilians. He has also been harshly criticized by his own people and was booed in Hostage Square Saturday night when Witkoff mentioned his name.",
      "\"The world wanted peace and Israel wanted peace, everybody did,\" Mr. Trump said. \"What a victory it's been. If you'd kept going on for three, four years fighting, fighting, fighting, it was getting bad, it was getting heated. The timing of this is brilliant and I said, 'Bibi you're going to be remembered for this for far more than if you kept this going, going, going, kill, kill, kill.' It would not be the same. And I just want to congratulate you for having the courage \u2014 that's it.\"",
      "He urged Israelis to focus now on peace and reconstruction: \"We've won, and now let's rebuild our lives and make it stronger and bigger and better than ever before.\"",
      "The president met with some of the Israeli hostages' families at the Knesset before delivering his remarks, according to the Hostage and Missing Families Forum. Afterward, the president traveled to Egypt for a peace signing ceremony."

    "published": "Mon, 13 Oct 2025 11:18:23 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. economy picked up speed in the second half of the year, although job growth and inflation remain a concern, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy could be on the upswing even if tariffs and stubborn inflation continue to weigh on growth, according to a new analysis.",
      "The National Association for Business Economics (NABE) said Monday it expects the nation's gross domestic product \u2014 a measure of the total value of goods and services \u2014 to rise 1.8% in 2025, up from the group's previous estimate in June of 1.3%.",
      "The survey, which was conducted from Sept. 17-25, consulted 40 economists on their forecasts for labor growth, inflation and other key metrics for the remainder of the year and into 2026. NABE also expects the economy to expand at a faster pace in 2026, at 1.7%, higher than its June forecast of 1.4%.",
      "The report is the latest signal that economic growth continues to hold up despite rising inflation and a recent slowdown in the labor market. After\u00a0economic activity shrank in the first three months of 2025, growth has accelerated over the rest of the year, EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco, vice president of NABE, told CBS News. The outlook for business investment in particular has improved, he noted.",
      "The economy could get a further boost this year from the Federal Reserve. NABE expects Fed officials, who trimmed their benchmark rate in September for the first time since 2024, to lower borrowing costs by another quarter of a percentage point by year-end and by a total of three-quarters of percentage point in 2026.",
      "Pain points remain",
      "While the economy has performed better than many experts predicted earlier this year, there are still signs of weakness. Government data indicates that job growth has deteriorated since the first half of the year.",
      "As hiring cools, meanwhile, the percentage of long-term job seekers \u2014 people unemployed for 27 weeks or longer \u2014 has risen to 26% of the total unemployed population, the highest in more than three years, labor data shows.",
      "Layoffs are also climbing. Through September, employers this year have cut nearly 950,000 jobs, the largest number of layoffs since 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Looking ahead, NABE expects the job market to remain fragile. Economists predict average monthly payroll gains of 60,000 for the rest the year, down from the 87,000 the group forecasted in June. From January to August, employers added an average of around 75,000 jobs per month, according to government data.",
      "NABE projects that the nation's unemployment rate,\u00a04.3 % as of August, will rise to 4.5% in 2026.",
      "Another lingering pain point for the economy is inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% annual target. NABE expects inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditure index \u2014 the Fed's preferred measure of inflation \u2014 to rise at an annualized rate of 3% over the rest of 2025.",
      "Nearly all of those surveyed \u2014 95% \u2014 expect U.S. tariffs to drive up consumer prices over the rest of the year, according to NABE, although the group now expects stepped-up duties on imports to have less of an inflationary impact than it previously predicted. As a result, inflation is projected to cool to 2.5% by the end of 2026, according to the panel of economists.",
      "A recession is unlikely, according to NABE. Most of the economists polled by the group put the odds of a slump in the next 12 months at between 20% and less than 40%."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance on Sunday accused Democrats of \"hostage-taking\" with their posture in the government shutdown, as Democratic leaders in Congress have pushed for serious negotiations with Republican leaders and the White House to end the stalemate.",
      "\"We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute,\" Vance said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Twelve days into the government shutdown, Democrats and Republicans continued to trade blame over the impasse, without a clear resolution in sight. As Senate Republican leadership has held repeat votes on a House-passed measure to fund the government, looking to peel off support from across the aisle, Democrats have demanded an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits as a condition for their support to reopen the government. And as Democrats call for negotiations in the funding fight, Republican leaders say there's nothing to negotiate.",
      "When asked Sunday about Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's insistence that the stalemate would only be solved by negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House, Vance said \"this isn't a deal-making, this isn't a negotiation, this is hostage-taking.\"",
      "\"If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans,\" Vance said. \"But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, 'unless you the President of the United States give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government.'\"",
      "Vance added, \"we'll negotiate over health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up people's government.\"",
      "On the question of the health insurance tax credits, Vance said \"we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry, so we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them.\"",
      "\"There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House,\" Vance said. \"But if the far-left Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage-taking. And we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.\"",
      "Meanwhile on Friday, the White House announced that layoffs previewed earlier in the shutdown had begun, and the administration said in a court filing that seven agencies began issuing reduction-in-force notices to more than 4,000 workers.",
      "Vance said the government is focused on \"ensuring essential services remain open\" when asked how the administration is deciding who gets laid off. And he urged that \"this is not a situation that we're excited about,\" saying \"we want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer and the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.\"",
      "Pressed about the layoffs, some of which were rescinded, Vance said \"the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos.\"",
      "\"We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas,\" Vance said. \"That chaos is because Schumer and the far-left Democrats shut down the government.\"",
      "On whether the layoffs can hold up to legal scrutiny after two unions sued to block the mass layoffs during the shutdown, Vance said, \"we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do.\"",
      "\"All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff, we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government,\" Vance said. \"If they just join with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all these conversations will no longer be necessary.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday and said Vance is \"just not living in reality.\"",
      "\"There's no negotiations happening right now, because Republicans are boycotting those negotiations,\" Murphy said, arguing they are doing so \"because they are desperate to raise premiums on people in this country by 75% in order to finance their tax cut for the wealthy.\"",
      "Murphy said \"this is an emergency.\"",
      "\"We have a responsibility in this upcoming budget to prevent disaster for families whose premiums are about to go up, and to address the destruction of our democracy and the rule of law that's happening all over this country,\" Murphy said. \"Those are urgent matters.\""

Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",

      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",

NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

      "The remnants of Typhoon Halong brought hurricane-force winds and catastrophic flooding to coastal communities in western Alaska on Sunday, pushing entire houses off their foundations.",
      "Rescue aircraft were dispatched to the tiny Alaskan villages of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, where there were reports of up to 20 people possibly unaccounted for, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the state Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.",
      "\"We have received reports that people's homes have floated away and that people were potentially in those homes,\" Zidek told The Associated Press.",

      "In Kwigillingok, at least 18 people were rescued, while at least 16 people were rescued in Kipnuk, Alaska State Troopers said Sunday evening local time. Three people were still unaccounted for in Kwigillingok as of 6:50 p.m. local time. Troopers had also received reports of people still unaccounted for in Kipnuk but couldn't confirm the exact number.",

      "According to the nonprofit Coastal Villages Region Fund, nearly 600 people in Kipnuk were taking shelter at a local school while around 300 were sheltering in a school in Kwigillingok.",
      "Roads and boardwalks were inundated and power lines were damaged in Bethel, Napaskiak, Napakiak, and other Yukon-Kuskokwim communities. Crews worked to clear the airport runway in Bethel, which was littered with debris from high winds. The area is among the most isolated in the U.S., and some communities have few roads and residents use boardwalks, boats and snowmobiles to get around, Zidek said.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Oct 2025 19:05:20 -0400",
    "summary": "Crucial for marine life and the global economy, coral reefs are the planet's first major environmental system to cross a climate \"tipping point\" as the world warms.",
    "story": [
      "Coral reefs around the globe have for years suffered publicly in warming oceans, periodically making headlines when iconic underwater landscapes lose their colors and wither during repeated mass bleaching events caused by climate change. Now, reefs are the first environmental system on Earth to pass a climate \"tipping point,\" according to a new report by climate scientists who call the situation an \"unprecedented crisis.\"",
      "Researchers at the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute in England have released their second Global Tipping Points report, which examines some of the fundamental processes that support life on this planet in terms of their proximity to benchmarks that may signal permanent damage.",
      "\"Tipping points represent critical thresholds in Earth's climate system where small changes can lead to significant, often irreversible consequences,\" the authors said in their report. Steve Smith, a research fellow at the Global Systems Institute and one of the report's co-authors, told CBS News that tipping points are \"all about that point at which change becomes self-propelling, kind of a self-accelerating change.\"",
      "The report, published Sunday, comes three years after the institute released its first iteration in 2022 and about a month before the United Nations hosts COP30, an annual climate change conference, in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil, a city in the Amazon rainforest that is itself an example of a major global ecosystem on the brink of a climate emergency. Tim Lenton, the director of the Global Systems Institute and lead author of the report, said in a statement that he hopes his team's findings make it onto the agenda.",
      "\"We are rapidly approaching multiple Earth system tipping points that could transform our world, with devastating consequences for people and nature,\" his statement said. \"This demands immediate, unprecedented action from leaders at COP30 and policymakers worldwide.\"",
      "The 2015 Paris Agreement set upper limits for global warming at 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius \u2014 between 2.7 and 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 above average levels in preindustrial times. But leaders have repeatedly warned in the years since that countries are falling short of the emissions targets necessary to meet those temperature goals, with the U.N. declaring greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere reached all-time highs in 2023. By 2024, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported temperatures had risen to about 1.4 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average.",
      "\"A new reality\"",
      "Higher ocean temperatures have already degraded coral reefs, which are crucial for marine life and provide habitats for roughly one-fourth of all underwater species. The new report points out that reefs also support the livelihoods of about a billion people, so their deterioration is as much an economic threat as an environmental one.",
      "Scientists have determined that the \"tipping point\" for coral reefs begins when global warming reaches about 1.2 degrees Celsius, with somewhere between 70 and 90% of coral dying when that number climbs to 1.5 degrees.",
      "\"We're very confident that, unfortunately, we're in the middle of the coral reef dieback,\" Smith said, which, he explained, essentially means \"the collapse of coral reefs worldwide.\"",
      "Reef death is often catalyzed by bleaching, when heat stress causes coral to purge the colorful algae that sustains it and, in turn, become pale and weak. If the stress persists and bleaching is severe or prolonged, the coral can completely break down.",
      "The International Coral Reef Initiative announced in April that an estimated 84% of the world's coral reefs were under heat stress. As the new report notes, this is \"the most extensive and intense\" mass bleaching event ever recorded.",
      "Small pockets of coral are expected to survive, Smith said, and preserving them while minimizing the progression of warming temperatures should be everyone's top priority.",
      "\"We're in a new reality whereby we can now say that we've passed the first major climate tipping point, which is the coral reefs,\" he said. \"And obviously we'll have to, as we say, try to reduce the damage. The quicker that we can decarbonize and take greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, the better.\"",
      "Ice sheets, ocean currents and the Amazon rainforest",
      "Other environmental systems are on the verge of passing their tipping points, too, according to the report. In addition to coral reefs, it cited the potentially catastrophic effects of a warming world on the Amazon rainforest, ocean currents that influence weather patterns, and glaciers like the Greenland ice sheet, which is currently melting and shedding the equivalent of three Niagara Falls' worth of freshwater into the North Atlantic every hour.",
      "\"It's a race against time, really,\" said Smith. \"We have to transform the whole energetic basis of society within a generation, away from fossil fuels and toward this cleaner, safer future to avoid these further tipping points beyond coral reefs and the devastating consequences that they would bring.\"",
      "The report acknowledged meaningful headway has been made in the shift toward renewable energy, highlighting \"positive tipping points\" that have been crossed as the use of electric vehicles, solar power and wind power becomes more widespread. The rise of solar power, in particular, is one positive transition that Smith singled out as especially \"remarkable\" \u2014 although he emphasized that more still needs to be done, urgently, to bring the Earth back on track.",
      "\"Getting that into the heads of our senior decision-makers is going to be important,\" said Smith, \"because what is traditionally thought of as high impact, low likelihood events, they're actually becoming high impact, high likelihood, if we don't do something now.\""

    "published": "Sun, 12 Oct 2025 10:26:10 -0400",
    "summary": "The former justice who was the deciding vote on some of the Supreme Court's most consequential decisions talks about the Court today, and about his memoir, \"Life, Law & Liberty.\"",
    "story": [
      "Former Justice Anthony Kennedy loves to show guests around his art-filled chambers, but beneath that gentlemanly charm is the steel that once made him a force on the Supreme Court. He showed a visitor a statue of the Pony Express: \"And when Ronald Reagan was Governor, and he saw it and loved it, I said, 'You're not Queen Mary. I don't have to give it to you!'\"",
      "Kennedy, now 89 years old, no longer hears Supreme Court cases. He formally stepped down seven years ago during the first Trump administration. \"I loved sitting on the bench,\" he said.",
      "Asked whether he would want to be there today, he replied, \"The only reason I left \u2013 I love the Court \u2013 but I left for something that I love more, which is my wife, Mary.\"",
      "Kennedy now has time for his wife and family \u2013 and time to look back. In a new memoir, \"Life, Law & Liberty\" (to be published Tuesday by Simon & Schuster), Kennedy details how growing up in the West shaped his remarkable legal career, from private practice and teaching law in Sacramento, to sitting on the highest court in the country.",
      "\"I was born in the West and embraced that Western spirit,\" he writes. \"Sacramento is where my thinking began about equality, liberty and freedom.\"",
      "Asked if he ever imagined himself sitting on the Supreme Court, Kennedy replied, \"No, or on any court in fact. My father was a solo practitioner, and I took over his solo practice. Actually it took over me. And I had no time to see the kids growing up.\"",
      "So when then-Governor Ronald Reagan asked Kennedy if he would be interested in a federal judgeship, he said yes. \"President Ford had asked him who his recommendation would be, and it seemed to me a good way to be able to spend more time with my family,\" he said.",
      "At just 38 years of age, Kennedy became the youngest judge on the 9th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, but soon discovered that sitting on the bench had its own challenges. Just months after Kennedy was sworn in, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme was charged with the attempted assassination of President Gerald Ford. Judge Kennedy presided over her bail hearing. \"Because I was the circuit judge and happened to be in Sacramento that day or that week,\" he said. On the question of whether Fromme should be allowed bail, Kennedy said, \"It took me probably ten seconds to decide no.\"",
      "But just days later, Kennedy says his home in Sacramento was broken into and vandalized. And though he couldn't prove it, he always suspected there was a link.  \"It was terrifying,\" he said. \"Fortunately our U.S. marshals are very good, and nothing happened.\"",
      "More than a decade later, Reagan \u2013 now president \u2013 reached out again, this time with a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court. Reagan's first pick, Robert Bork, had been rejected by the Senate, and his second, Douglas Ginsburg, had dropped out. Kennedy, the third choice, said yes, and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Professor Jamal Greene, who teaches constitutional law at Columbia University, said, \"I think you could make an argument for saying that Justice Kennedy, in his time, was the most influential justice, maybe even in the history of the Court.\"",
      "",
      "Greene got to know Kennedy in 2006 while clerking for another justice on the Court, John Paul Stevens. \"He definitely was a bit of an iconoclast in the sense that he sometimes went with the conservatives, but very often went with the liberal bloc as well,\" Greene said.",
      "And as the \"swing justice\" on the Court, says Greene, Kennedy cast the deciding vote on some of the most consequential political and cultural issues of his era: the 2000 Presidential election, gun ownership, abortion rights, and same-sex marriage.",
      "Greene said, \"One way of measuring that is, the year I was on the Court, there were 25 5-4 decisions, and Justice Kennedy was in the majority in every single one. And there's certainly no one else who came close to that.\"",
      "Kennedy did not take his power lightly. A devout Catholic, he considered resigning from the Court in 1992 while deciding Planned Parenthood v. Casey, but ultimately joined with liberal justices to uphold a woman's right to an abortion.",
      "He said, \"It just seemed to me that this was the woman's right, and that what people of my belief should do is to convince her not to have the abortion, to convince her \u2026 but that she should have the right.\"",
      "Kennedy also wrote the decision in 2015 that recognized same-sex marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges: \"No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family.\"",
      "Kennedy said, \"Someone told me it passed the refrigerator test, [which means] if there's something that's interesting and well-written, you put it on your refrigerator.\"",
      "All of Kennedy's opinions, says Greene, reflect a common theme: \"If you saw a Supreme Court opinion and saw the words 'freedom' and 'liberty' in the first paragraph, you could be pretty sure that Justice Kennedy was the person who had written that,\" he said.",
      "But since Kennedy stepped down, Greene says, his legacy has begun to fade. In 2022, the Supreme Court (including two of his former clerks, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh) reversed Roe v. Wade, ending the federal right to abortion. In his opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that the decision behind Roe v. Wade was \"egregiously wrong,\" and that the opinion Kennedy wrote in Planned Parenthood v. Casey \"perpetuated its errors.\"",
      "To which Kennedy says, \"I stand by what we wrote and what we decided. It's a difficult issue.\"",
      "He also noted it is quite infrequent for the Court to overrule one of its own decisions.",
      "It may not be the last Kennedy opinion that's reversed. A petition has already been filed asking the Court to reconsider the case that legalized same-sex marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges.",
      "Today, Kennedy spends a lot of time with his own \"nine\" \u2013 his grandchildren \u2013 and while he is careful not to criticize the current justices, he admits he worries that some members of the Court may be too public with their differences: \"I'm actually somewhat concerned about the Court,\" he said. \"It's a little bit too personal and confrontational, some of the opinions. I'm hoping that will settle down a little bit.\"",
      "I asked, \"You do write a lot about how important civility is, and ethics. Do you think we've lost sight of that today? Is that another reason why you wrote this book?\"",
      "\"Yes, I'm concerned,\" he replied. \"Democracy presumes an open, rational, thoughtful, decent discussion where you respect the dignity of the person with whom you disagree. And if it doesn't have that, then democracy as we know it is in danger.\"",

    "story": [
      "The next phase of the Gaza peace plan brokered by President Trump moved forward significantly on Monday as Hamas released all of the 20 living Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, and as more aid started to flow into the Palestinian territory after two years of war.",
      "The steps are crucial parts of President Trump's 20-point peace plan, and they came three days after a ceasefire took effect in Gaza and Israeli troops pulled back to a pre-determined line.",
      "World leaders, including Mr. Trump, met in Egypt on Monday for a summit on the future of Gaza and the broader Middle East.",
      "But the situation remains fragile, with major questions over what comes next still to be answered.",
      "Negotiations over next steps",
      "Israel and Hamas have little trust in each other, and it took a number of failed, indirect negotiations in Doha, Qatar's capital, to get to the truce, with Egypt and Qatar acting as meditators.",
      "The initial phases of the agreement called for: the release of the final hostages held by Hamas, living and dead; the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel; a surge of humanitarian aid to Gaza; and a partial pullback by Israeli forces from Gaza's main cities.",
      "Egypt's foreign minister said on Monday that it was crucial that Israel and Hamas fully implement the first phase of the deal so that the parties can start negotiations on the second phase. As of Monday evening, all living hostages were back in Israel, but the remains of many of the slain captives remained in Gaza.",
      "\"We're very committed to [the peace deal],\" Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani told CBS News on Monday. \"The agreement specifically says 72 hours for when IDF redeploys on the new line ... That is past already, and not all hostages have returned yet, so we understand what we're dealing with.\"",
      "Later phases of the plan will have to address thornier issues such as Gaza's postwar governance, Israel's demand that Hamas disarm, which the group has rejected, and Palestinian demands for a state, which the current Israeli government has rejected.",
      "Negotiations over those issues could break down, and Israel has hinted it may resume military operations if its demands are not met.",
      "President Trump's plan to end the war also stipulates that regional and international partners will work to develop the core of a new Palestinian security force.",
      "Reconstruction will be another major challenge. The World Bank, and a postwar plan proposed by Egypt, estimates that at least $53 billion will be needed to rebuild the shattered Palestinian territory. Egypt plans to host a future reconstruction conference.",
      "Will Hamas disarm?",
      "Among the most difficult issues is Israel's insistence that a weakened Hamas completely disarm. Hamas refuses to do that and wants to ensure Israel pulls its troops completely out of Gaza.",
      "So far, the Israeli military has withdrawn from Gaza City, the southern city of Khan Younis and other areas, but it remains in control of about 53% of the enclave, according to Israeli officials. Troops remain in most of the southern city of Rafah, towns of Gaza's far north, and a wide strip along the length of Gaza's border with Israel.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that Israel was \"tightening the noose around Hamas from all sides,\" and vowed that Gaza would be demilitarized after the Israeli government approved the peace plan, which it did hours later.",
      "\"Hamas will disarm and Gaza will be demilitarized. If this can be achieved the easy way, all the better; if not, it will be achieved the hard way,\" Netanyahu said, addressing reporters.",
      "Who will govern Gaza?",
      "Israel and Hamas have not agreed on Gaza's postwar governance.",
      "Under the U.S. plan, an international body is supposed to govern the Palestinian territory, overseeing Palestinian technocrats running day-to-day affairs. Hamas and other factions would not have any role in Gaza's governance.",
      "The plan envisions an eventual role for Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas' Palestinian Authority \u2014 something Netanyahu has long opposed. But it requires the authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, to first undergo a sweeping reform program, and it does not provide any timeline for the process.",
      "Hamas has said Gaza's government should be worked out among Palestinians.",
      "The deal also recognizes an independent Palestinian state as, \"the aspiration of the Palestinian people,\" but it's unclear if or when discussions on statehood could take place, and Israel's Netanyahu has repeatedly said he will not allow the creation of a Palestinian state.",
      "International security force",
      "The plan calls for an Arab-led international security force in Gaza, along with Palestinian police trained by Egypt and Jordan. It says Israeli forces will leave additional areas as those forces deploy.",
      "Under the plan, the force would work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with the newly trained Palestinian police forces.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said the international force needs a U.N. Security Council resolution to endorse its deployment and mandate as a peacekeeping force.",
      "About 200 U.S. troops are now in Israel to monitor the ceasefire and the early stages of the peace plan. They were expected to carry out that work in conjunction with partner nations, nongovernmental organizations and private-sector players."

      "On Monday, Hamas \u2014 which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., Israel and many other nations \u2014 released 20 hostages into the custody of the Red Cross, which then brought them to Israel as part of a new ceasefire deal that many hope will signal an end to two years of war in the devastated Gaza Strip. Under the agreement, all living hostages were to be released, as well as the bodies of the deceased.",

      "The fighting has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the deaths were women and children, and displaced around 90% of the Gaza population of some 2 million. The United Nations and many independent experts consider the ministry's figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties in Gaza.",
      "Prior to Monday's release, there were 48 hostages held in Gaza, including the body of one soldier from a previous war. Israel had determined that at least 25 of the hostages were killed on Oct. 7, 2023, or died while in captivity. Just before the release of the first hostages under the ceasefire, Hamas informed Israel that two additional hostages were no longer alive, Tamir Nimrodi and Bipin Joshi. Israel had previously expressed \"grave concern\" over their status.",

      "The fraternal twins were taken from their homes in kibbutz Kfar Aza, on the border with Gaza, during the Oct. 7 attack. Seventeen others were also abducted from Kfar Aza, but the Berman twins were the only hostages from the kibbutz who remained in captivity. The family had heard from hostages who returned in a previous deal that, as of February, the brothers were alive but being held separately. Liran Berman, their older brother, said it's the longest the two have ever spent apart. In Kfar Aza, the twins lived in apartments across from each other. Gali is more outgoing, while Ziv is more reserved and shy with a sharp sense of humor, their brother said.",
      "Omri Miran, 48",
      "Omri Miran was kidnapped from the Nahal Oz kibbutz. During the attack, terrorists held his family, including his two daughters, ages 2 and 6 months, hostage in the kitchen of a neighbor's house and then broadcast it on Facebook Live. Miran and the father of the other family, Tsachi Idan, were kidnapped. Idan's body was released\u202fduring the last hostage exchange after he was killed in captivity. Lishay Miran Lavi, Miran's wife, said their younger daughter knew \"daddy Omri\" only through photos and videos, and didn't really understand what a father is. Moshe Lavi, Miran's brother who lives in New York City, told CBS News New York that Miran's sister and two young nieces survived the mental and physical torture on Oct, 7, but watched as Miran was taken away to Gaza.",
      "Matan Angrest, 22",
      "Matan Angrest, an Israeli soldier, was taken from his military tank in southern Israel. He is the oldest of four children from Kiryat Bialik, outside of Haifa. His family has been among the most vocal protesters and very critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Last Tuesday, which marked two years since the Oct. 7 attack, his mother, Anat Angrest, addressed her son at a rally. \"I know you're in pain, and I can't hug you. I hear you whisper, 'Come for me, Mom,' and I can't protect you,\" she said.",
      "Eitan Mor, 25",
      "Eitan Mor was working as a security guard at the Nova music festival, where he helped evacuate people injured in the attack. Mor's parents helped found the Tikva Forum, a loosely organized group of hostage families. They advocated for military pressure, not an immediate ceasefire or hostage release deal, as the best chance for bringing the hostages home. That stance has put Mor's father at odds with many of the other families of hostages. The Israeli military released a photo on Monday showing Eitan Mor beaming in an embrace with his parents.",
      "Alon Ohel, 24",
      "Alon Ohel, who also has German and Serbian citizenship, was kidnapped at the Nova music festival from a mobile bomb shelter along with Hersh Goldberg-Polin, an American-Israeli who was killed in captivity in August 2024. A talented pianist, his family has placed pianos across Israel and several sites around the world to raise awareness of his plight. Three other hostages who had been held with Ohel for more than a year were released during the previous ceasefire, including Eli Sharabi, who said Ohel was like his adopted son. Sharabi said they were kept chained for the entire period of their captivity and subsisted on a moldy pita bread per day. Ohel has shrapnel in his eye from the attack on the bomb shelter and his family is worried he may be partially blind. Eli Sharabi, a hostage who was previously freed, told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" last month that he became a father figure to Ohel in their year-plus together, and when Sharabi found out he was going to be freed, Ohel was not on the list. \"You imagine this moment hundreds of times,\" Sharabi said. \"And you believe it's going to be the happiest moment ever. And because of Alon, this moment become very complicated. He had small panic attack. He started to cry and shaking. So, we took water, washed his face, hugging him. It wasn't easy.\"",
      "Guy Gilboa-Dalal, 24",
      "Guy Gilboa-Dalal was among those abducted from the Nova music festival, while his brother, Gal, managed to escape. In the past year, Guy has appeared in two videos released by Hamas. In one video, he appears alongside his childhood friend, Evyatar David, with terrorists filming them in a van begging for their freedom and watching their fellow hostages being released nearby to the Red Cross. \"The hardest thing for me is that I really went there to watch over him, watch over my baby brother, and I returned without him,\" Gal Dalal told CBS News in May.",
      "Elkana Bohbot, 36",
      "Elkana Bohbot was kidnapped from the Nova music festival. In the past year, Hamas has published multiple videos of Bohbot, filmed under duress, including one where he has a fake telephone conversation with his wife, Rivka; their son, Reem; his mother and his brother \u2014 pleading with them to help him get out of Gaza. His son made binoculars in kindergarten which he often used to go out and \"look for his father,\" according to Bohbot's mother, Ruhama.",
      "Rom Braslavski, 21",
      "Rom Braslavski was working as a security guard at the Nova festival. He attempted to help festivalgoers evacuate and was wounded in both hands before being kidnapped, witnesses said. In August, the Islamic Jihad militant group released a video of a skeletal Braslavski sobbing and pleading for his life, adding that injuries to his foot prevent him from standing. Later videos of Braslavski and fellow hostage Evyatar David digging their own graves horrified Israelis, sparking some of the largest attendance in months at weekly protests. His father, Ofir, said Rom is usually a strong, happy-go-lucky kid, and that video is the first time he's seen his son cry.",
      "Nimrod Cohen, 21",
      "Nimrod Cohen was taken from a tank where he was stationed as a soldier in southern Israel. Cohen is obsessed with Rubik's cubes, his family said, and a burned Rubik's cube was found in the tank he was abducted from. This year, his mother, Viki Cohen, illustrated a Passover haggadah, the text laying out the rituals and story recited during the Passover holiday, in honor of hostages, partly because her family stopped celebrating holidays after the attack. \"We don't gather as a family, because it reminds us how much he is missing,\" Cohen said. The only time the extended family would gather is at protests, she said. \"The best thing about my son is that he's my son,\" his father, Yehuda Cohen, told CBS News last week. \"He's a normal boy like every other boy. For me, he's special like his brother, sister. We are a normal family. We are a warm, normal family, and we want to get back to being a warm, normal family.\"",

Sharon's sister Danielle and her 5-year-old daughter, who were visiting, also were kidnapped. All were released in November, except for David Cunio. In July, Sharon shared a photo of the twins marking their fifth birthday, their second without their father, writing on Facebook that the girls have changed so much while he's been in captivity that \"they're not the same little girls he knew.\"",
      "Evyatar David, 24",
      "Evyatar David was taken hostage at the Nova music festival along with his childhood friend, Guy Gilboa-Dalal. In August, Hamas released a video of David, gaunt and pale, who said he was digging his own grave. The condition of the hostages in the videos horrified Israelis and led tens of thousands of protesters to take to the streets and demand a ceasefire deal, in one of the largest turnouts for the weekly hostage protests in months.",
      "Maksym Harkin, 37",
      "Maksym Harkin was abducted from Nova, which was the first festival he had ever attended, according to his family. Harkin was born in Ukraine and moved to Israel with his family, where he lived in the city of Tirat HaCarmel in the north. He has a 3-year-old daughter and was the primary provider for his mother and 11-year-old brother.

      "Eitan Horn, originally from the city of Kfar Saba, was visiting his brother Iair at the Nir Oz kibbutz on Oct. 7. Both were kidnapped. For most of the war, the two were held with three other hostages in a filthy cell underground. In early February, terrorists filmed the emotional interaction between the brothers as they were told that Iair would be released and Eitan would stay in Gaza. Since his release, Iair Horn has campaigned for his brother and the other hostages, flying frequently to the United States and meeting with politicians.",
      "Segev Kalfon, 27",
      "Segev Kalfon was kidnapped from the Nova music festival, where he was last seen attempting to flee terrorists along the highway. Before the attack, he worked at his family's bakery in Dimona, in southern Israel. The middle child of three, Kalfon had recently been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, a condition his family has highlighted in urging his release. Kalfon's family received a sign of life from him after the last ceasefire, when some of the hostages said they were held with him for months. Kalfon's family has focused on religious rituals in their fight for his release, including traveling to the grave of prominent rabbis and dedicating a Torah scroll in his honor.",
      "Bar Kupershtein, 23",
      "Bar Kupershtein was working at the Nova festival as a security guard when he was abducted. Witnesses said Kupershtein stayed at the festival to try to provide first aid to people who had been shot and injured. Kupershtein was the main financial support for his family after his father was severely injured in an accident several years ago, his aunt, Ora Rubinstein, told reporters.

On Oct. 7, Hamas released a video of the pair that has become one of the most well-known videos from that day. It showed Argamani on an all-terrain vehicle crying, \"Don't kill me!\" and reaching out her arms to Or, who is being marched away from her by terrorists. Or worked in tech in Tel Aviv before his abduction.",
      "Matan Zangauker, 25",
      "Matan Zangauker was kidnapped from kibbutz Nir Oz along with his girlfriend, Ilana Gritzewsky. The two met while working on a medical cannabis farm there. Gritzewsky was released after 55 days and has since advocated tirelessly for his release, wearing a hat of Zangauker's she rescued from their burned home. His mother, Einav, has been a constant presence at protests, giving impassioned speeches and even being hoisted in a cage above the crowd to draw attention to the hostages' plight. Zangauker, who said she was previously a Netanyahu supporter, has emerged as one of his harshest critics.",

      "Bipin Joshi, 24",

He came to Israel on a student exchange to work and study agriculture at kibbutz Alumim on the Gaza border. Ten of the 17 Nepali students in the program were killed during the attack. Joshi, who was able to throw a number of live grenades out of the bomb shelter where they were hiding, was injured and kidnapped. Joshi's sister, 17-year-old Pushpa Joshi, regularly travels eight hours one way on buses to Kathmandu from her home in western Nepal to lobby to secure her brother's release.

      "Tamir Nimrodi was taken from Erez, a crossing on the northern border of Gaza that had been the main route for people entering and leaving the territory. He had been serving with the Israeli defense body overseeing humanitarian aid in Gaza. Nimrodi was taken with two other soldiers by terrorists who walked them to the Gaza gate and forced them to cross. Israel confirmed the deaths of the two soldiers who were taken with Nimrodi. There had been no sign of life from Nimrodi in the two years since he was seen in footage walking into Gaza in shorts and a T-shirt without his glasses. Herut Nimrodi, his mother, said she didn't know what was worse: to think he had been killed in captivity, or that he was alive but being held in terrible conditions. \"I'm scared to even imagine,\" she said."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Vice President JD Vance that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Oct. 12, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. We begin today with Vice President JD Vance, who joins us from Cincinnati, this morning. Good morning to you, Mr. Vice President.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE: Good morning, Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We are getting very close to that 72 hour deadline for the hostage release. I think the world is holding its breath here. Is the administration seeing signs that Hamas and Israel are complying with everything they need to and that this will go ahead?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Yes, Margaret, so knock on wood, but we feel very confident the hostages will be released, and that the President is actually traveling to the Middle East, likely this evening, in order to meet them and greet them in person. It's a big day for their families, but I think more importantly, it's a big day for the entire world. The President of the United States said to his entire diplomatic team, especially Marco Rubio, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, to go and get a deal done, to stop the war in Gaza, to begin to rebuild Gaza so the population could live there in peace and prosperity, to actually eliminate the threat of terrorism to our friends in Israel- which is very, very important, and also to bring the hostages home alive. It was a very tall task. He pursued a very non traditional diplomacy with people who were not 40 year diplomats, but people who brought a fresh perspective to it. And of course, the President was criticized for it. The diplomatic team was criticized for it. But I think that because he chose a different pathway, he didn't just do what everybody else in the past had done. We are now on the cusp of a sustainable peace in the Middle East. It's a great moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are some very ambitious plans in phase two in particular, of this deal. Let me ask you about some of the details, because the administration has pledged about 200 US troops from Central Command to be part of implementing this deal. They're not going to be in Gaza, but how long will they be involved here? And more broadly, is the Trump administration fully committed to keeping the pressure on? Because those things you just mentioned aren't going to happen overnight in terms of dismantling Hamas and building towards a stable Gaza.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: You're exactly right, Margaret. It is going to take consistent leverage and consistent pressure from the President of the United States on down. I know the President is very committed to doing that, but you asked about the 200 troops from Central Command. I think you put it accurately. These are not troops who are going to be put in Gaza, but they're troops who are already at Central Command. They've been at that base for many, many years, and they're going to help monitor and mediate this peace. Inevitably, there are going to be conflicts here. There are going to be things that the people in Gaza disagree with Israel about, that the Israelis disagree with the Gulf Arab states about, we see our role really as mediating some of those disputes and ensuring that the pressure stays on everybody to achieve a durable and lasting peace. One of the under reported elements of this deal Margaret is that the President convinced the entire Muslim world really both the Gulf Arab states, but as far in Southeast Asia as Indonesia, to really step up and provide ground troops so that Gaza could be secured in safety. And that actually makes it possible to rebuild. It makes it possible to dismantle those terrorist networks. It makes it possible to ensure that lasting peace that all of us care so much about. So we think that the Arab countries, the Muslim-majority countries, are going to step up in a big way with troops on the ground, we're going to continue to play our mediation role. And I think that's a very, very good place for all of us to be. It's been successful thus far, and of course, we're going to work to make it as successful all the way through as we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Big picture, though, when it comes to American security. You said back in July that you'd seen what you called heartbreaking images of little kids who are clearly starving to death in Gaza and that quote, \"Israel's got to do more to let that aid in.\" Are you concerned that even if, God willing, this war ends, America's security has been endangered by this perception that America has been okay with Israel and in support of it, despite conduct that clearly you and the President didn't agree with.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, look, as the President said, you have to remember, the war started because of a brutal terrorist attack on Israeli soil, and we've been laser focused on eliminating the terrorist threat to the Israelis, while also ensuring that the innocent people in Gaza get the necessary humanitarian aid. That's a difficult balance to strike, but I think if you look at the dancing in the street in Gaza, if you look at the way that the Gulf Arab states really the entire Muslim world, but also you look at how the Israelis responded. They were cheering at the mention of President Trump's name yesterday in a massive rally in Israel. This is one of those peace deals where Muslims and Jews and Christians all seem unified that it's a really good thing for the world. It's a really good thing for humanity, and it happened because of President Trump's leadership. So I actually think this peace deal will make us safer. I'm sure they're going to be some hard feelings from the last couple of years of war. There always are. But if we can build a sustainable peace, Margaret, I am 100% sure Americans will be safer because of it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about what's happening here at home, or perhaps not happening when it comes to negotiations to reopen the government. There were more than 4,000 layoff notices called RIFs, or reduction in force, announcements that went out Friday to workers across seven different agencies, including Treasury and Health and Human Services. Take a listen to how the President described this.",
      "[SOT]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We'll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren't popular with Republicans, frankly, because that's the way it works. They wanted to do this so we'll get little taste of their own medicine.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you deciding who gets laid off?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the main thing that we're focused on Margaret is ensuring essential services remain open, and obviously, in a government shutdown, we have limited funds to work with, because the appropriations that keep the government running have not been made. That's thanks to Chuck Schumer and the Democrats. So we're trying to do everything that we can to ensure that low income women and children get the food services that they need. We're trying to make sure that we pay our troops because that matters for national security. We also want our people to get their paychecks. That's where we've been focused, and unfortunately, what that does mean Margaret is that some federal bureaucrats are going to have to get laid off. This is not a situation that we're excited about. We want the government to reopen, but Chuck Schumer, the Democrats decided to shut down the government, and we have to deal with the consequences in the administration, so that's what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, these aren't furloughs. These are notifications of being laid off, of losing their jobs, that's why it's a little different this time, and specifically when it comes to what's happening within the health sector. CBS did confirm on Saturday that the Trump administration went and rescinded some of the layoffs of hundreds of CDC scientists who were mistakenly laid off on Friday, and then told Saturday that's not the case, but some of them were involved with the federal measles response. Some of them were involved with the response on Ebola. How does a mistake like this happen? Did the White House even talk to the CDC?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, so- so two- two responses to that, Margaret. First of all, I want to assure the American people that the frontline health care workers, the people who monitor measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases, those people are still on the job, and we're trying very hard to figure out how to ensure those people get a paycheck, of course, because we want them to be happy and healthy. We want them to be able to do their jobs well. But the second point, Margaret, is the government shutdown inevitably leads to some chaos. We are figuring out how to take money from some areas and give it to other areas. That chaos is because Schumer and the far left Democrats shut down the government. We have to remember, Margaret, that the vast majority of Republicans and- and to their great credit, a number of moderate Democrats, have consistently voted to reopen the government. But if Chuck Schumer and the far left Senate Democrats are going to shut down the government, that is going to lead to some chaos. So you ask, how does this mistake happen? It happened because Chuck Schumer shut down the government, and we're trying to make sure that essential services still function in the face of that shutdown.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was a White House decision to lay off these individuals. You heard the President talking about that. That- that wasn't Chuck Schumer's decision. I understand your broader point on the negotiations, but the layoffs came from the president and the White House.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: But my point is, Margaret, that we have to do layoffs because we have to preserve necessary resources to do the most critical things that the government does, and in that phase, you're going to have some chaos. You're going to lay off people, frankly, Margaret, that the White House doesn't want to lay off. We would like to reopen the government and ensure the essential- essential services stay on. But unfortunately, in an environment where we're dealing with limited resources, where the government is shut down, we've got to move some things around. And in that moving things around, there is some chaos, there is some unpredictability, but we're trying to do everything that we can with the- the hand of cards that Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have dealt us. That's our solemn promise, and that's our duty to the American people, but there's going to be chaos. That's why we want to open the government. That's why we want the Democrats to accept that the government should be open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are you confident that these job cuts are legal, that these reductions in force during a shutdown are going to withstand legal scrutiny, given that some unions are saying this is a violation of the Anti Deficiency Act?",
      "JD VANCE: Well, we are confident. Margaret, of course, we always follow the law, and we always follow court cases, and we think that we have the authority to do what we need to do. I'm sure that some people will sue, and that will get figured out in court. But the reality is, we have to remember, why are we in this situation, Margaret? All these conversations about whether it's a temporary layoff or a permanent layoff \u2013 we are dealing with a terrible, chaotic situation, because Chuck Schumer and a few far left Democrats decided to shut down the government. If they just joined with the moderate Democrats and the vast majority of Republicans, we can open up the government, and all of these conversations will no longer be necessary.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When I pressed leader Schumer on this program just last Sunday about this, about reopening the government, he said it's going to take getting everyone in the same room with the President of the United States. Only the five people, including the President, he said, can solve it. Why doesn't the President insist that lawmakers come back to Washington sit with him and talk this through?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, as Chuck Schumer said, it's not all lawmakers. It's the Senate leadership that really is driving this shutdown. The House has already passed a bill to reopen the government. It's the Senate, and again, it's a far left sort of contingent of Senate Democrats who are keeping the government shut down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the president says he's a deal maker. Why doesn't he force a deal here? Why doesn't he tell Republicans like the speaker, get your lawmakers back here, come into my office, let's hammer this thing out.",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Margaret, it's a totally fair question, and the answer is, because this isn't a deal making. This isn't a negotiation. This is hostage taking. Chuck Schumer has not said to us, this is what we need. He said that unless you give us what we need, we're going to shut down the government. That is a totally different thing. If Chuck Schumer wants to come into the Oval Office or come to my house, he is welcome to talk about how to fix health care policy for Americans. Of course, we want to lower insurance premiums. We want to make sure that the skyrocketing health care costs of the Biden administration start to level off and hopefully come down. That's one conversation. But you don't come into the Oval Office and say, unless you, the President of the United States, give us everything that I want, I'm going to shut down the government. I'm going to deny low income women and children their food benefits. I'm not going to pay the troops. That is what Chuck Schumer has put us in the situation of doing. We don't negotiate with a person who has taken the entire federal government hostage over a health care policy dispute. And I think that basic principle you saw Barack Obama say this to Ted Cruz and a number of Republicans, we want to talk about health care policy, but we're not going to shut down the government over this. That's all that Donald Trump is now saying to Chuck Schumer and the far left Democrats: we are not going to negotiate over opening the government. We'll negotiate on health care policy, but only once you do your job and open up the people's government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, just a quick follow there. Though, what is your vision for that health care policy? Do you want these tax credits to fade out over time, extend them and then fade them out? Are you open to making them permanent?",
      "VICE PRESIDENT VANCE: Well, the tax credits go to some people deservedly. And we think the tax credits actually go to a lot of waste and fraud within the insurance industry. So we want to make sure that the tax credits go to the people who need them. We also think that Obamacare gave the health insurance industry a lot of ridiculous regulations that if we cut out, we could give people access to better health care at a lower cost. That's what we're working on. And again, I think there's a lot of agreement, actually Margaret, that's the crazy thing about this. There's a lot of willingness to negotiate, a lot of willingness to compromise from both the moderate Democrats and certainly from the White House. But if the far left Democrats led by Chuck Schumer are going to shut down the government and refuse to open up the government unless they get everything they want, that's not a negotiation, that's a hostage taking, and we're not going to reward that kind of behavior from Washington, D.C.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u00a0All right, Mr. Vice President, thank you for your time this morning. 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute. Stay with us."

      "Just before an Israel-Hamas ceasefire went into effect Friday, which is the first step in implementing phase one of President Trump's peace plan to end the war in Gaza, senior U.S. officials shared a timeline of the monthslong effort to put the deal together.",
      "At this point, Israeli troops have withdrawn from parts of Gaza, initiating a 72-hour countdown for Hamas to release all remaining Israeli hostages. In exchange, Israel will release dozens of Palestinian prisoners and allow aid to flow into Gaza. Palestinians who left northern Gaza during fighting there could be seen returning to the war-ravaged area Friday.",
      "The vast majority of Mr. Trump's 20-point plan remains to be implemented, but as the work of fulfilling it begins, here's what senior U.S. officials have told CBS News about key moments in the negotiations.",
      "August 2025: Hamas accepts new ceasefire proposal",
      "Hamas accepted a new Gaza ceasefire proposal presented by Egypt and Qatar. One U.S. official said this proposal drew upon principles from earlier negotiations and previous hostage releases. It also took into consideration elements of what Israel, Hamas and Mr. Trump wanted to be included. It was this proposal that would evolve into the 20-point plan.",
      "Around Monday, Sept. 22 through Wednesday, Sept. 24: Witkoff, Kushner bring 20-point plan to Qataris to \"tighten it up\"",
      "In New York during the United Nations General Assembly, special Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and outside Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner brought the 20-point plan to the Qataris, in particular, to Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, with whom they worked to \"wordsmith the document, to tailor it, to tighten it up,\" a senior U.S. official said. Afterward, they brought the document to other Arab leaders to get feedback.",
      "The senior official said negotiators met with Turkey and Egypt, in addition to Qatar. On Tuesday, Sept. 23, during his day at the United Nations General Assembly, President Trump presented the 20-point plan to a roundtable of Arab leaders, which elicited \"a lot of feedback.\"",
      "Wednesday, Sept. 24 through Sunday, Sept. 28: Witkoff, Kushner draft plan that includes Netanyahu apology to Qatar for airstrike in Doha",
      "Witkoff and Kushner stayed in New York City after the U.N. General Assembly, working through the weekend to put together a plan to present to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office on Monday, Sept. 29.",
      "Their plan included an apology from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Mohammed, the Qatari prime minister, for an Israeli strike that killed Hamas officials in Doha in September. \"It all went well,\" a senior U.S. official said.",
      "Monday, Sept. 29: Netanyahu's apology to Qatar",
      "Mr. Trump announced the 20-point proposal during a meeting with Netanyahu at the White House. That day, the president, Netanyahu and the Qatari prime minister spoke on a phone call, and Netanyahu apologized for Israel's strikes on Doha, expressing \"his deep regret that Israel's missile strike against Hamas targets in Qatar unintentionally killed a Qatari serviceman,\" according to a White House readout of the call.",
      "The Israeli strike had caused \"a lot of angst within the Arab world\" and there was \"deep mistrust between the parties,\" a senior U.S. official said, adding that Netanyahu's apology to Qatar was well received, \"as something really, really strong and the sort of thing that mature people do.\"",
      "\"That got us some leverage,\" the official added.",
      "Around this time, an official said the U.S. began to detect Hamas \"had had enough.\"",
      "\"Every family in Gaza has been affected by this,\" the official said. \"You read some of the public opinion of polls \u2014 the Gazans do not just blame Israel for this conflict. They, in large part, were blaming Hamas for it. We began to sense that turn in leverage.\"",
      "Within days, there would be a meeting in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, with the Turkish and Egyptian intelligence chiefs and the Qatari prime minister.",
      "Friday, Oct. 3: in Miami, Kushner, Witkoff work on hostage releases",
      "In Florida, when Kushner heard Hamas had agreed to start talks on hostage releases, he drove 20 minutes to Witkoff's home in Miami, where they worked and fielded calls about the peace proposal, two administration officials said.",
      "Sunday, Oct. 5 - Monday, Oct. 6: Meetings in Sharm El Sheikh bring Hamas and Israel to the table",
      "Officials from Turkey, Qatar and Egypt sat down with Hamas and Israel at the table in Sharm El Sheikh on Oct. 5. Witkoff and Kushner set off for Sharm El Sheikh once they felt the tactical teams \"had done quite a bit.\"",
      "Wednesday morning, Sharm El Sheikh, Oct. 8: Refining the peace plan",
      "Kushner and Witkoff arrived in Sharm El Sheikh at 6:30 a.m. local time and \"immediately went to work,\" according to one senior U.S. official. They spent \"a lot of time\" going over proposals and issues that had arisen over the previous days, such as the redeployment of the Israel Defense Forces and when the hostage releases would take place.",
      "During these talks, they also separated the peace deal into two phases. Phase one would be a hostage release, including the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israel.",
      "Then, phase two would begin. This was what one senior U.S. official called an \"almost permanent ceasefire\" that would be in place until other issues were negotiated: the decommissioning of arms, how a technocratic government would enter and run Gaza, how the Israeli army would redeploy and what the gating mechanisms for these steps would be.",
      "Before they left, Mr. Trump relayed multiple messages to Kushner and Witkoff.",
      "\"His message was, 'First, get it done,'\" a U.S. official said. He also reiterated that he stood behind every aspect of his 20-point plan.",
      "\"POTUS wanted people on both sides to understand that he was going to enforce good conduct here, and that was a critical and overarching message that we were there to talk about,\" this official said.",
      "\"We were going for, you know, 20 straight hours,\" one official said of the talks in Egypt.",
      "Sharm El Sheikh, Oct. 8, Wednesday evening: \"Serious breakthroughs\"",
      "\"We began to have some very, very serious breakthroughs with regard to all of these issues,\" the U.S. official said, prompting another meeting Wednesday night with Kushner, Witkoff and Middle East officials.",
      "After settling what both sides saw as consequential issues that were discussed by both sides, and clearing up some \"misconceptions and miscommunications,\" Kushner and Witkoff made a call to the president and received some directions from him. Mr. Trump called into the talks at least three times on either Witkoff's or Kushner's iPhone, and spoke on speaker with multiple stakeholders.",
      "One of the key breakthroughs that evening was reaching consensus on the release of the 20 living Israeli hostages and the swap for the Palestinian prisoners.",
      "\"People became more malleable. You could see it as we were trust-building. Food was coming in. We were exchanging ideas,\" one U.S. official said. \"I can't stress enough how important this physical interaction was. We had multiple Arab leaders there who, I think, became very, bought into the fact that we really wanted to see a deal. We were committed to it, and we were going to stand behind it.\"",
      "At this time, Hamas began to realize \"they didn't need the hostages necessarily to enforce a view of theirs, that it was better for them to concede that a release was a positive thing, that better things would happen as a result of that decision on their part,\" a U.S. official said.",
      "\"It was so comprehensive, the engagement, so interactive. We just got ourselves to that place, and then everybody could see the line, and they wanted to cross it. Everybody. It really became a unanimous thing,\" this official added.",
      "5:30 p.m., Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 8 (2:30 a.m., Sharm El Sheikh, Thursday, Oct. 9): Announcing the deal",
      "Witkoff and Kushner felt they had dealt with all the issues and were ready to announce the deal. President Trump announced it in the U.S. on Truth Social.",
      "\"This is a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding Nations, and the United States of America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!\"",
      "Witkoff and Kushner then traveled to Cairo, and met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi to tell him he was needed for the implementation phase. After the El-Sisi meeting, Witkoff and Kushner flew to Tel Aviv.",
      "6:30p, Tel Aviv, Thursday, Oct. 9: Witkoff, Kushner met with applause in Cabinet room",
      "Witkoff and Kushner arrive in Tel Aviv, though they never made it to their hotel. They immediately went to see President Isaac Herzog, to walk him through the plan, and then met with Netanyahu. They also spoke to the Israeli Cabinet, receiving a warm welcome.",
      "In the Cabinet room, \"everybody started clapping,\" a U.S. official said. \"There were plenty of differences of opinion that we heard there. There were hardliners, there were people who wanted to see the 20 hostages come home above all else, but we talked, and we explored different pathways to get to good compromises.\"",
      "Their reason for going to Israel was to ensure \"implementation occurs.\" Another senior U.S. official acknowledged, \"There's still just a lot of ways that this can go wrong.\"",
      "\"So, we're staying on top of the details to make sure everyone fulfills their obligations and that any misunderstandings are quickly discussed and adjudicated,\" the official said.",
      "A U.S. official suggested Mr. Trump may have succeeded in reaching a deal where other leaders failed because \"he's not trying to be a middle-of-the-roader.\"",
      "\"He's basically stood shoulder to shoulder with Israel 100%,\" the official said. This has meant Israel \"has a lot of trust in him that he's not going to ask them to do anything that would compromise their security. And because they know that if they agree together on what the end state should be, President Trump and his team were able to have much more frank and creative conversations with Israel on how to get there.\""

      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.",
      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",
      "But in the places where they have recovered, it's \"a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,\" Pilcher said. \"We can. We can make a difference.\"",
      "Extinct species",
      "The latest Red List notes that six species have moved to the extinct category. The IUCN says those species include the Christmas Island shrew and the slender-billed curlew, a migratory shorebird.",
      "Three Australian mammals and a plant native to Hawaii were assessed by the IUCN for the first time and put on the list of extinct species."

    "summary": "CBS News meets young Palestinians who've lost their parents to Israel's war with Hamas, who say they're scared, and know \"life will never be the same.\"",
    "story": [
      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Indirect peace talks between Israel and Hamas aimed at ending the war in Gaza and freeing the remaining Israeli hostages resumed Wednesday in Egypt. President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were expected to arrive in Egypt on Wednesday to join the conversations, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "The war was sparked by the Hamas-led, Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken as hostages. Israeli officials believe 48 of those people remain captive, though only 20 are believed to still be alive.",
      "Since that day, the Gaza Strip's Hamas-run Ministry of Health says Israel's retaliatory war has killed more than 67,000 Palestinians. Israel disputes that figure but provides no estimate of its own, and the United Nations considers the health ministry's count the most reliable information available, as Israel has barred foreign journalists from operating independently in Gaza.",
      "Ricardo Pires, a spokesman for the United Nations children's charity UNICEF, said this week that what he calls Israel's \"disproportionate response\" in Gaza has killed or maimed at least 61,000 children since the war started.",
      "UNICEF and the global charity Save the Children, which cited data compiled by the Hamas-run Gaza Government Media Office, say that on average, a child dies every hour in Gaza \u2014 or \"a classroom of children\" per day, as UNICEF put it.",
      "Since the war started, Save the Children says at least 20,000 kids have been killed in total \u2013 amounting to nearly a third of all Palestinians believed to have died in the war.",
      "UNICEF spokesman James Elder, told CBS News that when he visited one of Gaza's beleaguered hospitals this week, \"the first thing I saw was four children who had all been shot by quadcopters [military drones], then I went into a hallway and it was wall-to-wall children across all the corridors.\"",
      "\"There was a boy bleeding out on the floor who had apparently been there for five hours, then he was put on a stretcher only for another child to be put in his place,\" Elder told CBS News. \"Then I watched a little girl die. That's half an hour here in Gaza.\"",
      "The staggering death toll does not reflect the thousands more children who have been maimed and injured, or those who have lost one or both parents during the war.",
      "At a makeshift camp for Palestinian orphans in the southern city of Khan Younis, CBS News' team in Gaza saw some of the young faces behind the grim statistics.",
      "\"I wish the war were just a dream I'd wake up from and see my parents next to me,\" said 14-year-old Deena Al-Za'arab, who lost both of her parents.",
      "\"I have to keep it together for the sake of my siblings,\" she added, \"because now I must raise them.\"",
      "Many of the children at the camp now spend their days doing the work of adults.",
      "Arat Awqal, who is just 10, promised her father she'd be a doctor before he died, but she now focuses on taking care of her younger sister.",
      "\"I just want to go back to how it used to be,\" she told CBS News. \"Whenever we heard the sound of missiles my father would hold us, but now he's gone, and we are always scared.\"",
      "UNICEF says one in five children in Gaza is acutely malnourished, and Elder stressed that the trauma being inflicted on the youngest is not just physical.",
      "\"The kids not only lost loved ones \u2014 it's not just about just having your mother killed, it's about watching your mother die, then add that level of trauma to being displaced \u2014 and we talk of displacement, it sounds like a neutral or abstract term. It's not. It's violent. It's repetitious, and it also increases trauma.\"",
      "The U.N. estimates that about 90% of Gaza's population, some 1.9 million people, have been forcibly displaced during the war, many of them multiple times as the focus of Israel's military operations has shifted. Most recently, the Israel Defense Forces ordered everyone to leave Gaza City, the enclave's biggest population center, and to move further south, to areas such as Khan Younis.",
      "It's led to another mass exodus, which aid workers say has increased the suffering in the region and made it harder to help those showing up, often with nothing.",
      "\"There have been several hundred thousands of people who have moved from the north recently, in the last few weeks,\" Olga Cherevko, a spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told CBS News' Haley Ott on Wednesday.",
      "\"The situation was already very crowded,\" she said, speaking on the phone from central Gaza. \"They are now even more so. You can see a lot of people living on the side of the road, pitching tents on the sides of the roads \u2026 There are many people who fled on foot and, of course, were not able to bring anything with them, and this creates extremely difficult conditions in terms of hygiene, sanitation and these kinds of things.\"",
      "At the camp for the orphans \u2014 all of them among the displaced \u2014 12-year-old Gazal Basam told CBS News she felt \"such pain in my heart after losing my dad.\"",
      "\"I want to live like I did before the war,\" she said. \"But I know life will never be the same again.\".",
      "\"I feel such pain in my heart after losing my dad,\" said 12-year-old Gazal Basam at the camp for orphans. \"I want to live like I did before the war, but I know life will never be the same again.\""

      "\"We found that strong social ties can literally slow down the biological aging process,\" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital. \"Strong social ties appear to work in the background over many years, building a more resilient body by reducing the chronic, low-grade inflammation that is a key driver of accelerated aging.\"",
      "Ong further elaborated on the findings in a Cornell Chronicle article. \"This paper builds on a foundational study we published last year showing how cumulative social advantage relates to positive health outcomes,\" he wrote.",

      "The four key areas of connection include \"the warmth and support you received from your parents growing up, how connected you feel to your community and neighborhood, your involvement in religious or faith-based communities, and the ongoing emotional support from friends and family,\" Ong detailed.",
      "\"What's striking is the cumulative effect \u2014 these social resources build on each other over time,\" he went on. \"It's not just about having friends today; it's about how your social connections have grown and deepened throughout your life. That accumulation shapes your health trajectory in measurable ways.\"",

      "\"Think of social connections like a retirement account,\" Ong recommended. \"The earlier you start investing and the more consistently you contribute, the greater your returns.\"",
      "\"Our study shows those returns aren't just emotional \u2014 they're biological. People with richer, more sustained social connections literally age more slowly at the cellular level. Aging well means both staying healthy and staying connected \u2014 they're inseparable.\"",

A fake site once popped up around the Equifax settlement, tricking thousands before it was shut down. The lesson? If the site appears unusual, it doesn't necessarily mean it's fake, but it should prompt you to double-check before entering your details or clicking on any links.",
      "Red flags that expose fake settlement sites",
      "Spotting a scam often comes down to noticing the little details. Watch for these common warning signs before you hand over your information.",
      "If a site asks for your full Social Security number or the names of your children, stop. For example, the official Equifax settlement only requested the last six digits of SSNs.

      "Fraud can be found with red flags like odd URLs, urgent countdowns, or fee requests (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Kurt \u2018CyberGuy\u2019 Knutsson discusses Instagram\u2019s new maps feature and more on \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend.\u2019",
      "Navigation apps have become an essential part of modern life. Whether you are commuting to work, running errands or exploring a new city, relying on accurate directions and real-time traffic updates can make all the difference. Over the past decade, Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps have emerged as the dominant players in this space, each offering a distinct approach to navigation.",
      "While millions of people rely on these apps daily, choosing the right one can depend on a variety of factors, from interface design to privacy policies. In this article, we compare these three apps across usability, accuracy, features and data handling to help you determine which one best fits your needs.",

      "What each app does best",
      "Google Maps is widely regarded as the all-rounder. It combines extensive mapping data with points of interest, public transit information, Street View, Live View AR and detailed business listings. Its versatility makes it a top choice for both daily commuters and travelers.",
      "Google Maps is a great way to explore the world with detailed routes, Street View, and real-time traffic insights. (OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Waze, on the other hand, is designed primarily for drivers. It thrives on community input, offering live updates about traffic jams, road hazards, accidents and even police presence. Since Google owns Waze, many Waze-style real-time alerts have now begun appearing directly inside Google Maps. While Waze still focuses on driving, this integration blurs the lines between the two apps.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0has made major strides in recent years. Once considered the underdog, it's now a solid choice for iOS users. Its clean interface, privacy-focused design and seamless integration with Siri, CarPlay and Apple Watch make it a convenient pick for those fully in the Apple ecosystem.",
      "INSTAGRAM FRIEND MAP FEATURE SPARKS PRIVACY QUESTIONS",
      "Usability and interface",
      "When it comes to interface, each app approaches design differently.",
      "Google Maps provides a dense but intuitive layout, giving users access to multiple layers of information, including traffic, satellite imagery and public transit routes. Switching between driving, walking, biking and transit is straightforward, and the search functionality is robust, often displaying detailed business profiles, ratings, and hours of operation.",
      "Waze prioritizes active driving support. Its interface is visually bold, with clear alerts for traffic jams, accidents and road hazards submitted by other users. While some may find the screen slightly cluttered, the focus is entirely on driving efficiency, which makes sense given its target audience.",
      "Waze helps to put you on a faster route with live, community-driven alerts that help you dodge traffic jams and road hazards.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Apple Maps offers a minimalist, streamlined interface that emphasizes simplicity. Searching for locations, initiating navigation, and following turn-by-turn instructions is straightforward. The app works seamlessly with iOS features like Siri and CarPlay, providing a smooth and cohesive experience for Apple users.",
      "Navigation accuracy and performance",
      "Accurate routing and timely traffic updates are critical.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0remains the most reliable for precise routing and travel time estimates. It combines AI-enhanced predictive routing with historical and live traffic data to suggest the best route. Its consistency holds strong across urban and rural areas alike.",
      "Waze\u00a0is unmatched for real-time rerouting. Relying heavily on crowd-sourced reports, it often detects slowdowns or hazards before Google Maps does. However, it still struggles when offline or in areas with poor data coverage.",
      "Apple Maps has significantly improved its routing accuracy, especially in cities. Its traffic data is now crowd-sourced from millions of iPhones, processed on-device to protect privacy. In some rural or international regions, though, it can still lag behind Google Maps and Waze.",
      "Apple Maps offers seamless use with your iPhone and CarPlay for smooth and privacy-focused navigation.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Features and ecosystem integration",
      "Beyond basic navigation, each app offers additional tools and integrations.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0offers offline maps, Live View AR navigation, multi-stop routing, EV charger locations and indoor maps for airports and malls. Integration with Gmail, Calendar and Google Assistant creates a seamless travel experience.",
      "Waze\u00a0remains focused on social and driving-specific features. You can report hazards or police sightings and even control Spotify, Audible or podcasts directly from the app without switching screens.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0leans into privacy and ecosystem benefits. Its \"Look Around\" feature rivals Street View, while EV routing, cycling paths and Siri integration make it ideal for Apple fans. Apple also uses anonymized \"Look Around\" imagery to train its AI models, but with strict privacy safeguards like blurring faces and plates.",
      "YOUR PHONE IS TRACKING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT\u2019S NOT",
      "Privacy and data handling",
      "How these apps handle your personal data matters more than ever.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0collects detailed location and usage data to power personalization and advertising. That means better recommendations, but less privacy for users who prefer anonymity.",
      "Waze, also owned by Google, gathers anonymized driving data to enhance community reporting. Its functionality depends on sharing your location in real time, which is necessary for crowd-sourced accuracy.",
      "Apple Maps takes a different approach. It processes most data on-device, uses random identifiers instead of personal accounts and does not associate searches with your Apple ID. That makes it the most privacy-conscious option, though even Apple collects anonymized data for traffic and route improvements.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here:\u00a0CyberGuy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There is no single \"best\" navigation app, and the right choice depends on your priorities. Google Maps is ideal if you want a feature-packed, versatile app that works well for a variety of transportation modes and travel scenarios. Its global coverage and rich data make it reliable for everyday use and exploration. Waze is best if your main concern is real-time driving efficiency. Its community-driven traffic alerts and dynamic rerouting help you avoid congestion and save time during daily commutes. Apple Maps suits users deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem who value simplicity, clean design and privacy protections. It may not have as many features as Google Maps or the same real-time edge as Waze, but its seamless integration with iOS makes it convenient.",

      "We spend so much time online that how we connect to the internet has become almost as important as the devices we use. Most people never give it a second thought. They connect their computer to Wi-Fi, type in a password and get on with their day. But if you have ever wondered whether plugging in an Ethernet cable is safer than sticking to wireless, you are asking the right question. The way you connect can have real consequences for your privacy and security. Recently, Kathleen reached out to me with the same doubt.",
      "\"Is it more secure to use the Ethernet connection at home for my computer, or is it safer to use the Wi-Fi from my cable provider?\"",
      "It's a great question, Kathleen, because both options seem similar on the surface but work very differently under the hood. Those differences can mean the difference between a private, secure connection and one that's more vulnerable to attackers.",
      "BEWARE OF FAKE WI-FI NETWORKS THAT STEAL YOUR DATA WHEN TRAVELING",

      "Ethernet offers direct, wired security without wireless risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Ethernet and Wi-Fi differ when it comes to security",
      "Ethernet and Wi-Fi both get you online, but they do it in completely different ways.\u00a0Ethernet\u00a0uses a physical cable that connects your computer directly to the router. Since it is a wired connection, data travels straight through that cable, making it much harder for anyone to intercept it. There is no wireless signal to hijack, no airwaves to eavesdrop on.",
      "Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is built on convenience. It sends your data through the air to and from your router, which is what makes it so easy to connect from anywhere in your home. But that convenience comes with more risk. Anyone within range of your signal could potentially try to break into the network. If your Wi-Fi is protected by a weak password or uses outdated encryption, a skilled attacker might gain access without ever stepping inside your house.",
      "At home, that risk is smaller than in a coffee shop or hotel, but it is not zero. Even a poorly secured smart device on your network can give attackers a way in. Ethernet removes many of those risks simply because it is harder to access a connection that requires physical access to a cable. Check out our steps for setting up a home network like a pro\u00a0here.",
      "DON'T USE YOUR HOME WI-FI BEFORE FIXING CERTAIN SECURITY RISKS",
      "Why one connection might be safer than the other",
      "It is easy to think Ethernet is automatically safer, but that is not the whole story. Your real security depends on how your entire network is set up. For example, a Wi-Fi network with a strong password, up-to-date router firmware, and WPA3 encryption is going to be far more secure than a poorly configured Ethernet setup connected to an outdated router.",
      "There is also the question of who else uses your network. If it is just you and a handful of devices, your risk is low. But if you live in a shared space or run smart home gadgets, that changes the equation. Each device connected to Wi-Fi is a potential entry point. Ethernet reduces the number of devices that can connect, which limits the attack surface.",
      "Ultimately, the connection type is one piece of the puzzle. The bigger factors are how your router is configured, how often you update your software, and how careful you are with what devices you connect.",
      "Wi-Fi brings convenience but also potential exposure to hackers.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways to make your internet safer",
      "Whether you stick with Wi-Fi or switch to Ethernet, there are several practical steps you can take to protect your devices and data. Each step adds an extra layer of security to your network.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",

    "story": [
      "Skydweller CEO Robert Miller discusses his company's solar-powered drone that can fly for days on 'Fox News Live.'",
      "Shoplifting has long been a challenge for retailers, but a U.S. company now believes that flying drones could help combat the issue. Flock Safety, best known for its law enforcement camera systems, is promoting its new Flock Aerodome Drone as an Automated Security system to the private sector. The idea is simple: if a theft occurs, a drone launches, follows the suspect, and streams live video back to security teams or even police. With theft rates reportedly climbing 93% in 2024, the push for high-tech security has never been stronger.",

While some may view this as an added safety measure, others may worry about increased surveillance and loss of privacy.

      "What you need to know about nursery breach",
      "According to reports, the hacker group Radiant claims to have stolen data related to around 8,000 children. To prove possession, they posted samples, including pictures and profiles of ten children, on a darknet website. They then issued a ransom demand, threatening to release more sensitive information unless Kido paid. In addition to targeting the nursery chain directly, Radiant reportedly called some of the children's parents, pressuring them to push Kido into paying the ransom.",
      "FBI WARNS ABOUT NEW EXTORTION SCAM TARGETING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "When questioned about their actions, the group defended their tactics as a form of \"penetration testing\" for which they supposedly deserved compensation. This defense is misleading, as such testing requires explicit permission from the organization being targeted or participation in an official bug bounty program. Without that consent, these actions are illegal and deeply unethical.",
      "Hackers exploited children\u2019s data in the Kido breach, exposing families to serious risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so disturbing?",
      "The Kido breach is alarming for multiple reasons. First, it involves children's data, which is particularly sensitive and legally protected in most countries. Second, the attackers combined traditional data theft with intimidation tactics, reaching out to parents directly. History suggests that once criminals gain access to such information, the attacks can escalate.",
      "Breaches like this highlight how personal and digital security are intertwined. The potential misuse of data extends beyond simple identity theft. It can impact children's safety, family privacy and long-term well-being. With attackers leveraging both the stolen data and psychological pressure on parents, the threat is particularly potent and long-lasting.",
      "Parents reported being directly contacted by attackers, showing how intimidation adds to the harm. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps parents can take to protect their child's data",
      "Even though the investigation into the Kido breach is ongoing, parents and schools can take immediate action to protect children's data and reduce the risk of further exploitation. Here's a detailed guide:",
      "Log in to email, school portals and cloud storage accounts linked to your child. Look for unusual activity such as unrecognized logins, changes to passwords or new connected devices. Set up notifications for account activity whenever possible so you are alerted instantly if something suspicious happens.",
      "Adding\u00a02FA creates an extra layer of security. Even if a hacker has a password, they won't be able to access the account without the second verification step. Most email providers, school portals and messaging platforms support this, and it's a simple step that dramatically improves security.",
      "Data broker sites often collect names, addresses and other personal details that hackers can use. Services that remove your child's information from these databases can make it harder for attackers to find and exploit sensitive data.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "These services can continuously scan for your child's personal information online and alert you if their data appears on suspicious websites or the dark web. This early warning allows you to take action before criminals attempt to exploit it.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "A strong antivirus program protects devices from malware, phishing scams, and suspicious scripts. It is particularly important on devices that children use to access school portals or personal accounts. This ensures that if a hacker tries to use malware to get deeper access, it is blocked.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

One teacher said she respects her students' determination to stay connected and even acknowledged that the phone ban has improved behavior and focus in class. Still, she worries that turning Google Docs into chat rooms could open the door to bullying or cheating. Parents are also weighing in.

They're chatting through shared Google Docs, buying MacBooks so they can iMessage during class, swapping notes over email, and even sticking to old-school Post-Its to stay in touch. While some of these workarounds seem harmless, they also carry risks, from distractions that take focus away from learning to new opportunities for bullying or even cheating. For teachers, it's a reminder that managing distractions in the classroom goes beyond phone policies.

      "Kurt 'The CyberGuy' Knutsson shares practical ways to avoid falling victim to AI-generated phishing scams and discusses a report that North Korean agents are posing as I.T. workers to funnel money into the country's nuclear program.",
      "Cybercriminals are getting smarter every day, and one of their most convincing tricks is disguising phishing emails to look like they're coming from people you trust. Work emails are particularly dangerous because they lower your guard. After all, if the sender is your boss or IT department, why would you suspect anything? Unfortunately, scammers know this and use it to their advantage. I recently received an email from Krysti from Rockwall, Texas, who highlighted a similar issue.",
      "\"I received a spam email from my employer's email. It had a document attached to it. I tried to open it and could not. I contacted my employer and they told me they hadn't sent me anything. I changed my password and ran a virus scan. I also have been checking on the dark web for anything coming up on me. So far everything is okay. I did sign up for antivirus software based on your recommendation and we are signed up for identity theft protection. Is there anything else I should do?\"",
      "Incidents like this are more common than many realize, Krysti. And while it sounds like you took the right first steps by changing your password, scanning for malware and monitoring for identity misuse, there are a few additional precautions worth taking. A close call is often a warning sign that your digital habits might need tightening. Let's break down why these attacks are so dangerous and what everyone should do to make sure they're fully protected.",

      "Phishing emails often look like they come from someone you know, making them harder to spot. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why work email scams are so dangerous",
      "Phishing attempts that impersonate coworkers or employers are particularly effective because they rely on trust and urgency. You're more likely to open an attachment or click a link if you believe it's tied to your job. Scammers often spoof legitimate email addresses or use addresses that look almost identical to the real ones, hoping you won't notice the subtle difference.",
      "Once you interact with these emails, the risks multiply. Opening a malicious attachment could install spyware or ransomware. Clicking a fake link might lead to a login page designed to harvest your credentials. Even if nothing obvious happens right away, attackers could still be collecting background information to use in a future attack.",
      "These scams are becoming harder to spot, too. Some are powered by artificial intelligence-generated text, making them free of the usual grammar mistakes that used to be obvious red flags. Others use stolen email threads to insert themselves into ongoing conversations. That's why even seasoned professionals fall for them.",

      "Opening a fake attachment can secretly install malware or spyware on your device. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What to do immediately after a close call",
      "Changing your password or running a malware scan is often not enough to stop attackers. It's worth going a little further to make sure nothing slipped through. Start by checking your login history to see if there are any unauthorized sign-ins on your email or work accounts.",
      "Most platforms allow you to review recent activity, including device type and location, and if anything looks suspicious, sign out of all sessions immediately and change your password again. Next, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on your email and any other critical accounts. Even if attackers manage to steal your password, they won't be able to gain access without the second verification step.",
      "It's also important to alert your IT team, especially if the email appears to come from your employer's address. This could mean the company's email system has been compromised, and notifying them will allow them to investigate and secure other accounts if necessary. Finally, make sure all your software is up to date. Malware often exploits vulnerabilities in outdated systems, so regularly updating your operating system, antivirus and productivity tools adds another layer of protection against future attacks.",

      "Work email scams are rising, and even experienced professionals can get fooled. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 ways to check if your device or data is compromised",
      "Some cyber threats don't reveal themselves immediately. Scammers often collect small bits of data over time or wait weeks before trying to use what they've stolen. The following steps are actions anyone can take to make sure their device and personal data remain secure, and to catch any signs of compromise before they turn into serious problems.",
      "1) Consider a personal data removal service",
      "The more personal information about you that's publicly available, the easier it is for scammers to target you. Data removal services can help by scanning hundreds of data broker websites and removing your details from them. Reducing this digital footprint not only makes it harder for attackers to build profiles on you but also limits how easily phishing attempts can be tailored to your life.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "HOW FAKE MICROSOFT ALERTS TRICK YOU INTO PHISHING SCAMS",
      "Your information could already be circulating in breach dumps and underground markets without you realizing it. Identity protection services monitor known dark-web sources, forums and leak sites for your email, phone, SSN and other sensitive details. If they find a match, they alert you so you can act quickly: change passwords, turn on two-factor authentication, and place fraud alerts or credit freezes with the credit bureaus.",
      "Your information might already be circulating in dark web marketplaces without you realizing it. Identity theft protection services can help by continuously scanning those underground sites for your email, passwords or other sensitive details.

      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if you never shared payment details, attackers may attempt account takeovers or fraudulent transactions using any information they have. Review your bank, credit card and online account statements frequently for unusual activity. Pairing this habit with identity theft protection tools gives you an added safety net, as they often include financial monitoring and fraud alerts to catch problems quickly.",
      "Email accounts are often the central hub for many other services. If your inbox is compromised, attackers might try to break into linked accounts such as cloud storage, messaging apps or collaboration tools. Check each of these services for unfamiliar logins, permission changes or device activity, and secure them by changing passwords and enabling two-factor authentication.",
      "Weak or reused passwords are one of the easiest ways for attackers to break into accounts after a breach. A password manager solves this by generating and storing strong, unique passwords for every site you use. It also acts as a passive phishing detector. If the tool doesn't autofill a login form, that's a sign the page could be fake. Over time, this significantly reduces your risk of falling victim to credential-based attacks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Modern cyber threats go beyond viruses. A strong antivirus solution now acts as a full security layer, blocking phishing websites, detecting malicious scripts and stopping suspicious activity before it can compromise your device. If you've interacted with a suspicious attachment or link, a reputable antivirus tool can catch malware that might still be hiding in the background.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",

      "Close calls like this are unsettling, but they are also valuable wake-up calls. Cybercriminals are constantly refining their tactics, and phishing emails that once looked laughably fake can now be nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. The key is to build layers of defense, not just reactive steps after an incident, but proactive habits that make you a harder target in the first place.",

A small flap called the epiglottis blocks the windpipe during swallowing, and the path into the trachea is narrow and curved. To get around these obstacles, current tools are rigid. Medics have to lift the epiglottis with a metal scope and carefully angle the tube forward. If it slips into the esophagus instead, oxygen goes to the stomach instead of the lungs.\u00a0\"Traditional tools must be stiff so you can push them, and they only turn by pressing on sensitive tissue,\" explained Elliot Hawkes, professor of mechanical engineering at UCSB.",

      "The \"advanced fee\" gift: Anyone who promises to expedite probate proceedings or secure larger inheritances for an upfront fee is probably in it to win it (for themselves). Some cases even involve disgruntled family members acting out of greed. These are not your run-of-the-mill remote scammers from a foreign country; these can be local \"facilitators\" who have no actual authority and simply pocket the money. If someone claims you have an inheritance coming, but they need \"a fee to unlock it\" or they promise to \"handle your probate case\" for a small upfront fee, you guessed it \u2014 nothing ever comes from it.",
      "Why probate scams work",
      "Grief is a beacon for fraudsters. With grief comes diminished critical thinking from even the hardiest of privacy diehards. Scammers deliberately strike during this window when defenses are low. A scammer who can reference your personal information, family information or property details doesn't sound like a criminal, they sound like a legitimate professional. Scams often use the weapon of urgency \u2014 you have to purportedly act fast to avoid asset seizures, legal penalties or missed deadlines. When something demands immediate action, victims feel compelled to respond before verifying claims or consulting attorneys, which is exactly what fraudsters count on.",

      "How to protect yourself against the inheritance trap",
      "The good news is that with awareness and a few smart steps, you can lower your risk of falling victim to inheritance scams.",
      "Never send money or give information to an unsolicited contact about an estate. If someone claims you owe fees or have obligations, independently verify their identity or company. Contact the probate court directly using publicly listed numbers, not information provided by the caller. Ask your estate attorney about any claims before making payments.",
      "In most jurisdictions, you can't prevent a probate filing from going public. But you can minimize additional data exposure by not sharing anything on social media and limiting contact to only key parties that you trust with financial information.",
      "Data removal services specialize in removing personal information from data broker sites that scammers use to supplement probate data. Personal information combined with probate records create the perfect setup for inheritance traps\u2014scammers can make super-convincing, alarmist content that can bypass your intuition about scams, especially during times of grief.",
      "Illustration of a cybercriminal. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Legitimate attorneys and court officials will leave detailed messages and provide callback numbers you can verify independently by searching online. Unknown callers without legit numbers are likely scams.",
      "Set up appropriate fraud alerts and prevention methods with the bank or estate holder, especially if the estate holds a significant value that would be a golden opportunity for thieves.",
      "Scammers use convincing calls and messages to pressure people into paying fake debts, authorities warn. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "You can report potential probate scams to your probate court. They can issue a special order to protect assets, require executors to adopt formal procedures or even remove an executor for fraudulent behavior. You can also go to\u00a0ReportFraud.ftc.gov\u00a0to file a complaint.",
      "Ensure elderly relatives or those less familiar with scam tactics understand these risks. Scammers often target multiple heirs, seeking the most vulnerable respondent.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The probate system creates a privacy trade-off. You can't prevent much of this information from entering the public record, but you can control how you respond, and how much personal data is out there. Any probate topics should come through official court channels, and never an unsolicited phone call, email or text message. When in doubt, verify with your probate court, and always consult your estate attorney. With a little vigilance and a bit of data cleanup, you can ensure that the probate process doesn't put you in harm's way, during the time when you're at your most vulnerable.",

However, one of the organization\u2019s former leaders is criticizing how MSF has handled the situation in Gaza, going so far as to say its members have acted as \"accomplices of Hamas.\"",
      "Alain Destexhe, who worked as a doctor with MSF in the 1980s before serving as the group\u2019s secretary-general in the 1990s, told Fox News Digital the organization moved away from its impartial, humanitarian roots.",

      "On Oct. 12, 2023, less than a week after Hamas carried out its brutal massacre and took more than 250 people hostage, MSF condemned the slaughter but also called for an end to Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, making no mention of the hostages.",
      "\"M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) is horrified by the brutal mass killing of civilians perpetrated by Hamas, and by the massive attacks on Gaza, Palestine, now being pursued by Israel,\" the organization wrote. \"MSF calls for an immediate cessation to the indiscriminate bloodshed, and the establishment of safe spaces and safe passage for people to reach them as a matter of urgency.\"",
      "Beyond the organization\u2019s condemnation of both the massacre and Israeli actions, Destexhe uncovered several social media posts on accounts allegedly belonging to MSF staffers appearing to celebrate the Oct. 7 massacre. Destexhe explained to Fox News Digital that much of MSF\u2019s staff in the Gaza Strip are Palestinians, not foreign workers.",

      "As Israeli hostages are freed and Palestinian prisoners and detainees released \u2014 and after President Donald Trump's lengthy address to Israel\u2019s parliament on Monday \u2014 focus is shifting to what comes next.",
      "Some of the longest applause for Trump's speech came when he said that virtually the whole region had endorsed a plan for Gaza to be demilitarized and Hamas to disarm \u2014 key elements of his 20-point plan that have yet to actually be agreed upon.",
      "Now that phase one of his plan is being executed, negotiators and neighboring countries will watch whether key points of Trump\u2019s proposal will be accepted by both Israel and Hamas in talks on the next phases.",
      "Last few days",
      "A ceasefire came into effect in Gaza on Friday at noon local time, (5 a.m. ET), after the first phase of Trump's plan was agreed by Israel and Hamas, bringing relative calm to the enclave for the first time in months since the last truce collapsed in March.",
      "Under the first phase of Trump's plan, 20 living hostages were  handed over to Israel on Monday.  The remains of a further 28 hostages held by Hamas were expected to be released within 72 hours, although only four were initially, much to the disappointment of families.",
      "Israel also pledged to release 250 convicted prisoners and 1,700 Palestinians detained since Oct. 7.  Over 150 of the freed prisoners were deported to Egypt.",
      "More aid has begun to flow into the enclave in recent days, although it falls far short of what aid workers say is necessary.",
      "Now what?",
      "Hamas has long asserted that it would not release the last of the hostages until Israeli groups leave Gaza entirely, but having agreed to the first phase of Trump's plan, the militant group is relying on guarantees from Trump that a full withdrawal will eventually happen.",
      "When and if Israel withdraws fully remains unclear.",
      "Meanwhile, it is also unclear whether Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, will agree to a key stipulation of Trump's overall plan, as well as a crucial demand from Israel \u2014 that it disarm.",
      "Hamas has long refused calls to lay down arms, saying it has a right to armed resistance until Israel ends its occupation of Palestinian territories \u2014 and that has been a key sticking point in talks to negotiate an end to Israel's offensive in Gaza.",
      "In an interview with Al Jazeera on Oct. 9, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said that no Palestinian would accept surrendering weapons and that the people of Gaza were in greater need than ever of resistance.",
      "The militant group has agreed to step down from leadership over the territory and relinquish governance to a transitional body of Palestinian technocrats, which would be overseen by an international body, dubbed the \"Board of Peace.\" This body is expected to be headed by Trump, with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also named as a possible member of the oversight body.",
      "Noting the plan aboard the Air Force One on Monday en route to Israel, Trump said he first wanted to find out whether \"Tony would be popular with all.\"",
      "\"I like Tony, I\u2019ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he\u2019s an acceptable choice to everybody,\" he added.",
      "The idea of Blair joining the board has already drawn early criticism, with his reputation in the region shadowed by his decision to back the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2014 and claims by the U.S. and Britain of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction found to be false.",
      "Trump optimistic",
      "Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way to Israel on Monday, Trump said he believed \"everybody is happy\" with his 20-point peace plan.",
      "Noting that much of Gaza now resembles a \"demolition site\" after more than two years of Israel's offensive in the enclave, Trump said cleanup efforts would begin \"pretty much immediately.\"",
      "During his address to the Knesset, Trump also said Israel has won all it can by force.",
      "\u201cNow, it is time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East,\u201d he said.",
      "In Gaza, Palestinians across the enclave balanced their hopes for peace against fears that the ceasefire won't hold, as many return to the areas where their homes once stood.",
      "\"Everything is gone; no necessities of life remain,\" one man told NBC News.",
      "\"So, why do you live for? Our money, our homes that we worked hard for years \u2014 it\u2019s all gone,\" he said. \"Nothing is left.\""

    "summary": "Six months into President Donald Trump\u2019s unprecedented gambit to impose sizable tariffs on imports, U.S. consumers are already shouldering as much as 55% of their costs, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs analysts",
    "story": [
      "Six months into President Donald Trump\u2019s unprecedented gambit to impose sizable tariffs on imports, U.S. consumers are already shouldering as much as 55% of their costs, according to a new report from Goldman Sachs analysts.",
      "And with new tariffs most likely on the way, the cost burden could rise even higher, they said.",
      "The findings, released Sunday, suggest U.S. consumers will continue to struggle with high prices \u2014 which Trump had promised to address in the run-up to his re-election. While inflation rates have come down from the post-Covid peak, they have remained stuck above levels economists consider healthy, causing consumers and businesses alike to continue to report feeling burdened by price increases.",
      "Over the past six months, Trump has imposed tariffs on copper, steel, aluminum and some automobiles and auto parts. He has also levied country-specific tariff rates of as much as 28% on China and 16% on much of the rest of the world, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Partly as a result, consumer prices tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics have increased every month since April, when Trump made his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d speech announcing the new duties. As of August, the BLS\u2019 benchmark Consumer Price Index stood at 2.93%. September data has been delayed because of the government shutdown, now in its 13th day, and it is scheduled to be released later this month.",
      "A separate inflation measure preferred by the Federal Reserve has likewise continued to climb, rising to 2.7% for August \u2014 above the central bank\u2019s 2% target.",
      "In August, Trump assailed an initial Goldman Sachs estimate that said consumers could bear as much as 67% of the cost of tariffs.",
      "In a statement, White House spokesman Kush Desai said: \u201cThe President and Administration\u2019s position has always been clear: While Americans may face a transition period from tariffs upending a broken status quo that has put America Last, the cost of tariffs will ultimately be borne by foreign exporters. Companies are already shifting and diversifying their supply chains in response to tariffs, including by onshoring production to the United States. Americans can rest assured that the Administration will continue to deliver economic relief from Joe Biden\u2019s inflation crisis while laying the groundwork for a long-term restoration of American Greatness.\u201d",
      "The administration has also pointed to the billions in revenue the duties have brought in to continue to justify their existence. In September, tariff revenues totaled more than $31 billion, bringing the year-to-date haul to about $215 billion. Trump has floated various proposals for how to use the funds, including sending out rebate checks to U.S. households and subsidizing U.S. farmers and manufacturers. Last week, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated the administration would use some tariff revenues to pay for Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children food subsidies that have been affected by the shutdown.",
      "The Goldman analysts arrived at their estimate of the tariffs\u2019 burden on consumers by comparing how much consumer prices for tariffed products have deviated from previous trends. The burden is actually less than the estimated pass-through that occurred during the trade war Trump set off during his first term in 2018. In that period, evidence suggests, foreign exporters did not bear any significant share of the tariff costs, meaning consumers were shouldering even more of a burden.",
      "This time, exporters are bearing some cost, along with U.S. businesses, who may actually be sparing consumers even worse price increases for the moment. American companies may be waiting to see how the Supreme Court rules on tariffs, the Goldman analysts said. Businesses also might have accumulated inventory in advance of the tariffs\u2019 setting in, allowing them to hold off on raising their retail prices more significantly. The nation\u2019s highest court is set to hear opening arguments in the tariff case Nov. 5.",
      "Still, the analysts estimate tariffs have added 0.44% to the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure. That could rise to as much as 0.6% if Trump makes good on recent threats to impose tariffs on products such as furniture and kitchen cabinets. Those were set to take effect Tuesday.

      "Allen said he first met Keaton during an audition, and that she was later cast in his Broadway play, \"Play It Again, Sam.\"",
      "\"For the first week of rehearsal we never spoke a word to one another. She was shy, I was shy, and with two shy people things can get pretty dull. Finally, by chance we took a break at the same moment and wound up sharing a fast bite at some Eighth Avenue joint,\" he wrote.",
      "\"That was our first moment of personal contact,\" he continued. \"The upshot is that she was so charming, so beautiful, so magical, that I questioned my sanity. I thought: Could I be in love so quickly?\"",
      "Allen said that by the time the show opened, he and Keaton were lovers, and that he started to show her his films.",
      "\"As time went on I made movies for an audience of one, Diane Keaton,\" he wrote. \"I never read a single review of my work and cared only what Keaton had to say about it.

      "Allen reflected on the world without Keaton.",
      "\"But the world is constantly being redefined, and with Keaton\u2019s passing it is redefined once again,\" he said. \"A few days ago the world was a place that included Diane Keaton. Now it\u2019s a world that does not. Hence, it\u2019s a drearier world.\"",

      "\u201cThis is an unconscionable and gruesomely damaging manipulation of innocent children for vindictive and self-serving motives,\u201d Allen said, according to the Times.",
      "Allen was never charged with a crime, but the allegations against him resurfaced in the 2010s. Keaton defended Allen in a post on X in 2018 during the #MeToo movement.",
      "\"Woody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe him. It might be of interest to take a look at the 60 Minute interview from 1992 and see what you think,\" Keaton wrote, linking to a clip of the interview.",
      "Keaton never married, and Allen went on to marry one of Mia Farrow's adopted children, Soon-Yi Previn, in 1997, when she was 27 and he was 62."

He\u2019s optimistic, he has all these dreams and plans when he gets out.\u201d",

      "Is \"Roofman\" Based on a True Story?",

      "Manchester carved a hole in the roof of the McDonald's in Belmont, North Carolina, and ordered the workers to lie on the ground as he told another to open the safe \u2014 while holding a .22 caliber rifle.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. You\u2019re the good people,\u201d Manchester reportedly told the employees, according to the Observer. \u201cI\u2019m the bad guy. I\u2019m sorry for doing this to you.\u201d",

      "The Observer reported Manchester, who had recently divorced from the mother of his three children, told police he did it for the money, \u201cto pay bills and buy things for my kids.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will do everything I can do to fix the situation. I still have a lot to give the community and the Army,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was going to be quick cash, and I ended up scaring people and wasted the police\u2019s time as well, and I am sorry for that.\u201d",
      "Authorities in California suspected Manchester was behind more than 40 other robberies in the state and others, as his military assignments would put him near the locations.",

      "Investigators found a fingerprint in the space, which was a match for Manchester, who had escaped from the state prison months before, per the Observer. They started showing Manchester's mugshot to people in the area, and on Jan. 5, 2005, they showed his photo at Crossroads Church to Wainscott.",
      "\u201cMiss Wainscott, the man that you\u2019ve been dating is not who you think he is,\u201d investigators told her, according to the Observer. \u201cHe\u2019s an escaped convict. He\u2019s considered extremely dangerous.\u201d",
      "They showed her Manchester's mug shot on America's Most Wanted, and she later helped investigators catch him.",
      "Manchester was set to take Wainscott out for dinner that night, as it was her birthday, and she called him to confirm he was picking her up, per the Observer. As investigators tailed his car, he stopped at a Bi-Lo grocery store to pick up flowers.",
      "Once he was at Wainscott's door, the tactical unit swarmed, and Manchester surrendered, according to the Observer.",

      "He added, \u201cThat has been the most scared I\u2019ve ever been in my entire life. When you think that you\u2019re dying, it\u2019s a feeling that I\u2019m never going to forget.\u201d",
      "The show's medical professionals were able to determine that the Latimer had sustained  a \u201cdry bite,\u201d which meant the snake released no venom into him.",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday, according to an administration official, a Western official and a Ukrainian embassy spokesperson.",
      "Trump appeared to confirm the meeting while speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One on his way back from the Middle East. Asked whether he is hosting Zelenskyy on Friday, Trump responded, \"I think so, yeah.\"",
      "Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Olga Stefanishyna, confirmed that Trump invited Zelenskyy to a meeting this week, Ukrainian Embassy spokesperson Halyna Yusypiuk said. The Financial Times previously reported the visit.",
      "Trump said earlier Monday that the United States is considering approving Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine, adding that they would be \u201ca new step of aggression\u201d in its war against Russia. Providing the long-range missiles would mark a new level of U.S. support for Ukraine in the war.",
      "\"We may not, but we may do it,\" Trump said in separate remarks to reporters on Air Force One. \"I think it\u2019s appropriate to bring up \u2014 yeah, I want to. I want to see the war settled.\"",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said.",
      "Ukraine theoretically could use the long-range Tomahawk missiles to strike inside Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin has cautioned the United States against supplying the weapons, saying this month that it would be a \u201cqualitatively new stage of escalation, including in relations between Russia and the U.S.\u201d",
      "Dmitry Medvedev, a top Russian official and former president and prime minister, also said delivering Tomahawk missiles \u201ccould end badly for everyone, and first and foremost, for Trump himself.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy will visit on the heels of Trump's trip to the Middle East, where he was hailed for his role in championing a peace deal that led to Hamas' release of the remaining living hostages and Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelenskyy's office, said Monday on X that Ukrainian officials were on their way to Washington for \"high-level talks.\" Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko and top national security official Rustem Umerov are part of the delegation, he said.",
      "The talks aimed \"to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s defense, secure our energy resilience, and intensify sanctions pressure on the aggressor,\" Yermak said.",
      "Zelenskyy last visited the White House in mid-August, a few days after Trump met with Putin in Alaska. Zelenskyy was joined by a group of prominent European leaders, who acted as diplomatic backup after a tense Oval Office meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in February.",
      "Last week, first lady Melania Trump said she has an \u201copen channel of communication\u201d with Putin over the \u201cwelfare\u201d of Ukrainian children believed to have been kidnapped and taken to Russia. She wrote a letter to Putin in August, when Putin and President Trump met in Alaska, calling for him to protect \u201cthe innocence of these children.\u201d",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed he could end the war in Ukraine, quickly, even within 24 hours. But during his first few months in office, he said that while he originally thought the war in Ukraine might be the \"easiest\" to end, Putin \"let me down.\""

      "The agreement comes just more than two years to the day after the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Israel that killed 1,200 people and around 250 kidnapped.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s personal touch \u2014 both as a heavy hand and a gentle guide \u2014 played a pivotal role at key moments in the development of a Middle East peace deal that promises to bring an end to Israel\u2019s two-year war in Gaza, current and former officials in the United States and other nations told NBC News.",
      "Trump announced on Wednesday that the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of the plan to end the conflict in Gaza had been agreed to, with a pause in fighting and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Trump called it \u201ca great deal\u201d in a brief interview with NBC News on Thursday morning. \u201cEverybody is happy,\u201d he said.",
      "The deal accelerated over several crucial moments \u2014 Israel\u2019s strike on Qatar, discussions on the sidelines of the recent United Nations General Assembly in New York City and Jared Kushner\u2019s conversations with his father-in-law, these sources said.",
      "Also helpful, though, was an old-fashioned deadline. In recent weeks, Trump told advisers he wanted to announce a deal by Oct. 7, the second anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that precipitated the war, according to two people familiar with his instructions.",
      "The president, one of the people said, was fixated on the date both for its symbolic significance and because he saw it as a way to herald a new step forward in Israel\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits Washington next month.",
      "This account of the Trump administration\u2019s role in the ceasefire deal is based on interviews with a dozen sources in three countries.",
      "As the war in Gaza ground on \u2014 with more than 67,000 dead, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, declarations of famine and images of wounded children across social media \u2014 it threatened Trump\u2019s vision for a more interconnected Middle East that he began to implement in his first term with the Abraham Accords, which established relationships between Israel and several Arab nations.",
      "The war\u2019s intensity also presented an opportunity for Trump to coalesce regional powers around a peace plan to disarm Hamas, preclude Israel from seizing the West Bank and provide for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to the first phase of that proposal \u2014 a ceasefire and an Israeli military pullback to a \u201cyellow line\u201d within Gaza that leaves more of the strip under the control of Palestinians. That is to be followed by Hamas\u2019 returning as many as 20 Israeli hostages and the remains of as many as 28 hostages and Israel\u2019s releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and the remains of 15 dead Gazans.",
      "Trump was able to announce the pact just one day after his target.",
      "To do that, Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and of a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations that could influence Hamas and Palestinian civilians. At the same time, he had to apply pressure. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
      "And, at times, the darkest hours yielded the biggest breakthroughs.",
      "Qatar strikes",
      "After months of negotiations with no result, a turning point came in September in the form of a surprise attack.",
      "Israeli forces launched airstrikes on the Qatari capital, Doha, in an attempt to kill the leaders of Hamas. Six people were killed, including a member of Qatar\u2019s internal security force.",
      "Over the course of the war, Israel has struck in Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, in addition to Gaza.",
      "But this was different. Qatar is a U.S. ally that hosts a strategic air base with 10,000 American troops. Trump and his team had come to view the Persian Gulf nation as a trusted partner in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The parents of an Israeli hostage had been in Doha that very morning, meeting Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani.",
      "The bombing blindsided and angered the White House, as well as the Arab world.",
      "Asked about the strikes at the time, Trump told reporters: \u201cI was very unhappy about it. Very unhappy about every aspect.\u201d",
      "But instead of killing the prospect of a deal, the Israeli attack prompted Trump and his team to ratchet up pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the war to an end.",
      "\u201cIt was the moment that Trump said, \u2018Enough,\u2019\u201d said a former Israeli official, adding: \u201cThis deal, almost identical, has been on the table for over a year now. Netanyahu didn\u2019t want to do it, but Trump left him no choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth Netanyahu and Hamas tried to say \u2018yes, but\u2019 to stall, but Trump decided to hear only \u2018yes\u2019 and pushed them into the corner,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Shortly after the strikes, Trump issued a warning to Israel: He would not support the annexation of the West Bank, as some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet had proposed.",
      "The Americans, the Qataris and other Arab governments saw the surprise strikes as an opportunity to exert leverage, according to an Arab official and former Israeli officials with knowledge of the diplomatic talks.",
      "\u201cIt was a catalyst to bring pressure on the Israeli government, which had been the main obstacle to a deal,\u201d the Arab official said.",
      "U.N. General Assembly sidelines",
      "Weeks after the strikes on Doha, the U.N. General Assembly met along the bank of the East River in New York City.",
      "It was on the sidelines \u2014 where, historically, deals are often solidified with face-to-face interactions and handshakes \u2014 that the discussions \u201creally took a turn,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.",
      "Trump convened a meeting at the General Assembly with Arab- and Muslim-majority nations to sell his 20-point peace plan. Rubio said that is where Trump \u201ccreated this coalition\u201d before he presented the proposal to Netanyahu at the White House at the end of last month.",
      "Crucially, during that visit, Trump persuaded Netanyahu to call Al-Thani, the Qatari prime minister, to apologize for the Israeli strikes in Qatar. That allowed Qatar to remain engaged as a key intermediary in peace talks.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that the Qatari government viewed the apology as a way to move forward, and it saw its role, that it had invested in for quite a long time, as still vital to achieving a ceasefire and hopefully peace in the future,\u201d Nawaf Al-Thani, a former Qatari defense attach\u00e9 to the United States, told NBC News.",
      "Trump\u2019s handling of that episode was reminiscent for many observers of the way he reacted to Israel\u2019s and Iran\u2019s striking each other during a ceasefire agreement following American bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "\u201cWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don\u2019t know what the f--- they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump, clearly frustrated, said at the time. His rebuke of Israel, along with Iran, reassured Arab countries with ties to Shia-majority Iran. In that way, a former senior White House official said, Trump\u2019s messages to Israel after its strikes in Iran and in Qatar were similar.",
      "\u201cBoth showed the president\u2019s commitment to Israel, but also his commitment to the Arab countries,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Seeing the United States pushing Israel over the strike in Doha helped persuade Qatar, Turkey and other Arab governments to press Hamas, making it clear that the time for delays and foot-dragging was over, the officials said.",
      "As the negotiations advanced, both the U.S. and Arab negotiators chose to convey a united and optimistic front, placing Netanyahu at risk of potentially insulting Trump if he questioned the 20-point proposal Trump put on the table, the former Israeli official said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump people and Arab world just briefed total confidence and optimism before anything was finalized to make it seem like a done deal, which made saying \u2018no\u2019 a public affront to Trump, and Netanyahu can\u2019t do that,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIt was a show of very effective statecraft and use of leverage.\u201d",
      "Kushner\u2019s role",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, became his chief envoy to the Middle East. There he was delivering a speech at the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. There he was building relationships with Arab leaders, focusing on economic relations.",
      "Years later, Kushner became deeply involved in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. He emerged, former Israeli officials said, because he carries important influence with regional governments and the president.",
      "\u201cKushner was the architect,\u201d a former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner was able to convey to Trump that the conflict in Gaza threatened the future of his biggest diplomatic success the last time he was in office \u2014 the Abraham Accords.",
      "That deal produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Trump has aimed to extend it to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.",
      "\u201cThe entire legacy was in jeopardy,\u201d the former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner and Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Egypt on Tuesday to hammer out details of the deal, according to senior U.S. officials.",
      "They went over various aspects of the proposal, including how Israeli military forces would be redeployed and the order of hostage and prisoner releases, the officials said, with one adding that an important feature of their work was the decision to \u201cseparate the peace deal into two clear phases.\u201d That allowed for an agreement on the exchange of people, while the deal\u2019s other points are negotiated in a second phase.",
      "The U.S. negotiators called Trump on Wednesday evening to get his final guidance before he announced that a deal was in place, the officials said. Israel\u2019s government approved the exchange Thursday evening.",
      "\u201cIt came together quick in a good way,\u201d Witkoff told NBC News in a brief telephone interview Thursday morning as he waited to board a flight to Israel.",
      "Kushner and Witkoff had about \u201cfive hours of sleep in the last three days,\u201d senior U.S. officials said.",
      "American negotiators expect the next phase to be \u201calmost a permanent ceasefire until all the other issues we have to deal with are negotiated and considered,\u201d one of the officials said, pointing to outstanding topics as thorny as how Gaza will be governed.",
      "U.S. officials cautioned Thursday that there is still a lot of work to do to ensure the ceasefire holds and the rest of the plans can be finalized and implemented.",
      "\u201cThis is a very delicate time,\u201d one of them said.",
      "Trump said he plans to travel to Egypt to put his signature on the Middle East agreement in the coming days.",
      "And the U.S. military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support the International Stabilization Force for the long-term internal security solution for Gaza and to support the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into Gaza, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "The effort will be called the Civil-Military Coordination Cell, and U.S. troops could begin arriving in Israel immediately, the officials said.",
      "In addition to supporting moving aid and assistance into Gaza, they are expected to support the deconfliction mechanism between the two sides \u2014 basically making sure that both sides are upholding their part of the security agreements.",
      "\u201cI think right now,\u201d a senior U.S. official said, \u201cwe\u2019re just focused on making sure any gaps are patched up in the agreement.\u201d",
      "Trump allies say the agreement between Israel and Hamas, forged under immense pressure on both sides \u2014 including Trump\u2019s broad support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, the limits he placed on Netanyahu and a threat to let Israel destroy Hamas if it did not agree to the pact \u2014 is a testament to the validity of his peace-through-strength approach to foreign policy.",
      "\u201cHe understands that sometimes you have to use force to set the structure for peace,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who is close to Trump, said in an interview last week."

      "The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, who lives in hiding after attempting to run for the presidency last year against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Machado, 58, was recognized for keeping \"the flame of democracy burning amidst a growing darkness\" and \"ever-expanding authoritarianism in Venezuela.\"",
      "Despite speculation that President Donald Trump might win the prize for his role helping broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, among other things, Machado emerged as a late favorite in online betting platforms hours before the decision came.",

      "\"I hope you understand that this is a movement; this is the achievement of a whole society. I'm just one person.

      "With nicknames such as \"the Lady of Steel\" and \"the Iron Lady,\" she has been among the most high profile victims of Maduro's intensifying crackdown against opposition figures, journalists and civil society during his increasingly repressive rule."

    "story": [
      "When it comes to the best foods for easing chronic constipation, are kiwis on your grocery list?",
      "New dietary guidelines from the British Dietetic Association, published Monday, say that kiwis \u2014 along with rye bread and certain supplements \u2014 can help improve constipation symptoms.",
      "The guidelines, the authors say, are the first evidence-based recommendations for treating constipation with diet, not medications.",
      "Chronic constipation affects around 16% of adults worldwide, and constipation is the reason for almost 2.5 million doctors visits in the U.S. per year, according to the American College of Gastroenterology.",
      "Eirini Dimidi, a lead author of the guidelines, said the existing guidance for managing chronic constipation is largely focused on pharmaceuticals.",
      "The few dietary recommendations out there \u2014 eat more fiber, drink more water \u2014 are ambiguous and often lack research to back them up.",
      "\u201cI remember looking at the guidelines and realizing that they are just really limited in the number of dietary recommendations they make,\u201d said Dimidi, a registered dietician and associate professor in the department of nutritional sciences at King\u2019s College in London.",
      "To come up with the new guidelines, the authors analyzed clinical trials and evaluated each method\u2019s effectiveness for managing constipation. The recommendations were jointly published in the Journal of Human Nutrition & Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology & Motility.",
      "What is chronic constipation?",
      "Constipation \u2014 defined by fewer than three bowel movements a week \u2014 is considered chronic if it lasts for more than three months.",
      "Symptoms can vary from person to person, but common ones are hard or lumpy stool, stomachache and nausea. More serious symptoms of constipation include blood in stool, fever and vomiting.",
      "Constipation can be caused by diet, lifestyle, certain illnesses and injuries, and some medications. It\u2019s extremely common, affecting people of all ages, gender and race.",
      "\u201cI see chronic constipation across the spectrum,\u201d said Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \u201cI see it in toddlers, I see it in school-age children, I see it in adults. So it\u2019s a common thing,\u201d she said.",
      "Chronic constipation can severely impact people\u2019s lives and limit their physical abilities, worsening their quality of life and work productivity.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re chronically constipated, you may not be able to even participate in physical activity, because you feel bloated, you\u2019re in pain, you\u2019re achy, it may affect your mood,\u201d said Anderson-Haynes, who also owns 360 Girls and Women, a nutrition and health practice based in Boston.",
      "How is chronic constipation treated?",
      "Dr. William Chey, professor of gastroenterology at the University of Michigan and incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology, said most studies on treating chronic constipation have focused on fiber supplements, like psyllium, and medications, like bisacodyl, senna and amitiza.",
      "He added American guidelines \u201cfocus pretty heavily on medical therapies for chronic constipation.\u201d",
      "Traditional constipation treatments include increasing fiber intake through foods like prunes and other fruits and vegetables, drinking more water, and using different kinds of laxatives.",
      "While the new guidelines include certain fiber-rich foods and fiber supplements, there\u2019s no guidance on a \u201chigh-fiber diet\u201d overall.",
      "\u201cWhen we were building these guidelines, and looking at the literature, we were expecting a lot more evidence on a high-fiber diet, and there simply isn\u2019t enough in constipation,\u201d Dimidi said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that a high-fiber diet is very beneficial for our overall health and also for elements of gut health, such as reducing the risk of colorectal cancer,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when it comes to constipation, specifically, we just don\u2019t have enough evidence to say that it improves constipation.\u201d",
      "What are the new recommendations?",
      "Chey, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new guidelines, said the recommendations \u201cprovide a valuable road map to things that [people] can try as they\u2019re waiting to see their primary care physician.\u201d",
      "He added that people with more severe cases of constipation may need to see a gastroenterologist.",
      "The recommendations include:",
      "Fiber supplements: More than 10 grams of fiber supplements, such as psyllium, per day can improve stool frequency and consistency and aid in reducing straining. Fiber supplements should be slowly introduced and dosage gradually increased.Probiotics: Certain strains of probiotics, including, B. lactis and Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2, may help some people with symptoms. If taking one, patients should take a supplement of their choice and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for at least four weeks.Magnesium oxide supplements: 0.5-1.5 grams daily can help with stool frequency and consistency, reduce symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain and improve overall quality of life. Dosage should start at 0.5 grams per day and be gradually increased weekly.Kiwis: Three daily, with or without the skin, can help improve stool frequency but not consistency.Rye bread: Six to eight slices of rye bread per day can also aid stool frequency, but not consistency. The authors noted that this amount may not be realistic for some people.High mineral-content water: In combination with other treatments, 0.5-1.5 liters per day of high mineral-content water may also help. One of the key minerals in high mineral-content water, magnesium, is a known laxative.",

      "Still, overall, he said, \u201cI think these kinds of recommendations are going to be very helpful.\u201d",
      "Dimidi said she hopes the release of the guidelines can \u201cempower\u201d those with chronic constipation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping [the guidance] means that clinicians are very well-informed and can provide personalized advice to their patients that is very effective,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also that people themselves with constipation can access now evidence-based information, feel empowered to take control of the symptoms and improve a condition that has a tremendous impact on quality of life.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A jubilant Donald Trump celebrated a hard-won ceasefire Monday in the conflict between Israel and Hamas militants, while inviting Middle East leaders to create a lasting peace that unlocks the region\u2019s potential for dramatic economic growth.",
      "As all 20 living hostages rejoined their families in Israel, Trump spoke to the nation's parliament in Jerusalem and marked a momentous breakthrough in a war that began just over two years ago.",
      "The U.S. president who wrung a peace deal from bitter combatants told the Knesset that \u201cthe long and painful nightmare is finally over.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not only the end of a war,\u201d said Trump, who had arrived in Israel in the morning. \u201cThis is the end of an age of terror and death and the beginning of the age of faith and hope and of God.",
      "\"It\u2019s the start of a grand concord and lasting harmony for Israel and all the nations of what will soon be a truly magnificent region.\u201d",
      "Making it so won\u2019t be easy. Old antagonisms could resurface at any point, jeopardizing the truce that Trump and his advisers brokered over the past few months.",
      "An accusation of bad faith came right away. Family members said Monday that Hamas had released the remains of only four of 28 deceased hostages, breaking a commitment. They called for an \u201cimmediate suspension\u201d of the ceasefire agreement until all the bodies are returned.",
      "Dueling statements from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also suggested they differed over something as fundamental as whether the fighting was truly over.",
      "Netanyahu, speaking on television Sunday, said, \u201cThe campaign is not over\u201d and that \u201csome of our enemies are trying to recover in order to attack us again.\u201d",
      "Asked about that on Air Force One en route to Israel, Trump told reporters: \u201cThe war is over. The war is over. The war is over, OK? You understand that?\u201d Lest there be any doubt, Trump reinforced the point during his remarks to the Knesset while Netanyahu sat and listened.",
      "\u201cNow you can be a little nicer, Bibi, because you\u2019re not at war anymore, Bibi,\u201d he said, using Netanyahu\u2019s nickname.",
      "After finishing his speech, Trump flew to Egypt to take part in a peace conference with the leaders of 20 nations, posing for pictures in front of a sign proclaiming, \u201cPeace in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Notably missing from the signing ceremony were the two parties who\u2019d been at war: Hamas and Israel. Trump had invited Netanyahu to the ceremony in Sharm el-Sheikh, but the Israeli leader chose not to attend. His office cited the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah as the reason. Without Netanyahu and a representative from Hamas, the day lacked what often turns out to be an iconic picture at such Middle East peace ceremonies: the U.S. president and the combatants linking arms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary moment and demonstration of will by an American president: a bid to end the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza,\u201d Aaron David Miller, a former State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator in Republican and Democratic administrations, said in an interview. \u201cBut to do that you need to climb several very high mountains.\u201d",
      "Richard Goldberg, who served on the White House National Security Council in Trump\u2019s first term, wrote on X: \u201cToday is a celebration. Trump and Netanyahu delivered the opportunity for peace through strength.\u201d",
      "\u201cTomorrow is harder,\u201d he added. \u201cWords like demilitarizing, disarming and de-radicalizing are just words without action. Every step will be filled with pitfalls. Every step will be contested by forces that do not support the Trump vision for peace. By Iran. By the Muslim Brotherhood. By the U.N. By others.\u201d",
      "As for the future, the Trump administration appears to have less of a blueprint than an aspiration. Last month, Trump released a 20-point peace plan that starts with ending the war in Gaza and ends with forging a broader peace between Israel and the Palestinians.",
      "The first part is specific; the latter, vague. The 19th point says that certain conditions that include reconstruction of Gaza and political reform must be met and then, once that happens, \u201cthe conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\u201d The authors set no hard deadlines or timetables for deciding the Palestinians\u2019 fate.",
      "At home, Trump is enmeshed in a government shutdown with no end in sight. But presidents enjoy far more latitude when it comes to foreign policy, and Trump appears to be savoring his achievement overseas.",
      "A senior administration official traveling with Trump on the quick trip to Israel and Egypt said of the president\u2019s mood: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen him so proud.\u201d",
      "Another official, back in Washington, said: \u201cEveryone is taking great pride in it and wants to be part of it. And it\u2019s an acute reminder that we can do the hard things.\u201d",
      "Trump tapped two confidants to negotiate the deal: his son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House envoy Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer. Both watched in the Knesset as Trump delivered an hour-long speech, relishing the moment and riffing in ways that made members laugh and applaud in surprise.",
      "\u201cTrump! Trump! Trump,\u201d lawmakers chanted. Some wore his signature piece of campaign memorabilia, a red hat with a twist that read: \u201cTrump, the Peace President.\u201d",
      "Seizing on the good will, Trump made a personal plea to help a friend. Netanyahu is facing trial on corruption charges. Trump went off script to beseech Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon the prime minister.",
      "\u201cThis man is a good man right here. I have an idea. Mr. President, why don\u2019t you give him a pardon?\u201d Trump said.",
      "Now that the fighting has stopped and the hostages have been returned, Trump's interest could potentially wane. As the leader with the most leverage in the region, Trump needs to stay involved to make progress on his vision of a transformed Middle East, foreign policy analysts said.",
      "For Trump, there is at least one clear incentive to stay engaged.",
      "He lost out on the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize last week, and his supporters are already lobbying for him to get the award next year.",
      "\"You have to wonder whether he stays with this,\" Miller, the former negotiator, said. \"That will depend primarily on whether there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow: the elusive Nobel, which he believes he deserves.\""

      "Some of the longest applause for Trump's speech came when he said that virtually the whole region had endorsed a plan for Gaza to be demilitarized and Hamas to disarm \u2014 key elements of his 20-point plan that have yet to actually be agreed upon.",
      "Now that phase one of his plan is being executed, negotiators and neighboring countries will watch whether key points of Trump\u2019s proposal will be accepted by both Israel and Hamas in talks on the next phases.",
      "Last few days",
      "A ceasefire came into effect in Gaza on Friday at noon local time, (5 a.m. ET), after the first phase of Trump's plan was agreed by Israel and Hamas, bringing relative calm to the enclave for the first time in months since the last truce collapsed in March.",
      "Under the first phase of Trump's plan, 20 living hostages were  handed over to Israel on Monday.  The remains of a further 28 hostages held by Hamas were expected to be released within 72 hours, although only four were initially, much to the disappointment of families.",
      "Israel also pledged to release 250 convicted prisoners and 1,700 Palestinians detained since Oct. 7.  Over 150 of the freed prisoners were deported to Egypt.",
      "More aid has begun to flow into the enclave in recent days, although it falls far short of what aid workers say is necessary.",
      "Now what?",
      "Hamas has long asserted that it would not release the last of the hostages until Israeli groups leave Gaza entirely, but having agreed to the first phase of Trump's plan, the militant group is relying on guarantees from Trump that a full withdrawal will eventually happen.",
      "When and if Israel withdraws fully remains unclear.",
      "Meanwhile, it is also unclear whether Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, will agree to a key stipulation of Trump's overall plan, as well as a crucial demand from Israel \u2014 that it disarm.",
      "Hamas has long refused calls to lay down arms, saying it has a right to armed resistance until Israel ends its occupation of Palestinian territories \u2014 and that has been a key sticking point in talks to negotiate an end to Israel's offensive in Gaza.",
      "In an interview with Al Jazeera on Oct. 9, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said that no Palestinian would accept surrendering weapons and that the people of Gaza were in greater need than ever of resistance.",
      "The militant group has agreed to step down from leadership over the territory and relinquish governance to a transitional body of Palestinian technocrats, which would be overseen by an international body, dubbed the \"Board of Peace.\" This body is expected to be headed by Trump, with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also named as a possible member of the oversight body.",
      "Noting the plan aboard the Air Force One on Monday en route to Israel, Trump said he first wanted to find out whether \"Tony would be popular with all.\"",
      "\"I like Tony, I\u2019ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he\u2019s an acceptable choice to everybody,\" he added.",
      "The idea of Blair joining the board has already drawn early criticism, with his reputation in the region shadowed by his decision to back the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2014 and claims by the U.S. and Britain of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction found to be false.",
      "Trump optimistic",
      "Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way to Israel on Monday, Trump said he believed \"everybody is happy\" with his 20-point peace plan.",
      "Noting that much of Gaza now resembles a \"demolition site\" after more than two years of Israel's offensive in the enclave, Trump said cleanup efforts would begin \"pretty much immediately.\"",
      "During his address to the Knesset, Trump also said Israel has won all it can by force.",
      "\u201cNow, it is time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East,\u201d he said.",
      "In Gaza, Palestinians across the enclave balanced their hopes for peace against fears that the ceasefire won't hold, as many return to the areas where their homes once stood.",
      "\"Everything is gone; no necessities of life remain,\" one man told NBC News.",
      "\"So, why do you live for? Our money, our homes that we worked hard for years \u2014 it\u2019s all gone,\" he said. \"Nothing is left.\""

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Wait 'til next year.",
      "The public push to make Donald Trump the winner of the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize began within hours of the committee\u2019s announcement Friday that the honoree this year is Maria Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader.",
      "Snubbed by the Nobel selection committee, Trump should be the clear front-runner for the prize next year, given the breakthrough he reached toward ending the war in Gaza, his supporters said.",
      "Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., said Friday he would introduce a resolution in Congress saying Trump deserves the honor.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll be a strong candidate next year, and he should have been a slam dunk this year, but unfortunately, the committee got it wrong,\u201d Carter said in an interview. \u201cBut they made their decision. So, next year they\u2019ll have an opportunity to make up for it.\u201d",
      "Jason Miller, a former senior Trump campaign official, told NBC News: \u201cThe legacy of the Nobel Peace Prize will be irreparably damaged if it isn\u2019t awarded to President Trump in 2026. The voices calling for President Trump to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2026 are only going to get louder.\u201d",
      "Few voices were louder than Trump\u2019s in making the case that he\u2019d earned the award this year. The president mounted a rare public campaign to win it based on seven peace deals he says he reached in global hotspots.",
      "He is inching closer to an eighth. A whirlwind bout of U.S.-led diplomacy has culminated in a ceasefire in Gaza. Hamas militants may release the remaining hostages early next week. And Trump plans to fly to the region this weekend to sign the accord and deliver a speech to the Israeli parliament.",
      "Trump has long said he didn\u2019t expect the five-member Norwegian selection committee to give him the award. The betting markets saw it the same way. Early this week, Polymarket, a prediction betting site, had put his odds of winning at 2%.",
      "The deadline for nominating people for the Nobel Prize was Jan. 31 \u2014 11 days into Trump\u2019s new term. Still, the committee was free to consider accomplishments that came later in the year as it winnowed down the candidates, said Nina Graeger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, who handicaps the top candidates for the prize.",
      "\u201cWill you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not,\u201d Trump told an audience of generals and admirals last week. \u201cThey\u2019ll give it to some guy that didn\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d",
      "But he believed it would be advantageous to strike the Middle East peace deal before the committee revealed the winner, a person who has been in meetings with him said. That way, Trump could make the argument that the committee process was \u201crigged\u201d; a president who ended so many conflicts rightly should have gotten the award that celebrates peace, this person said.",
      "Shortly after the winner was announced, Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, posted on social media that \u201cThe Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.\u201d",
      "Much can happen in a year\u2019s time. If the peace deal in Gaza doesn\u2019t hold \u2014 if the fighting resumes and more Gazans die in the crossfire \u2014 Trump isn\u2019t likely to get credit for raising false hopes that peace was at hand, foreign policy analysts say.",
      "The committee will want to see if the peace deal that Trump describes as an historic triumph is real or ephemeral.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the peace plan will be sustainable and lasting,\u201d Graeger said. \u201cHe definitely should get credit for his efforts to end the war and really engaging with this process. But there are a lot of hurdles in the implementation of the plan.\u201d",
      "A second issue is whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president chooses to work more collaboratively with other nations over the coming year. In creating the prize, Swedish inventor and entrepreneur Alfred Nobel held that the winner should be someone who has \u201cdone the most or the best work for fraternity between nations,\u201d among other criteria.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help Trump\u2019s chances that he threatened to acquire Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal, analysts said. Nor is the committee likely to reward him for pulling out of such cross-border endeavors as the Paris climate agreement or the World Health Organization, they said.",
      "K\u00e5re Aas, Norway\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S., said that Trump would be a \u201cstrong contender\u201d for the prize if he ends the Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas wars. Still, the president wouldn\u2019t be a shoo-in, he added.",
      "Trump\u2019s statements about absorbing Greenland and Canada \u201cwould also be considered by the committee,\u201d Aas said. \u201cThe committee doesn\u2019t necessarily give him the Nobel Peace Prize if there\u2019s peace in Gaza and Ukraine next year.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Prince William has fought back tears during an emotional conversation with a woman who lost her husband to suicide, in a video released by Kensington Palace Friday.",
      "William, 43, was speaking to campaigner Rhian Mannings at her home in south Wales. Mannings lost her one-year-old son, George suddenly in 2012 to an undiagnosed illness. Five days later, her husband Paul died by suicide. Mannings said Paul blamed himself for their son's death.",
      "Mannings has since used her experience to launch a charity aimed at supporting parents who suffer the loss of a child or young adult.",
      "The video was released on World Mental Health Day to highlight suicide prevention efforts. The Prince and Princess of Wales\u2019 Royal Foundation is launching a new National Suicide Prevention Network, aiming to bring charities together to transform suicide prevention in the U.K. Manning\u2019s charity 2Wish will be part of the network. According to statistics cited in the video, someone in the U.K. dies by suicide every 90 minutes.",
      "\u201cI will forever go over those last few days with him wondering what I missed,\" Mannings says about her Paul's suicide. \"We were just so happy and I think this just shows it really can happen to anyone.\u201d",
      "William, the heir to the throne, asked Mannings what she would say to her late husband if she could.",
      "\u201cI would just like to sit him down like this and just say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t you come to me?\u2019 Because he\u2019s missed out on just so much joy, and we would have been OK. And I think that\u2019s what the hardest thing is, we would have been OK,\u201d Mannings tells William, who then becomes visibly emotional.",
      "\"Are you OK?\" Mannings asks the prince, who takes time to gather himself before continuing. \"It's hard to ask these questions,\" William says.",
      "\u201cThe best way to prevent suicide is to talk about it. Talk about it early, talk about it with your loved ones, those you trust, your friends,\u201d William says."

    "summary": "The previous ceasefire lasted from Jan. 19 to March 18, when Israel resumed military operations in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "The Israeli government approved the first part of the peace plan to end the conflict in Gaza, after a brutal two-year war that has ravaged the Palestinian enclave and sparked a global outcry, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said early on Friday local time.",
      "\u201cThe government has just now approved the framework for the release of all of the hostages \u2014 the living and the deceased,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement posted on X.",
      "Under the terms of the deal, the ceasefire should take effect within 24 hours.",
      "President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he plans to travel to Egypt for an official signing of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas and that hostages will be released \u201con Monday or Tuesday.\u201d",
      "Trump's announcement on Wednesday that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal was widely welcomed Thursday by world leaders, the families of hostages and Palestinians who have endured more than two years of war.",
      "But huge questions remain about whether Trump's 20-point plan can successfully resolve the long-term future of the Gaza Strip, with uncertainty over its directive for Hamas to disband, as well as the governance of the shattered enclave.",
      "A spokesperson for Netanyahu's office said Thursday that a ceasefire would take effect 24 hours after the Cabinet had agreed on the deal and hostages would be released after 72 hours.",
      "Separately, the United States military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support stabilization in Gaza and the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into the enclave, two U.S. officials familiar with the planning said.",
      "The U.S. troops will stay in Israel, where they will support logistics, transportation, engineering and planning, the officials said.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "While the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appeared imminent, explosions were seen and heard in southern Gaza on Thursday morning.",
      "Trump said Wednesday on social media that the sides had taken the \"first steps toward a strong, durable, and everlasting peace,\" calling it \"a GREAT Day for the Arab and Muslim World, Israel, all surrounding nations, and the United States of America.\"",
      "Among those to welcome the announcement was United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who urged \"all concerned to abide fully by the terms of the agreement\" and described it as a \"momentous opportunity\" to recognize \"the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas \"praised the great efforts made by President Trump and all mediators to reach this agreement.\"",
      "Netanyahu said he had \"a very moving and warm conversation\" with Trump in which they \"congratulated each other on the historic achievement of signing the agreement to release all the hostages,\" his office said in a statement.",
      "\"If indeed this deal can hold, it'll bring in an era of peace that we haven't seen now in the Middle East for several years, ever since that terrible attack on Oct. 7,\" Col. Steve Warren, former principal deputy chief of public affairs at the Pentagon, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The plan could come with a political cost for Netanyahu inside Israel. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel\u2019s far-right national security minister, said Thursday on X that his party will \u201cbring down the government\u201d unless Hamas is \u201cdismantled.\u201d",
      "Celebrations and cautious optimism",
      "The announcement came after indirect talks involving Israel, Hamas and Steve Witkoff, U.S. ambassador at large, and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
      "Trump announced the breakthrough one day after the second  anniversary of the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 were killed and another 250 were kidnapped, and the start of Israel's war on Gaza in which more than 67,000 people \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 have been killed, according to local health officials.",
      "While many governments defended Israel's initial right to respond to the attack, the scale of civilian death and suffering wrought by its war have drawn increasing international condemnation and isolation for the Jewish state. Last month, the United Kingdom became the latest Western nation to recognize Palestine as a state, joining a majority of countries that now do so worldwide.",
      "Much of Gaza is now a rubble-strewn wasteland, with most of its buildings damaged or destroyed, according to the U.N. And the world's leading body on hunger, Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, has declared that a famine is now playing out inside the cramped territory.",
      "Israel's military operation has been deemed a genocide by a U.N. commission of inquiry, the world-leading International Association of Genocide Scholars, and human rights groups such as Amnesty International. Israel denies the charge, saying it is only attempting to destroy Hamas, which it blames for putting Palestinians in harm's way.",
      "After news arrived that the first ceasefire phase had been agreed to, some Palestinians on the ground inside Gaza were celebrating \u2014 cheering, dancing and singing, video showed.",
      "The first phase of Trump's deal would see the return of the remaining 48 hostages, around 20 of whom are believed to be alive, while the Israeli military said it was poised to withdraw from Gaza to an agreed-upon line.",
      "Trump told reporters that while the administration knows where most of the hostages believed to be alive are, finding the bodies of deceased hostages could be a \u201cbigger problem.\u201d",
      "An international force tasked with finding missing hostages in the Gaza Strip will be established as part of the ceasefire and hostage release deal, Israeli broadcaster i24 reported, citing Israeli officials.",
      "There were celebrations in \"Hostages Square\" in Tel Aviv early Thursday, the culmination of two years in which families and friends of the remaining captives have angrily campaigned for their government to prioritize their loved ones over the continuation of the conflict.",
      "They could be heard in video chanting \"Nobel prize to Trump\" \u2014 a reference to Trump's long-standing ambition to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which is being announced Friday.",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of Israeli hostages, said its members were feeling \"a mix of excitement, anticipation, and concern\" at the news. It expressed its \"profound gratitude to President Trump and his team for the leadership and determination that led to this historic breakthrough: an end to the war and a comprehensive agreement to return all the hostages.\"",
      "Ruby Chen, father of hostage Itay Chen, a U.S.-Israeli dual citizen, said on \"Stay Tuned NOW\" that while he shared this cautious hope, the captors had not \u201cprovided any sign of life\" for his son.",
      "Lasting agreement unclear",
      "While Hamas has agreed to participate in the hostage and prisoner exchange, it has not said it will disarm and disband \u2014 a key stipulation of Trump's proposal.",
      "A senior Hamas official, Osama Hamdan, said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Thursday that no Palestinians would surrender their weapons, though he did not explain whether that was the group\u2019s official position.",
      "Prominent Palestinian prisoner Marwan Barghouti, whose supporters dub the \u201cPalestinian Nelson Mandela,\u201d will not be released as part of a ceasefire agreement, Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian told reporters Thursday.",
      "The first phase also does not address Gaza's medium and long-term future. Trump's plan says the enclave should be temporarily governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee\" overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" led by Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. That is until the Palestinian Authority, the chief political organ in the region, can be \"reformed.\"",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it was moving to \"adjusted deployment lines soon\" but warned that parts of Gaza were \"still considered a dangerous combat zone\" and that its troops were \"deployed and operating anywhere in the Strip.\"",
      "Israel shattered the previous ceasefire \u2014 which lasted from Jan. 19 to March 18 \u2014 by launching a barrage of deadly airstrikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip, ending two months of relative calm and plunging Gaza into a renewed humanitarian crisis.",
      "Israel blamed Hamas for the resumption of hostilities, citing the militant group\u2019s refusal to meet Israel\u2019s demand to release more hostages."
