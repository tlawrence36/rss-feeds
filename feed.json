      "The papers of composer and songwriter Burt Bacharach are being donated to the Library of Congress",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Burt Bacharach, one of the most celebrated and popular composers and songwriters of the 20th century, will have his papers donated to the Library of Congress.",
      "Bacharach's widow Jane Bacharach, who made the donation, and the Library of Congress, announced the acquisition in a statement Thursday.",
      "The collection includes thousands of music scores and parts, including his arrangement of \u201cThe Look of Love,\u201d and musical sketches for songs including \u201cAlfie\u201d and \u201cRaindrops Keep Falling on My Head.\u201d",
      "Bacharach delighted millions in the 1960s and '70s with those and other quirky and unforgettable melodies including \u201cWalk on By,\u201d \u201cDo You Know the Way to San Jose,\u201d \u201cClose to You\u201d and dozens of other hits.",
      "The Grammy, Oscar and Tony winner died last year at age 94.",
      "Jane Bacharach said in a statement that she chose the institution because Burt Bacharach and songwriting partner Hal David received the Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song in 2012, and Bacharach valued it above all his other awards. It's the first time the library has acquired a collection from one of its Gershwin recipients.",
      "\u201cBurt poured his heart and soul into his music, and we are so proud that the Library will give others the opportunity to visit and enjoy his legacy,\u201d her statement said.",
      "The collection will become available for researchers in the summer of 2025.",
      "\u201cThe Library is proud to be entrusted with ensuring Bacharach\u2019s music and legacy will remain accessible for future generations, in hopes of inspiring them with his creativity and distinctly American musical genius,\u201d Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden said in statement.",
      "Bacharach's papers will join the collected manuscripts and papers of Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Lerner and Loewe, Billy Strayhorn, Leonard Bernstein and Henry Mancini at the library."

    "summary": "It seemed like bad satire, or yet another conspiracy theory",
    "story": [
      "It seemed like bad satire, or yet another conspiracy theory",
      "Headlines from the satirical website the Onion on Thursday: \u201cNew Dating Site Suggests People You Already Know But Thought You Were Too Good For.\u201d \u201cTrump Boys Have Slap Fight Over Who Gets to Run Foreign Policy Meetings.\u201d \u201cHere's Why I Decided to Buy Infowars.\u201d",
      "Only one has the ring of truth. Sort of.",
      "The bylined author of the Infowars article, Bryce P. Tetraeder, doesn't actually exist. And the Onion doesn't plan to invest in business school scholarships for promising cult leaders.",
      "But the Onion's purchase of Alex Jones' conspiracy-theory-saturated media empire at a bankruptcy auction tied to lawsuits by the families of Sandy Hook shooting victims is very real \u2014 an effort to fight falsehoods with funny and a who'd-have-thunk-it development in an already somewhat unbelievable year. An element of doubt was added late Thursday when the judge in Jones' bankruptcy case ordered a hearing for next week on how the auction was conducted.",
      "On Thursday, The Onion immediately shut down Infowars and said it plans to relaunch it in January as a parody of conspiracy theorists.",
      "\u201cOur goal in a couple of years is for people to think of Infowars as the funniest and dumbest website that exists,\u201d said Ben Collins, the Onion's CEO. \u201cIt was previously the dumbest website that exists.\u201d",
      "The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, was backed by Sandy Hook families, who were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in lawsuits against Jones for his false claims that the 2012 shootings at a Connecticut elementary school werex a hoax.",
      "The new Infowars will be a satire of theories Jones advanced, which themselves were so absurd that they could have seemed satirical if they hadn't caused real-life harm. The development ends one tentacle of a loose network of podcasters, TikTok influencers and others whose content keeps people perpetually provoked and enraged, Collins said. He called Jones one small character in a universe of fear-based media.",
      "\u201cThey've had a free pass to this point and we don't think that's fair,\u201d he said.",
      "At the very least, he said, the Onion hopes to return some fun to the Internet to offset years of doomscrolling.",
      "In Collins, who once covered misinformation for NBC News, the new venture has a leader uniquely suited to what is being attempted, said Dale Beran, who made this year's Netflix documentary, \u201cThe Anti-Social Network,\u201d about the topic.",
      "The Onion, founded as a newspaper in 1988, has gone through several ownership changes and was purchased earlier this year by a group that includes Jeff Lawson, co-founder of the software company Twilio. Since then, Beran said, it \u201cfeels like there is new life breathed into it.\"",
      "Done well, a satirical site on conspiracy theories and those who traffic in them could meet a historical moment much like comedian Stephen Colbert did when his Comedy Central show, \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d mocked pompous conservative television talk show hosts a decade and more ago.",
      "And what will happen when some of Jones' casual fans who didn't follow the news of the bankruptcy auction log on to Infowars in a few months only to find the Onion's new creation? Probably not much, said Beran, who suggested it's unlikely there's much overlap between people attracted by conspiracy theories and those who want to mock them.",
      "Indeed, conspiracy theories about the Onion's purchase of Infowars began popping up online only hours after it was announced.",
      "\u201cThere's no chance this outlet which hasn't been relevant in years was able to afford this purchase on their own. Who was really behind this?\u201d the website Zeee Media, which bills itself as \u201cone of the most trusted, uncensored sources of information in Australia,\u201d posted on X.",
      "Jones himself hurriedly posted a video aimed at his fans on Thursday. \u201cThis is a total attack on free speech,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deep state is completely out of control.\u201d",
      "There is an impact any time a prominent website that traffics in misinformation is shut down. Still, the business model of reaching people who want to be enraged is still viable, Beran said. Another expert in misinformation suggested Jones will quickly move on, and his fans will move with him.",
      "\u201cAs long as there are people willing to tune in, he will find new outlets,\u201d said Yotam Ophir, head of the Media Effects, Misinformation and Extremism Lab at the University of Buffalo. \u201cIf anything, the Onion trolling and the court cases against him will just make some of his most dedicated fans even more sure of his righteousness, seeing him as a martyr for free speech.\u201d",
      "At the very least, the Onion purchase offered a moment of zen for liberals who have had a pretty rough week or so following Donald Trump's election victory and the GOP sweep in Congress.",
      "\u201cThis is bad karma turned good,\u201d wrote Timothy W. Larson, who describes himself on X as a \u201cunabashed progressive.\" \u201cI love it.\u201d",

      "Levin told him the lawsuit should be tossed in its entirety. He said ruling in favor of the claims made in McSweeney's lawsuit \u201cwould kill\u201d some television and Broadway stage shows if the First Amendment did not protect the producers of shows.",

      "\u201cWhat are the limits a director can do to induce the behavior the director wants?\u201d the judge asked as he questioned whether a director could demand that show participants not sleep for two days before filming or subject themselves to a physical assault just before they go on camera.",
      "Levin said there were limits to First Amendment protection for the creators of a communicative show, but he said they were narrow in scope. McSweeney's lawsuit, he said, did not fall within the narrow exceptions, such as when a producer might commit a criminal felony offense during the production of a show."

      "The state that gave much of America the right to offer legal sports betting may decide that certain bets on college athletes are out of bounds",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- After an unexpected loss in which he threw four interceptions in September, Auburn quarterback Payton Thorne heard from bettors angry that his subpar statistics lost bets for them. Some contacted him over the Venmo cash transfer app, asking him to refund their losses.",
      "In March, North Carolina basketball player Armando Bacot said he got over 100 direct messages on social media from angry gamblers when he did not make enough rebounds for their bets to win.",
      "Now the state whose U.S. Supreme Court victory led to an explosion of legal sports betting across America is considering banning such bets involving the statistical performance of college athletes.",
      "New Jersey argues that student athletes are more accessible and thus more vulnerable to pressure and harassment than professional players, given that they eat in the same dining halls, live in the same dorms and attend classes with many other students.",
      "\u201cNot all of what has come from the legalization of sports betting has been positive,\u201d said state Sen. Kristin Corrado.",
      "A bill before the state Legislature would ban so-called proposition bets, commonly known as \u201cprops,\u201d on what a particular athlete does or doesn't do in a game. That can include how many touchdowns a quarterback throws, how many yards a running back accumulates, or how many rebounds a basketball player collects.",
      "Austin Mayo, assistant director of government relations for the NCAA, said 1 in 3 players in sports that are heavily bet on have reported receiving harassment from gamblers.",
      "The association wants such bets prohibited nationwide. If it passes the bill, New Jersey would join 13 other states that ban college prop bets, according to the American Gaming Association: Ohio, Maryland, Vermont, Louisiana, Arizona, Colorado, Massachusetts, Oregon, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.",
      "But Bill Pascrell III, a lobbyist for numerous gambling and sports-betting companies, said there has not been a demonstrable level of serious harm from college prop bets, which he said constitute 2% to 4% of the legal sports betting industry.",
      "\u201cWhen we ban any type of bet, particularly those that had been legalized, we're pushing the bettor to the black market,\u201d he said.",
      "New Jersey allows betting on college games but prohibits it on teams from New Jersey or on games from out-of-state teams that are physically played in New Jersey.",
      "Pascrell said that the recent tournament success of New Jersey colleges Seton Hall and St. Peter's were bet on, either with illegal offshore internet sites, or legally by gamblers traveling to other states where it is permitted.",
      "The bill was approved and released from an Assembly committee Thursday. It still must be approved by both full chambers of the Legislature and signed by Gov. Phil Murphy to become law.",
      "New Jersey's lawsuit challenging a ban on legal sports betting in all but four U.S. states led to a 2018 Supreme Court ruling allowing any state in the nation to offer it; 38 currently do, and Missouri will soon become the 39th.",

      "BLOOMINGTON, Indiana -- When composer Mason Bates approached Michael Chabon about turning his novel \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\u201d into an opera, he said the writer told him frankly that \u201copera was not his thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was very supportive of the endeavor and he gave it his blessing, but he said he couldn\u2019t be involved,\u201d Bates recalled. \u201cHe was really more giving it a thumbs-up on a rights level.\u201d",
      "So Bates and librettist Gene Scheer proceeded on their own to wrangle into operatic form Chabon\u2019s sprawling, Pulitzer Prize-winning tale about two young Jewish cousins set over more than a decade before and after World War II.",
      "Now, six years after Bates first read the novel and became inspired by it, the opera is bound for the Metropolitan Opera, due to open the company\u2019s next season in September 2025.",
      "But first it\u2019s having its world premiere on Friday in what might seem an unlikely spot, at the Jacobs School of Music on the Indiana University campus in Bloomington. The premiere was originally planned for the Los Angeles Opera, but the company begged off, citing the costs involved.",
      "Bloomington turns out to be not such a surprising choice given that the school has nearly 300 voice students and the Musical Arts Center, built in 1972, was modeled after the Met stage.",
      "\u201cThe space and technology and those kinds of production elements were very attractive to the Met in terms of how the opera would play here,\u201d said Catherine Compton, managing director of the school\u2019s opera and ballet theater program.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been heartening to see how our students have reacted and been elevated by the Met\u2019s creative team that\u2019s been in residence here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd also how the creative team has been able to adapt their process to our students.\u201d",
      "In fact, Met staff will be back in Bloomington in January to workshop another forthcoming commission, an opera by Carlos Simon called \u201cIn the Rush\u201d with a libretto by playwright Lynn Nottage and her daughter, Ruby Aiyo Gerber.",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay\u201d was commissioned by the Met after Peter Gelb, the company\u2019s general manager, attended a performance of Bates\u2019 first opera, \u201cThe (R)evolution of Steve Jobs,\u201d in 2017 in Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Paul Cremo, the Met\u2019s dramaturg, connected Bates with Scheer, a veteran librettist widely praised for his work in turning Herman Melville\u2019s unwieldy masterpiece \u201cMoby Dick\u201d into the text for an opera composed by Jake Heggie. The Met will perform that opera next March.",
      "\u201cI give \u2018Moby Dick\u2019 to new librettists for a model of how to get to the essence,\u201d Cremo said. \u201c\u2018Kavalier & Clay\u2019 goes down a lot of side roads into history and nooks and crannies. I figured we needed somebody who gets how to adapt and condense a book into an opera.\u201d",
      "With many of the \u201cnooks and crannies\u201d \u2014 like a 40-page detour to Antarctica \u2014 stripped away, Scheer was able to focus on the two main characters.",
      "There\u2019s Joe Kavalier, who escapes to America from Czechoslovakia on the eve of the Holocaust, dreams of bringing his younger brother to safety in America, and falls in love with Rosa, a Bohemian artist. His cousin is the Brooklyn-born Sammy Clay, who dreams of striking it rich and, ambivalent about his sexuality, has a thwarted love affair with a handsome actor.",
      "Together, using Sammy\u2019s talent for story-telling and Joe\u2019s artistic genius, the cousins invent a wildly popular comic strip character called The Escapist.",
      "Scheer and Bates identified three distinct worlds depicted in the novel, each of which lent itself to a different compositional style.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the world of World War II, where we see the Kavalier family picked off one by one,\u201d Bates said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dark musical space with a lot of drums and mandolins. Then the big band music of 1940s New York, a lot of swing, a lot of jazz. Then when they start to draw and they create art, we go into this electro-acoustic, techno-symphonic space.\u201d",
      "Bates said he deliberately keeps these sound worlds separate at first, but \u201cwhat becomes really exciting in the opera is that as Joe goes through kinds of a psychedelic spiral, these worlds start to collide and smash together.\u201d",
      "Keeping these worlds visually separate and then merging them posed both a challenge and an opportunity for director Bart Sher, who worked on the set design with 59 Productions, a company known for its innovative use of projections and animation.",
      "\u201cThe unique challenge to \u2018Kavalier & Clay\u2019 is the simultaneity of space and time,\u201d Sher said. \u201cYou might see them working in the office of Empire Toys and at the same time see their family struggling in Prague, and at the same time see them try to capture what the experience is like through The Escapist.",
      "\u201cAnd if you can get all three of those elements to work at the same time and have music and song \u2014 then you really have something in this piece that I think is very special.\u201d",

      "Since a trip to Ethiopia in 1985 during the famine, Curtis has also devoted much of his time and energy to charitable causes: Co-founding Comic Relief, producing Red Nose Day for years and helping create organizations like Make Poverty History and more. Decades of work has helped raise more than $2 billion and supported over 170 million people.",
      "On Sunday he\u2019s being celebrated for those efforts by the film academy with the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award. Getting an Oscar is especially exciting for Curtis who remembers as a teen having to wait until the night after to watch the broadcast in the U.K.",
      "\u201cI've been excited by their existence for 50 years,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is particularly a special award, but it\u2019s not work for which one expects praise or needs praise. So it\u2019s very lovely.\u201d",
      "Curtis spoke to The Associated Press about his second career, the state of romantic comedies and Hugh Grant\u2019s second act. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "CURTIS: No, it\u2019s been one of those cascading things. I have always found that if you create a sort of venue for generosity, the public reaction is so often astonishing. When did this first TV show, we thought we\u2019d make \u00a35 million, but we made \u00a315 million. The next year we made \u00a327 million. I would have had to be a monster not to continue with it. I thought it was going to last a year. Instead, it\u2019s lasted a lifetime.",
      "CURTIS: We have a younger generation that is very passionate about issues of gender and diversity and climate. There\u2019s a more sophisticated understanding of how you solve problems and change things. A lot of it is about giving power to people on the ground. And particularly since the pandemic, it\u2019s important to go on pointing out how much difference a small amount of money can make abroad and at home.",
      "CURTIS: I don\u2019t see the things as different. What is slightly peculiar is that I have written two very serious movies, one about malaria and the other about the negotiation of a G8 (summit). But when doing my own films, I\u2019ve focused more on private romantic things and not gone all out on the stuff that I do the charity work for.",
      "CURTIS: I\u2019m a bit puzzled by it. I can\u2019t but sort of think it\u2019s almost a lucky break. I remember once bumping into Chris Rock, who I had never met, and he said to me, \u201cI like your films because they\u2019ve got man jokes in them.\u201d I think he was saying that the sentiment is repeatedly either undercut or reinforced by jokes that you don\u2019t quite expect. There must be something in that combination that makes feel people feel comfortable with the heart of it.",
      "CURTIS: I think all of these things go in waves. There are two shows on telly at the moment, \u201cNobody Wants This\u201d and \u201cColin from Accounts\u201d that I really love. \u201c(500) Days of Summer\u201d was a long time ago but I adored that. And it wasn\u2019t a comedy but \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d I think when you look back, you\u2019ll find there\u2019s a consistent stream of movies that deal with those issues, just not in quite the same format.",
      "CURTIS: Very much. With regard to Hugh now, no acting required. He was always a scoundrel. I think it\u2019s easier for him. He had to work harder in my movies when he was pretending to be nice. Now he\u2019s a self-evident psychopath. I\u2019m obviously joking but I love them. There were 10 years there where no one took any risks with Hugh. And it\u2019s lovely now that people are casting him in very different roles. I hope he does one or two movies more in line with what we used to do. He\u2019s a very interesting older man. But I\u2019m loving his current tendency to kill people.",
      "CURTIS: It has been a very schizophrenic life, in the end. It has been 50/50 for about the last 15 years. It\u2019s interesting thinking about how movies can affect change \u2014 the work of Participant and the idea that you could turn films into something with a real-world impact. I believe hugely in the ability of movies to change people\u2019s hearts and minds and attitudes. I do think that that might be worth us all thinking about is whether movies should have impact producers \u2014 a mechanism that actually tries to make the film as effective as possible in the real world. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve started to think about in joining the two halves of my life together."

      "On her debut solo record \u201cWhat a Relief,\u201d released last month on Phoebe Bridgers\u2019 Saddest Factory Records, Gavin channels a bluesy, nostalgic tone to explore intimacy, grief and intergenerational trauma. The lyrics are spare and reflect heartfelt \u2014 and at times earnest \u2014 realizations about pain and self-discovery. Created over seven years, the album is, as Gavin said, a testament to \u201chow much we change and stay the same\u201d over time.",

To celebrate the release of Gavin's album, Muna fan groups organized listening parties at lesbian bars like The Ruby Fruit in Los Angeles and Ginger\u2019s Bar in Brooklyn, New York.",

      "The process of opening myself up to new people \u2014 to work creatively \u2014 is very vulnerable.",
      "Gavin: It\u2019s a fun song. It feels young. It feels very much in the world of crush and fantasy. Which is one of my favorite kinds of pop songs to write.",
      "The solo project is, by nature, a very measured project. I\u2019m not really making these big, bold, sweeping pop statements. It\u2019s quite small and nuanced. My solo project is very \u201cif you know, you know.\u201d",
      "Gavin: It was amazing. I mean, she is a legend to me.",
      "There was a photo that she had taken \u2014 on view at Regen Projects \u2014 of a recent girlfriend in a bedroom with a bunch of stuff strewn everywhere. That photo was on every mood board and every treatment that I made for this album. It was the wallpaper on my computer. I was just like, \u201cThis is the vibe.\u201d",
      "Gavin: There are certain artists that I avoid listening to, if I notice that they really stick to me. I couldn\u2019t really write like Tori (Amos) or Fiona (Apple), even if I really tried super hard to emulate them, so I\u2019m not that worried about it. I\u2019m not a prodigious piano player, so it\u2019s going to be fine, you know what I mean?",
      "I mainly do listen to lesbians or lesbian-adjacent women from the \u201990s.",

There\u2019s something very poetic about the solo tour for this record putting me back in Chicago in the winter. Really brutal. We\u2019re doing it in a van, and I haven\u2019t been back in a van, you know, in a minute.",

      "I would love for queer people and girls at that age to find something in this record and to attach to it. The music that I listened to when I was 14 and 15 is so important to me. Those are my comfort records.",
      "Gavin: Sometimes you have to disappoint people who want the creative direction to go a certain way ... But if you know in your heart that your vision is different, then you have to follow your vision.",
      "Being an artist does require a lot of sacrifice. Like, I don\u2019t have the same stability in my personal life and domestic life because of my job. But I wouldn\u2019t want to do anything else."

      "Former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor Nathan Chasing Horse is scheduled to stand trial on Jan. 13 in Las Vegas",
      "LAS VEGAS -- Former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor Nathan Chasing Horse is set to stand trial early next year in Las Vegas on charges that he sexually abused Indigenous women and girls, a significant development in the sweeping criminal case after more than a year of stalled court proceedings while he challenged it.",
      "His trial in Clark County District Court is currently scheduled to begin on Jan. 13, court records show. He pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to 21 felonies, including sexual assault, kidnapping and producing and possessing videos of child sexual abuse, KLAS-TV in Las Vegas reported.",
      "Prosecutors are now able to move forward with their case because Chasing Horse was again indicted last month following a Nevada Supreme Court decision that his original indictment be dismissed. The high court's order left open the possibility for the charges to be refiled, and prosecutors quickly took their case before another grand jury.",
      "The high court said in its September order that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence of Chasing Horse's alleged crimes without any expert testimony. But the justices also made clear in their ruling that their decision was not weighing in on Chasing Horse's guilt or innocence, saying the allegations against him are serious.",
      "Best known for portraying the character Smiles A Lot in the 1990 movie \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, which is home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.",
      "After starring in the Oscar-winning film, according to prosecutors, Chasing Horse began promoting himself as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies.",
      "Prosecutors said he used his authority to gain access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest in January near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since.",
      "Chasing Horse's arrest reverberated around Indian Country as law enforcement in the U.S. and Canada quickly followed up with more criminal charges. In Montana, authorities there said his arrest helped corroborate long-standing allegations against him on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation. Tribal leaders banished Chasing Horse from the reservation in 2015 amid allegations of human trafficking.",
      "His latest indictment in Las Vegas includes new allegations that Chasing Horse filmed himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. Prosecutors have said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, was found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos."

      "The purchase of Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars at a bankruptcy auction by the satirical news publication The Onion is the latest twist in a yearslong saga",
      "The purchase of Alex Jones ' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction by the satirical news publication The Onion is the latest twist in a yearslong saga between the far-right conspiracy theorist and families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims.",
      "The sale was ordered after relatives of many of the 20 children and six educators killed in the 2012 shooting successfully sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress. Jones repeatedly made false claims on his show that the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Here are some things to know about how Jones' misinformation empire ended up on the auction block.",
      "Fresh out of high school in the early 1990s, Jones, a barrel-chested, gravelly voiced Texas native, started broadcasting on a public-access television channel in the state capital. From the start, Jones promoted conspiracies about the U.S. government and false claims about a secret New World Order.",
      "In 2004, Jones had two employees and a tiny office in south Austin. In 2007, he formed Free Speech Systems, to run his growing media business, according to court records in his bankruptcy cases. By 2010, Jones had over 60 employees.",
      "As the outlandish nature of his false claims grew, so did his media empire, with annual revenues of up to $80 million, and a fanbase that at his height listened to him on more than 100 radio stations across the United States as well as through his Infowars website and social media.",
      "Jones has acknowledged in court that he promoted the conspiracy theory that the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax perpetrated in part by the U.S. government as part of an effort to expand gun control. He called the parents of slain children \u201ccrisis actors\u201d on his show and said the shooting was \u201cphony as a three-dollar bill.\u201d",
      "After separate defamation lawsuits were filed in Connecticut and Texas by family members of victims, Jones acknowledged in 2022 that the shooting was \u201c100% real\u201d and said it was \u201cabsolutely irresponsible\u201d to call it a hoax.",
      "Victims\u2019 families who sued Jones said they were subjected to years of torment, threats and abuse by people who believed the lies told on his show.",
      "Courts in Texas and Connecticut found Jones liable for defamation for his portrayal of the Sandy Hook massacre as a hoax and awarded the families nearly $1.5 billion in damages. In both states, the judges issued default judgments finding Jones liable without trials because he failed to respond to court orders and turn over many documents. Juries then heard evidence and decided on the amount of damages, with judges tacking on additional penalties.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment. Up for sale was everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras.",
      "The Onion acquired Infowars' website; social media accounts; studio in Austin, Texas; trademarks; and video archive. The sale price was not disclosed.",
      "After the sale was announced, Infowars\u2019 website was down and Jones was broadcasting from what he said was a new studio location.",
      "Jones vowed to challenge the sale and auction process in court, and late Thursday a federal judge ordered a hearing into exactly how The Onion won the bidding. Lawyers for Jones and a company affiliated with Infowars alleged the trustee overseeing the auction changed the bidding process just days before it was held."

      "The satirical news publication The Onion was named the winning bidder for Alex Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction Thursday, backed by families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims whom Jones owes more than $1 billion in defamation judgments for calling the massacre a hoax.",
      "The purchase would turn over Jones\u2019 company, which for decades has peddled in conspiracy and misinformation, to a humor website that plans to relaunch the Infowars platform in January as a parody. But the judge in Jones\u2019 bankruptcy case said Thursday that he had concerns about how the auction was conducted and ordered a hearing for next week after complaints by lawyers for Jones and a company affiliated with Jones that put in a $3.5 million bid.",
      "Within hours of the announcement about The Onion's winning bid, Infowars\u2019 website was down and Jones was broadcasting from what he said was a new studio location. Up for sale were Infowars\u2019 website; social media accounts; studio in Austin, Texas; trademarks; video archive; and other assets.",
      "\u201cThe dissolution of Alex Jones\u2019 assets and the death of Infowars is the justice we have long awaited and fought for,\u201d Robbie Parker, whose daughter Emilie was killed in the 2012 shooting in Connecticut, said in a statement provided by his lawyers.",
      "The satirical outlet \u2014 which carries the banner of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Finest News Source\u201d on its masthead \u2014 was founded in the 1980s and for decades has skewered politics and pop culture, including making Jones a frequent target of mocking articles. Mass shootings in the U.S., such as the Sandy Hook attack, are often followed by The Onion publishing slightly updated versions of one of its most well-known recurring pieces: \"'No Way to Prevent This,' Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.\u201d",
      "On his live broadcast, Jones was angry and defiant, calling the sale \u201ca total attack on free speech.\u201d He later announced his show was being shut down. Jones then resumed his broadcast from a new studio nearby and carried it live on his accounts on X.",
      "At a court hearing Thursday afternoon in Houston, the trustee who oversaw the auction, Christopher Murray, acknowledged that The Onion did not have the highest bid but said it was a better deal overall because some of the Sandy Hook families agreed to forgo a portion of the sale proceeds to pay Jones' other creditors. First United American Companies, a business affiliated with one of Jones\u2019 product-selling websites, submitted the only other bid. The trustee said he could not put a dollar amount on The Onion\u2019s bid.",
      "Walter Cicack, an attorney for First United American Companies, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez that Murray changed the auction process only days before, deciding not to hold a round Wednesday where parties could outbid each other. Sealed bids were submitted last week, and the trustee chose only from those, Cicack said.",
      "Murray said he followed the judge's auction rules laid out in a September order that made the overbidding round optional. But Lopez said he was surprised such a round of bidding was not held and that he had concerns about transparency.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all going to an evidentiary hearing and I\u2019m going to figure out exactly what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one should feel comfortable with the results of this auction.\u201d",
      "An exact date of next week\u2019s hearing was not immediately set.",
      "After the hearing, Jones said on his show that he thought the auction was unfairly rigged and expressed optimism that the judge would nullify the sale. He has repeatedly told his listeners that if his supporters won the bidding, he could stay on the Infowars platforms but that he had set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts in case they were needed.",
      "\u201cThis was a auction that didn\u2019t happen, with a bid that was lower, with money that wasn\u2019t real,\" he said.",
      "Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Global Tetrahedron, told The Associated Press in a video interview earlier Thursday that it planned to relaunch the Infowars website in January with satire aimed at conspiracy theorists and right-wing personalities, as well as educational information about gun violence prevention from the group Everytown for Gun Safety. Collins would not disclose the bid amount.",
      "\u201cWe thought it would be a very funny joke if we bought this thing, probably one of the better jokes we\u2019ve ever told,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe (Sandy Hook) families decided they would effectively join our bid, back our bid, to try to get us over the finish line. Because by the end of the day, it was us or Alex Jones, who could either continue this website unabated, basically unpunished, for what he\u2019s done to these families over the years, or we could make a dumb, stupid website, and we decided to do the second thing.\u201d",
      "Jones did not lose his personal X account, which has more than 3 million followers, in the auction. But the bankruptcy judge is deciding whether his personal accounts can be sold off at the trustee\u2019s request.",
      "Sandy Hook families sued Jones and his company for repeatedly saying on his show that the shooting that killed 20 children and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats by his followers. Jones has since acknowledged the shooting was \u201c100% real.\u201d",
      "The Onion, based in Chicago, bills itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s leading news publication, offering highly acclaimed, universally revered coverage of breaking national, international, and local news events.\u201d Recent headlines have included, \u201cTrump Boys Have Slap Fight Over Who Gets To Run Foreign Policy Meetings,\u201d \u201cOklahoma Law Requires Ten Commandments To Be Displayed In Every Womb\u201d and \u201cMan Forgetting Difference Between Meteoroid, Meteorite Struggles To Describe What Just Killed His Dog.\u201d",

      "Beyonc\u00e9, whose full name is Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter, is not the first performer to be the subject of a college-level course.

      "Moscovitch said the union presented unchallenged evidence of \u201cuse of non-certified personnel to talk with and recruit players; use of uncertified staff to negotiate terms of players\u2019 employment; giving things of value \u2014 concert tickets, gifts, money \u2014 to non-client players; providing loans, money, or other things of value to non-clients as inducements; providing or facilitating loans without seeking prior approval or reporting the loans.\u201d",
      "\u201cI find MLBPA has met its burden to prove the alleged violations of regulations with substantial evidence on the record as a whole,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThere can be no doubt that these are serious violations, both in the number of violations and the range of misconduct. As MLBPA executive director Anthony Clark testified, he has never seen so many violations of so many different regulations over a significant period of time.\u201d",
      "Mar\u00eda de Lourdes Mart\u00ednez, a spokeswoman for Rimas Sports, said the company declined to comment. Arroyo did not respond to a text message seeking comment.",
      "Moscovitch held four in-person hearings from Sept. 30 to Oct. 7 and three on video from Oct. 10-16.",
      "\u201cWhile these kinds of gifts are standard in the entertainment business, under the MLBPA regulations, agents and agencies simply are not permitted to give them to non-clients,\u201d she said.",
      "Arroyo's clients included Mets catcher Francisco Alvarez and teammate Ronny Mauricio.",
      "\u201cWhile it is true, as MLBPA alleges, that Mr. Arroyo violated the rules by not supervising uncertified personnel as they recruited players, he was put in that position by his employers,\u201d Moscovitch wrote. \u201cThe regulations hold him vicariously liable for the actions of uncertified personnel at the agency. The reality is that he was put in an impossible position: the regulations impose on him supervisory authority over all of the uncertified operatives at Rimas, but in reality, he was their underling, with no authority over anyone.\u201d",
      "In its petition to the court, the MLBPA asked the court to confirm Moscovitch's decision and to order the three individuals to pay the union $400,000, the amount they were fined by the union, plus interest dating from Moscovitch's decision.",

      "\u201cOutlander\u201d is returning with the concluding episodes of its seventh season this month, but its stars have already wrapped official production on the show\u2019s eighth and final season",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cOutlander\u201d is returning with the concluding episodes of its seventh season this month, but its stars have already wrapped official production on the show\u2019s eighth and final season.",
      "Caitr\u00edona Balfe and Sam Heughan, who have played time traveler Claire and 18th century Highlander Jamie since the show began, recently teased their bittersweet goodbye. Speaking less than a fortnight after their official wrap day, with only a few pick-up shots left to shoot, the stars described filming their final scene for the upcoming season.",
      "\u201cIt was very emotional. I was very emotional,\u201d Balfe said.",
      "\u201cI was, too,\u201d Heughan agreed. \u201cWe ended on a scene, well, I think \u2014 it was quite tough to do because it was a real Jamie-Claire moment, so it felt quite fitting. And I think they scheduled it like that. But it was also quite intense because a lot of the crew came to sort of celebrate or watch the final take of the final scene.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd there was a lot of words,\u201d added Balfe. \u201cIt was really hard to get through it because it also felt like everything had sort of this double meaning, you know, it\u2019s a lot of talk about goodbyes and things.\u201d",
      "Based on the books by Diana Gabaldon and mostly filmed in Scotland, the long-running show has leapt across time periods, including the Jacobite Rising, 1740s Versailles, 1960s Boston, the Revolutionary War \u2014 and more.",
      "\u201cI played Jamie when he was 23 and now he\u2019s sort of around 60. So it\u2019s quite a journey,\u201d said Heughan. \u201cThe show is always changing, always moving, it\u2019s a real journey that they\u2019ve been on from Scotland to America. And I think it\u2019s very rewarding. I\u2019m glad we weren\u2019t in a sort of procedural where we had to sort of be in the same location all the time.\u201d",
      "The concluding half of Season 7, premiering Nov. 22 on Starz, begins with the couple returning to Jamie\u2019s homeland of Scotland, before America \u2014 and the rebel cause in the Revolutionary War \u2014 calls again, testing their marriage like never before.",
      "\u201cReturning home obviously is going to be so rewarding for Jamie, but also for the fans,\u201d Heughan said, \u201cbecause I think the fans, they get to see a lot of, their favorite characters and their favorite locations.\u201d",
      "The latest episodes weave in storylines involving Claire and Jamie\u2019s time-traveling daughter Brianna and her husband Roger (Sophie Skelton and Richard Rankin) and Jamie\u2019s nephew Ian (John Bell), as well as Jamie\u2019s secret son William (Charles Vandervaart) and the British lord who is raising him.",
      "Season 7 also features one of Heughan's favorite co-stars \u2014 one he confirms fans won\u2019t be seeing in Season 8.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s actually the last time you see Sleepy,\u201d Heughan says. \u201cHe was my horse throughout first seasons. And he\u2019s a black Friesian with a white spot on him. And actually, if you look closely, he somehow transports himself to America as well because he doubles up as a horse in America. But yeah, I mean, we say goodbye to a lot of locations, a lot of characters in Season 7B.\u201d",
      "With the last season still to come, and the \u201cOutlander\u201d universe expanding with the upcoming prequel \u201cOutlander: Blood of My Blood,\u201d the story will continue for fans \u2014 although Balfe and Heughan will be getting used to their \u201cDroughtlander,\u201d the term fans coined for periods without the show.",
      "\u201cIt has been our lives for the last 11 years. We\u2019ve built families and homes in Scotland,\u201d said Heughan. \u201cSo, yes, it\u2019s quite a change that we\u2019re about to face.\u201d"

      "Quickly scribbled notes went up on the tiled wall under 14th Street in Manhattan as Chavez spoke.",

      "The project ended over the weekend, but Chavez is looking for possible locations for future iterations, even if they are not as good as the subway tunnel.",
      "\u201cPeople have so much to say,\u201d he said. \"And I love being in places where people are moving from one place to another. They just stop. They real quick get something off their chest, and then they\u2019re on their way.\u201d"

      "Apologetic rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine has been sentenced to 45 days in prison after repeatedly violating probation, disappointing a federal judge who rewarded his cooperation in a criminal case against him with leniency five years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- Apologetic rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine was sentenced Tuesday to 45 days in prison by a federal judge who said repeated violations of his probation after his cooperation against a violent gang won him leniency in a criminal case show that he doesn't have sufficient respect for judicial system rules.",
      "Judge Paul A. Engelmayer ordered the additional time be spent behind bars five years after giving the performer whose real name is Daniel Hernandez a two-year prison sentence that likely would have been decades behind bars if he had not testified at trial against the violent gang known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.",
      "The Manhattan judge said that five violations of probation rules including failing to show up for drug tests, traveling to Las Vegas from his Florida home without permission and lying to his probation officer \u201csay to me loud and clear that you don't believe the rules apply to you.\u201d",
      "He questioned whether Tekashi 6ix9ine, 28, thought he was above the law \u201cmaybe because you\u2019re a famous and wealthy rapper.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut the same rules do apply to you,\u201d Englemayer said.",
      "Before the judge announced the jail time, Tekashi 6ix9ine asked for mercy, saying he was disappointed in himself for having to face him again just a half year before his probation would have expired.",
      "\u201cI'm very sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not minimizing my actions. I fully take responsibility. I let myself down. I let my family down. Give me an opportunity to clean things up.\u201d",
      "He said he didn't want the judge to \u201cthink of me as ill mannered or I'm a bad person,\" and he insisted that \u201cI don't go out of my way to break the law.\u201d",
      "After his jail stint is finished, Tekashi 6ix9ine will be subject to a month of home incarceration, a month of home detention and a month of curfews as apart of an extension of his probation period by one year. He also will not be allowed to travel internationally and will face electronic monitoring.",
      "In April 2020, Tekashi 6ix9ine was granted compassionate release from prison several months before his sentence was finished because asthma made him susceptible to the coronavirus, which was spreading through the nation\u2019s jails and prisons.",
      "He was arrested on Oct. 29 and has spent the past two weeks in solitary confinement, a particularly harsh detainment that the judge described as a reason why he didn't impose a three-month jail term.",
      "In 2018, Tekashi 6ix9ine was arrested on charges accusing him of joining Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods before trying to get others to commit violence against his perceived enemies.",
      "Engelmayer said the singer's parole violations weren't \u201cgravely serious,\u201d but they were \u201cprofound\u201d breaches of the court's trust.",
      "He also said Tekashi 6ix9ine has \u201crepeatedly flown very close to the flame\u201d as he cited two instances in which he was arrested in the Dominican Republic and a speeding violation for allegedly going 136 mph in a 65 mph zone.",
      "\u201cYour repeated brushes with the law underscore the need to get this message across to you,\u201d the judge said."

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a man whose views public health officials have decried as dangerous in charge of a massive agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research, Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "\u201cFor too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,\u201d Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social site announcing the appointment. Kennedy, he said, would \u201cend the Chronic Disease epidemic\" and \u201cMake America Great and Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "Trump said Kennedy would target drugs, food additives and chemicals.",
      "As one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, Kennedy's nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials.",
      "Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work, and so I am concerned.\u201d",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he has chosen Doug Collins, a former congressman from Georgia, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command. The Republican served in Congress from 2013 to 2021, and he helped defend Trump during his first impeachment process.",
      "Later Thursday, Trump said he was nominating North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Department of the Interior. After ending his own presidential campaign in December 2023, Burgum endorsed Trump and became an outspoken supporter, appearing on TV news shows and at rallies and other events. He was on Trump's short list of potential running mates.",
      "Kennedy hails from one of the nation\u2019s most storied political families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination last year. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his bid this summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration.",
      "He and the president-elect have since become good friends. The two campaigned together extensively during the race\u2019s final stretch, and Trump made clear he intended to give Kennedy a major public health role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to let him go wild on health,\u201d Trump said at a rally last month.",
      "During the campaign, Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump had asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Kennedy has pushed against processed foods and the use of herbicides like Roundup weed killer. He has long criticized the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry.",
      "But he is perhaps best known for his criticism of childhood vaccines.",
      "Again and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, he said in a podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism.",
      "In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines that advise when kids should receive routine vaccinations.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, \u2018Better not get them vaccinated,\u2019\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades. The World Health Organization credits childhood vaccines with preventing as many as 5 million deaths a year.",
      "Trump during his first term launched Operation Warp Speed, an effort to speed the production and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19. The resulting vaccines were widely credited, including by Trump himself, with saving lives.",
      "Kennedy has also worked to shore up support among young mothers in particular, on a message of ridding the U.S. of unhealthy ingredients in foods, promising to model regulations after those imposed in Europe. His claims that the U.S. obesity epidemic, as well as a rise in chronic diseases like diabetes, are the result of processed and unhealthy foods has resonated on social media among fitness gurus and mom influencers alike.",
      "It remains unclear how that will square with Trump\u2019s history of deregulation of big industries, including food. Trump has pushed for fewer inspections of the meat industry, for example.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s stance on vaccines raises question about his ability to get confirmed, even in a GOP-controlled Senate. He also has said he would make a controversial recommendation to remove fluoride from drinking water, although fluoride levels are mandated by state and local governments. The addition of the mineral has been cited as leading to improved dental health and is considered safe at low levels.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not comment on Trump's pick of Kennedy or any other potential nominee. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any judgments about any of these folks at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, praised the HHS pick, posting on X: \u201cBad day for Big Pharma! @RobertKennedyJr.\"",
      "Several Democrats quickly condemned the selection.",
      "Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the No. 3 Democrat, said that Kennedy\u2019s confirmation would be \u201cnothing short of a disaster for the health of millions of families.\u201d",
      "But not every Democrat recoiled from the news. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he was \u201cexcited\u201d for Kennedy to lead HHS. Polis said he wants to see Kennedy take on \u201cbig pharma\u201d and hopes he will \u201clean into personal choice\u201d on vaccines.",
      "That idea is concerning to former New York Public Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan, who said that if people opt against vaccines, deadly viruses could run wild. He points to an uptick in measles outbreaks \u2014 16 have occurred so far this year compared to four last year. \u201cThat\u2019s going to continue if we have someone at the top of our health system that is saying, \u2018I\u2019m not so sure about the science here,\u2019\u201d Vasan said.",
      "FDA could have one of the biggest shakeups, with Kennedy's promises of more regulations \u2014 action that would buck the moves that previous Republican administrations have made. He has promised a crackdown on food dyes and preservatives. And with pharmaceutical companies, he's suggested that drugmakers be barred from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars. He also proposed eliminating fees that drugmakers pay the FDA to review their products.",
      "He wants to weaken FDA regulations around a host of unsubstantiated therapies, including psychedelics and stem cells as well as discredited COVID-era drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "Kennedy also will focus on ending the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previously worked for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his former campaign communications manager, Del Bigtree, told the AP last month.",
      "This past weekend, Kennedy said he wanted to fire 600 employees at NIH, which oversees vaccine research and replace them with 600 new people. In separate comments, he has said that in his first week he would order a pause in drug development and infectious disease research, shifting the focus to chronic diseases.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he will nominate Jay Clayton, who served as chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during his first term, to serve as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York.",

      "A U.S. military watchdog says Navy officials lacked sufficient understanding of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people",
      "HONOLULU -- Navy officials \u201clacked sufficient understanding\u201d of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people in 2021, a U.S. military watchdog said Thursday.",
      "That lack of awareness came even though officials had engineering drawings and environmental studies that described the risks, the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s inspector general said.",
      "The finding was among a long list of Navy failures identified by the inspector general in two reports that follow a yearslong investigation into the fuel leak at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. Investigators said it was imperative for the Navy to address its management of fuel and water systems at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and recommended that the military assess leak detection systems at other Navy fuel facilities.",
      "\"The DoD must take this action, and others, to ensure that tragedies like the one in November of 2021 are not allowed to repeat,\u201d Inspector General Robert P. Storch said in a statement.",
      "The military built the Red Hill fuel tanks into the side of a mountain in the early 1940s to protect them from aerial attack. There were 20 tanks in all, each about the height of a 25-story building with the capacity to hold 12.5 million gallons (47.3 million liters.) The site was in the hills above Pearl Harbor and on top of an aquifer equipped with wells that provided drinking water to the Navy and to Honolulu's municipal water system.",
      "Fuel leaks at Red Hill had occurred before, including in 2014, prompting the Sierra Club of Hawaii and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply to ask the military to move the tanks to a place where they wouldn't threaten Oahu's water. But the Navy refused, saying the island's water was safe.",
      "The 2021 spill gushed from a ruptured pipe in May of that year. Most of it flowed into a fire suppression drain system, where it sat unnoticed for six months until a cart rammed a sagging line holding the liquid. Crews believed they mopped up most of this fuel but they failed to get about 5,000 gallons (19,000 liters.) Around Thanksgiving, the fuel flowed into a drain and drinking water well that supplied water to 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",
      "The inspector general's report noted 4,000 families had to move out of their homes for months because they couldn't drink or bathe in their water. The military spent more than $220 million housing residents in hotels and responding to the spill. Congress appropriated $2.1 billion more, some of which is helping the Navy close the Red Hill facility in compliance with an order from Hawaii regulators.",
      "Among the inspector general's other findings:",
      "1. The Navy never told the state Department of Health, which regulates underground fuel tanks, about the missing fuel after the May 2021 spill. 2. The Navy missed four separate opportunities in November 2021 to activate emergency response plans to respond to the water contamination. That includes on Nov. 20, when fuel was released from the drainage pipe, and on Nov. 28, when residents called base authorities to report chemical and fuel smells emanating from their water. 3. The Navy issued news releases on Nov. 21 and 22 saying \u201cthe drinking water was safe\u201d but did so without conducting any laboratory analysis to confirm that was the case.4. The Navy didn't assume contamination from the spill had spread throughout Pearl Harbor's drinking water system, as required by the water system emergency response plan. The report said some residents may have continued to cook and shower with their tap water as a result.",

      "Hawaii's congressional delegation, which called for the investigation in 2021, issued a joint statement saying the reports made clear the Navy and the military failed to manage fuel and water operations at Red Hill and Pearl Harbor to a standard that protects the health and safety of the people of Hawaii.",
      "\u201cIt's outrageous and unacceptable,\u201d said the statement from U.S. Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz and U.S. Reps. Ed Case and Jill Tokuda, all Democrats.",
      "They called on the Navy to take \u201cfull responsibility\u201d for its failures and immediately implement the inspector general's recommendations.",
      "A Navy spokesperson said in a statement that the inspector general's findings align with previous evaluations and support corrective actions the Navy is implementing.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to constant improvement to ensure the highest standards of operation, maintenance, safety, and oversight at all of our facilities at all times,\u201d the statement said.",

      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said he welcomed the inspector general's findings, which he said underscored what environmental advocates had long alleged.",

      "Deep breathing can be a simple and effective way to reduce stress",
      "NEW YORK -- A simple, uncommon ritual starts each staff meeting at Myosin Marketing. When everyone is gathered on Zoom, and before they get to the meat of the agenda, CEO Sean Clayton leads his team through a deep-breathing exercise.",
      "The practice sets the tone for the meeting, and helps his employees, most of whom work remotely, to feel safe, grounded and willing to take creative risks, he said.",
      "\u201cAt first they thought it was really weird, like, \u2018What are we doing?\u2019\u201d Clayton said. \u201cThere were a lot of cameras off and I\u2019m sure a lot of people were like, \u2018This is awkward.\u2019\" But after a couple of weeks, there was a shift. Employees of the Austin, Texas company were saying, 'This feels good,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Deep breathing can be an effective way to reduce stress at work, studies show. But on the job, many people don\u2019t think about how they\u2019re inhaling and exhaling.",
      "Desk workers sitting a computer tend to take shallow breaths as their shoulders creep up. Workers who spend the day on their feet in retail or health care may be too busy to focus on breathing.",
      "But there's good reason to remember to pause to take deep breaths. Chronic, unmanaged stress, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, can be as harmful to our health as secondhand smoke, according to the American Heart Association. Research suggests deep-breathing exercises can lower a person's blood pressure and reduce anxiety.",
      "Other benefits: deep breathing is free, can be done anywhere and doesn't require taking a half-hour to meditate. Spending just a minute or two breathing deeply can help calm racing thoughts, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt relaxes my mind. It makes my mind so full of ease,\u201d Lisa Marie Deleveaux, a marketing professional and mother of five, said. \u201cIt brings you back to the present moment.\u201d",
      "Deleveaux was laid off several months ago and has struggled to find a new job. She wakes most mornings at 4 or 5 a.m., before the children, to do breathing exercises. One is a technique known as alternate nostril breathing, a yoga exercise that involves inhaling through one nostril and out through another, using a thumb or forefinger to hold one nostril closed at a time.",
      "\u201cIf you set a priority for yourself ... you can make the time,\u201d Deleveaux said.",
      "Focusing on breathing for one to five minutes \"can help you clear the slate and wipe all these things out of your mind...and allow you to get back to focusing on the one thing you want to accomplish,\u201d said cardiologist Glenn Levine, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \u201cThe best analogy is turning your computer off when you have 37 programs (open) and it freezes.\u201d",
      "A good way to do deep breathing exercises is while sitting on a bench outside, Levine said. If that\u2019s not an option, doing it at a desk works.",
      "\u201cEither turn off your screen or just put something blank on the screen so people think you\u2019re still working,\" Levine said. \u201cInstead of focusing on the screen or work, just focus on your breathing. If possible, close your eyes.\u201d",
      "There are other ways to fit in breathing exercises. To get ahead of anxiety before starting a day of cold calls, sales development representative Lindsay Carlisle does breathing exercises with her 7-year-old daughter during the drive to school. They breathe in for seven counts, hold their breath for five, breathe out for seven counts, and then repeat the cycle several times.",
      "\u201cThroughout that process, my shoulders start to drop on their own, and it really is calming,\u201d Carlisle, who lives in Flint, Michigan, said. \u201cI\u2019m not a yoga instructor. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but it works.\u201d",
      "Suze Yalof Schwartz was an overworked fashion editor when her mother-in-law taught her a three-minute meditation technique that she says changed her life. She gave up her fashion career and founded Unplug Meditation, a Santa Monica, California, company with a meditation studio, an app and programs for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWhen we slow down our breath, we send a signal to our brain that everything\u2019s OK, even when it\u2019s not,\" she said.",
      "A 16-second breathing technique she's taught to firefighters, police officers, doctors and others is called the box breathing technique. You breathe in for four counts, hold for four, breathe out for four counts and hold for four.",
      "\u201cIt is the best thing that you can do at work before you have a meeting, before you send out an email that you wish you didn\u2019t send, before you have a difficult conversation, because it just calms you down, gets rid of your negative energy,\" Yalof Schwartz said.",
      "Employers such as Coca-Cola, Mattel and Netflix have hired Unplug Meditation to teach breathing or meditation.",
      "It's not always easy for workers to find space for deep breathing exercises. For example, in retail jobs, workers often mix with customers. Yalof Schwartz recommends doing breathing exercises when ringing up a sale or folding clothes. You can also take a deep breath right before walking through a door.",
      "Office workers can set a timer on their phones to remind themselves to breathe deeply. That's what Carlisle, the sales representative, does. She also keeps a Post-it note on her monitor that says \u201cBreathe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe anxiety is always going to be there,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cBut at least I know I have one small tool. ... It sounds so simple and silly, but it works.\u201d",

      "President-elect Donald Trump 's plan to appoint Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Health and Human Services Department will put a prominent vaccine skeptic at the helm of the nation's sprawling public health apparatus.",
      "A scion of a famous Democratic dynasty, Kennedy made a name in his own right as an environmental attorney who successfully took on large corporations including DuPont and Monsanto.",
      "But over the past two decades, he's increasingly devoted his energy to promoting claims about vaccines that contradict the overwhelming consensus of scientists.",
      "Trump would have Kennedy lead a massive Cabinet agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research and the social safety net programs Medicare and Medicaid. He said before the election he would give Kennedy free rein over health policy.",
      "Here's a look at Kennedy and the agency he'll be tasked with leading:",
      "He took over the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense and built it into a juggernaut during the pandemic. His activism helped him build a loyal following that he's leveraged in his political pursuits.",
      "Kennedy insists he is not anti-vaccine and claims he has never told the public to avoid vaccination. But he has repeatedly made his opposition to vaccines clear. He said on a podcast \u201cthere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and has urged people to resist CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccinated.",
      "While there are rare instances when people have severe reactions to vaccines, the billions of doses administered globally provide real-world evidence that they are safe. The World Health Organization says vaccines prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year.",
      "He wants to eliminate liability protections for drug companies.",
      "Even before Trump was elected, Kennedy said he would recommend water agencies stop adding fluoride to drinking water. Fluoride strengthens teeth and is viewed as one of the biggest public health successes of the past century.",
      "He made a variety of other claims not backed by science, such as questioning whether HIV causes AIDS and suggesting antidepressants lead to school shootings.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "Kennedy has promised to take a serious look at those who work for HHS and its agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "He is especially focused on putting an end to the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previous history working for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his campaign communications manager Del Bigtree told the AP last month. Bigtree is also an anti-vaccine organizer.",
      "He said he wants to fire 600 employees at the National Institutes of Health, which oversees vaccine research, and replace them with 600 new employees.",
      "Many of the scientists and researchers who work at the NIH are not political appointees, which makes firing them abruptly more difficult. Nevertheless, Kennedy made the promise at the Genius Network Annual Event in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to a video first obtained by ABC News.",
      "\u201cWe need to act fast, and we want to have those people in place on Jan. 20, so that on Jan. 21, 600 people are going to walk into offices at NIH and 600 people are going to leave,\u201d Kennedy said, according to a video of his remarks posted on YouTube.",
      "He says the public health establishment is too focused on infectious diseases and wants to redirect resources toward panoply of problems he characterizes as the chronic disease epidemic, including obesity, diabetes, autism and mental illnesses. He blames them on greedy corporations including drug companies that worry healthy Americans would be bad for their bottom line and food producers using harmful pesticides and additives.",
      "Kennedy's father was Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, brother of President John F. Kennedy. Both men were assassinated.",
      "Kennedy originally ran in the Democratic primary against President Joe Biden before deciding to launch an independent bid. He then suspended that campaign earlier this year and endorsed Trump, who has repeatedly praised Kennedy, promised him influence in a future administration, and vowed to \u201cMake America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "The GOP base has eagerly welcomed Kennedy since he joined forces with Trump, an embrace Kennedy never received from the Democratic Party. His anti-vaccine activism has alienated him from much of his famous family.",
      "Doctors found a dead parasitic worm in Kennedy's brain and high levels of mercury that he said caused brain fog and memory problems.",
      "He once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York\u2019s Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city in 2014. A photo showed Kennedy with his fingers in the bear\u2019s bloodied mouth, a mock grimace on his face and an apparent bloodstain on his pantleg.",
      "He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.",
      "And a federal law enforcement agency opened an investigation after Kennedy allegedly cut off the head of a dead whale and took it home two decades ago. The National Marine Fisheries Service ended the probe a short time later.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination is certain to be opposed by the pharmaceutical lobby in Washington, which relies on the predictability of FDA\u2019s science-based rules to bring new medicines to market.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposals for the agency bear little resemblance to those of prior Republican administrations, which have typically favored cutting regulations to speed up product approvals.",
      "Instead, Kennedy has suggested barring drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars. He\u2019s also proposed eliminating fees that drugmakers pay the FDA to review their products, allowing the agency to hire extra scientists to speed up their work. Replacing those funds would require billions in new appropriations from the federal budget.",
      "In a post last month to the social media platform X, Kennedy vowed to end FDA\u2019s \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of a host of unsubstantiated therapies, including psychedelics and stem cells as well as discredited COVID-era drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "In recent interviews, Kennedy has also suggested clearing out \u201centire departments\u201d at FDA, including the one responsible for nutrition standards.",

    "summary": "New rules require drugmakers to be clearer about explaining the risks and side effects of prescription drugs",

      "New rules require drugmakers to be clearer about explaining the risks and side effects of prescription drugs",
      "WASHINGTON -- Those ever-present TV drug ads showing patients hiking, biking or enjoying a day at the beach could soon have a different look: New rules require drugmakers to be clearer and more direct when explaining their medications' risks and side effects.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration spent more than 15 years crafting the guidelines, which are designed to do away with industry practices that downplay or distract viewers from risk information.",
      "Many companies have already adopted the rules, which become binding Nov. 20. But while regulators were drafting them, a new trend emerged: thousands of pharma influencers pushing drugs online with little oversight. A new bill in Congress would compel the FDA to more aggressively police such promotions on social media platforms.",
      "\u201cSome people become very attached to social media influencers and ascribe to them credibility that, in some cases, they don\u2019t deserve,\u201d said Tony Cox, professor emeritus of marketing at Indiana University.",
      "Still, TV remains the industry's primary advertising format, with over $4 billion spent in the past year, led by blockbuster drugs like weight-loss treatment Wegovy, according to ispot.tv, which tracks ads.",
      "The new rules, which cover both TV and radio, instruct drugmakers to use simple, consumer-friendly language when describing their drugs, without medical jargon, distracting visuals or audio effects. A 2007 law directed the FDA to ensure that drug risk information appears \u201cin a clear, conspicuous and neutral manner.\u201d",
      "FDA has always required that ads give a balanced picture of both benefits and risks, a requirement that gave rise to those long, rapid-fire lists of side effects parodied on shows like \u201c Saturday Night Live.\u201d",
      "But in the early 2000s, researchers began showing how companies could manipulate images and audio to de-emphasize safety information. In one example, a Duke University professor found that ads for the allergy drug Nasonex, which featured a buzzing bee voiced by Antonio Banderas, distracted viewers from listening to side effect information, making it harder to remember.",
      "Such overt tactics have largely disappeared from drug ads.",
      "\u201cIn general, I would say the ads have gotten more complete and transparent,\u201d says Ruth Day, director of the medical cognition lab at Duke University and author of the Nasonex study.",
      "The new rules are \u201csignificant steps forward,\u201d Day said, but certain requirements could also open the door to new ways of downplaying risks.",
      "One requirement instructs companies to show on-screen text about side effects while the audio information plays. A 2011 FDA study found that combining text with audio increased recall and understanding.",
      "But the agency leaves it to companies to decide whether to display a few keywords or a full transcript.",
      "\u201cYou often cannot put all that on the screen and expect people to read and understand it,\u201d Day said. \u201cIf you wanted to hide or decrease the likelihood of people remembering risk information, that could be the way to do it.\u201d",
      "Viewers tend to tune out long lists of warnings and other information. But experts who work with drug companies don\u2019t expect those lists to disappear. While the guidelines describe how the information should be presented, companies still decide the content.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a company and you\u2019re worried about possible FDA enforcement or product liability and other litigation, all your incentives are to say more, not less,\u201d said Torrey Cope, a food and drug lawyer who advises companies.",
      "Experts also say the new rules will have little effect on the overall tone and appearance of ads.",
      "\u201cThe most salient element of these ads are the visuals, and they are uniformly positive,\u201d said Cox. \u201cEven if the risk message is about, for instance, sudden heart failure, they\u2019re still showing someone diving into a swimming pool.\u201d",
      "The new rules come as Donald Trump's advisers begin floating plans for the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who has advised the president-elect, wants to eliminate TV drug ads. He and other industry critics point out that the U.S. and New Zealand are the only countries where prescription drugs can be promoted on TV.",
      "Even so, many companies are looking beyond TV and expanding into social media. They often partner with patient influencers who post about managing their conditions, new treatments or navigating the health system.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re teaching people to live a good life with their disease, but then some of them are also paid to advertise and persuade,\u201d said Erin Willis, who studies advertising and media at the University of Colorado Boulder.",
      "Advertising executives say companies like the format because it\u2019s cheaper than TV and consumers generally feel influencers are more trustworthy than companies.",
      "FDA\u2019s requirement for truthful, balanced risk and benefit information applies to drugmakers, leaving a loophole for both influencers and telehealth companies like Hims, Ro and Teledoc, who may not have a direct financial connection to makers of the drugs they\u2019re promoting.",
      "The issue has attracted attention from members of Congress.",
      "\u201cThe power of social media and the deluge of misleading promotions has meant too many young people are receiving medical advice from influencers instead of their health care professional,\u201d Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Mike Braun of Indiana wrote the FDA in a February letter.",
      "A recently introduced bill from the senators would bring influencers and telehealth companies clearly under FDA\u2019s jurisdiction, requiring them to disclose risk and side effect information. The bill also would require drugmakers to publicly disclose payments to influencers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s asking the FDA to take a more serious stance with this kind of marketing,\u201d said Willis. \u201cThey know it\u2019s happening, but they could be doing more.\u201d",

      "Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert F",
      "Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was building up a following with his anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, and becoming one of the world\u2019s most influential spreaders of fear and distrust around vaccines.",
      "Now, President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which regulates vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism. He has also pushed other conspiracy theories, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "No medical intervention is risk-free. But doctors and researchers have proven that risks from disease are generally far greater than the risks from vaccines.",
      "Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that he is not anti-vaccine, saying he only wants vaccines to be rigorously tested, but he also has shown opposition to a wide range of immunizations. Kennedy said in a 2023 podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told Fox News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism. In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccines.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, better not get them vaccinated,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "That same year, in a video promoting an anti-vaccine sticker campaign by his nonprofit, Kennedy appeared onscreen next to one sticker that declared \u201cIF YOU\u2019RE NOT AN ANTI-VAXXER YOU AREN\u2019T PAYING ATTENTION.\u201d",
      "The World Health Organization has estimated that global immunization efforts have saved at least 154 million lives in the past 50 years.",
      "In a study of verified Twitter accounts from 2021, researchers found Kennedy\u2019s personal Twitter account was the top \u201csuperspreader\u201d of vaccine misinformation on Twitter, responsible for 13% of all reshares of misinformation, more than three times the second most-retweeted account.",
      "He has traveled to states including Connecticut, California and New York to lobby or sue over vaccine policies and has traveled the world to meet with anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Kennedy has also aligned himself with businesses and special interests groups such as anti-vaccine chiropractors, who saw profit in slicing off a small portion of the larger health care market while spreading false or dubious health information.",
      "An Associated Press investigation found one chiropractic group in California had donated $500,000 to Kennedy\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Defense, about one-sixth of the group\u2019s fundraising that year. Another AP investigation found he was listed as an affiliate for an anti-vaccine video series, where he was ranked among the Top 10 for the series\u2019 \u201cOverall Sales Leaderboard.\u201d",
      "His group has co-published a number of anti-vaccine books that have been debunked. One, called \u201cCause Unknown,\u201d is built on the false premise that sudden deaths of young, healthy people are spiking due to mass administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Experts say these rare medical emergencies are not new and have not become more prevalent.",
      "An AP review of the book found dozens of individuals included in it died of known causes not related to vaccines, including suicide, choking while intoxicated, overdose and allergic reaction. One person died in 2019.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit."

    "story": [
      "Democratic lawmakers who wield control of the Virginia Legislature are hoping to make good on promises made on the campaign trail, including becoming the first Southern state to expand constitutional protections for abortion access",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Democrats who control both chambers of the Virginia legislature are hoping to make good on promises made on the campaign trail, including becoming the first Southern state to expand constitutional protections for abortion access.",
      "The House Privileges and Elections Committee advanced three proposed constitutional amendments Wednesday, including a measure to protect reproductive rights. Its members also discussed measures to repeal a now-defunct state constitutional ban on same-sex marriage and ways to revise Virginia's process to restore voting rights for people who served time for felony crimes.",
      "\u201cThis meeting was an important next step considering the moment in history we find ourselves in,\u201d Democratic Del. Cia Price, the committee chair, said during a news conference. \u201cWe have urgent threats to our freedoms that could impact constituents in all of the districts we serve.\u201d",
      "The at-times raucous meeting will pave the way for the House and Senate to take up the resolutions early next year after lawmakers tabled the measures last January. Democrats previously said the move was standard practice, given that amendments are typically introduced in odd-numbered years. But Republican Minority Leader Todd Gilbert said Wednesday the committee should not have delved into the amendments before next year's legislative session. He said the resolutions, particularly the abortion amendment, need further vetting.",
      "\u201cNo one who is still serving remembers it being done in this way ever,\u201d Gilbert said after the meeting. \u201cCertainly not for something this important. This is as big and weighty an issue as it gets.\u201d",
      "The Democrats' legislative lineup comes after Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin, to the dismay of voting-rights advocates, rolled back a process to restore people's civil rights after they completed sentences for felonies. Virginia is the only state that permanently bans anyone convicted of a felony from voting unless a governor restores their rights.",
      "\u201cThis amendment creates a process that is bounded by transparent rules and criteria that will apply to everybody \u2014 it's not left to the discretion of a single individual,\u201d Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, the patron of the voting rights resolution, which passed along party lines, said at the news conference.",
      "Though Democrats have sparred with the governor over their legislative agenda, constitutional amendments put forth by lawmakers do not require his signature, allowing the Democrat-led House and Senate to bypass Youngkin's blessing.",
      "Instead, the General Assembly must pass proposed amendments twice in at least two years, with a legislative election sandwiched between each statehouse session. After that, the public can vote by referendum on the issues. The cumbersome process will likely hinge upon the success of all three amendments on Democrats' ability to preserve their edge in the House and Senate, where they hold razor-thin majorities.",
      "It's not the first time lawmakers have attempted to champion the three amendments. Republicans in a House subcommittee killed a constitutional amendment to restore voting rights in 2022, a year after the measure passed in a Democrat-led House. The same subcommittee also struck down legislation supporting a constitutional amendment to repeal an amendment from 2006 banning marriage equality.",
      "On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers voted 16-5 in favor of legislation protecting same-sex marriage, with four Republicans supporting the resolution.",
      "\u201cTo say the least, voters enacted this (amendment) in 2006, and we have had 100,000 voters a year become of voting age since then,\u201d said Del. Mark Sickles, who sponsored the amendment as one of the first openly gay men serving in the General Assembly. \u201cMany people have changed their opinions of this as the years have passed.\u201d",
      "A constitutional amendment protecting abortion previously passed the Senate in 2023 but died in a Republican-led House. On Wednesday, the amendment passed on party lines.",
      "If successful, the resolution proposed by House Majority Leader Charniele Herring would be part of a growing trend of reproductive rights-related ballot questions given to voters. Since 2022, 18 questions have gone before voters across the U.S., and they have sided with abortion rights advocates 14 times.",
      "The voters have approved constitutional amendments ensuring the right to abortion until fetal viability in nine states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Ohio and Vermont. Voters also passed a right-to-abortion measure in Nevada in 2024, but it must be passed again in 2026 to be added to the state constitution.",
      "As lawmakers debated the measure, roughly 18 members spoke. Mercedes Perkins, at 38 weeks pregnant, described the importance of women making decisions about their own bodies. Rhea Simon, another Virginia resident, anecdotally described how reproductive health care shaped her life.",
      "Then all at once, more than 50 people lined up to speak against the abortion amendment.",
      "\u201cLet's do the compassionate thing and care for mothers and all unborn children,\u201d resident Sheila Furey said.",
      "The audience gave a collective \u201cAmen,\u201d followed by a round of applause.",

The company said it plans to wind down ongoing clinical trials \u201cas quickly as practical\u201d \u2014 and that it was currently evaluating \u201cstrategic alternatives\u201d for assets related to its drug development and research programs, which include studies on potential cancer treatments.",

      "Revenue, however, totaled at $44.1 million for the second quarter \u2014 down from $50 million from the year prior. The company cited lower testing kit sales and telehealth orders, as well as a decrease in research revenue, but said that was partially offset by a growth in membership services.",
      "23andMe anticipates the job cuts and other restructuring efforts announced Monday to reduce its operating expenses and save the company more than $35 million annually. 23andMe also expects to incur up to $12 million in costs, primarily related to one-time severance and other termination-related expenses.",
      "23andMe ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $127 million, compared with $216 million as of March 31, 2024.",

      "Hours after Donald Trump was elected president for the second time, Dr. Clayton Alfonso had two messages from patients seeking to replace their IUDs. Over the next few days, three women inquired about getting their tubes tied.",
      "All of them said the election was the reason they were making these choices now.",
      "Requests for long-term birth control and permanent sterilizations have surged across the nation since the election, doctors told The Associated Press. And companies that sell emergency contraception and abortion pills say they're seeing significant spikes in requests from people who are stockpiling the medications \u2014 one saw a 966% increase in sales of emergency contraception from the week before in the 60 hours after the election.",

      "Although anti-abortion advocates are pressing Trump for more restrictions on abortion pills, it's unclear what \u2014 if much \u2014 will be done regarding access to contraceptives of any kind during the second Trump administration. Trump told a Pittsburgh television station in May that he was open to supporting regulations on contraception. But after media reports on the interview, he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he \u201chas never and will never\u201d advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives.",
      "Alfonso said his patients want to replace still-effective IUDs and \u201crestart\u201d the 3-to-12-year clock on them before the inauguration. He also said the women are particularly concerned about IUDs, which have been attacked by abortion opponents who believe life begins when an egg is fertilized. Experts believe the devices work mostly by blocking fertilization, but also may make it harder for a fertilized egg to implant in the womb.",
      "A patient who requested a tubal ligation Tuesday told Alfonso she doesn\u2019t want kids and is \u201cjust absolutely terrified of either forced pregnancy or inability to access contraception.\"",

      "One patient, Mara Zupko, said she wants prescription emergency contraception since she\u2019s on the cusp of the weight limit for Plan B, the most well-known over-the-counter type. Her husband is getting a vasectomy.",
      "\u201cWe always kind of teetered on whether we wanted children or not,\u201d said Zupko, 27. \u201dBut as the world has become scarier and scarier, we realized we didn\u2019t want to bring a child into that environment. And I also have several health risks.\u201d",
      "Women are also turning to companies that sell emergency contraception online or offer abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol through telehealth \u2014 something that's been happening even before the election, but that some companies say has accelerated.",
      "A study earlier this year showed the abortion pill supplier Aid Access received about 48,400 requests from across the U.S. for so-called \u201cadvance provision\u201d pills from September 2021 through April 2023 \u2014 with requests highest right after news leaked about Roe being overturned but before the formal announcement. Other research found that more women had their tubes tied post-Roe, with the biggest increases in states that ban abortion.",
      "Mifepristone has a shelf life of about five years and misoprostol around two years, according to Plan C, an organization that provides information about medical abortions. Plan B typically has a shelf life of four years.",
      "Telehealth company Wisp saw orders for abortion pills spike 600% between Election Day and the following day. And between Nov. 6 and 11, the company saw a 460% increase in sales of its emergency contraception and birth control offerings.",
      "At Gen Z-focused Winx Health, which sells emergency contraception called Restart, company leaders saw a 966% increase in sales in the 60 hours following the election compared with the week before. Sales of \u201cvalue packs\u201d of Restart \u2014 four doses instead of one \u2014 were up more than 7,000% in the past week.",
      "\"Morning after pills\u201d are legal in all states, but Winx co-founder Cynthia Plotch said many people seem confused about what emergency contraception is compared to abortion pills. In a 2023 poll by the health policy research organization KFF, a majority of responders said they know these two things aren't the same, but only 27% reported knowing emergency contraceptive pills cannot end a pregnancy.",
      "Doctors agree confusion around morning after pills may explain some of the stockpiling. But Alfonso at Duke suspects most people are doing this for the same reason they are seeking longer-term methods of birth control: to avoid abortion by preventing pregnancy in the first place.",
      "Alfonso predicts the birth control and abortion pill surge may level out like it did in 2016 and 2022. If the new administration \u201cis not focused on health care right away,\" he said, \"then I think it\u2019ll go to the back of people\u2019s minds until it picks up in the media.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Seven-year-old Halima Abou Yassine was brought to Lebanon from Gaza for treatment after an Israeli strike left her near death with a gaping wound in her skull",
      "BEIRUT -- When Zarifa Nawfal\u2019s family arrived in Beirut for her wounded daughter\u2019s surgery, one of the first things she wanted to do was go to the sea. The Mediterranean had been a constant companion at their home in Gaza before the war.",
      "\u201cThe moment I smelled the sea, I felt at peace inside \u2014 as if I were in Gaza,\u201d she said.",
      "But soon their place of refuge reminded her of home in far more distressing ways.",
      "Nawfal\u2019s 7-year-old daughter, Halima Abou Yassine, is one of a dozen severely wounded Palestinian children brought to Lebanon this year for treatment through a program launched by a British-Palestinian surgeon, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta.",
      "But months after their arrival, Lebanon is itself embroiled in a war some fear will end in Gaza-like destruction.",
      "In February, Nawfal was staying with her five children and her mother in an apartment in central Gaza. They had been displaced from their home in the north and Nawfal\u2019s husband was missing, likely dead.",
      "The children were filling water containers outside when two missiles struck, Nawfal said. She rushed outside and found Halima, the youngest, lying in the street, her skull cracked open, her brain exposed.",
      "Through her shock, Nawfal said, \u201cI was relieved that her body was in one piece.\u201d In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury.",
      "Halima\u2019s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal\u2019s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue.",
      "But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl\u2019s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said.",
      "Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned.",
      "\u201cBecause of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,\" he said.",
      "In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up.",
      "\u201cSome of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,\u201d Nawfal said.",
      "But they were unable to do more than keep the little girl alive. Her skull was still gaping open, a shard of bone missing. Her brain was beset by infection.",
      "The family was evacuated to Egypt in May. In July, they boarded a plane for Lebanon.",
      "The first of the wounded Palestinian children arrived in Lebanon in May. Five-year-old Adam Afana had nearly lost his left arm in a blast that killed his father and sister. His arm was paralyzed and he needed a complex surgery to correct the nerve damage.",
      "At the time, Lebanon was already embroiled in a low-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes.",
      "For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut.",
      "Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries.",
      "Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts.",
      "\u201cEven after the end of the wars (in Lebanon), the wounded from Iraq and Syria would come here for that kind of complex and multistage treatment,\u201d Abu Sitta said.",
      "In July, Halima underwent successful surgery to repair her skull at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.",
      "Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head.",
      "In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center.",
      "The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family\u2019s hotel suite, away from windows.",
      "Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she \u201ccompletely refused.\u201d",
      "\u201cLebanon isn\u2019t just another Arab country or a country we came to for treatment \u2014 Lebanon is a sister to Gaza,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are like two souls in one body. ... We live or die together.\u201d",
      "Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon \u201creminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.\u201d Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them.",
      "\u201cWhat we hope for Lebanon is that what happened in Gaza won\u2019t happen here \u2014 that the beginning and the ending won\u2019t both be the same,\u201d Afana said.",
      "The Ghassan Abu Sitta Fund halted bringing wounded Palestinian children to Lebanon but continues to treat the existing patients \u2014 with some challenges.",
      "Since arriving in Beirut, Adam has undergone a procedure to clear infection from his bones, a neurosurgery and regular physiotherapy sessions. With effort, he can now slightly clench his hand.",
      "But the final operation \u2014 a muscle transfer and surgery to repair the damaged nerves to his arm \u2014 is on hold.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a handful of people who specialize in this globally, and we were expecting one of them to come to Lebanon,\u201d Abu Sitta said. The trip has been delayed by the escalation in Lebanon.",
      "When he first launched the program, Abu Sitta hoped to treat 50 Palestinian children from Gaza at any given time. Unable to bring more patients in, the team is turning its resources to treating Lebanese children.",
      "The numbers of wounded Lebanese children are still far lower than in Gaza. As of last week, Lebanon\u2019s Ministry of Public Health said 192 children had been killed and at least 1,255 wounded since October 2023. In Gaza, more than 13,000 children have been killed and thousands more have been wounded, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "Abu Sitta said the wounds of children in Lebanon are \u201cidentical to the injuries of Palestinian children from Gaza.\u201d Most were wounded while at home. They suffered \u201ccrush injuries to the limbs, blast injuries to the face\u201d and often \u201cmultiple members of the family killed at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cAs in Gaza, this war takes its toll on children,\u201d he said. \u201cAll wars are waged on children.\u201d"

      "BOISE, Idaho -- Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion bans told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\u201cWe felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\u201d said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \u201cnecessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\u201d",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant it would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \u201cmirror syndrome,\u201d a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband decided to seek an abortion, and learned they would have to go out of state to get one after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat.",
      "\u201cNo parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\u201d Adkins said. \u201cI wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\u201d",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \u201cBrooks\u201d for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\u201cIf I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\u201d Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\u201d she said. They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\u201cAll four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\u201d attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \u201cto protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\u201d",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General\u2019s office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\u201cUnborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\u201d Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \u201crare circumstances where abortion is necessary\u201d to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \u201cusurp the role of the Legislature\u201d by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho\u2019s multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \u201cbasically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\u201d Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cI have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\u201d she said. \u201cI have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\u201d",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\u201cWe are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\u201d she said."

      "Syphilis is a particular concern. For centuries, it was a common but feared infection that could deform the body and end in death. New cases plummeted in the U.S. starting in the 1940s when infection-fighting antibiotics became widely available, and they trended down for a half century after that. By 2002, however, cases began rising again, with men who have sex with other men being disproportionately affected.",

      "However, there was a 12% increase in the rate of cases of unknown- or later-stage syphilis \u2014 a reflection of people infected years ago.",
      "Cases of syphilis in newborns, passed on from infected mothers, also rose. There were nearly 4,000 cases, including 279 stillbirths and infant deaths.",
      "\u201cThis means pregnant women are not being tested often enough,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor of medicine at the University of Southern California.",
      "What caused some of the STD trends to improve? Several experts say one contributor is the growing use of an antibiotic as a \u201cmorning-after pill.\u201d Studies have shown that taking doxycycline within 72 hours of unprotected sex cuts the risk of developing syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia.",
      "In June, the CDC started recommending doxycycline as a morning-after pill, specifically for gay and bisexual men and transgender women who recently had an STD diagnosis. But health departments and organizations in some cities had been giving the pills to people for a couple years.",
      "Some experts believe that the 2022 mpox outbreak \u2014 which mainly hit gay and bisexual men \u2014 may have had a lingering effect on sexual behavior in 2023, or at least on people's willingness to get tested when strange sores appeared.",
      "Another factor may have been an increase in the number of health workers testing people for infections, doing contact tracing and connecting people to treatment. Congress gave $1.2 billion to expand the workforce over five years, including $600 million to states, cities and territories that get STD prevention funding from CDC.",
      "Last year had the \"most activity with that funding throughout the U.S.,\u201d said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors.",
      "However, Congress ended the funds early as a part of last year\u2019s debt ceiling deal, cutting off $400 million. Some people already have lost their jobs, said a spokeswoman for Harvey's organization.",
      "Still, Harvey said he had reasons for optimism, including the growing use of doxycycline and a push for at-home STD test kits.",
      "Also, there are reasons to think the next presidential administration could get behind STD prevention. In 2019, then-President Donald Trump announced a campaign to \u201celiminate\u201d the U.S. HIV epidemic by 2030. (Federal health officials later clarified that the actual goal was a huge reduction in new infections \u2014 fewer than 3,000 a year.)",
      "There were nearly 32,000 new HIV infections in 2022, the CDC estimates. But a boost in public health funding for HIV could also also help bring down other sexually transmitted infections, experts said.",
      "\u201cWhen the government puts in resources, puts in money, we see declines in STDs,\u201d Klausner said.",

      "The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group\u2019s $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys",
      "NEW YORK -- The Justice Department is suing to block UnitedHealth Group's $3.3 billion purchase of Amedisys, citing concerns the combination would hinder access to home health and hospice services in the U.S.",
      "The antitrust complaint, filed in Maryland by the Justice Department and four states' attorneys general Tuesday, argues that a potential merger is illegal because the two companies are \"such large competitors\" already \u2014 and the deal would give UnitedHealth too much control in many local markets.",
      "That would mean less choice for patients looking for affordable care, the suit alleges, as well as fewer employment options for nurses seeking competitive pay and benefits.",
      "\u201cAmerican healthcare is unwell,\" Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said in a prepared statement. \u201cUnless this $3.3 billion transaction is stopped, UnitedHealth Group will further extend its grip to home health and hospice care, threatening seniors, their families and nurses.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit follows UnitedHealth's acquisition of LHC Group Inc., another home health and hospice provider. Since that transaction's completion last year, the Justice Department said, UnitedHealth and Amedisys have emerged as two of the largest providers of home health and hospice care in the country.",
      "The complaint alleges that UnitedHealth's plan to acquire Amedisys is the result of \"an intentional, sustained strategy of acquiring, rather than beating, competition.\u201d After completing the LHC acquisition, the suit says UnitedHealth prevented Amedisys' 2023 plans to merge with infusion provider OptionCare by paying a \u201cbreakup fee\u201d \u2014 and then separately made its own acquisition offer, which Amedisys eventually accepted.",
      "UnitedHealth is seeking to add Amedisys to Optum, its subsidiary that provides care as well as pharmacy and technology services. In a response Tuesday to the antitrust suit, Optum said the transaction \u201cwould be pro-competitive and further innovation.\u201d It said it plans to \u201cvigorously defend (itself) against the DOJ\u2019s overreaching interpretation of the antitrust laws.\u201d",
      "Amedisys added that it also remains committed to the deal, which it believes \u201cwill create more opportunities to deliver quality, compassionate and value-based care to patients and their families.\u201d",
      "In details about the deal published on Optum's website, the company maintained Optum and Amedisys \u201cwould operate just a fraction\" of all home health and hospice care markets nationwide when combined. Optum also noted plans to divest some of its care centers to home health provider VitalCaring upon the deal's completion. It said the divestments would aid competition but the Justice Department said that the proposal is inadequate.",
      "Beyond its Optum unit, UnitedHealth Group also runs one of the nation\u2019s largest health insurers, UnitedHealthcare. The Minnesota-based healthcare giant reported third-quarter net income of $6.06 billion on revenue of $100.82 billion.",
      "Louisiana-based Amedisys reported third-quarter earnings of $16.9 million and a revenue of $587.7 million for the period.",
      "Tuesday's lawsuit arrives in the final months of the Biden administration, which has been particularly aggressive in antitrust enforcement. In recent years, the Justice Department has also targeted companies accused of engaging in illegal monopolies and driving up prices across industries like entertainment, travel and tech.",
      "The four states\u2019 attorneys general joining Tuesday's suit against UnitedHealth and Amedisys are from Maryland, Illinois, New Jersey and New York."

      "Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz says it's no longer serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools",
      "Food and beverage manufacturer Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that it no longer is serving the Lunchables meals it created for U.S. schools.",
      "The company introduced the two packaged meals \u2014 one starring pizza and the other a turkey, cheddar cheese and cracker plate \u2014 at the beginning of the 2023-2024 academic year. At the time, Kraft Heinz said the offerings were protein-enriched and contained reduced levels of saturated fat and sodium to meet the requirements of the national free and reduced-price school lunch program.",
      "Nutritionists and advocacy groups were not thrilled by the launch. The Center for Science in the Public Interest called having Lunchables in cafeterias \u201ca highly questionable move for school nutrition\u201d that might confuse families into thinking the versions sold at supermarkets were a healthy option.",
      "The drumbeat quickened in April, when Consumer Reports said its tests showed the school-approved Lunchables contained more sodium than the store varieties. The organization also reported that commercially available Lunchables had more lead compared to ready-made meals made several other companies.",
      "Consumer Reports petitioned the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ban Lunchables and similar processed meal kits from schools.",
      "In a statement, Pittsburgh-based Kraft Heinz attributed the decision to pull out of the market served by the National School Lunch Program to a lack of demand. The company described the business impact as \u201cnegligible,\u201d saying sales of the school-designed meals \u201cwere far less than 1% of overall Lunchables sales\u201d during the last academic year.",
      "\u201cLast year, we brought two NSLP compliant Lunchables options to schools that had increased protein. While many school administrators were excited to have these options, the demand did not meet our targets,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis happens occasionally across our broad portfolio, especially as we explore new sales channels. Lunchables products are not available in schools this year and we hope to revisit at a future date.\u201d",
      "The Kraft Heinz Co. produces a wide range of familiar products, including Capri Sun juice pouches, Oscar Meyer hot dogs, Grey Poupon mustard, Kool-Aid and Philadelphia Cream Cheese."

    "story": [
      "A pregnant woman has filed a lawsuit seeking the right to an abortion in Kentucky",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A pregnant woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking to restore the right to an abortion in Kentucky in the latest challenge to the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "The suit, filed in state court in Louisville, claims that Kentucky laws blocking abortions violate the plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights to privacy and self-determination. It asks that both state laws be struck down by a judge in Jefferson County Circuit Court.",
      "The woman, a state resident identified by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy, is about seven weeks pregnant, the suit said. She wants to terminate her pregnancy but cannot legally do so in Kentucky, it said.",
      "The decision about whether to become or remain pregnant is among the \u201cmost personal and consequential decisions a person will make in their lifetime,\u201d the suit said. Her legal team includes attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "\u201cWithout the ability to decide whether to continue a pregnancy, Kentuckians have lost the right to make critical decisions about their health, bodies, lives and futures,\u201d the suit said.",
      "The plaintiff said in a statement that ending her pregnancy is the best decision for her and her family.",
      "\u201cI feel overwhelmed and frustrated that I cannot access abortion care here in my own state, and I have started the difficult process of arranging to get care in another state where it\u2019s legal,\u201d she said in the statement issued by the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cThis involves trying to take time off work and securing child care, all of which place an enormous burden on me.\u201d",
      "Defendants in the latest suit include Russell Coleman, Kentucky\u2019s Republican attorney general.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the attorney general\u2019s responsibility to defend the laws passed by the General Assembly, and we will zealously work to uphold these laws in court,\u201d Coleman said in a statement.",
      "The suit was quickly denounced as meritless by David Walls, executive director of The Family Foundation, a conservative group staunchly opposed to abortion.",
      "\u201cThe ACLU\u2019s suggestion that the Kentucky Constitution somehow secretly contains a hidden right to terminate the life and stop the beating heart of an unborn human being, despite Kentucky\u2019s clear 150-year pro-life history, is absolutely absurd,\u201d Walls said in a statement.",
      "The suit is seeking class-action status to include others who are or will become pregnant and want the right to have an abortion. It is challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities.",
      "The trigger law took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 and bans abortions except to save the life of the patient or to prevent disabling injury. It does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.",
      "The lawsuit is similar to legal action taken nearly a year ago, also by a pregnant woman who sought the right to an abortion in Kentucky. That challenge was dropped after the woman learned her embryo no longer had cardiac activity, but abortion rights groups said the legal fight was far from over.",
      "In 2022, Kentucky voters rejected a ballot measure that would have denied any constitutional protections for abortion, but abortion rights supporters have made no inroads in the Republican-controlled Legislature at chipping away at the laws.",
      "Kentucky's Supreme Court refused last year to halt the near-total ban, resulting in abortion access remaining virtually shut off in the. Abortion rights groups have searched for plaintiffs to challenge the ban.",
      "Brigitte Amiri, deputy director of the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, said Tuesday that bans in Kentucky and elsewhere have \u201cwreaked havoc on people\u2019s lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose who can scrape together the resources may be able to travel out of state to get care, but others will be forced to carry their pregnancies to term against their will, often at great cost to their health or lives,\u201d Amiri said in a statement.",
      "The plaintiff in the new lawsuit said the decision whether to end her pregnancy should be hers.",
      "\"I am bringing this case to ensure that other Kentuckians will not have to go through what I am going through, and instead will be able to get the health care they need in our community,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "New government data shows that U.S. drug overdose deaths appear to be showing a sustained decline",
      "NEW YORK -- The decline in U.S. drug overdose deaths appears to have continued this year, giving experts hope the nation is seeing sustained improvement in the persistent epidemic.",
      "There were about 97,000 overdose deaths in the 12-month period that ended June 30, according to provisional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data released Wednesday. That's down 14% from the estimated 113,000 for the previous 12-month period.",
      "\u201cThis is a pretty stunning and rapid reversal of drug overdose mortality numbers,\u201d said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends.",
      "Overdose death rates began steadily climbing in the 1990s because of opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths led by other opioids like heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. Provisional data had indicated a slight decline for 2023, and the tally released Wednesday showed that the downward trend has kept going.",
      "Of course, there have been moments in the last several years when U.S. overdose deaths seemed to have plateaued or even started to go down, only to rise again, Marshall noted.",
      "\u201cThis seems to be substantial and sustained,\u201d Marshall said. \"I think there's real reason for hope here.\"",
      "Experts aren't certain about the reasons for the decline, but they cite a combination of possible factors.",
      "One is COVID-19. In the worst days of the pandemic, addiction treatment was hard to get and people were socially isolated \u2014 with no one around to help if they overdosed.",
      "\u201cDuring the pandemic we saw such a meteoric rise in drug overdose deaths that it\u2019s only natural we would see a decrease,\u201d said Farida Ahmad of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Still, overdose deaths are well above what they were at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The recent numbers could represent the fruition of years of efforts to increase the availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, and addiction treatments such as buprenorphine, said Erin Winstanley, a University of Pittsburgh professor who researches drug overdose trends.",
      "Marshall said such efforts likely are being aided by money from settlements of opioid-related lawsuits, brought by state, local and Native American governments against drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies. Settlement funds have been rolling out to small towns and big cities across the U.S., and some have started spending the money on naloxone and other measures.",
      "Some experts have wondered about changes in the drug supply. Xylazine, a sedative, has been increasingly detected in illegally manufactured fentanyl, and experts are sorting out exactly how it's affecting overdoses.",
      "In the latest CDC data, overdose death reports are down in 45 states. Increases occurred in Alaska, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington.",
      "The most dramatic decreases were seen in North Carolina and Ohio, but CDC officials voiced a note of caution. Some jurisdictions have had lags in getting death records to federal statisticians \u2014 particularly North Carolina, where death investigations have slowed because of understaffing at the state medical examiner's office. The CDC made estimates to try to account for incomplete death records, but the decline in some places may ultimately turn out not to be as dramatic as initial numbers suggest.",
      "Another limitation of the provisional data is that it doesn't detail what's happening in different groups of people. Recent research noted the overdose deaths in Black and Native Americans have been growing disproportionately larger.",
      "\u201cWe really need more data from the CDC to learn whether these declines are being experienced in all racial ethnic subgroups,\" Marshall said.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- The family of a security guard who was shot and killed at a hospital in Portland, Oregon, sued the facility for $35 million on Tuesday, accusing it of negligence and failing to respond to the dangers that the gunman posed to hospital staff over multiple days.",
      "In a wrongful death complaint filed Tuesday, the estate of Bobby Smallwood argued that Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center failed to enforce its policies against violence and weapons in the workplace by not barring the shooter from the facility, despite staff reporting threats and aggression toward them in the days before the shooting.",
      "\u201cThe repeated failures of Legacy Good Samaritan to follow their own safety protocols directly led to the tragically preventable death of Bobby Smallwood,\u201d Tom D\u2019Amore, the attorney representing the family, said in a statement. \u201cDespite documented threats and abusive behavior that required immediate removal under hospital policy, Legacy allowed a dangerous individual to remain on the premises for three days until those threats escalated to violence.\u201d",
      "In an email, Legacy Health said it was unable to comment on pending litigation.",
      "The shooting at Legacy Good Samaritan Medical Center in Portland was part of a wave of gun violence sweeping through U.S. hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make health care one of the nation\u2019s most violent fields. Health care workers racked up 73% of all nonfatal workplace violence injuries in 2018, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "The gunman at the Portland hospital, PoniaX Calles, first visited the facility on July 19, 2023, as his partner was about to give birth. On July 20 and July 21, nursing staff and security guards filed multiple incident reports describing outbursts, violent behavior and threats, but they weren't accessible or provided to workers who were interacting with him, according to the complaint.",
      "On July 22, nurse supervisors decided to remove Calles from his partner's room, and Smallwood accompanied him to the waiting room area outside the maternity ward. Other security guards searching the room found two loaded firearms in a duffel bag, and his partner told them he likely had a third gun on his person, the complaint said.",
      "According to the complaint, over 40 minutes passed between the discovery of the duffel bag and Smallwood's death. Two minutes before he was shot, a security guard used hand gestures through glass doors to notify him that Calles was armed. Smallwood then told Calles he would pat him down, but Calles said he would leave instead. Smallwood began escorting him out of the hospital, and as other staff members approached them, Calles shot Smallwood in the neck.",
      "The hospital did not call a \u201ccode silver,\u201d the emergency code for an active shooter, until after Smallwood had been shot, the complaint said.",
      "Smallwood's family said his death has profoundly impacted them.",
      "\u201cEvery day we grieve the loss of our son and all the years ahead that should have been his to live,\u201d his parents, Walter \u201cBob\u201d and Tammy Smallwood, said in the statement released by their attorney. \u201cNothing can bring Bobby back, but we will not stop fighting until Legacy is held fully responsible for what they took from our family.\u201d",
      "After the shooting, Legacy said it planned to install additional metal detectors; require bag searches at every hospital; equip more security officers with stun guns; and apply bullet-slowing film to some interior glass and at main entrances.",
      "Around 40 states have passed laws creating or increasing penalties for violence against health care workers, according to the American Nurses Association. Hospitals have armed security officers with batons, stun guns or handguns, while some states allow hospitals to create their own police forces."

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean opposition leader Lee Jae-myung was convicted of violating election law and sentenced to a suspended prison term Friday by a court that ruled he made false statements while denying corruption allegations during a presidential campaign.",
      "If it stands, the ruling could significantly shake up the country\u2019s politics by potentially unseating Lee as a lawmaker and denying him a shot at running for president in the next election. But Lee, who faces three other trials over corruption and other criminal charges, is expected to challenge any guilty verdict and it remains unclear whether the Supreme Court would decide on any of the cases before the presidential vote in March 2027.",

Choo Kyung-ho, the floor leader of Yoon\u2019s People Power Party, said the verdict showed that \u201cjustice was alive\u201d and called for the judiciary to conclude the case swiftly.",
      "The ruling drew intense media coverage and seemingly thousands of protesters. Surrounded by police lines, Lee\u2019s supporters and critics occupied separate streets near the court, shouting opposing slogans and holding signs that said \u201cLee Jae-myung is innocent\u201d and \u201cArrest Lee Jae-myung.\u201d There were no immediate reports of major clashes.",
      "Prosecutors indicted Lee in 2022 over charges that he made false claims related to two controversial development projects in the city of Seongnam, where he was mayor from 2010 to 2018, while campaigning as the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party.",
      "One of the comments cited by prosecutors is related to suspicions that Seongnam city in 2015 changed the land-use designation to allow a housing project on a site previously preserved as green space due to lobbying by private developers.",
      "Lee said during a parliamentary hearing in October 2021 that the city was instead \u201ccoerced\u201d by the national government to make the change to the site in the district of Baekhyeon-dong. Prosecutors say there\u2019s no evidence to back Lee\u2019s claim, which has been denied by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport.",
      "Prosecutors also cited a TV interview Lee gave in December 2021, when he said he didn\u2019t know a senior official at Seongnam city\u2019s urban development arm during his time as mayor. Lee spoke a day after the official was found dead amid an investigation into a property development project in the district of Daejang-dong, which reaped huge profits for a small asset management firm and its affiliates and raised suspicions about possible corrupt links between them, city officials and politicians.",
      "Prosecutors argued that Lee was lying to the public to distance himself from the controversies and improve his chances of winning the election. They had sought a two-year prison sentence for him.",
      "The court found Lee guilty over the comments related to the Baekhyeon-dong project, saying it was clear that the city\u2019s decision to change the site\u2019s land-use designation wasn\u2019t based on demands by the land ministry. It acquitted Lee on most of the charges related to his Daejang-dong comments, citing a lack of evidence.",
      "\u201cWhen false information is distributed to voters during an election process, that could prevent voters from making proper choices and risks distorting the will of the people and damaging the function of the electoral system,\u201d the court said in a statement. \u201cSuch actions cannot be taken lightly.\u201d",
      "The same court on Nov. 25 will rule on another case against Lee. He is accused of suborning perjury by allegedly pressuring a Seongnam city employee to give false testimony in a different court case in 2019. The testimony was meant to downplay his 2003 conviction that, when as a lawyer, he had helped a TV journalist impersonate a prosecutor to secure an interview with then-Seongnam Mayor Kim Byung-ryang over suspected corruption in 2002.",
      "While running for Gyeonggi Province governor in 2018, Lee claimed he had been wrongly accused over the incident, prompting prosecutors to indict him on a charge of making false statements during an election campaign. Lee was acquitted in 2019, partially based on the testimony of the city employee, who had worked as Kim's secretary and said he contemplated dropping charges against the journalist to make Lee the main culprit of the incident.",
      "Prosecutors indicted Lee on the perjury charges in October last year, presenting transcripts of telephone conversations that they said showed Lee persuading the employee to testify in court that he was framed.",
      "A third and more significant trial at the Seoul Central District Court involves various criminal allegations stemming from Lee\u2019s days as Seongnam mayor, including that he provided unlawful favors to private investors involved in the two development projects seen as dubious.",
      "Lee is also facing a trial at the Suwon District Court over allegations that he pressured a local businessman into sending millions of dollars in illegal payments to North Korea as he tried to set up a visit to that country that never materialized.",
      "While denying wrongdoing, Lee has accused the government of Yoon, a prosecutor-turned-president, of pursuing a political vendetta.",
      "Yoon, who has seen his approval ratings drop to the 20s in recent weeks, is grappling with his own political scandal. It centers around allegations that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee exerted inappropriate influence on the People Power Party to pick a certain candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of election broker Myung Tae-kyun, who was arrested this week."

      "BEN GURION INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, Israel -- At Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport, more than a year of war has taken its toll. Global airlines have canceled flights, gates are empty and pictures of hostages still held in the Gaza Strip guide the few arriving passengers to baggage claim.",
      "But one check-in desk remains flush with travelers: the one serving flights to the United Arab Emirates, which have kept up a bridge for Israelis to the outside world throughout the war.",
      "The Emirati flights, in addition to bolstering the airlines' bottom line, have shined a light on the countries\u2019 burgeoning ties \u2014 which have survived the wars raging across the Middle East and could be further strengthened as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to return to office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a political and economic statement,\u201d said Joshua Teitelbaum, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Israel\u2019s Bar-Ilan University. \u201cThey are the main foreign airlines that continue to fly.\u201d",
      "Since the wars began with Hamas\u2019 initial Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, many international airlines have halted, restarted and halted again their flights into Israel\u2019s main gateway to the rest of the world. The concern is real for the carriers, who remember the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine 10 years ago and Iran shooting down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 after takeoff from Tehran in 2020.",
      "But FlyDubai, the sister airline to the long-haul carrier Emirates, has kept up multiple flights daily and kept Israel connected to the wider world even as its other low-cost competitors have stopped flights. Abu Dhabi\u2019s Etihad has continued its flights as well.",
      "While maintaining the flight schedule remains politically important for the UAE after its 2020 diplomatic recognition of Israel, it also provided a further shot in the arm for revenues \u2014 particularly for FlyDubai.",
      "Since the wars started, international carriers such as Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc., Germany\u2019s Lufthansa and other major airlines halted their flights. Some resumed, only to stop again after Iran\u2019s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack on Israel and Israel\u2019s Oct. 26 retaliatory strike on the Islamic Republic. Tehran has threatened to strike Israel again.",
      "That\u2019s brought major business to Israel's national carrier El Al, which had struggled in the coronavirus pandemic and prior years. The airline posted its best-ever half-year results this year, recording a $227 million profit as compared to $58 million profit in the same period last year. El Al stock has risen by as much 200% over the last year, as compared to a 29% rise in the wider Tel Aviv 125 stock market index.",
      "El Al, however, lacks the routes and connections of major international carriers. Low-cost carriers as well have stopped flying into Israel during periods of the war, sending the price of El Al tickets ever higher. Passenger numbers through Ben Gurion halved compared to the same period the year before, El Al said in its second-quarter financial results.",
      "However, FlyDubai has kept flying. The carrier has operated over 1,800 flights to Israel since October last year, cancelling only 77 flights overall, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. In September alone, it flew over 200 flights.",
      "As a line snaked toward the FlyDubai check-in counters at Ben Gurion Airport, UAE-bound Motti Eis said the flights were \"a symbol that the Emirates countries decided to keep the peace.\u201d",
      "FlyDubai declined to answer questions from The Associated Press about the flights.",
      "Etihad, the flag carrier for Abu Dhabi, has kept flying into Tel Aviv, but the number of its flights has been dwarfed by FlyDubai. FlyDubai had 3.6% market share at Ben Gurion, compared to El Al\u2019s 43.2% in the second half of 2024. However, at least two of the foreign low-cost airlines with greater market, Wizz Air and Blue Bird, stopped flying for extended periods this year.",
      "Etihad said it maintains a close watch on the situation in the region, but continues its daily flights to and from Tel Aviv.",
      "\u201cBen Gurion International Airport remains open, employing best practices in safety and security practices, enabling Etihad and other airlines to provide essential air connectivity as long as it is secure to do so,\u201d the airline said in a statement.",
      "But beyond the financial impact, the decision also takes root in the UAE\u2019s decision to recognize Israel in 2020, under agreements brokered by then President Trump known as the Abraham Accords. While Abu Dhabi has repeatedly expressed concern and outrage as Israel\u2019s conduct during the wars, Israel\u2019s Consulate in Dubai and Embassy remain open in the country.",
      "And while Dubai broadly speaking remains focused on business in the country, Abu Dhabi\u2019s focus long has been on its geopolitical aims \u2014 which since the 2011 Arab Spring have been squarely focused on challenging Islamist movements, and those who back them, in the wider region. The UAE, a hereditary autocracy, long has viewed those groups as serious challenges to its power.",
      "The Emirati government, in response to questions from the AP over the flights, sent a story published by its state-run WAM news agency about its participation in a Nov. 1 conference in Riyadh in support of a two-state solution to the decadeslong Israel-Palestinian crisis. The UAE has called repeatedly for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, along with the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "However, likely given the wider anger in the Arab world over Israel\u2019s devastating militant campaign in Gaza, Dubai International Airport no longer advertises on its electronic billboard the location of the check-in for Tel Aviv. It sits in a distant corner of one of the airport\u2019s terminals, next to a Dubai police stand. Private security guards also keep watch over the line, while individuals who appeared to be undercover police officers watched the gate, a higher level of security than normally noticed at the airport.",
      "But in the lines, Hebrew and Arabic can be heard and those traveling routinely have their blue-backed Israeli passports out in their hands.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a symbol of the UAE\u2019s commitment to the relationship,\u201d said Dina Esfandiary, a senior advisor on the Middle East at the International Crisis Group, a think tank. \u201cNo matter what happens, no matter where the war goes, no matter how much Israel flouts international law, the UAE has decided that this is a step they took, that the relationship remains beneficial to them.\u201d",

      "The annual gathering brings together countries and members that jointly account for almost two-thirds of global GDP and half the world's trade, according to organizers. They confirmed heads of government attending in Lima include outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, China's President Xi Jinping, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, among others, as the world wonders how a new U.S. government might upend global dynamics.",
      "Leaders and other representatives will hold closed-door discussions in the morning among themselves, and in the afternoon with members of APEC's business advisory council. The council met Wednesday and called on APEC nations and members to boost inclusive growth and prioritize the needs of micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, particularly those led by women and Indigenous entrepreneurs.",
      "\u201cWhile the global economy remains resilient, APEC economies are grappling with persistent inflation, economic disparities, high interest rates and the urgent need to increase investments for a green, climate-resilient future,\u201d said council chairwoman Julia Torreblanca.",
      "APEC is bound to be one of Biden's last before leaving office, and White House officials insist that his attendance as well as his subsequent visit to Brazil for the Group of 20 meeting next week will be substantive, with talks to focus on climate issues, global infrastructure, counter-narcotic efforts. For the first time since last year\u2019s APEC forum, Biden will meet one-on-one with Chinese President Xi on Saturday. He will also meet with South Korea\u2019s Yoon Suk Yeol, Japan\u2019s Shigeru Ishiba and Peru\u2019s President Dina Boluarte.",
      "The officials say Biden also will use the summits to press allies to keep up support for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia\u2019s invasion and persist in negotiating an end to Israel's wars in Lebanon and Gaza.",
      "Still, analysts say he will be overshadowed at APEC by Xi, who arrived Thursday and proceeded to inaugurate a $1.3 billion megaport that is perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America\u2019s ongoing reorientation in the region.",
      "The Chancay port will shave 10 days off shipping times to China, which has seen trade with South America boom over the past two decades. Peru\u2019s economy minister in June said neighboring nations are actively modifying their supply chains to benefit from the port, in which total investment will top $3.5 billion.",
      "Ahead of the inauguration at the port, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Lima, locals told The Associated Press that the development hasn't buoyed their economic prospects. On the contrary, they said the port has impaired their ability to fish, threatening their livelihoods.",
      "Discontent has been brewing in the middle-class San Borja neighborhood outside Lima\u2019s Convention Center, where the APEC conference is sited. Metal barriers and police equipped with riot gear surround the perimeter where, for the past two days, anti-government protesters angry about a recent spate of gang-fueled violence have shouted slogans demanding that their wildly unpopular presiden t take action against the crime wave.",
      "The rallies have devolved into scuffles with police, who used batons to drive away the more aggressive protesters on Thursday.",

      "The Samagi Jana Balawegaya, or United People's Power Party, led by opposition leader Sajith Premedasa had 31 seats.",
      "Dissanayake was elected president on Sept. 21 in a rejection of traditional political parties that have governed the island nation since its independence from British rule in 1948. But he received just 42% of the votes, fueling questions over his party\u2019s outlook in Thursday\u2019s parliamentary elections.

      "The victory in Jaffna marks a great dent for traditional ethnic Tamil parties that have dominated the politics of the north since independence.",
      "It is also a major shift in the attitude of Tamils, who have long been suspicious of majority ethnic Sinhalese leaders. Ethnic Tamil rebels fought an unsuccessful civil war in 1983-2009 to create a separate homeland, saying they were being marginalized by governments controlled by Sinhalese.",

      "Dissanayake said during the presidential campaign that he planned to propose significant changes to the targets set in the IMF deal, which his predecessor, Ranil Wickremesinghe, signed, saying it placed too much burden on the people. However, he has since changed his stance and says Sri Lanka will go along with the agreement.",
      "Sri Lanka\u2019s crisis was largely the result of economic mismanagement combined with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which along with 2019 militant attacks devastated its important tourism industry. The pandemic also disrupted the flow of remittances from Sri Lankans working abroad.",

      "Sri Lanka\u2019s economic upheaval led to a political crisis that forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to resign in 2022. Parliament then elected Wickremesinghe to replace him.,",
      "The economy was stabilized, inflation dropped, the rupee strengthened and foreign reserves increased under Wickremesinghe.

      "BAMAKO, Mali -- After years of serving as Mali's minister of the environment, Aida M'bo now spends her time planting trees in a fight that many in the arid West African country acknowledge they are losing.",
      "\u201cDeforestation is an important issue in Mali,\u201d she said, standing in front of the Zamblara forest. For decades it has been classified as protected, but like many forests in the vast Sahel, it could be wiped out.",
      "\u201cIt is mainly due to the excessive wood-cutting,\u201d M'bo said.",
      "Even some of her fellow tree-planters that day were to blame. Salimata Diabate, who took part in the ceremony last month, lives nearby and sells firewood from the forest in the Sikasso region, long considered Mali\u2019s breadbasket.",
      "While Diabate expressed concern about the threats to Mali\u2019s forests, she said people like her in the countryside have no choice but firewood for cooking.",
      "\u201cThings like cooking gas and solar panels are better, but it\u2019s too expensive for rural women,\u201d she said.",
      "The loss of forests has become a pressing issue across Africa as the Sahara Desert continues to creep southward. Over the last three decades, nearly 7,722 square miles (20,000 square kilometers) of forest have been lost in Mali, according to the environmental nonprofit Tree Aid.",
      "M'bo's nonprofit, Energia, is financially supported by the Great Green Wall, an initiative by African countries launched in 2007 that aims to plant trees in a nearly 5,000-mile line across the continent, creating a natural barrier to hold back the desert as climate change sweeps the sands south.",
      "But millions of the trees died as temperatures rose and rainfall diminished. As a result, only 4% of the Great Green Wall\u2019s original goal has been met, and an estimated $43 billion would be needed to achieve the rest.",
      "In Mali, the initiative is facing an additional challenge : the population\u2019s dependency on firewood.",
      "Lassana Coulibaly, who lives in the town of Senou near the capital, Bamako, spends his days chopping up and reselling wood he buys from people who cut it from a nearby forest.",
      "\u201cThis how we make a living on a daily basis,\u201d he said. He doesn\u2019t believe the forest will disappear.",
      "A 2019 study by the African Energy Commission found that 64% of Mali\u2019s total fuel consumption was of biomass, primarily firewood and charcoal for household use. Their sale remains legal.",
      "Despite being one of Africa\u2019s top gold producers, Mali ranks among the world's least developed nations, with almost half of its 23 million population living below the national poverty line. The problem is worse in rural areas, where subsistence farming \u2014 many people's only real option for survival \u2014 is threatened by armed conflict and climate change.",
      "The country has been plagued by an insurgency fought by armed groups, including some allied with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, and two military coups since 2020.",
      "Mali is also among several countries in the Sahel that have experienced record-breaking floods this year, with more than 1,000 people killed and hundreds of thousands displaced across the region.",
      "Khady Camara, an environmental activist based in Senegal, said forests can help to weather the effects of climate change by absorbing water to prevent floods, and by absorbing carbon that would otherwise end up in the atmosphere as part of heat-trapping gas.",

      "TOKYO -- Japanese Princess Yuriko, the wife of wartime Emperor Hirohito\u2019s brother and the oldest member of the imperial family, has died after her health deteriorated recently, palace officials said. She was 101.",
      "Yuriko died Friday at a Tokyo hospital, the Imperial Household Agency said. It did not announce the cause of death, but Japanese media said she died of pneumonia.",
      "Born in 1923 as an aristocrat, Yuriko married at age 18 to Prince Mikasa, the younger brother of Hirohito and the uncle of current Emperor Naruhito, months before the start of World War II.",
      "She has recounted living in a shelter with her husband and their baby daughter after their residence was burned down in the U.S. fire bombings of Tokyo in the final months of the war in 1945.",
      "Yuriko raised five children and supported Mikasa\u2019s research into ancient Near Eastern history, while also serving her official duties and taking part in philanthropic activities, including promotion of maternal and child health. She outlived her husband and all three sons.",
      "Her death reduces Japan\u2019s rapidly dwindling imperial family to 16 people, including four men, as the country faces the dilemma of how to maintain the royal family while conservatives in the governing party insist on retaining male-only succession.",
      "The 1947 Imperial House Law, which largely preserves conservative prewar family values, allows only males to take the throne and forces female royal family members who marry commoners to lose their royal status.",
      "The youngest male member of the imperial family, Prince Hisahito \u2014 the nephew of Emperor Naruhito \u2014 is currently the last heir apparent, posing a major problem for a system that doesn\u2019t allow empresses. The government is debating how to keep succession stable without relying on women.",

She enjoyed exercise in the morning while watching a daily fitness program on television, the Imperial Household Agency says. She also continued to read multiple newspapers and magazines and enjoyed watching news and baseball on TV. On sunny days, she sat in the palace garden or was wheeled in her wheelchair.",
      "Yuriko was hospitalized after her stroke and had been in and out of intensive care since then. Her overall condition deteriorated over the past week, the Imperial Household Agency said."

      "Even though fewer camels are being traded now, the state government has worked to turn the fair into a big tourist attraction. On the large sandy plain where the fair is held, large Ferris wheels are installed and dozens of stalls are set up to sell local handicrafts. Men with impressive moustaches compete for a prize, and tourists are encouraged to take selfies with them.",

      "TOKYO -- Japan\u2019s economy eked out an annual rate of 0.9% growth in the July-September period as consumer spending held up, government data showed Friday.",
      "The world\u2019s fourth-largest economy grew 0.2% in the fiscal second quarter, marking the second straight quarter of expansion, following 0.5% growth in April-June.",
      "Seasonally adjusted gross domestic product, or GDP, measures the value of a nation\u2019s products and services. The annual rate shows how much the economy would have grown or contracted, if the quarterly rate continued for a year.",
      "Domestic demand grew at an annualized rate of 2.5%. Private consumption, which makes up more than half of Japan\u2019s GDP, grew 3.6% on the back of healthy household consumption, according to preliminary Cabinet Office data.",
      "Recent data show wages and employment are improving. Spending was lower than the previous quarter, partly because of severe weather that crimped spending and shut down some factories. Recent income tax reductions helped boost spending.",
      "Exports grew 1.5%. The weakening yen is a plus for exports, tending to make Japanese products cheaper overseas. But the impact was relatively limited in the latest quarter. The Japanese yen was trading at 160-yen levels earlier this year. It\u2019s now trading at 150-yen levels.",
      "Prior to the last two quarters, the economy contracted 0.6% in the January-March quarter after recording a 0.1% growth in October-December in 2023, highlighting how Japan\u2019s economy recently slipped into periods of contraction in between weak expansion.",

      "The high-profile Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima has thrust one of the world\u2019s least popular presidents into the limelight",
      "LIMA, Peru -- It was a big day for Peru\u2019s accidental president, Dina Boluarte, whose official schedule has been blank for months.",
      "On Thursday, the high-profile Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Lima thrust Boluarte \u2014 among the world's least popular presidents, with a mere 4% public approval rating \u2014 into the bright lights of a convention center packed with world leaders, prominent CEOs and visiting dignitaries.",
      "It's not just that Boluarte, long a low-profile and low-paid civil servant, has never before rolled out the red carpet for powerful leaders like U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping since taking office in December 2022. It's that she has hardly been seen outside her brick mansion in weeks. Local journalists count more than 100 days since she last spoke to a reporter.",
      "Her recent reclusion is not especially surprising. She became president because she was the vice-president of Pedro Castillo, a former rural schoolteacher with no previous political experience who was ousted when he tried to dissolve Congress and disband the courts. A wave of violent protests rocked the country, marring Boluarte's first weeks in power.",
      "The president's popularity tanked even more in March, when the sight of Rolex watches gleaming from her wrist prompted police to raid her home and prosecutors to launch an investigation into her alleged unlawful enrichment.",
      "A survey by polling company Ipsos showed her approval drop to just 4%. The poll was conducted Oct. 10-11, with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points. No president in Peru has had a worse rating in at least 40 years.",
      "Powerful lawmakers satisfied with their lavish salaries have resisted calls to impeach her but quietly absorbed most of her duties, leaving Boluarte with little to do.",
      "The latest lightning rod for public ire has been a growing trend of violent extortion by criminal gangs in Lima's hardscrabble outskirts. Protesters accusing the government of indifference to rising crime have taken to the streets across Peru.",
      "On Wednesday, protesters blocked highways and rallied in Peru's southeast Arequipa region, drawing a police crackdown that left six injured by rubber bullets. Lima residents also took advantage of the international spotlight to stage protests this week while Biden and 20 other world leaders prepared to gather for the APEC summit.",
      "After a string of killings targeting bus drivers who failed to pay extortion money last month sent a chill through Lima, public transport drivers launched several strikes that paralyzed the city of 10 million. The government has declared a state of emergency and promised a strong response, but the persistence of violent attacks has sharpened anger against Boluarte.",
      "Fearing all that could go wrong in yanking Peru's wildly unpopular leader out of the shadows and onto the world stage this week, the government left nothing to chance.",
      "Authorities declared Thursday through Saturday as nonworking holidays and closed schools, ordering millions of school children and civil servants to stay home the entire week to keep the streets clear. At a highway underpass near the convention center hosting APEC on Monday, workers scrubbed the spray-painted slogan \u201cDina Asesina,\u201d or \u201cDina, the Murderer\u201d from a concrete wall.",
      "\u201cThe event is certainly important for Peru, but the government is so scared of losing control of the streets that it\u2019s overreacting, putting inappropriate measures in place,\u201d said Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru.",
      "Officials have pleaded with citizens not to protest.",
      "\u201cIt would be very regrettable if, in the days that we receive visitors from the world's 21 most powerful economies, we show a bad spectacle, a spectacle of conflict,\u201d Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzen said in a recent press conference. President Boluarte went further, branding protests \u201ctraitors.\"",
      "On Thursday, protesters said that the specter of conflict at APEC was exactly what they wanted.",
      "As Boluarte, donning a sparkly pink dress and pearls, greeted Chinese President Xi with a ceremonial honor guard and trumpet flourish, riot police scuffled with anti-government protesters a few blocks away.",
      "\u201cShe's trying to take advantage of this moment in front of the TV cameras to pretend she's the president of Peru,\u201d said Betty Mendoza, a 35-year-old protester brandishing portraits of the 50 civilian demonstrators killed in the 2022 social unrest.",
      "\u201cShe does not represent us,\u201d Mendoza said of Boluarte. \u201cWe did not elect her.\u201d",
      "At one point Thursday, masked protesters surged toward a line of police near the conference site, shoving officers who pushed back and beat them with batons. Medics rushed to attend to several teenage boys clutching their heads and yelping in pain.",
      "\u201cMy grandson is growing up in a country where violence is being normalized,\u201d said 54-year-old Freda Reyes, who had come to protest from the eastern working-class district of Santa Anita where she said 10 of her neighbors had been killed by criminal gangs this month.",
      "The last time Peru hosted APEC, in 2016, a wave of protests similarly sprung up around the country. At the time, workers were striking over their low salaries and Lima residents venting over their city's notoriously derelict public infrastructure.",
      "That remains a concern. On Wednesday, a fire raced up the sides of a multi-story plastic toy warehouse and engulfed six other houses near the presidential palace, causing no injuries but raising a pall of black smoke visible from the red carpet where Boluarte was bestowing a medal on her Malaysian counterpart.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea tested exploding drones designed to crash into targets and leader Kim Jong Un called for accelerating mass production of the weapons, state media said Friday.",
      "The country\u2019s latest military demonstration came as the United States, South Korea and Japan engaged in combined military exercises involving advanced fighter jets and a U.S. aircraft carrier in nearby international waters, in a display of their defense posture against North Korea.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency published photos of Kim talking with officials near at least two different types of unmanned aerial vehicles. They included those with X-shaped tails and wings that look similar to the ones the country disclosed in August, when Kim inspected another demonstration of drones that explode on impact.",
      "The drones flew various routes and accurately struck targets, KCNA said. Its images showed what appeared to be a BMW sedan being destroyed and old models of tanks being blown up.",
      "Kim expressed satisfaction with the weapons\u2019 development process and stressed the need to \u201cbuild a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production,\u201d noting how drones are becoming crucial in modern warfare.",
      "KCNA paraphrased Kim as saying drones were easy to make at low cost for a range of military activities. The report didn\u2019t say if Kim spoke directly about rival South Korea, which the North Korean drones are apparently designed to target.",
      "North Korea last month accused South Korea of sending its own drones to drop anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets over the North's capital of Pyongyang, and threatened to respond with force if such flights occur again. South Korea\u2019s military has refused to confirm whether or not the North\u2019s claims were true.",
      "Tensions in the region have escalated as Kim flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program, which includes various nuclear-capable weapons targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially reach the U.S. mainland.",
      "Kim is also allegedly sending military equipment and troops to Russia to support President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine, which raised concerns in Seoul that he would get Russian technology in return to further develop his arsenal.",
      "In addition to his intensifying nuclear threats, Kim has also engaged in psychological and electronic warfare against South Korea, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash in the South and disrupting GPS signals from border areas near the South\u2019s biggest airport.",
      "South Korean officials say North Korea will be a key topic in a trilateral summit between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba this week at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Peru.",

      "The Australian government's plan to ban children from social media to protect them from harm has won almost universal political support",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- How do you remove children from the harms of social media? Politically the answer appears simple in Australia, but practically the solution could be far more difficult.",
      "The Australian government\u2019s plan to ban children from social media platforms including X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram until their 16th birthdays is politically popular. The opposition party says it would have done the same after winning elections due within months if the government hadn\u2019t moved first.",
      "The leaders of all eight Australian states and mainland territories have unanimously backed the plan, although Tasmania, the smallest state, would have preferred the threshold was set at 14.",
      "But a vocal assortment of experts in the fields of technology and child welfare have responded with alarm. More than 140 such experts signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemning the 16-year age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Details of what is proposed and how it will be implemented are scant. More will be known when legislation is introduced into the Parliament next week.",
      "Leo Puglisi, a 17-year-old Melbourne student who founded online streaming service 6 News Australia at the age of 11, laments that lawmakers imposing the ban lack the perspective on social media that young people have gained by growing up in the digital age.",
      "\u201cWith respect to the government and prime minister, they didn\u2019t grow up in the social media age, they\u2019re not growing up in the social media age, and what a lot of people are failing to understand here is that, like it or not, social media is a part of people\u2019s daily lives,\u201d Leo said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of their communities, it\u2019s part of work, it\u2019s part of entertainment, it\u2019s where they watch content \u2013 young people aren\u2019t listening to the radio or reading newspapers or watching free-to-air TV \u2013 and so it can\u2019t be ignored. The reality is this ban, if implemented, is just kicking the can down the road for when a young person goes on social media,\u201d Leo added.",
      "Leo has been applauded for his work online. He was a finalist in his home state Victoria's nomination for the Young Australian of the Year award, which will be announced in January. His nomination bid credits his platform with \u201cfostering a new generation of informed, critical thinkers.\u201d",
      "One of the proposal's supporters, cyber safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, knows from personal tragedy how dangerous social media can be for children.",
      "Her 15-year-old daughter Carly Ryan was murdered in 2007 in South Australia state by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online. In a grim milestone of the digital age, Carly was the first person in Australia to be killed by an online predator.",
      "\u201cKids are being exposed to harmful pornography, they\u2019re being fed misinformation, there are body image issues, there\u2019s sextortion, online predators, bullying. There are so many different harms for them to try and manage and kids just don\u2019t have the skills or the life experience to be able to manage those well,\u201d Sonya Ryan said.",
      "\u201cThe result of that is we\u2019re losing our kids. Not only what happened to Carly, predatory behavior, but also we\u2019re seeing an alarming rise in suicide of young people,\u201d she added.",
      "Sonya Ryan is part of a group advising the government on a national strategy to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse in Australia.",
      "She wholeheartedly supports Australia setting the social media age limit at 16.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get this perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to make sure that there are mechanisms in place to deal with what we already have which is an anxious generation and an addicted generation of children to social media.\"",
      "A major concern for social media users of all ages is the legislation\u2019s potential privacy implications.",
      "Age estimation technology has proved inaccurate, so digital identification appears to be the most likely option for assuring a user is at least 16.",
      "Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, an office that describes itself as the world\u2019s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, has suggested in planning documents adopting the role of authenticator. The government would hold the identity data and the platforms would discover through the commissioner whether a potential account holder was 16.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippine navy transported food and other supplies to a territorial ship outpost in a shoal in the South China Sea without any confrontation with Chinese forces guarding the disputed area, officials said Friday.",
      "The Philippine delivery of supplies and military personnel on Thursday to the Second Thomas Shoal was the third such trip that did not lead to any confrontation since July, when both sides signed a rare deal to stop an alarming spike in violent confrontations.",
      "\u201cThe Armed Forces of the Philippines continues to uphold its mandate of safeguarding Philippine sovereignty and ensuring the welfare of its stationed personnel in the West Philippine Sea,\u201d military spokesperson Col. Xerxes Trinidad said, using the Philippine name for the South China Sea.",
      "\u201cThere were no untoward incidents during the mission,\u201d Trinidad said.",
      "The Philippines occupied the shoal by permanently beaching a navy ship in its shallows in 1999, prompting China, which also claims it, to surround the atoll with its coast guard and naval forces in what has been a continuing territorial standoff.",
      "Called Ayungin by the Philippines and Ren\u2019ai Jiao by China, the shoal had been the most dangerous flashpoint in the South China Sea and became the scene of increasingly violent confrontations starting last year that alarmed other governments, led by the United States.",
      "The deal, which has not been made public, outlines a temporary arrangement that lets the Philippines transport supplies and fresh batches of Filipino forces to Manila's ship outpost without clashing with China\u2019s coast guard, navy and suspected militia ships guarding the shoal.",
      "Neither side conceded its territorial claims under the deal, which only applies to the Second Thomas Shoal, according to Philippine officials.",
      "The agreement was reached after China agreed to drop a demand for the Philippines to notify China in advance of any trip to the shoal and for Chinese forces to board Philippine supply vessels for inspection, two Philippine officials told The Associated Press in July. They spoke on condition of anonymity for lack of authority to discuss the negotiations publicly.",
      "It\u2019s the first known agreement by China with any one rival claimant country over a specific shoal in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety.",
      "Before the deal was reached, Chinese coast guard and navy forces had used powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers to prevent Philippine supply vessels from reaching Manila\u2019s fragile outpost at the shoal \u2014 the long-grounded and rusting warship, the BRP Sierra Madre.",
      "In the worst confrontation, Chinese forces on speedboats repeatedly rammed and then boarded two Philippine navy boats on June 17 to prevent Filipino personnel from transferring food and other supplies including firearms to the BRP Sierra Madre, the Philippine military said.",
      "The Chinese forces seized the Philippine navy boats and damaged them with machetes and improvised spears. They also seized seven M4 rifles, which were packed in cases, and other supplies in a chaotic faceoff that wounded several Filipino navy personnel. The assault was captured in video and photos that were later made public by Philippine officials.",
      "China and the Philippines blamed each other for the confrontation. The United States, Japan and Australia were among those who condemned the Chinese actions at the shoal.",
      "While clashes have stopped at the Second Thomas Shoal, sporadic confrontations have continued elsewhere in the South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan and, at times, Indonesia, have also been involved in the long-seething territorial disputes in the busy waterway."

      "The men were \u201cvictims of forced disappearance by members of the Guatemalan army,\u201d the court\u2019s decision said, adding that the state did not investigate, judge or sanction those responsible.",
      "The Costa Rica-based court said in its ruling that the Guatemalan government must take the steps necessary to establish what happened to the victims and punish those responsible.",
      "Agapito P\u00e9rez Lucas, Nicol\u00e1s Mateo, Macario P\u00fa Chival\u00e1n and Luis Ruiz Luis had been threatened by government agents for their human rights work, the court said.",

      "\u201cThe most important thing is that this is a clear message to the military elite that has disrupted justice by making all kinds of maneuvers so that in Guatemala impunity reigns,\u201d M\u00e9ndez said. \u201cIt is a message for the justice system that has been complacent with human rights violators from the 36 years of armed conflict.\u201d",

      "Renz died Monday, according to Peter Gehrig, a close friend for 50 years and a former AP colleague who lived in the same senior citizen residence in Frankfurt. No cause of death was given.",
      "Widely known as \u201cUli,\u201d Renz began working for the AP in Germany in 1971, after a stint at United Press International. At AP, he first worked on the foreign desk and eventually headed the German-language service at its Frankfurt headquarters from 1986-92.",

      "The 1963-65 trial in Frankfurt of 22 men who helped run the Auschwitz death camp in Germany-occupied Poland was one of the biggest following the Allies\u2019 Nuremberg war crimes trials immediately after World War II. It confronted people in then-West Germany with the Nazi past and is credited as a turning point in German efforts to address the crimes of that period.",
      "After retiring in 1992, Renz devoted his time to researching the life of Georg Elser, a carpenter who tried to kill Hitler in Munich but was thwarted because the Nazi leader unexpectedly left the room minutes before a bomb exploded. Renz published several books on Elser\u2018s life and the failed attempt, gaining recognition from scholars and political leaders. He was honored with the German Cross of Honor for his work.",
      "\u201cRenz\u2019s passion for researching the Third Reich sprang at least partly from his father\u2019s refusal to talk about his own role in it as a civilian administrator in Nazi-occupied Poland,\u201d Gehrig said. \u201cAcross vanquished Germany, there wasn\u2019t much interest into digging into the dark past.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a political and economic statement,\u201d said Joshua Teitelbaum, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at Israel\u2019s Bar-Ilan University. \u201cThey are the main foreign airlines that continue to fly.\u201d",
      "Since the wars began with Hamas\u2019 initial Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, many international airlines have halted, restarted and halted again their flights into Israel\u2019s main gateway to the rest of the world. The concern is real for the carriers, who remember the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine 10 years ago and Iran shooting down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 after takeoff from Tehran in 2020.",
      "But FlyDubai, the sister airline to the long-haul carrier Emirates, has kept up multiple flights daily and kept Israel connected to the wider world even as its other low-cost competitors have stopped flights. Abu Dhabi\u2019s Etihad has continued its flights as well.",
      "While maintaining the flight schedule remains politically important for the UAE after its 2020 diplomatic recognition of Israel, it also provided a further shot in the arm for revenues \u2014 particularly for FlyDubai.",
      "Since the wars started, international carriers such as Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines Inc., Germany\u2019s Lufthansa and other major airlines halted their flights. Some resumed, only to stop again after Iran\u2019s Oct. 1 ballistic missile attack on Israel and Israel\u2019s Oct. 26 retaliatory strike on the Islamic Republic. Tehran has threatened to strike Israel again.",
      "That\u2019s brought major business to Israel's national carrier El Al, which had struggled in the coronavirus pandemic and prior years.

El Al stock has risen by as much 200% over the last year, as compared to a 29% rise in the wider Tel Aviv 125 stock market index.",

Low-cost carriers as well have stopped flying into Israel during periods of the war, sending the price of El Al tickets ever higher. Passenger numbers through Ben Gurion halved compared to the same period the year before, El Al said in its second-quarter financial results.",

      "Etihad, the flag carrier for Abu Dhabi, has kept flying into Tel Aviv, but the number of its flights has been dwarfed by FlyDubai. FlyDubai had 3.6% market share at Ben Gurion, compared to El Al\u2019s 43.2% in the second half of 2024. However, at least two of the foreign low-cost airlines with greater market, Wizz Air and Blue Bird, stopped flying for extended periods this year.",
      "Etihad said it maintains a close watch on the situation in the region, but continues its daily flights to and from Tel Aviv.",

      "But beyond the financial impact, the decision also takes root in the UAE\u2019s decision to recognize Israel in 2020, under agreements brokered by then President Trump known as the Abraham Accords. While Abu Dhabi has repeatedly expressed concern and outrage as Israel\u2019s conduct during the wars, Israel\u2019s Consulate in Dubai and Embassy remain open in the country.",
      "And while Dubai broadly speaking remains focused on business in the country, Abu Dhabi\u2019s focus long has been on its geopolitical aims \u2014 which since the 2011 Arab Spring have been squarely focused on challenging Islamist movements, and those who back them, in the wider region. The UAE, a hereditary autocracy, long has viewed those groups as serious challenges to its power.",
      "The Emirati government, in response to questions from the AP over the flights, sent a story published by its state-run WAM news agency about its participation in a Nov. 1 conference in Riyadh in support of a two-state solution to the decadeslong Israel-Palestinian crisis. The UAE has called repeatedly for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, along with the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "However, likely given the wider anger in the Arab world over Israel\u2019s devastating militant campaign in Gaza, Dubai International Airport no longer advertises on its electronic billboard the location of the check-in for Tel Aviv. It sits in a distant corner of one of the airport\u2019s terminals, next to a Dubai police stand. Private security guards also keep watch over the line, while individuals who appeared to be undercover police officers watched the gate, a higher level of security than normally noticed at the airport.",
      "But in the lines, Hebrew and Arabic can be heard and those traveling routinely have their blue-backed Israeli passports out in their hands.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a symbol of the UAE\u2019s commitment to the relationship,\u201d said Dina Esfandiary, a senior advisor on the Middle East at the International Crisis Group, a think tank. \u201cNo matter what happens, no matter where the war goes, no matter how much Israel flouts international law, the UAE has decided that this is a step they took, that the relationship remains beneficial to them.\u201d",

      "The annual gathering brings together countries and members that jointly account for almost two-thirds of global GDP and half the world's trade, according to organizers. They confirmed heads of government attending in Lima include outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden, China's President Xi Jinping, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, among others, as the world wonders how a new U.S. government might upend global dynamics.",
      "Leaders and other representatives will hold closed-door discussions in the morning among themselves, and in the afternoon with members of APEC's business advisory council. The council met Wednesday and called on APEC nations and members to boost inclusive growth and prioritize the needs of micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises, particularly those led by women and Indigenous entrepreneurs.",
      "\u201cWhile the global economy remains resilient, APEC economies are grappling with persistent inflation, economic disparities, high interest rates and the urgent need to increase investments for a green, climate-resilient future,\u201d said council chairwoman Julia Torreblanca.",
      "APEC is bound to be one of Biden's last before leaving office, and White House officials insist that his attendance as well as his subsequent visit to Brazil for the Group of 20 meeting next week will be substantive, with talks to focus on climate issues, global infrastructure, counter-narcotic efforts. For the first time since last year\u2019s APEC forum, Biden will meet one-on-one with Chinese President Xi on Saturday.

      "Still, analysts say he will be overshadowed at APEC by Xi, who arrived Thursday and proceeded to inaugurate a $1.3 billion megaport that is perhaps the clearest sign of Latin America\u2019s ongoing reorientation in the region.",
      "The Chancay port will shave 10 days off shipping times to China, which has seen trade with South America boom over the past two decades. Peru\u2019s economy minister in June said neighboring nations are actively modifying their supply chains to benefit from the port, in which total investment will top $3.5 billion.",
      "Ahead of the inauguration at the port, 60 kilometers (37 miles) north of Lima, locals told The Associated Press that the development hasn't buoyed their economic prospects. On the contrary, they said the port has impaired their ability to fish, threatening their livelihoods.",
      "Discontent has been brewing in the middle-class San Borja neighborhood outside Lima\u2019s Convention Center, where the APEC conference is sited. Metal barriers and police equipped with riot gear surround the perimeter where, for the past two days, anti-government protesters angry about a recent spate of gang-fueled violence have shouted slogans demanding that their wildly unpopular presiden t take action against the crime wave.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Enbridge's contentious plan to reroute an aging pipeline around a northern Wisconsin tribal reservation moved closer to reality Thursday after the company won its first permits from state regulators.",
      "Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources officials announced they have issued construction permits for the Line 5 reroute around the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation. The energy company still needs discharge permits from the DNR as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.",
      "The project has generated fierce opposition. The tribe wants the pipeline off its land, but tribal members and environmentalists maintain rerouting construction will damage the region's watershed and perpetuate the use of fossil fuels.",
      "The DNR issued the construction permits with more than 200 conditions attached. The company must complete the project by Nov. 14, 2027, hire DNR-approved environmental monitors and allow DNR employees to access the site during reasonable hours.",
      "The company also must notify the agency within 24 hours of any permit violations or hazardous material spills affecting wetlands or waterways; can\u2019t discharge any drilling mud into wetlands, waterways or sensitive areas; keep spill response equipment at workspace entry and exit points; and monitor for the introduction and spread in invasive plant species.",
      "Enbridge officials issued a statement praising the approval, calling it a \u201cmajor step\u201d toward construction that will keep reliable energy flowing to Wisconsin and the Great Lakes region.",
      "Bad River tribal officials warned in their own statement Thursday that the project calls for blasting, drilling and digging trenches that would devastate area wetlands and streams and endanger the tribe's wild rice beds. The tribe noted that investigations identified water quality violations and three aquifer breaches related to the Line 3 pipeline\u2019s construction in northern Minnesota.",
      "\u201cI'm angry that the DNR has signed off on a half-baked plan that spells disaster for our homeland and our way of life,\u201d Bad River Chairman Robert Blanchard said in the statement. \u201cWe will continue sounding the alarm to prevent yet another Enbridge pipeline from endangering our watershed.\u201d",
      "Line 5 transports up to 23 million gallons (about 87 million liters) of oil and natural gas daily from Superior, Wisconsin, through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario. About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of the pipeline run across the Bad River reservation.",
      "The tribe sued Enbridge in 2019 to force the company to remove the pipeline from the reservation, arguing the 71-year-old line is prone to a catastrophic spill and land easements allowing Enbridge to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.",
      "Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation's southern border.",
      "The company has only about two years to complete the project. U.S. District Judge William Conley last year ordered Enbridge to shut down the portion of pipeline crossing the reservation within three years and pay the tribe more than $5 million for trespassing. An Enbridge appeal is pending in a federal appellate court in Chicago.",
      "Michigan\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel, filed a lawsuit in 2019 seeking to shut down twin portions of Line 5 that run beneath the Straits of Mackinac, the narrow waterways that connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Nessel argued that anchor strikes could rupture the line, resulting in a devastating spill. That lawsuit is still pending in a federal appellate court.",
      "Michigan regulators in December approved the company\u2019s $500 million plan to encase the portion of the pipeline beneath the straits in a tunnel to mitigate risk. The plan is awaiting approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."

      "It seemed like bad satire, or yet another conspiracy theory",
      "Headlines from the satirical website the Onion on Thursday: \u201cNew Dating Site Suggests People You Already Know But Thought You Were Too Good For.\u201d \u201cTrump Boys Have Slap Fight Over Who Gets to Run Foreign Policy Meetings.\u201d \u201cHere's Why I Decided to Buy Infowars.\u201d",
      "Only one has the ring of truth. Sort of.",
      "The bylined author of the Infowars article, Bryce P. Tetraeder, doesn't actually exist. And the Onion doesn't plan to invest in business school scholarships for promising cult leaders.",
      "But the Onion's purchase of Alex Jones' conspiracy-theory-saturated media empire at a bankruptcy auction tied to lawsuits by the families of Sandy Hook shooting victims is very real \u2014 an effort to fight falsehoods with funny and a who'd-have-thunk-it development in an already somewhat unbelievable year. An element of doubt was added late Thursday when the judge in Jones' bankruptcy case ordered a hearing for next week on how the auction was conducted.",
      "On Thursday, The Onion immediately shut down Infowars and said it plans to relaunch it in January as a parody of conspiracy theorists.",
      "\u201cOur goal in a couple of years is for people to think of Infowars as the funniest and dumbest website that exists,\u201d said Ben Collins, the Onion's CEO. \u201cIt was previously the dumbest website that exists.\u201d",
      "The purchase, for an undisclosed sum, was backed by Sandy Hook families, who were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in lawsuits against Jones for his false claims that the 2012 shootings at a Connecticut elementary school werex a hoax.",
      "The new Infowars will be a satire of theories Jones advanced, which themselves were so absurd that they could have seemed satirical if they hadn't caused real-life harm. The development ends one tentacle of a loose network of podcasters, TikTok influencers and others whose content keeps people perpetually provoked and enraged, Collins said. He called Jones one small character in a universe of fear-based media.",
      "\u201cThey've had a free pass to this point and we don't think that's fair,\u201d he said.",
      "At the very least, he said, the Onion hopes to return some fun to the Internet to offset years of doomscrolling.",
      "In Collins, who once covered misinformation for NBC News, the new venture has a leader uniquely suited to what is being attempted, said Dale Beran, who made this year's Netflix documentary, \u201cThe Anti-Social Network,\u201d about the topic.",
      "The Onion, founded as a newspaper in 1988, has gone through several ownership changes and was purchased earlier this year by a group that includes Jeff Lawson, co-founder of the software company Twilio. Since then, Beran said, it \u201cfeels like there is new life breathed into it.\"",
      "Done well, a satirical site on conspiracy theories and those who traffic in them could meet a historical moment much like comedian Stephen Colbert did when his Comedy Central show, \u201cThe Colbert Report,\u201d mocked pompous conservative television talk show hosts a decade and more ago.",
      "And what will happen when some of Jones' casual fans who didn't follow the news of the bankruptcy auction log on to Infowars in a few months only to find the Onion's new creation? Probably not much, said Beran, who suggested it's unlikely there's much overlap between people attracted by conspiracy theories and those who want to mock them.",
      "Indeed, conspiracy theories about the Onion's purchase of Infowars began popping up online only hours after it was announced.",
      "\u201cThere's no chance this outlet which hasn't been relevant in years was able to afford this purchase on their own. Who was really behind this?\u201d the website Zeee Media, which bills itself as \u201cone of the most trusted, uncensored sources of information in Australia,\u201d posted on X.",
      "Jones himself hurriedly posted a video aimed at his fans on Thursday. \u201cThis is a total attack on free speech,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deep state is completely out of control.\u201d",
      "There is an impact any time a prominent website that traffics in misinformation is shut down. Still, the business model of reaching people who want to be enraged is still viable, Beran said. Another expert in misinformation suggested Jones will quickly move on, and his fans will move with him.",
      "\u201cAs long as there are people willing to tune in, he will find new outlets,\u201d said Yotam Ophir, head of the Media Effects, Misinformation and Extremism Lab at the University of Buffalo. \u201cIf anything, the Onion trolling and the court cases against him will just make some of his most dedicated fans even more sure of his righteousness, seeing him as a martyr for free speech.\u201d",
      "At the very least, the Onion purchase offered a moment of zen for liberals who have had a pretty rough week or so following Donald Trump's election victory and the GOP sweep in Congress.",
      "\u201cThis is bad karma turned good,\u201d wrote Timothy W. Larson, who describes himself on X as a \u201cunabashed progressive.\" \u201cI love it.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A computer expert who stole bitcoin worth billions of dollars at current prices \u2014 and then spent years laundering some of the hacked cryptocurrency with help from his wife \u2014 was sentenced on Thursday to five years in prison.",
      "Ilya Lichtenstein masterminded one of the largest-ever thefts from a virtual currency exchange before he and his wife, Heather Rhiannon Morgan, carried out an elaborate scheme to liquidate the stolen funds, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly told Lichtenstein that his theft was \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d and not an impulsive act.",
      "\u201cIt's important to send a message that you can't commit these crimes with impunity, that there are consequences to them,\u201d she said.",
      "Lichtenstein, who gets credit for the two years and nine months that he has spent in jail since his February 2022 arrest, expressed remorse for \u201cwasting my talents on crime instead of a positive contribution to society.\u201d He said he hopes that he can apply his expertise to fight cybercrime when he gets out of prison.",
      "\u201cI want to take full responsibility for my actions and make amends any way I can,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge is scheduled to sentence Morgan on Monday. Lichtenstein pleaded with the judge to spare his wife from prison, blaming himself for her involvement.",
      "In August 2016, Lichtenstein hacked into a virtual currency exchange, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, and stole approximately 120,000 bitcoin. It was worth approximately $71 million at the time of the hack and would be valued at more than $7.6 billion at current market prices, according to prosecutors.",
      "Several months later, Lichtenstein began moving the stolen bitcoin in a string of complex transactions designed to conceal its path across a series of accounts and platforms. He enlisted his wife\u2019s help in cleaning the stolen funds.",
      "Lichtenstein, an entrepreneur and cryptocurrency investor, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Russia and grew up in a Chicago suburb. Morgan, a business owner and writer, adopted the alter ego \u201c Razzlekhan \u201d for performing rap songs and recording videos for her music.",
      "Lichtenstein and Morgan were living in New York City when they were arrested in February 2022. They had been living in San Francisco around the time of the hack.",
      "Prosecutors recommended a five-year prison sentence for Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty in August 2023 to one count of money laundering conspiracy. They recommended an 18-month prison sentence for Morgan, who pleaded guilty to the same charge.",
      "\u201cNeither the hack nor the laundering scheme was an impulsive decision. The defendant (Lichtenstein) spent months attempting to gain access to Bitfinex\u2019s infrastructure and get the accesses and permissions he needed in order to orchestrate his hack,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lichtenstein told his wife about the hack over three years later, but he initially solicited her help in laundering the proceeds \u201cwithout explaining exactly what he was doing,\u201d according to prosecutors.",
      "Morgan \u201cwas certainly a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions, but she was a lower-level participant,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "During family trips to Kazakhstan and Ukraine, Lichtenstein met with couriers who delivered him money that he smuggled back into the U.S.",
      "\u201cOver half a decade, the defendant engaged in what IRS agents described as the most complicated money laundering techniques they had seen to date,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, which is digital money that typically isn\u2019t backed by any government or banking institution. Transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "The couple successfully laundered about 21 percent of the funds stolen from Bitfinex. The laundered money was worth at least $14 million at 2016 prices. Its value would have exceeded $1 billion at the time of their 2022 arrest.",
      "Authorities seized the remaining funds, collectively valued at over $6 billion at current prices.",
      "\u201cHe became one of the greatest money launderers that the government has encountered in the cryptocurrency space,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "An attorney for Bitfinex said the hack \u201cdevastated\u201d its finances and its reputation with its customers, with the stolen funds accounting for approximately 36% of the company's assets at the time of theft.",
      "\u201cBitfinex had to take unprecedented and immediate action to ensure that any losses from the Hack would ultimately be borne by Bitfinex and its shareholders alone, not its customers,\u201d the lawyer, Barry Berke, wrote in a letter to the judge.",
      "A prosecutor said Lichtenstein immediately began cooperating with federal authorities after his arrest, helping them with other cybercrime investigations.",
      "Over 96% of the stolen funds have been recovered, with help from Lichtenstein, according to defense attorney Samson Enzer. The \u201cvast bulk\u201d of the stolen money was never spent, the lawyer said.",
      "\u201cThis is not an evil person,\u201d Enzer said. \u201cThis is a good person who made some very bad mistakes.\u201d",

      "Chair Jerome Powell says the Federal Reserve will likely cut its key interest rate slowly and deliberately in the coming months, in part because inflation has shown signs of persistence and the Fed\u2019s officials want to see where it heads next",
      "WASHINGTON -- Chair Jerome Powell said Thursday that the Federal Reserve will likely cut its key interest rate slowly and deliberately in the coming months, in part because inflation has shown signs of persistence and the Fed's officials want to see where it heads next.",
      "Powell, speaking in Dallas, said that inflation is edging closer to the central bank's 2% target, \u201cbut it is not there yet.\"",
      "At the same time, he said, the economy is strong, and the policymakers can take time to monitor the path of inflation.",
      "\u201cThe economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates,\u201d the Fed chair said. \u201cThe strength we are currently seeing in the economy gives us the ability to approach our decisions carefully.\u201d",
      "Economists expect the Fed to announce another quarter-point rate cut in December, after a quarter-point reduction last week and half-point cut in September.",
      "But the Fed's steps after that are much less clear. In September, the central bank's officials collectively signaled that they envisioned cutting their key rate four times in 2025. Wall Street traders, though, now expect just two rate reductions, according to futures pricing tracked by CME FedWatch. And after Powell's cautious remarks Thursday, traders estimated the likelihood of a Fed rate cut in December at just below 59%, down from 83% a day earlier.",
      "The Fed's benchmark interest rate tends to influence borrowing rates across the economy, including for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. Other factors, though, can also push up longer-term rates, notably expectations for inflation and economic growth.",
      "For example, Donald Trump's presidential election victory has sent yields on Treasury securities higher. It is a sign that investors expect faster growth next year as well as potentially larger budget deficits and even higher inflation should Trump impose widespread tariffs and mass deportations of migrants as he has promised.",
      "In his remarks Thursday, Powell suggested that inflation may remain stuck somewhat above the Fed's target in the coming months. But he reiterated that inflation should eventually decline further, \u201calbeit on a sometimes bumpy path.\u201d",
      "Under questioning, Powell also explained why he considers the Fed's role as an independent federal agency to be crucial to its ability to fight inflation. During his first term, Trump threatened to try to fire Powell for not cutting interest rates. And during this year\u2019s election campaign, Trump asserted that as president, he should have a \u201csay\u201d on the Fed's rate policies.",
      "Powell said Thursday that the Fed's independence from political concerns has made the public confident that the policymakers will keep inflation low over time. That confidence, in turn, has helped reduce inflation after it had spiked in the wake of the pandemic. When consumers and businesses expect inflation to slow, they act in ways that help hold it down \u2014 by, for example, not demanding high cost-of-living raises.",
      "\u201cThe public,\" Powell said, \"believed that we would get inflation down, that we would restore price stability. And that\u2019s ultimately the key to it.\u201d",
      "Powell declined to comment on other political topics, including the potential impacts of Trump's proposals to impose sweeping tariffs and implement mass deport",
      "Other Fed officials have also recently expressed uncertainty about how much more they can cut rates, given the economy\u2019s steady growth and the apparent stickiness of inflation.",
      "As measured by the central bank\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, so-called core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, have been stuck in the high 2% range for five months.",
      "On Wednesday, Lorie Logan, president of the Fed\u2019s Dallas branch, said it was not clear how much more the Fed should cut its key short-term rate.",
      "\u201cIf we cut too far ... inflation could reaccelerate and the (Fed) could need to reverse direction,\u201d Logan said. \u201cI believe it\u2019s best to proceed with caution.\u201d"

      "The purchase of Alex Jones ' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction by the satirical news publication The Onion is the latest twist in a yearslong saga between the far-right conspiracy theorist and families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims.",
      "The sale was ordered after relatives of many of the 20 children and six educators killed in the 2012 shooting successfully sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress. Jones repeatedly made false claims on his show that the Newtown, Connecticut, shooting was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Here are some things to know about how Jones' misinformation empire ended up on the auction block.",
      "Fresh out of high school in the early 1990s, Jones, a barrel-chested, gravelly voiced Texas native, started broadcasting on a public-access television channel in the state capital. From the start, Jones promoted conspiracies about the U.S. government and false claims about a secret New World Order.",
      "In 2004, Jones had two employees and a tiny office in south Austin. In 2007, he formed Free Speech Systems, to run his growing media business, according to court records in his bankruptcy cases. By 2010, Jones had over 60 employees.",
      "As the outlandish nature of his false claims grew, so did his media empire, with annual revenues of up to $80 million, and a fanbase that at his height listened to him on more than 100 radio stations across the United States as well as through his Infowars website and social media.",
      "Jones has acknowledged in court that he promoted the conspiracy theory that the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax perpetrated in part by the U.S. government as part of an effort to expand gun control. He called the parents of slain children \u201ccrisis actors\u201d on his show and said the shooting was \u201cphony as a three-dollar bill.\u201d",
      "After separate defamation lawsuits were filed in Connecticut and Texas by family members of victims, Jones acknowledged in 2022 that the shooting was \u201c100% real\u201d and said it was \u201cabsolutely irresponsible\u201d to call it a hoax.",
      "Victims\u2019 families who sued Jones said they were subjected to years of torment, threats and abuse by people who believed the lies told on his show.",
      "Courts in Texas and Connecticut found Jones liable for defamation for his portrayal of the Sandy Hook massacre as a hoax and awarded the families nearly $1.5 billion in damages. In both states, the judges issued default judgments finding Jones liable without trials because he failed to respond to court orders and turn over many documents. Juries then heard evidence and decided on the amount of damages, with judges tacking on additional penalties.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment. Up for sale was everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras.",
      "The Onion acquired Infowars' website; social media accounts; studio in Austin, Texas; trademarks; and video archive. The sale price was not disclosed.",
      "After the sale was announced, Infowars\u2019 website was down and Jones was broadcasting from what he said was a new studio location.",
      "Jones vowed to challenge the sale and auction process in court, and late Thursday a federal judge ordered a hearing into exactly how The Onion won the bidding. Lawyers for Jones and a company affiliated with Infowars alleged the trustee overseeing the auction changed the bidding process just days before it was held."

      "One of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors has agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Smithfield Foods, one of the nation\u2019s largest meat processors, has agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota, officials announced Thursday.",
      "An investigation by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry found that the Smithfield Packaged Meats subsidiary employed at least 11 children at its plant in St. James ages 14 to 17 from April 2021 through April 2023, the agency said. Three of them began working for the company when they were 14, it said. Smithfield let nine of them work after allowable hours and had all 11 perform potentially dangerous work, the agency alleged.",
      "As part of the settlement, Smithfield also agreed to steps to ensure future compliance with child labor laws. U.S. law prohibits companies from employing people younger than 18 to work in meat processing plants because of hazards.",
      "State Labor Commissioner Nicole Blissenbach said the agreement \"sends a strong message to employers, including in the meat processing industry, that child labor violations will not be tolerated in Minnesota.\u201d",
      "The Smithfield, Virginia-based company said in a statement that it denies knowingly hiring anyone under age 18 to work at the St. James plant, and that it did not admit liability under the settlement. The company said all 11 passed the federal E-Verify employment eligibility system by using false identification. Smithfield also said it takes a long list of proactive steps to enforce its policy prohibiting the employment of minors.",
      "\u201cSmithfield is committed to maintaining a safe workplace and complying with all applicable employment laws and regulations,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe wholeheartedly agree that individuals under the age of 18 have no place working in meatpacking or processing facilities.\u201d",
      "The state agency said the $2 million administrative penalty is the largest it has recovered in a child labor enforcement action. It also ranks among the larger recent child labor settlements nationwide. It follows a $300,000 agreement that Minnesota reached last year with another meat processer, Tony Downs Food Co., after the agency's investigation found it employed children as young as 13 at its plant in Madelia.",
      "Also last year, the U.S. Department of Labor levied over $1.5 million in civil penalties against one of the country\u2019s largest cleaning services for food processing companies, Packers Sanitation Services Inc., after finding it employed more than 100 children in dangerous jobs at 13 meatpacking plants across the country.",
      "After that investigation, the Biden administration urged U.S. meat processors to make sure they aren't illegally hiring children for dangerous jobs. The call, in a letter by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to the 18 largest meat and poultry producers, was part of a broader crackdown on child labor. The Labor Department then reported a 69% increase since 2018 in the number of children being employed illegally in the U.S.",
      "In other recent settlements, a Mississippi processing plant, Mar-Jac Poultry, agreed in August to a $165,000 settlement with the U.S. Department of Labor following the death of a 16-year-old boy. In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service LLC, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",

Disney was required by the Department of Justice to sell the networks for its acquisition of 21st Century Fox\u2019s film and television assets to be approved.",

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- The Tampa Bay Rays will play their 2025 home games at the New York Yankees' nearby spring training ballpark amid uncertainty about the future of hurricane-damaged Tropicana Field, Rays executives told The Associated Press.",
      "Stuart Sternberg, the Rays' principal owner, said in an interview that Steinbrenner Field in Tampa is the best fit for the team and its fanbase. At about 11,000 seats, it's also the largest of the spring training sites in Florida.",
      "\u201cIt is singularly the best opportunity for our fans to experience 81 games of major league Rays baseball,\u201d Sternberg said. \u201cAs difficult as it is to get any of these stadiums up to major league standards, it was the least difficult.

      "\u201cThis outcome meets Major League Baseball's goals that Rays fans will see their team play next season in their home market and that their players can remain home without disruption to their families,\u201d Manfred said in a news release.",
      "The Rays' home since 1998, the domed Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg was hit hard by Hurricane Milton on Oct. 9, with most of its fabric roof shredded and water damage inside.

      "The work would have to be approved by the city council, which earlier this year voted for a new $1.3 billion, 30,000-seat stadium to replace Tropicana Field beginning in 2028. The new stadium is part of a much larger urban revitalization project known as the Historic Gas Plant District \u2014 named for the Black community that once occupied the 86 acres (34 hectares) that includes retail, office and hotel space; a Black history museum; and restaurants and bars.",
      "Amid all the uncertainty, the Rays know one thing: they will play 2025 in a smallish, outdoor ballpark operated by one of their main American League East division rivals. A ballpark with a facade mimicking that of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and festooned with plaques of Yankee players whose numbers have been retired.",
      "Brian Auld, the Rays co-president, said in an interview that Tampa Bay has to be ready for a regular-season MLB game March 27 against the Colorado Rockies, just three days after the Yankees break training camp.",
      "\u201cThere will be a ton of work toward putting in our brand,\u201d Auld said. \u201cThe term we like to use for that is \u201dRayful' into Steinbrenner Field.\"",
      "It will also come with some weather challenges in the hot, rainy Florida summer climate the Rays didn't worry about in their domed ballpark. The Rays averaged about 16,500 fans per game during the 2024 season.",
      "The Yankees will receive about $15 million in revenue for hosting the Rays, a person familiar with the arrangement told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because that detail was not announced. The money won\u2019t come from Tampa Bay but from other sources, such as insurance.",
      "Once known as Legends Field, Steinbrenner Field opened in 1996 on Tampa's north side. It is named for longtime Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who ran a shipbuilding company in Tampa and died at his home there in 2010. One of his sons, Yankees executive Hal Steinbrenner, was instrumental in getting the deal done with the Rays, Sternberg said.",
      "\u201cThis is a heavy lift for the Yankees. This is a huge ask by us and baseball of the Yankees,\u201d Sternberg said. \u201c(Hal Steinbrenner) did not waver for one second. I couldn't have been more grateful.\u201d",
      "Hal Steinbrenner said in a news release that the Yankees are \u201chappy to extend our hand to the Rays\" and noted that the team and his family have \u201cdeep roots\u201d in the Tampa Bay area.",

      "The Capitals led 3-1 on goals by Taylor Raddysh, Dylan Strome and Aliaksei Protas before a turnover by Tom Wilson ended with Nylander beating Logan Thompson. Dowd's penalty became one mistake too many, and Washington lost for just the fifth time in 15 games this season.",
      "Woll stopped 24 of the 27 shots he faced to help Toronto bounce back. Thompson had 31 saves and lost for the first time since Washington acquired him from Vegas last summer.",
      "Maple Leafs: The response coach Craig Berube and veteran leaders expected took a while to materialize, but the team's best players got it done when it mattered.",
      "Capitals: After a charmed start to the season, the Capitals failed to add on and paid the price for a lackluster third period.",
      "The Leafs held the puck for a vast majority of the 3-on-3 OT before Tavares scored with 46.2 seconds left.",
      "Leafs defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson skated in his 1,000th regular-season NHL game.",

      "\u201cReally, my first thought is, eventually I want the rest of our performances, the rest of our games to overshadow this one,\u201d said Wembanyama, the top pick in the 2023 draft. \u201cI wish, I want to make it so that in the future it\u2019s just another one.\u201d",

      "Instead, Rioux will spend the 2024-25 season practicing with teammates and honing his skills \u2014 and still be a freshman next fall.",
      "\u201cI should have made that clear (before),\" Golden said. \"Honestly, it\u2019s put him in a tough situation. He\u2019s sitting over there at the end of games and everybody\u2019s yelling at him and trying to get him out there. They just hadn\u2019t understood that that was our potential plan for him.",
      "\u201cSo that\u2019s where we\u2019re at at this moment. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s 100% going to be the plan. We\u2019ll continue to talk to him and see if he changes what he wants to do. But as of right now, that\u2019s the plan that we\u2019re going to have with him as we move forward.\u201d",
      "Florida students chanted for \u201cOli\u201d in both of the team's home games this season. Golden emptied the bench in the final minutes of an 86-62 victory over Grambling State on Monday night and even said a few words to Rioux during the chaotic scene.",
      "\u201cI was just explaining to him, \u2019Hey, the reason why I\u2019m not putting you in right now is what we\u2019ve talked about a little bit,'\u201d Golden said. \"This wasn\u2019t a choice that I made for him. This is something that people (from) our program have talked with him and his family and his parents, his AAU coach and just kind of trying to figure out what the best route for him is.",
      "\u201cI just went up to him and I was like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not trying to be disrespectful with you. I\u2019m just not trying to burn your year putting you in for 30 seconds.\u2019\u201d",
      "Rioux handled the decision well, Golden said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a great kid, and he\u2019s a pleaser,\u201d Golden said. \"He wants to do what others think is best for him. And he\u2019s coachable. Again, if this is what our staff, his parents, the people around him that care about him, think is best, I think he\u2019s going to be comfortable. Ultimately, it\u2019s his decision. But I think that\u2019s where he\u2019ll land.\u201d",

      "\"That old Mike Tyson ... he doesn\u2019t have no more purpose in my life. He just doesn't exist,\u201d Tyson said. \u201cI\u2019m having a good time in my life. I don\u2019t have much time left, so I\u2019m having the best time of my life.\u201d",
      "Several states wouldn\u2019t sanction the bout. Texas agreed to a fight that was eight rounds instead of 10 or 12, with two-minute rounds instead of three, and heavier gloves designed to lessen the power of punches.",
      "Paul has faced persistent questions about why he would fight someone so much older, regardless of Tyson's pedigree. His answers have been consistent.",
      "\u201cI say talk to Mike and tell Mike that,\u201d Paul said. \u201cHe\u2019s the one that wanted it to be a pro fight and me, as a young person in this sport, is not going to (pass) up the opportunity to fight the GOAT of boxing. It\u2019s like Ja Morant turning down a 1-v-1 against LeBron. It\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d",
      "There is a high-profile championship fight on the card \u2014 the co-main event of Katie Taylor vs. Amanda Serrano.",
      "Paul said he wanted to give the women a spotlight after their slugfest at sold-out Madison Square Garden in 2022. It was the first time women headlined a boxing event at the famous venue.",
      "Taylor won a split decision that many questioned. Bidarian and Paul say the rematch for the undisputed super lightweight title will be the most lucrative women's sporting event in history.",
      "\u201cA lot of people said the real main event is Taylor-Serrano,\u201d Bidarian said. \u201cI'm OK if you feel that way. Jake has said he's more excited about that fight than his own fight. But we wanted to ensure the most eyeballs got to see that fight. To be quite honest with ourselves, Paul-Tyson draws a bigger audience.\"",

      "PHILADELPHIA -- Jalen Hurts rolled over, face down, and grabbed his helmet.",
      "The Philadelphia Eagles quarterback's head was spiked into the turf by Washington linebacker Frankie Luvu in the second quarter and bounced off the ground. Hurts was evaluated for a concussion \u2014 \u201cI guess I beat the protocol,\u201d he quipped \u2014 and stayed in the game.",
      "Hurts ran for the go-ahead score, Saquon Barkley rushed for 146 yards and two fourth-quarter touchdowns, and the Eagles stretched their lead in the NFC East with a 26-18 win Thursday night over Jayden Daniels and the Commanders.",
      "\u201cReally,\u201d coach Nick Sirianni said, \u201cwhat we talked about at halftime was this was going to be a grimy, gritty game.\u201d",
      "After three quarters of uninspired offense by the Eagles, Barkley and Hurts led them to 20 points in the fourth.",
      "The Eagles (8-2) won their sixth straight since their bye. Fans cheered when Hurts ran out of the tunnel for the second half, and he finished with 221 yards passing.",
      "\u201cWhen you see grass coming out of his helmet, yeah man, he got rocked a few times,\u201d offensive lineman Lane Johnson said. \u201cI thought he did a good job coming in the second half, and really putting it behind him.\u201d",
      "After the game, Hurts laughed when he failed to recall details of a specific play.",
      "\u201cI don't know what you're talking about. Probably not the right thing to say right now,\u201d he said.",
      "The Eagles' defense pitched in with a decisive stop.",
      "With the Eagles leading 12-10 in the fourth quarter, Washington was in range for a go-ahead field goal and coach Dan Quinn elected to go for it on fourth down. Daniels scrambled and was stopped for no gain, and less than three minutes later, Barkley scored on a 23-yard run.",

      "Elliott holds the franchise record with seven field goals of 50 yards or more in a season but has missed all four attempts from 50-plus in 2024.",
      "The matchup was hyped as the biggest game in this NFC East rivalry in nearly 30 years, but the first 30 minutes had all the excitement of a preseason game.",

      "But Gonzalez, promoted off the practice squad with Austin Seibert dealing with a hip injury, didn't get another opportunity late in the fourth. The Commanders were stopped on second- and third-and-1, and Daniels, the No. 2 overall draft pick, was stuffed on Philadelphia\u2019s 26.",

      "Not to start, at least. The finish was pretty encouraging.",
      "Deivon Smith drained a 3-pointer midway through the second half to spark an 18-0 spurt that propelled No. 22 St. John's past Wagner 66-45 on Wednesday night for its first victory as a Top 25 team in almost 10 years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m impressed, even though we\u2019re much more talented than Wagner,\u201d said Pitino, the Hall of Fame coach in his second season with the Red Storm. \u201cThey turned up the heat and made shots, and they were very poised when it counted.\u201d",
      "St. John's (3-0) jumped into the AP Top 25 poll this week for the first time since January 2019. It earned its first win as a ranked squad since topping Tulane on Dec. 28, 2014.",
      "And for Pitino, it was his first game coaching a Top 25 team since 2017 at Louisville.",
      "He didn't think his players thought much about any of that, though.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s nice for the fans. Certainly we\u2019re proud of that,\" Pitino said. \"We need to get the subway alumni back. We\u2019ve got great fans, but we don\u2019t have a lot of them.",

      "Playing before a crowd of 4,751 at Carnesecca Arena on its Queens campus, St. John\u2019s led just 39-37 before Kadary Richmond blocked a shot and fed Smith for a transition 3 with 9:54 remaining.",
      "\u201cThat was a big play,\" Pitino said. \"I think the shooting at the end when the game was in question was magnificent. The defense was great the whole night, basically.\u201d",

      "Ricardo Pepi scored from Christian Pulisic\u2019s pass in the fifth minute, Matt Turner saved a penalty kick and the United States won 1-0 at Jamaica in a CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal first leg, the Americans\u2019 first competitive match under coach Mau...",
      "Ricardo Pepi put the United States in good position to advance to the CONCACAF Nations League semifinals, scoring an early goal for a 1-0, first-leg win against Jamaica at Kingston on Thursday night in coach Mauricio Pochettino's first competitive match.",
      "\u201cWe were here to fight. We knew it was going to be difficult,\u201d Pepi said. \u201cAt the end of the day we got the result and now it's time to go and take care of it at home.\u201d",
      "The second leg of the total-goals quarterfinal is Monday in St. Louis, and the winner advances to a March 20 semifinal at Inglewood, California. The United States won the first three editions of the tournament.",
      "\u201cIn a difficult situation, they competed really well,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cOf course, we need to improve in all the areas.\u201d",
      "Pepi scored from Christian Pulisic\u2019s pass in the fifth minute, Matt Turner saved a penalty kick and the U.S. won with a shutout on the road for the first time since a 2016 friendly at Cuba. The Americans had 60% possession but were outshot 12-6.",
      "Jamaica finished a man short after Mason Holgate was given his second yellow card for pushing Brandon V\u00e1zquez in the 86th, 10 minutes after his first for kicking Gianluca Busio.",
      "Pulisic sparked the goal when he received a pass from Johnny Cardoso and dribbled up the center of the field. Pepi burst past Amari\u2019i Bell, ran onto the ball and took a touch, then mis-hit his shot but put the ball in off goalkeeper Andre Blake\u2019s far post for his 12th goal in 32 international appearances.",
      "\u201cI just saw Christian between the lines and I thought I had space in behind, so made a run,\u201d Pepi said after his third goal against Jamaica.",
      "Pulisic became the 33rd player to make 75 U.S. appearances. Pepi is the fourth American to score 12 international goals before age 22 after Landon Donovan, Jozy Altidore and Pulisic.",
      "Joe Scally\u2019s giveaway led to Jamaica being awarded a penalty kick by Costa Rican referee Juan Gabriel Calderon. Kasey Palmer passed to Shamar Nicholson, who spun around Mark McKenzie and was pulled down by Turner. The goalkeeper dived to his right to bat away Demarai Gray\u2019s 14th-minute spot kick, Turner's third save in eight penalty kicks while in the U.S. goal.",
      "\u201cI try to stay grounded, but I was definitely pumped up in the moment,\u201d said Turner, who has started one club match in eight months. \u201cNeeded a play like that for a long time now. I think that might have been the first penalty I've ever conceded in my career, so then to turn around and save it was a pretty nice feeling.\u201d",

      "McKennie got a yellow card in the 50th minute for pulling down Leon Bailey from behind by the jersey. Antonee Robinson and Bailey received yellow cards in the 69th after teams got into a shoving confrontation. American defender Tim Ream was not called for a possible hand ball in the second half and Musah had a goal-line clearance.",

      "The issue of Tyson\u2019s health didn\u2019t come up in a small concert venue about 20 miles from AT&T Stadium. A bout originally scheduled for July 20 was postponed to Friday night after Tyson had to be treated for a stomach ulcer when he fell ill on a flight.",

      "Several states wouldn\u2019t sanction the bout. Texas agreed to a fight that was eight rounds instead of 10 or 12, with two-minute rounds instead of three, and heavier gloves designed to lessen the power of punches.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve said everything I had to say,\u201d Tyson said in one of several attempts to get him to say more. \u201cI\u2019m just looking forward to fighting.\u201d",

      "Paul couldn't even get Tyson to respond by wearing what the 27-year-old said was a \u201cdiamond-spiked ear cover.\u201d It was Paul's jab at Tyson over the Hall of Famer infamously biting the ear of Evander Holyfield in a 1997 fight.",
      "Tyson did get briefly riled up when somebody asked twice what he would do if he lost. His last sanctioned bout was in 2005. Tyson fought Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition four years ago.",
      "\u201cI am not going to lose,\u201d Tyson said, his voice rising the second time it was asked. \u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d",

      "The fight is the first combat sports event to be streamed on Netflix. It will be available at no additional cost to the more than 280 million Netflix subscribers globally.",
      "Paul is a minus-200 betting favorite, according to BetMGM Sportsbook. That means the payout for a Paul victory would be about half the amount of any bet.",
      "The co-main event is a rematch between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano for the undisputed super welterweight title.",

    "summary": "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
    "story": [
      "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
      "NEW YORK -- As the International Rescue Committee copes with dramatic increases in displaced people in recent years, the refugee aid organization has looked for efficiencies wherever it can \u2014 including using artificial intelligence.",
      "Since 2015, the IRC has invested in Signpost \u2014 a portfolio of mobile apps and social media channels that answer questions in different languages for people in dangerous situations. The Signpost project, which includes many other organizations, has reached 18 million people so far, but IRC wants to significantly increase its reach by using AI tools \u2014 if they can do so safely.",
      "Conflict, climate emergencies and economic hardship have driven up demand for humanitarian assistance, with more than 117 million people forcibly displaced in 2024, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The turn to artificial intelligence technologies is in part driven by the massive gap between needs and resources.",
      "To meet its goal of reaching half of displaced people within three years, the IRC is testing a network of AI chatbots to see if they can increase the capacity of their humanitarian officers and the local organizations that directly serve people through Signpost. For now, the pilot project operates in El Salvador, Kenya, Greece and Italy and responds in 11 languages. It draws on a combination of large language models from some of the biggest technology companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.",
      "The chatbot response system also uses customer service software from Zendesk and receives other support from Google and Cisco Systems.",
      "If they decide the tools work, the IRC wants to extend the technical infrastructure to other nonprofit humanitarian organizations at no cost. They hope to create shared technology resources that less technically focused organizations could use without having to negotiate directly with tech companies or manage the risks of deployment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really be clear about where the legitimate concerns are but lean into the optimism of the opportunities and not also allow the populations we serve to be left behind in solutions that have the potential to scale in a way that human to human or other technology can\u2019t,\" said Jeannie Annan, International Rescue Committee\u2019s Chief Research and Innovation Officer.",
      "The responses and information that Signpost chatbots deliver are vetted by local organizations to be up to date and sensitive to the precarious circumstances people could be in. An example query that IRC shared is of a woman from El Salvador traveling through Mexico to the United States with her son who is looking for shelter and for services for her child. The bot provides a list of providers in the area where she is.",
      "More complex or sensitive queries are escalated for humans to respond.",
      "The most important potential downside of these tools would be that they don't work. For example, what if the situation on the ground changes and the chatbot doesn\u2019t know? It could provide information that's not just wrong, but dangerous.",
      "A second issue is that these tools can amass a valuable honeypot of data about vulnerable people that hostile actors could target. What if a hacker succeeds in accessing data with personal information or if that data is accidentally shared with an oppressive government?",
      "IRC said it's agreed with the tech providers that none of their AI models will be trained on the data that the IRC, the local organizations or the people they are serving are generating. They've also worked to anonymize the data, including removing personal information and location.",
      "As part of the Signpost.AI project, IRC is also testing tools like a digital automated tutor and maps that can integrate many different types of data to help prepare for and respond to crises.",
      "Cathy Petrozzino, who works for the not-for-profit research and development company MITRE, said AI tools do have high potential, but also high risks. To use these tools responsibly, she said, organizations should ask themselves, does the technology work? Is it fair? Are data and privacy protected?",
      "She also emphasized that organizations need to convene a range of people to help govern and design the initiative \u2014 not just technical experts, but people with deep knowledge of the context, legal experts, and representatives from the groups that will use the tools.",
      "\u201cThere are many good models sitting in the AI graveyard,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t worked out in conjunction and collaboration with the user community.\u201d",
      "For any system that has potentially life-changing impacts, Petrozzino said, groups should bring in outside experts to independently assess their methodologies. Designers of AI tools need to consider the other systems it will interact with, she said, and they need to plan to monitor the model over time.",
      "Consulting with displaced people or others that humanitarian organizations serve may increase the time and effort needed to design these tools, but not having their input raises many safety and ethical problems, said Helen McElhinney, executive director of CDAC Network. It can also unlock local knowledge.",
      "People receiving services from humanitarian organizations should be told if an AI model will analyze any information they hand over, she said, even if the intention is to help the organization respond better. That requires meaningful and informed consent, she said. They should also know if an AI model is making life-changing decisions about resource allocation and where accountability for those decisions lies, she said.",
      "Degan Ali, CEO of Adeso, a nonprofit in Somalia and Kenya, has long been an advocate for changing the power dynamics in international development to give more money and control to local organizations. She asked how IRC and others pursuing these technologies would overcome access issues, pointing to the week-long power outages caused by Hurricane Helene in the U.S. Chatbots won't help when there's no device, internet or electricity, she said.",
      "Ali also warned that few local organizations have the capacity to attend big humanitarian conferences where the ethics of AI are debated. Few have staff both senior enough and knowledgeable enough to really engage with these discussions, she said, though they understand the potential power and impact these technologies may have.",
      "\u201cWe must be extraordinarily careful not to replicate power imbalances and biases through technology,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThe most complex questions are always going to require local, contextual and lived experience to answer in a meaningful way.\u201d",

      "A computer expert who stole bitcoin worth billions of dollars at current prices \u2014 and then spent years laundering some of the hacked cryptocurrency with help from his wife \u2014 has been sentenced to five years in prison",
      "WASHINGTON -- A computer expert who stole bitcoin worth billions of dollars at current prices \u2014 and then spent years laundering some of the hacked cryptocurrency with help from his wife \u2014 was sentenced on Thursday to five years in prison.",
      "Ilya Lichtenstein masterminded one of the largest-ever thefts from a virtual currency exchange before he and his wife, Heather Rhiannon Morgan, carried out an elaborate scheme to liquidate the stolen funds, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly told Lichtenstein that his theft was \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d and not an impulsive act.",
      "\u201cIt's important to send a message that you can't commit these crimes with impunity, that there are consequences to them,\u201d she said.",
      "Lichtenstein, who gets credit for the two years and nine months that he has spent in jail since his February 2022 arrest, expressed remorse for \u201cwasting my talents on crime instead of a positive contribution to society.\u201d He said he hopes that he can apply his expertise to fight cybercrime when he gets out of prison.",
      "\u201cI want to take full responsibility for my actions and make amends any way I can,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge is scheduled to sentence Morgan on Monday. Lichtenstein pleaded with the judge to spare his wife from prison, blaming himself for her involvement.",
      "In August 2016, Lichtenstein hacked into a virtual currency exchange, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, and stole approximately 120,000 bitcoin. It was worth approximately $71 million at the time of the hack and would be valued at more than $7.6 billion at current market prices, according to prosecutors.",
      "Several months later, Lichtenstein began moving the stolen bitcoin in a string of complex transactions designed to conceal its path across a series of accounts and platforms. He enlisted his wife\u2019s help in cleaning the stolen funds.",
      "Lichtenstein, an entrepreneur and cryptocurrency investor, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Russia and grew up in a Chicago suburb. Morgan, a business owner and writer, adopted the alter ego \u201c Razzlekhan \u201d for performing rap songs and recording videos for her music.",
      "Lichtenstein and Morgan were living in New York City when they were arrested in February 2022. They had been living in San Francisco around the time of the hack.",
      "Prosecutors recommended a five-year prison sentence for Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty in August 2023 to one count of money laundering conspiracy. They recommended an 18-month prison sentence for Morgan, who pleaded guilty to the same charge.",
      "\u201cNeither the hack nor the laundering scheme was an impulsive decision. The defendant (Lichtenstein) spent months attempting to gain access to Bitfinex\u2019s infrastructure and get the accesses and permissions he needed in order to orchestrate his hack,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lichtenstein told his wife about the hack over three years later, but he initially solicited her help in laundering the proceeds \u201cwithout explaining exactly what he was doing,\u201d according to prosecutors.",
      "Morgan \u201cwas certainly a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions, but she was a lower-level participant,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "During family trips to Kazakhstan and Ukraine, Lichtenstein met with couriers who delivered him money that he smuggled back into the U.S.",
      "\u201cOver half a decade, the defendant engaged in what IRS agents described as the most complicated money laundering techniques they had seen to date,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, which is digital money that typically isn\u2019t backed by any government or banking institution. Transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "The couple successfully laundered about 21 percent of the funds stolen from Bitfinex. The laundered money was worth at least $14 million at 2016 prices. Its value would have exceeded $1 billion at the time of their 2022 arrest.",
      "Authorities seized the remaining funds, collectively valued at over $6 billion at current prices.",
      "\u201cHe became one of the greatest money launderers that the government has encountered in the cryptocurrency space,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "An attorney for Bitfinex said the hack \u201cdevastated\u201d its finances and its reputation with its customers, with the stolen funds accounting for approximately 36% of the company's assets at the time of theft.",
      "\u201cBitfinex had to take unprecedented and immediate action to ensure that any losses from the Hack would ultimately be borne by Bitfinex and its shareholders alone, not its customers,\u201d the lawyer, Barry Berke, wrote in a letter to the judge.",
      "A prosecutor said Lichtenstein immediately began cooperating with federal authorities after his arrest, helping them with other cybercrime investigations.",
      "Over 96% of the stolen funds have been recovered, with help from Lichtenstein, according to defense attorney Samson Enzer. The \u201cvast bulk\u201d of the stolen money was never spent, the lawyer said.",
      "\u201cThis is not an evil person,\u201d Enzer said. \u201cThis is a good person who made some very bad mistakes.\u201d",

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",
      "\u201cAdvanced economies need to demonstrate a credible commitment\u201d to helping poor nations, the report said.",
      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",
      "German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said \u201cprivate investment has to be brought to the table\u201d in order to fulfill developing countries needs. But Mariana Paoli of Christian Aid said any number that comes out of negotiations that's not based in publicly-financed grants \u201cwill be meaningless.\u201d",
      "Relying on the private sector means climate cash will not be \u201cneeds based, it will be profit-driven,\" she said, adding that crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and bank bailouts proves that public funds are available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Getting climate cash is personal for many activists from vulnerable nations, like Sandra Leticia Guzman Luna, who is from Mexico and the director of the climate finance group for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe are observing the climate impacts causing a lot of costs, not only economic costs but also human losses,\u201d she said.",
      "Argentina withdrew from the climate talks on Wednesday on the orders of its president, climate skeptic Javier Milei. The Argentine government did not respond to requests from The Associated Press for comment.",
      "Climate activists called the decision regrettable.",

      "A tech consultant charged with murder in Cash App founder Bob Lee\u2019s stabbing death has sparred with the lead prosecutor at trial",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A tech consultant charged with murder in Cash App founder Bob Lee\u2019s stabbing death sparred with the lead prosecutor at trial Thursday, interrupting questions asked of him with his own questions as he was grilled on his testimony.",
      "Nima Momeni, 40, had to be told several times by the judge to provide responsive answers.",
      "He broke his public silence after 18 months when he took the witness stand Wednesday to explain how Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m. on April 4, 2023, dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Momeni testified Lee, 43, suddenly pulled a knife on him after he cracked a \u201cbad joke\u201d suggesting Lee should spend his last night in the city with family instead of trying to visit a strip club. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "His testimony stunned Lee's father, brother and ex-wife, who have been a steadfast presence in the criminal trial. They say Lee was big-hearted and gentle, and close to his two children and ex-wife.",
      "\u201cWhat you have seen is Nima be aggressive on the stand, you\u2019ve seen him just trying to take control of this room, his arrogance and his entitlement are on full display here,\u201d said the victim's brother, Timothy Oliver Lee, speaking with reporters outside the court room Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis is insane,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this is ridiculous.\u201d",
      "The trial is in its fifth week. Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to the charismatic entrepreneur\u2019s generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died.",
      "Prosecutors say Momeni planned the April 4 attack after a dispute over his younger sister, Khazar Momeni, with whom Lee was friends. Momeni had picked up his sister from the home of a drug dealer introduced to her by Lee, and she said she may have been sexually assaulted after ingesting a date-rape drug called GHB.",
      "They say Momeni was angry with Lee so he took a knife from his sister\u2019s condo, and after the pair was kicked out of her place at 2 a.m., he drove Lee to a secluded area and stabbed him three times and then fled.",
      "Omid Talai, the assistant district attorney, grilled Momeni on Thursday on details of exactly how the attack unfolded. He asked Momeni why he did not call police after the attack and learning Lee had died, and why he did not respond to his sister's text asking where he had dropped off Lee.",
      "Momeni said he did not learn of Lee\u2019s death until the following day and was puzzled by his sister\u2019s query. He said he thought Lee could have been stabbed by someone else shortly after he saw him walk off, unharmed.",
      "In response to questions, Momeni said he didn't know what the prosecutor was getting at, accused him of misrepresenting his statements and said he had already answered.",
      "At one point, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alexandra Gordon said that the prosecutor had no obligation to provide him with a printout of the texts he was questioning him about or to put them on the multimedia screen.",
      "\u201cGotcha,\u201d said Momeni, dressed in a blue suit and tie. \u201cThank you for clarifying.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have video showing Lee and Momeni leaving Khazar Momeni's condo after 2 a.m. and driving off together in Momeni\u2019s BMW. Video also shows the two men getting out of the car in an isolated spot by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Prosecutors say that is where Momeni stabbed Lee, while the defense says that is where Lee attacked Momeni, erratic and aggressive from a multi-day bender of cocaine, ketamine and drinking.",
      "A knife recovered from the area where Lee was stabbed showed Momeni's DNA on the handle, but the defense said the handle should have been tested for fingerprints, namely Lee\u2019s.",
      "Momeni said he and Lee were on friendly terms when they left his sister's condo, but prosecutors say the defendant grilled the entrepreneur earlier in the evening about what might have happened to his sister at the drug dealer's apartment.",
      "The prosecutor pointed out multiple times Thursday that Momeni was questioning him the way he grilled Lee.",
      "Nima Momeni was 14 when his mother, Mahnaz Tayarani, took him and Khazar to the U.S., fleeing Iran and a husband who had inflicted years of abuse and violence on the family, she wrote in a letter submitted to the court in support of her son\u2019s pre-trial release.",
      "She has sat on one side of the courtroom while Lee's family members sit on the other."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia plans to require social media platforms to act to prevent online harms to users such as bullying, predatory behavior and algorithms pushing destructive content, the government said Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe Digital Duty of Care will place the onus on digital platforms to proactively keep Australians safe and better prevent online harms,\u201d Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said in a statement.",
      "The proposed changes to the Online Safety Act were announced before the government next week introduces to Parliament world-first legislation that would ban children younger than 16 from platforms including X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.",
      "Critics have argued that removing children from social media reduced incentives for platforms to provide safer online environments.",
      "Social media has been blamed for an increase in children taking their own lives and developing eating disorders due to bulling and exposures to negative body images.",
      "Rowland said making tech companies legally responsible for keeping Australians safe was an approach already adopted by Britain and the European Union.",
      "Digital businesses would be required to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harms on their platforms and services. The duty of care framework would be underpinned by risk assessment and risk mitigation, and informed by safety-by-design principles, the minister said.",
      "Legislating a duty of care would mean services can\u2019t \u201cset and forget.\u201d Instead, their obligations would mean they need to continually identify and mitigate potential risks, as technology and service offerings change and evolve, she said.",
      "The categories of harm in the legislation include harm to young people and mental well-being, promotion of harmful practices and illegal activity.",
      "The government has not said when the duty of care legislation will be introduced to Parliament or outlined the punishment for breaches.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia better known as DIGI, welcomed government efforts to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the Online Safety Act.",
      "\u201cDIGI\u2019s members together represent some of the safest sections of the Internet, and their work to keep people safe on their services never stops,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWhile we wait for further details about this announcement, DIGI\u2019s members will continue to deliver safety-by-design on their services and work constructively with the government to keep Australians safe online,\u201d Bose added.",
      "Swinburne University digital media expert Belinda Barnet described the duty of care as a \u201cgreat idea.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite pioneering to expect that platforms that host Australian users would have a duty of care responsibility in terms of the content they show and the experiences they offer,\u201d Barnet said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making the platforms take responsibility and that just simply doesn\u2019t happen at the moment. There\u2019s an assumption that they\u2019re a neutral third party. They\u2019re not responsible for the impact of that content,\u201d Barnet added.",

      "The Australian government's plan to ban children from social media to protect them from harm has won almost universal political support",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- How do you remove children from the harms of social media? Politically the answer appears simple in Australia, but practically the solution could be far more difficult.",
      "The Australian government\u2019s plan to ban children from social media platforms including X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram until their 16th birthdays is politically popular. The opposition party says it would have done the same after winning elections due within months if the government hadn\u2019t moved first.",
      "The leaders of all eight Australian states and mainland territories have unanimously backed the plan, although Tasmania, the smallest state, would have preferred the threshold was set at 14.",
      "But a vocal assortment of experts in the fields of technology and child welfare have responded with alarm. More than 140 such experts signed an open letter to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemning the 16-year age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Details of what is proposed and how it will be implemented are scant. More will be known when legislation is introduced into the Parliament next week.",
      "Leo Puglisi, a 17-year-old Melbourne student who founded online streaming service 6 News Australia at the age of 11, laments that lawmakers imposing the ban lack the perspective on social media that young people have gained by growing up in the digital age.",
      "\u201cWith respect to the government and prime minister, they didn\u2019t grow up in the social media age, they\u2019re not growing up in the social media age, and what a lot of people are failing to understand here is that, like it or not, social media is a part of people\u2019s daily lives,\u201d Leo said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of their communities, it\u2019s part of work, it\u2019s part of entertainment, it\u2019s where they watch content \u2013 young people aren\u2019t listening to the radio or reading newspapers or watching free-to-air TV \u2013 and so it can\u2019t be ignored. The reality is this ban, if implemented, is just kicking the can down the road for when a young person goes on social media,\u201d Leo added.",
      "Leo has been applauded for his work online. He was a finalist in his home state Victoria's nomination for the Young Australian of the Year award, which will be announced in January. His nomination bid credits his platform with \u201cfostering a new generation of informed, critical thinkers.\u201d",
      "One of the proposal's supporters, cyber safety campaigner Sonya Ryan, knows from personal tragedy how dangerous social media can be for children.",
      "Her 15-year-old daughter Carly Ryan was murdered in 2007 in South Australia state by a 50-year-old pedophile who pretended to be a teenager online. In a grim milestone of the digital age, Carly was the first person in Australia to be killed by an online predator.",
      "\u201cKids are being exposed to harmful pornography, they\u2019re being fed misinformation, there are body image issues, there\u2019s sextortion, online predators, bullying. There are so many different harms for them to try and manage and kids just don\u2019t have the skills or the life experience to be able to manage those well,\u201d Sonya Ryan said.",
      "\u201cThe result of that is we\u2019re losing our kids. Not only what happened to Carly, predatory behavior, but also we\u2019re seeing an alarming rise in suicide of young people,\u201d she added.",
      "Sonya Ryan is part of a group advising the government on a national strategy to prevent and respond to child sexual abuse in Australia.",
      "She wholeheartedly supports Australia setting the social media age limit at 16.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get this perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to make sure that there are mechanisms in place to deal with what we already have which is an anxious generation and an addicted generation of children to social media.\"",
      "A major concern for social media users of all ages is the legislation\u2019s potential privacy implications.",
      "Age estimation technology has proved inaccurate, so digital identification appears to be the most likely option for assuring a user is at least 16.",
      "Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, an office that describes itself as the world\u2019s first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online, has suggested in planning documents adopting the role of authenticator. The government would hold the identity data and the platforms would discover through the commissioner whether a potential account holder was 16.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, fears that the government will make the platforms hold the users\u2019 identification data instead.",
      "The government has already said the onus will be on the platforms, rather than on children or their parents, to ensure everyone meets the age limit.",
      "\u201cThe worst possible outcome seems to be the one that the government may be inadvertently pushing towards, which would be that the social media platforms themselves would end up being the identity arbiter,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThey would be the holder of identity documents which would be absolutely terrible because they have a fairly poor track record so far of holding on to personal data well,\u201d he added.",
      "The platforms will have a year once the legislation has become law to work out how the ban can be implemented.",
      "Ryan, who divides her time between Adelaide in South Australia and Fort Worth, Texas, said privacy concerns should not stand in the way of removing children from social media.",
      "\u201cWhat is the cost if we don\u2019t? If we don\u2019t put the safety of our children ahead of profit and privacy?\u201d she asked.",

      "In a Cypriot National Guard camp, Ukrainians are being trained on how to identify, locate and dispose of landmines and other unexploded munitions that litter huge swaths of their country, killing and maiming hundreds of people, including children",
      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- In a Cypriot National Guard camp, Ukrainians are being trained on how to identify, locate and dispose of landmines and other unexploded munitions that litter huge swaths of their country, killing and maiming hundreds of people, including children.",
      "Analysts say Ukraine is among the countries that are the most affected by landmines and discarded explosives, as a result of Russia\u2019s ongoing war.",
      "According to U.N. figures, some 399 people have been killed and 915 wounded from landmines and other munitions since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, equal to the number of casualties reported from 2014-2021. More than 1 in 10 of those casualties have been children.",
      "The economic impact is costing billions to the Ukrainian economy. Landmines and other munitions are preventing the sowing of 5 million hectares, or 10%, of the country\u2019s agricultural land.",
      "Cyprus stepped up to offer its facilities as part of the European Union\u2019s Military Assistance Mission to Ukraine. So far, almost 100 Ukrainian armed forces personnel have taken part in three training cycles over the last two years, said Cyprus Foreign Ministry spokesperson Theodoros Gotsis.",
      "\u201cWe are committed to continuing this support for as long as it takes,\u201d Gotsis told the Associated Press, adding that the Cyprus government has covered the 250,000 euro ($262,600) training cost.",
      "Cyprus opted to offer such training owing to its own landmine issues dating back five decades when the island nation was ethnically divided when Turkey invaded following a coup that sought union with Greece. The United Nations has removed some 27,000 landmines from a buffer zone that cuts across the island, but minefields remain on either side. The Cypriot government says it has disposed of all anti-personnel mines in line with its obligations under an international treaty that bans the use of such munitions.",
      "In Cyprus, Ukrainians undergo rigorous theoretical and practical training over a five-week Basic Demining and Clearance course that includes instruction on distinguishing and safely handling landmines and other explosive munitions, such as rockets, 155 mm artillery shells, rocket-propelled grenades and mortar shells.",
      "Theoretical training uses inert munitions identical to the actual explosives.",
      "Most of the course is comprised of hands-on training focusing on the on-site destruction of unexploded munitions using explosives, the chief training officer told the Associated Press. The officer spoke on condition of anonymity because he\u2019s not authorized to disclose his identity for security reasons.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trained on ordnance disposal using real explosives,\u201d the officer said. \u201cThat will be the trainees\u2019 primary task when they return.\u201d",
      "Cypriot officials said the Ukrainian trainees did not want to be either interviewed or photographed.",
      "Defusing discarded munitions or landmines in areas where explosive charges can\u2019t be used \u2014 for instance, near a hospital \u2014 is not part of this course because that\u2019s the task of highly trained teams of disposal experts whose training can last as long as eight months, the officer said.",
      "Trainees, divided into groups of eight, are taught how to operate metal detectors and other tools for detecting munitions like prodders \u2014 long, thin rods which are used to gently probe beneath the ground\u2019s surface in search of landmines and other explosive ordnance.",
      "Another tool is a feeler, a rod that\u2019s used to detect booby-trapped munitions. There are many ways to booby-trap such munitions, unlike landmines which require direct pressure to detonate.",
      "\u201cBooby-trapped munitions are a widespread phenomenon in Ukraine,\u201d the chief training officer explained.",
      "Training, primarily conducted by experts from other European Union countries, takes place both in forested and urban areas at different army camps and follows strict safety protocols.",
      "The short, intense training period keeps the Ukrainians focused.",
      "\u201cYou see the interest they show during instruction: they ask questions, they want to know what mistakes they\u2019ve made and the correct way of doing it,\u201d the officer said.",
      "Humanitarian data and analysis group ACAPS said in a Jan. 2024 report that 174,000 sq. kilometers (67,182 sq. miles) or nearly 29% of Ukraine\u2019s territory needs to be surveyed for landmines and other explosive ordnance.",
      "More than 10 million people are said to live in areas where demining action is needed.",
      "Since 2022, Russian forces have used at least 13 types of anti-personnel mines, which target people. Russia never signed the 1997 Ottawa Convention banning the use of anti-personnel mines, but the use of such mines is nonetheless considered a violation of its obligations under international law.",
      "Russia also uses 13 types of anti-tank mines.",
      "The International Campaign to Ban Landmines said in its 2023 Landmine Monitor report that Ukrainian government forces may have also used antipersonnel landmines in contravention of the Mine Ban Treaty in and around the city of Izium during 2022, when the city was under Russian control."

      "European Union regulators hit Facebook parent Meta with a fine of nearly 800 million euros on Thursday for what it calls \u201cabusive practices\u201d involving its Marketplace online classified ads business",
      "LONDON -- European Union regulators issued their first antitrust fine to Facebook parent Meta on Thursday with a penalty of nearly 800 million euros for what they call \u201cabusive practices\u201d involving its Marketplace online classified ads business.",
      "The European Commission, the 27-nation bloc's executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, issued the 797.72 million euro ($841 million) penalty after its long-running investigation found that the company abused its dominant position and engaged in anti-competitive behavior.",
      "It\u2019s the first time the EU has imposed a fine on the social media giant for breaches of the bloc\u2019s competition law. Brussels has already slapped Big Tech rivals Google and Apple with billions in antitrust penalties.",
      "The commission had accused Meta of distorting competition by tying its online classified ad business to its social network, automatically exposing Facebook users to Marketplace \u201cwhether they want it or not\" and shutting out competitors.",
      "It was also concerned that Meta was imposing unfair trading conditions with terms of service that authorized the company to use ad-related data \u2014 generated from competing classified ad platforms who advertise on Facebook or Instagram \u2014 to benefit Marketplace.",
      "Meta's practices gave it \u201cadvantages that other online classified ads service providers could not match,\u201d Margrethe Vestager, the commission's executive vice-president in charge of competition policy, said in a press release \u201cThis is illegal under EU antitrust rules. Meta must now stop this behaviour.\u201d",
      "Meta said in a statement that the decision fails to prove any \u201ccompetitive harm\u201d to rivals or consumers and \u201cignores the realities of the thriving European market for online classified listing services.\u201d",
      "The company said the Commission's case ignores the fact that Facebook users can choose to \u201dengage with Marketplace, and many don't.\" It said online marketplaces, including global sites like eBay, Europe-wide platforms like Vinted, and national services are continuing to grow.",
      "Meta said it would comply with the Commission's order to end the offending conduct and not repeat it, but also vowed to appeal.",
      "The case dates back to 2021, when European Union regulators and their counterparts in Britain opened dual investigations into the classified business. The British regulator wrapped up its investigation last year after Meta made concessions.",
      "The company continues to face EU scrutiny on other fronts, including investigations into whether Facebook and Instagram child safety and election integrity measures comply with the bloc\u2019s digital rulebook. Meta has previously been hit with a series of fines for breaches of the EU\u2019s stringent privacy laws, including a record 1.2 billion euro penalty last year.",

      "The November supermoon will still be almost full when the Leonid meteor shower peaks this weekend",
      "WASHINGTON -- It's a treat to see a supermoon. But that bright glowing orb will still be almost full when the Leonid meteor shower peaks this weekend, likely obscuring all but the brightest meteors in most locations.",
      "The Leonids are known for their high-speed meteors, which can travel at up to 44 miles per second (70 kilometers per second).",
      "\"Unfortunately this year, the viewing conditions will be affected\" by a nearly full moon, said Shyam Balaji of King's College London. \u201cWatching during the early morning hours, when the moon is lower in the sky, can improve your chances of seeing more meteors.\"",
      "This shower may result in around 15 visible meteors per hour under ideal viewing conditions.",
      "This year\u2019s peak activity on Sunday will happen when the moon is 98% full. The shower lasts through December 2.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the Leonids and other meteor showers.",
      "Multiple meteor showers occur annually and you don\u2019t need special equipment to see them.",
      "Most meteor showers originate from the debris of comets. The source of the Leonids is the comet Tempel-Tuttle.",
      "When rocks from space enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the resistance from the air makes them very hot. This causes the air to glow around them and briefly leaves a fiery tail behind them \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d",
      "The glowing pockets of air around fast-moving space rocks, ranging from the size of a dust particle to a boulder, may be visible in the night sky.",
      "Meteor showers are usually most visible between midnight and predawn hours.",
      "It\u2019s easier to see shooting stars under dark skies, away from city lights. Meteor showers also appear brightest on cloudless nights when the moon wanes smallest.",
      "And your eyes will better adapted to seeing meteors if you aren\u2019t checking your phone.",
      "The meteor society keeps an updated list of upcoming large meteor showers, including the peak viewing days and moonlight conditions.",
      "The next big one is the Geminid meteor shower, which peaks in mid-December.",

      "Waymo on Tuesday opened its robotaxi service to anyone who wants a ride around Los Angeles, marking another milestone in the evolution of self-driving car technology since the company began as a secret project at Google 15 years ago.",
      "The expansion comes eight months after Waymo began offering rides in Los Angeles to a limited group of passengers chosen from a waiting list that had ballooned to more than 300,000 people. Now, anyone with the Waymo One smartphone app will be able to request a ride around an 80-square-mile (129-square-kilometer) territory spanning the second largest U.S. city.",
      "After Waymo received approval from California regulators to charge for rides 15 months ago, the company initially chose to launch its operations in San Francisco before offering a limited service in Los Angeles.",
      "Before deciding to compete against conventional ride-hailing pioneers Uber and Lyft in California, Waymo unleashed its robotaxis in Phoenix in 2020 and has been steadily extending the reach of its service in that Arizona city ever since.",
      "Driverless rides are proving to be more than just a novelty. Waymo says it now transports more than 150,000 weekly trips in its robotaxis, a volume of business numbers that helped the company recently raise $5.6 billion from its corporate parent Alphabet and a list of other investors that included venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and financial management firm T. Rowe Price.",
      "\u201cOur service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana said in a blog post.",
      "Despite its inroads, Waymo is still believed to be losing money. Although Alphabet doesn't disclose Waymo's financial results, the robotaxi is a major part of an \u201cOther Bets\u201d division that had suffered an operating loss of $3.3 billion through the first nine months of this year, down from a setback of $4.2 billion at the same time last year.",
      "But Waymo has come a long way since Google began working on self-driving cars in 2009 as part of project \u201cChauffeur.\u201d Since its 2016 spinoff from Google, Waymo has established itself as the clear leader in a robotaxi industry that's getting more congested.",
      "Electric auto pioneer Tesla is aiming to launch a rival \u201cCybercab\u201d service by 2026, although its CEO Elon Musk said he hopes the company can get the required regulatory clearances to operate in Texas and California by next year.",
      "Tesla's projected timeline for competing against Waymo has been met with skepticism because Musk has made unfulfilled promises about the company's self-driving car technology for nearly a decade.",
      "Meanwhile, Waymo's robotaxis have driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles and provided more than 2 million rides to passengers without encountering a serious accident that resulted in its operations being sidelined.",
      "That safety record is a stark contrast to one of its early rivals, Cruise, a robotaxi service owned by General Motors. Cruise's California license was suspended last year after one of its driverless cars in San Francisco dragged a jaywalking pedestrian who had been struck by a different car driven by a human.",
      "Cruise is now trying to rebound by joining forces with Uber to make some of its services available next year in U.S. cities that still haven't been announced. But Waymo also has forged a similar alliance with Uber to dispatch its robotaxi in Atlanta and Austin, Texas next year.",
      "Another robotaxi service, Amazon's Zoox, is hoping to begin offering driverless rides to the general public in Las Vegas at some point next year before also launching in San Francisco."

      "It's auction time for Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "Conspiracy theory purveyor Infowars and most of its assets went on the auction block Wednesday, with Alex Jones waiting to see if he will be allowed to stay or if he will get kicked off its online platforms.",
      "The private auction was being held as part of Jones' personal bankruptcy, which resulted from the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuit judgments a judge and jurors ordered the bombastic internet show and radio host to pay to families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for repeatedly telling his audience that the Connecticut massacre of 20 children and six adults was a hoax staged by crisis actors. Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the defamation verdicts.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee had said sealed bids would be opened at 10:30 a.m. CST so the winning bidder or bidders could be chosen. But Jones appeared to be getting impatient on his show as hours passed without any word on the results.",
      "\u201cI just want to know: Is this our last day here or not?\" he said.",
      "He later wrote on the social media platform X that the trustees told him the results will be released Thursday morning.",
      "Both Jones' supporters and detractors expressed interest in submitting bids. They included Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and President-elect Donald Trump, and progressive media groups that have been critical of Jones. He said he could be allowed to stay and keep using Infowars' platforms if allies won the bidding but that he could be kicked out and Infowars shut down if opponents bought it.",
      "Jones, based in Austin, Texas, said he set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts just in case. His personal social media in his name \u2014 including his account on X, with more than 3 million followers \u2014 were not up for sale. Court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "Jones revealed Wednesday that he worked with a group that put in a bid, but did not provide any details.",
      "\u201cThe folks I\u2019m working with, who put in (a) substantive bid to try to save Infowars and continue it in the future, have been given no information on the other bidders. That\u2019s all secret,\" he said in a video posted on X.",
      "Everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts, and product trademarks and inventory were up for sale. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. . Any unsold items will be auctioned off next month.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Prospective buyers submitted sealed bids and confidentiality agreements by last Friday. The bankruptcy trustee, attorney Christopher Murray, appointed by the Justice Department, could have held new rounds of bidding Wednesday to boost prices above the sealed bids.",
      "Jones said Murray decided to choose from among the sealed bids. Jones said he was frustrated with that decision and learned about changes to the auction process only on Monday. A judge's order in September gave the trustee wide authority and said new bidding rounds on Wednesday were optional.",
      "Murray also could reject bids, even the highest ones, if he deemed them \u201ccontrary to the best interests of the Debtor\u2019s estate, FSS (Infowars parent company Free Speech Systems) and their creditors.\u201d",
      "Families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats by his followers."

      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal fight about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe",
      "After a tumultuous year filled with anxiety and a legal battle about its future in the U.S., TikTok may have just been thrown a lifeline by the man who was once its biggest foe: Donald Trump.",
      "President-elect Trump, who tried to ban the social media platform the last time he was in the White House, has repeatedly pledged during his most recent campaign to oppose a ban on the short-form video app, which could happen as soon as mid-January if the company loses a court case that\u2019s currently underway in Washington.",
      "For months, TikTok, and its China-based parent company ByteDance, have been embroiled in a legal battle with the U.S. over a federal law that forces them to cut ties for national security reasons or stop operating in one of their biggest markets in the world. The measure, signed by President Joe Biden in April, gives ByteDance nine months to divest its stakes, with a possible three-month extension if a sale was in progress. If that happens, the deadline could be extended into the first 100 days of Trump\u2019s presidency.",
      "The companies have claimed that divestiture is not possible, and the law, if upheld, would force them to shut down by Jan. 19, just a day before Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Attorneys for both sides have asked a federal appeals court reviewing the case to issue a ruling by Dec. 6. The losing side is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and could decide to take up the case, potentially dragging out the process even longer.",
      "When reached for comment, the Trump transition team did not offer details on how Trump plans to carry out his pledge to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d as he said on a Truth Social post in September while encouraging people who care about the platform to vote for him. But Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the transition team, indicated in a statement that he plans to see it through.",
      "\ufeff\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cHe will deliver.\u201d",
      "During a March interview with CNBC, Trump said he still believed TikTok posed a national security risk but opposed banning it because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he has continued to lambast over his 2020 election loss. He also denied changing his mind on the issue because of Republican megadonor Jeff Yass, a ByteDance investor that Trump, at the time, said that he had only met \u201cvery briefly.\u201d He said Yass \u201cnever mentioned TikTok\u201d during their meeting.",
      "Still, ByteDance \u2013 and groups connected to Yass \u2013 have been attempting to exert their influence. Lobbying disclosure reports show that this year, ByteDance paid veteran lobbyist and former Trump campaign aide David Urban $150,000 to lobby lawmakers in Washington in favor of TikTok. The company has also spent more than $8 million on in-house lobbyists and another $1.4 million on other lobbying firms, according to Open Secrets.",
      "Meanwhile, in March, Politico reported Kellyanne Conway, a former senior Trump aide, was being paid by the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth to advocate for TikTok in Congress. A spokesperson for the organization said Conway was hired as a consultant to conduct polling. Conway and Urban did not respond to requests for comment. TikTok, which has long denied it\u2019s a national security risk, declined to comment.",
      "If the courts uphold the law, it would fall on Trump\u2019s Justice Department to enforce it and punish any potential violations with fines. The fines would apply to app stores that would be prohibited from offering TikTok, and internet hosting services who would be barred from supporting it. Leah Plunkett, a lecturer at Harvard Law School, said from her reading of the statute, the attorney general has to investigate violations but can decide whether or not to drag such companies to court and force them to comply.",
      "Trump could do other things to prevent TikTok from disappearing.",
      "He could issue an executive order to nullify the ban \u2014 which Plunkett believes would not be lawful \u2014 or urge Congress to repeal the law. That would require support from Congressional Republicans who have aligned themselves with Trump but have also supported the prospects of getting TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company.",
      "In a statement sent to the AP after the election, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on China, said Trump\u2019s \u201clong-standing concerns\u201d about TikTok align with the law\u2019s requirement for divestment.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration will have a unique opportunity to broker an American takeover of the platform,\u201d he said.",
      "ByteDance, though, has previously said it has no intention to sell the platform despite interest from some investors, including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Analysts say the company is even less likely to sell the proprietary algorithm that fuels what users see on the app. That means even if TikTok is sold to a qualified buyer, it is likely to be a shell of its current self and would need to be rebuilt with new technology.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said it\u2019s also possible that Trump could take the issue back to the drawing board and direct his administration to negotiate a new deal with TikTok.",
      "TikTok said in 2022, it presented the Biden administration with a draft agreement that would bolster protections for users and provide it more oversight over the company\u2019s U.S. operations. But the administration has argued in court documents in recent months that it would be challenging to enforce the agreement due to the size and the technical complexity of the platform.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t been privy to new intelligence material on the matter for a few years and it's possible he could change his mind - and abandon his campaign promise - once he does, Kreps said.",
      "Plunkett, the Harvard Law faculty and author of \u201cSharenthood: Why We Should Think before We Talk about Our Kids Online,\u201d said if she were counseling TikTok, she would advise them to come up with a divesture plan that is compliant with the law and as favorable to them as possible.",
      "\u201cThere is too much uncertainty about what a Trump administration is likely to do,\u201d she said."

      "Here's a look at what's in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "Under the draft legislation, only those over 18-years-old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying.",
      "They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die. Two independent doctors have to be satisfied the person is eligible and a High Court judge will need to approve the decision.",

      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication themselves. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has made it voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "The bill will be debated in Parliament and lawmakers will be able to vote on it according to their conscience, rather than along party lines.",
      "Opinion among lawmakers appears to be divided, though some senior ministers including Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said he intended to vote against the bill. Starmer has previously supported assisted dying, but the government says it will remain neutral on the issue.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament. Leadbeater suggested that any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different to euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances."

      "Japan\u2019s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country\u2019s north-central region from starting",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday formally disqualified a reactor in the country's north-central region from restarting, the first rejection under safety standards that were reinforced after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The decision is a setback for Japan as it seeks to accelerate reactor restarts to maximize nuclear power.",
      "The Nuclear Regulation Authority said the Tsuruga No. 2 reactor is \u201cunfit\u201d as its operator failed to address safety risks stemming from the presence of possible active fault lines, which can potentially cause earthquakes, underneath it.",
      "Tsuruga No. 2, operated by the Japan Atomic Power Co., is the first reactor to be rejected under safety standards adopted in 2013 based on lessons from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown disaster following a massive earthquake and tsunami.",
      "\u201cWe reached our conclusion based on a very strict examination,\u201d NRA chairperson Shinsuke Yamanaka told reporters.",
      "The verdict comes after more than eight years of safety reviews that were repeatedly disrupted by data coverups and mistakes by the operator, Yamanaka said. He called the case \u201cabnormal\u201d and urged the utility to take the result seriously.",
      "The decision is a blow to Japan Atomic Power because it virtually ends its hopes for a restart. The operator, which is decommissioning its other reactor, Tsuruga No. 1, had hoped to put No. 2 back online, but it would require an examination of dozens of faults around the reactor to prove their safety.",
      "\u201cThe decision is extremely regrettable,\" Japan Atomic Power said in a statement. It said it will continue efforts to restart.",
      "An NRA safety panel concluded three months ago it could not rule out the possibility of active fault lines about 300 meters (330 yards) north of the No. 2 reactor stretching to right underneath the facility, meaning the reactor cannot be operated.",
      "Japan\u2019s government in 2022 adopted a plan to maximize the use of nuclear energy, pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that safety is the prerequisite for nuclear plant operation and that the government respects the scientific and highly technical decision by the watchdog. He said the government's position to promote nuclear energy is unchanged.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. The quake caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate.",
      "Building key nuclear facilities, such as reactors, directly above active fault lines is prohibited in earthquake-prone Japan.",
      "Yamanaka said the NRA is not immediately ordering a decommissioning because the reactor, which is offline and its spent fuel safely cooled, will not pose a major threat.",
      "If the utility decides to reapply, it must address not only the faults issue but it also must implement adequate safety measures for the entire plant, Yamanaka said. Providing scientific proof of the status of faults underneath key nuclear facilities is difficult, but other operators that obtained restart permits all cleared the requirement, he noted.",
      "The Tsuruga No. 2 reactor first started commercial operation in February 1987 and has been offline since May 2011. The operator rejected the NRA panel's 2013 on-site inspection results, which concluded that the faults under the No. 2 reactor were active, and applied for a restart in 2015.",
      "Of more than 50 commercial reactors, 27 have applied for restarts and 17 of them have been approved so far under the post-Fukushima safety standard."

      "Alpha Genesis has said that efforts to recover all the monkeys will continue for as long as it takes at its compound about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe that Rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "The monkeys pose no risk to public health, Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police have all said. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers.",
      "If people encounter the monkeys, they are advised to stay away from them \u2014 and to not fly drones in the area. The company said they are skittish and might run away from where they are gathered."

      "Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don\u2019t want to pay for an ad-free subscription",
      "LONDON -- Facebook and Instagram users in Europe will get the option to see less personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription, social media company Meta said Tuesday, bowing to pressure from Brussels over privacy and digital competition concerns.",
      "Meta Platforms has been offering European Union an ad-free subscription option for about a year to comply with the continent's strict data privacy rules, but regulators had accused the company of giving people a false choice.",
      "The company said in a blog post that while people will still be able to choose between the subscription and existing free versions, it would also start giving free users an extra option over the coming weeks to see digital ads that are less personalized.",
      "This means ads will be targeted at users based only on what they see during their current session on Facebook or Instagram going back no more than two hours, plus minimal personal information such as age, location, gender as well as how they engage with ads.",
      "Data from all of a user's previous time spent on Facebook or Instagram, which is typically combined to precisely target an individual with tailored ads, won't be used.",
      "\u201cWhile this new choice is designed to give people an additional control over their data and ad experience, it may result in ads that are less relevant to a person\u2019s interests,\u201d Meta said in a blog post. \u201cThat means people will see ads that they don\u2019t find as interesting. This drop in relevance is inevitable given that drastically reduced data is being used to show these less personalized ads to people.\u201d",
      "People who choose the new option will see ad breaks that can't be skipped for a few seconds, Meta said.",
      "European Union regulators had accused Meta of breaching the 27-nation bloc's digital rules when it gave user the option to pay a monthly fee to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data.",
      "The U.S. tech giant had rolled out the option after the European Union\u2019s top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users\u2019 online interests and digital activity.",
      "The company also said Tuesday it's slashing monthly subscription prices for the ad-free option. Web users will pay 5.99 euros ($6.36), down from 9.99 euros previously, while iPhone and Android users will be charged 7.99 euros instead of 12.99 euros, which includes commissions charged by the Apple and Google mobile app stores.",
      "Meta's new subscription model could hit the company's lucrative digital ad business in one of its biggest markets. The company said it has already factored the new offering into its most recent business outlook and financial guidance.",
      "The options are available to users 18 and older in the EU\u2019s 27 member countries, plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein."

      "WASHINGTON -- Scientists can't know precisely when a volcano is about to erupt, but they can sometimes pick up telltale signs.",
      "That happened two years ago with the world's largest active volcano. About two months before Mauna Loa spewed rivers of glowing orange molten lava, geologists detected small earthquakes nearby and other signs, and they warned residents on Hawaii's Big Island.",
      "Now a study of the volcano's lava confirms their timeline for when the molten rock below was on the move.",
      "\u201cVolcanoes are tricky because we don\u2019t get to watch directly what\u2019s happening inside \u2013 we have to look for other signs,\" said Erik Klemetti Gonzalez, a volcano expert at Denison University, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Upswelling ground and increased earthquake activity near the volcano resulted from magma rising from lower levels of Earth\u2019s crust to fill chambers beneath the volcano, said Kendra Lynn, a research geologist at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and co-author of a new study in Nature Communications.",
      "When pressure was high enough, the magma broke through brittle surface rock and became lava \u2013 and the eruption began in late November 2022. Later, researchers collected samples of volcanic rock for analysis.",
      "The chemical makeup of certain crystals within the lava indicated that around 70 days before the eruption, large quantities of molten rock had moved from around 1.9 miles (3 kilometers) to 3 miles (5 kilometers) under the summit to a mile (2 kilometers) or less beneath, the study found. This matched the timeline the geologists had observed with other signs.",
      "The last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. Most of the U.S. volcanoes that scientists consider to be active are found in Hawaii, Alaska and the West Coast.",
      "Worldwide, around 585 volcanoes are considered active.",
      "Scientists can't predict eruptions, but they can make a \u201cforecast,\u201d said Ben Andrews, who heads the global volcano program at the Smithsonian Institution and who was not involved in the study.",
      "Andrews compared volcano forecasts to weather forecasts \u2013 informed \u201cprobabilities\u201d that an event will occur. And better data about the past behavior of specific volcanos can help researchers finetune forecasts of future activity, experts say.",
      "(asterisk)We can look for similar patterns in the future and expect that there\u2019s a higher probability of conditions for an eruption happening,\u201d said Klemetti Gonzalez.",

      "As President-elect Donald Trump begins filling key posts in his second administration, social media users are pushing false claims that the 2024 election was rigged in his favor.",
      "One such narrative claims that billionaire Elon Musk facilitated the alleged fraud with his internet service provider Starlink, manipulating the vote count through election equipment such as ballot tabulators. Starlink, a subsidiary of Musk's SpaceX company, uses satellites to offer high-speed internet, even in remote areas.",
      "Some rural counties used the technology during the 2024 race to access their electronic poll books.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk used his internet provider Starlink to steal the 2024 election for President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "THE FACTS: These claims are unfounded. Election officials, including from multiple swing states, told The Associated Press that their voting equipment doesn\u2019t use Starlink and is not even connected to the internet. States have additional security measures to ensure that the count is accurate, according to experts. Election officials and security agencies have reported no significant issues with the 2024 race.",
      "\u201cIt is not possible that Starlink was used to hack or change the outcome of the US presidential election,\u201d David Becker, founder and executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research, wrote in an email. \u201cThis, quite simply, did not happen, and could not happen, thanks to the security measures we have in place, and these conspiracy theories echo other disinformation we\u2019ve heard over the past several years.\u201d",
      "Becker further explained that the country's nearly 10,000 election jurisdictions use a wide range of voting machines that are not connected to the internet while voting occurs and that nearly all votes are recorded on paper ballots, which are audited by hand to confirm the results of electronic tabulators.",
      "\u201cIf anyone tried to interfere with the machines to rig the election, it would be discovered through multiple means, including reconciling the registered voters who cast ballots with the number of votes, as well as the audits,\u201d he added.",
      "Certain jurisdictions in a few states allow for ballot scanners in polling locations to transmit unofficial results, using a mobile private network, after voting has ended on Election Day and the memory cards containing the vote tallies have been removed.",
      "Election officials who allow this say it provides for faster reporting of unofficial election results on election night. They say the paper records of the ballots cast are used to authenticate the results during postelection reviews, and that those records would be crucial to a recount if one was needed. Computer security experts have said this is an unnecessary risk and should be prohibited.",
      "Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly said in a statement on Nov. 6 that CISA has \u201cno evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Despite a lack of evidence, many on social media suggested that Starlink could indeed have been used to steal the election.",
      "\u201cIf Trump & Elon's \u2018little secret\u2019 was to use Starlink in swing states to tally the votes & rig the election \u2014 an investigation & hand recount is crucial. Now,\u201d reads one X post that had been liked and shared approximately 41,700 times as of Tuesday.",
      "Another widely shared X post states: \u201cElon Musk used Starlink to hack our elections so he can have nice things while inflicting pain on Americans. Are we really going to turn a blind eye to what happened and let the worst people among us run the country.\u201d",
      "Election officials in North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania \u2014 three of the seven swing states Trump won \u2014 told the AP that their voting equipment is never connected to the internet. In some cases, this is mandated by state law.",
      "\u201cSatellite-based internet devices were not used to tabulate or upload vote counts in North Carolina,\u201d said Patrick Gannon, a spokesperson for the North Carolina State Board of Elections. \u201cIn addition, our tabulated results are encrypted from source to destination preventing results being modified in transit. And no, tabulators and ballot-marking devices are never connected to the internet in North Carolina.\"",
      "The Tar Heel State prohibits its voting systems from being \u201cconnected to a network\u201d and requires any feature that allows such a connection to be disabled. This includes the internet, as well as any other wired or wireless connections.",
      "Gannon added that North Carolina has \u201cno evidence of any alteration of votes by anyone\u201d and requested that people stop spreading misinformation about elections.",
      "Mike Hassinger, a spokesperson for the Georgia secretary of state's office, called the claims spreading online \u201cabsolutely conspiratorial nonsense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe don't use Starlink equipment for any part of our elections, and never have,\u201d he said. \u201cOur election equipment is 100% air-gapped and never connected to the internet.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cair-gapped\u201d refers to a security measure that isolates a secured computer network from those that are unsecured. This means it is impossible to use the internet to manipulate the software that tallies Georgia's votes or the memory cards on which they're recorded, according to Hassinger. He explained that memory cards are transported by hand in secure bags with tamper-evident ties to a central elections office where votes are tabulated. There is also a chain of custody protocol in place so that their movement is well documented.",
      "Matt Heckel, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State, wrote in an email: \u201cCounties do not use Starlink to transmit unofficial or official election results. No voting system in Pennsylvania is ever connected to the internet.\u201d",
      "A pilot program in Arizona's Coconino, Apache and Navajo counties intended to \u201cenhance connectivity in underserved areas\" uses Starlink systems for electronic poll book synchronization, according to JP Martin, a spokesperson for the Arizona secretary of state's office. The state's election equipment is air-gapped, one of many security measures.",
      "Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin also employ stringent precautions to protect the integrity of their voting equipment.",
      "Some posts spreading online pointed to a local news segment in which the registrar of voters in Tulare County, California, noted that internet connectivity at the county's poll sites was improved this year thanks to Starlink. Stephanie Hill, a systems and procedures analyst for the agency, wrote in an email that \u201cthis connection is strictly for voter check-in purposes only and in no way a part of our voting system.\u201d California is among the states that prohibit their voting equipment from being connected to the internet.",
      "Trump is currently beating Vice President Kamala Harris in Tulare County with 60% of the vote.",
      "Pamela Smith, president and CEO of Verified Voting, agreed that the idea that Starlink was used to rig the election is absurd.",
      "\u201cWhile Starlink provided connectivity in a number of jurisdictions for electronic poll books (EPBs) in this election, neither Starlink nor other types of communication networks play any role in counting votes,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cOur elections produce huge quantities of physical evidence. A satellite system like Starlink cannot steal that.\u201d",

      "Delivering his first public speech since winning the 2024 election, President-elect Donald Trump touted his victory and praised his allies at the America First Policy Institute Gala at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.",
      "Calling this year's the \"most consequential election,\" Trump recalled how he lost the popular vote in 2016 but won it this time around.",
      "\"They would say, 'he didn't win the popular vote.' And we won the popular vote by records now, which so nobody can say that anymore about us,\" Trump said.",
      "He also celebrated his newly selected Cabinet members and senior administration officials, many of whom were in attendance.",
      "Newly announced picks who attended the annual gala on Thursday evening, including Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.",
      "Notably, Trump did not give a shout out to former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who he had announced as his attorney general and who was also in attendance.",
      "As he provided pleasantries to several members in the room, Trump transitioned into complimenting Musk, with whom he's spent a significant amount of time since his victory.",
      "\"We have a man who has a seriously high IQ. You know, I'm a person that believes in high IQs, and his is about as high as they get,\" Trump said, thanking him for campaigning in Pennsylvania on his behalf.",
      "Trump then touted his pairing of Ramasamy and Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\"They're going to be saving a lot of money and making our country stronger and better. And they'll be coming out with individual reports. But a big one toward the end. And you put those two together, it's going to be really great. So we look forward to seeing and working with Elon and that'll be a great experience,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump briefly mentioned his choice of RFK Jr. for the secretary of Health and Human Services.",
      "\"He wants to make people healthy. It's driven him pretty wild over the last number of years,\" Trump said, describing the position in a roundabout way: \"And today I nominated him for, I guess -- if you like health, and if you like people that live a long time, it's the most important position.\"",
      "However, he added a word of caution: \"I just looked at the news reports. People like you, Bobby. Don't get too popular, Bobby.\"",

And we're going to do things with energy and with land interior. That is going to be incredible. And so, I look forward to doing the formal announcement,\" Trump teased.",
      "Trump also joked that his term's official start date should be marked as Nov. 6, claiming that the economy is already doing better since his victory.",
      "\"You have to start my term from November 5th, okay? Or November 6th if you want ... November 5th, because the market's gone through the roof. Enthusiasms doubled. It's doubled in the last short while,\" Trump said.",

      "\"I really want to congratulate Linda, you and Brooke, for the job you've done. And it's an honor to be here,\" Trump closed, complimenting the AFPI executives.",
      "Trump was introduced by \"Rocky\" actor Sylvester Stallone, who delivered brief remarks that compared the president-elect to his own legacy film character and then to George Washington. Notably, Vice President Kamala Harris held her final campaign rally on the iconic \"Rocky steps\" in Philadelphia on the eve of the election.",
      "Before Trump took the stage, speakers included AFPI President Brook Rollins, AFPI board chair and Trump transition co-chair Linda McMahon, Argentine President Javier Millei, Ramaswamy and Larry Kudlow.",
      "After Trump spoke, Musk delivered a short speech as well, doubling down on his promise to gut the federal government.",
      "Trump's decision to deliver his first full speech on camera at the America First Policy Institute gala symbolized a move away from his campaign to his transition efforts \u2013 and a celebration of the AFPI's work for four years to quietly prepare for such a moment, building out Trump-aligned policy agenda for his second term and housing hundreds of former Trump administration officials who are now ready to go into his second administration.",
      "The ballroom was full of Trump allies of big and small names.",

    "summary": "The woman at the center of the DOJ's probe of Matt Gaetz testified to the House Ethics Committee that he had sex with her when she was 17 years old, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "Trump tapped Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to be the new attorney general.",
      "The woman who was at the center of a yearslong Justice Department investigation into sex trafficking allegations surrounding Rep. Matt Gaetz testified to the House Ethics Committee that the now-former Florida congressman had sex with her when she was 17 years old, sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that Gaetz had been tapped to serve as attorney general, overseeing the very branch of government that previously conducted its own investigation of him, which ended last year without charges being brought.",
      "Gaetz resigned from office following Trump's announcement. This came as the House Ethics Committee was in the final stages of its investigation, said sources, who added that the committee was preparing to meet this week to deliberate over whether to release a final report on the matter.",
      "Over the summer, the House Ethics Committee subpoenaed the woman at the center of the probe -- who is now in her 20s -- and she sat for multiple days of testimony where she testified to the committee that Gaetz had sex with her when she was a minor in high school, sources close to the investigation said.",
      "\"These allegations are invented and would constitute false testimony to Congress,\" Gaetz said in response to ABC News' reporting. \"This false smear following a three-year criminal investigation should be viewed with great skepticism.\"",
      "The Justice Department spent years probing the allegations against Gaetz, including allegations of obstruction of justice, before informing Gaetz last year that it would not bring charges.",
      "Gaetz has long denied any wrongdoing related to the Justice Department probe. In September, he released a detailed response to questions sent to him by the House Ethics Committee, which has been investigating allegations of alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, reiterating his denial of the allegations.",
      "\"Your correspondence of September 4 asks whether I have engaged in sexual activity with any individual under 18. The answer to this question is unequivocally NO. You can apply this response to every version of this question, in every forum,\" Gaetz said in a statement posted to his social media account.",
      "\"The Committee\u2019s star witness, Joel Greenberg, is a felonious liar who involves others in his lies ... Greenberg was initially indicted for attempting to falsely smear a teacher at a local high school as a pedophile,\" Gaetz added regarding former Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg, who pleaded guilty to falsely accusing a teacher, who was running for office against him, of a sex crime.",
      "The woman's allegation regarding Gaetz became part of the investigation following claims by Greenberg, a former friend of Gaetz who is currently serving an 11-year prison sentence after reaching a deal with investigators in May 2021 in which he pleaded guilty to multiple federal crimes, including sex trafficking of the woman when she was a minor and introducing her to other \"adult men\" who also had sex with her when she was underage.",
      "According to Greenberg's plea deal, the woman, who ABC News is not identifying, met Greenberg online in 2017 and began meeting him in hotels and houses in the Middle District of Florida, where he \"introduced the Minor to other adult men, who engaged in commercial sex acts with the Minor in the Middle District of Florida,\" court documents said.",
      "At the time, the minor \"represented that she was an adult\" on the website where she met Greenberg -- and according to his plea agreement, he acknowledges that he \"acted in reckless disregard of the fact that the Minor was less than 18 years old when he engaged in commercial sex acts\" and had a \"reasonable opportunity to observe\" that she was underage.",
      "Over the course of its investigation, the House Ethics Committee conducted interviews with at least half a dozen women who allegedly attended parties where the Florida congressman was also present, and who were paid by Greenberg, Gaetz's one-time close friend, sources told ABC News. Some of the witnesses had been subpoenaed by the committee, while others agreed to cooperate, according to the sources.",
      "The House Ethics Committee also subpoenaed Gaetz's former girlfriend for testimony, and said she sat for an interview earlier in the year, sources said. The former girlfriend previously testified to a grand jury in the sex trafficking probe, as ABC News previously reported.",
      "The committee has also obtained a sworn written statement by Gaetz\u2019s ex-girlfriend where she lists the Florida congressman as one of the attendees at a party in July 2017 where dugs were present and which was attended by the woman who Gaetz allegedly had sex with when she was a minor, sources said.",
      "ABC News previously reported that the committee obtained written testimony from a separate woman who said that in July 2017, when she was 20 years old, she attended a party in Florida that Gaetz also attended, and which was attended by the woman who was a minor at the time and where drugs including cocaine were present.",
      "Greenberg, a key witness in the Justice Department probe, has been cooperating with the House Ethics investigation, according to sources. Earlier this year, while serving time in a Florida federal prison, he provided written testimony to the committee, the sources said.",
      "Some witnesses were shown Venmo payments they allegedly received from Gaetz, sources said.",
      "As ABC News previously reported, one woman who said she attended a party with the Gaetz in 2017, who ABC News is not identifying, told the committee that a payment from Gaetz was for sex, multiple sources told ABC News. Others have said they were paid to attend parties they said Gaetz also attended, and that those parties included drugs and sex, the sources said.",
      "Gaetz has long denied all of the allegations, including paying for sex, and previously dismissed them by claiming \"someone is trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.\"",
      "Earlier in the year the committee subpoenaed the Justice Department for records related to its probe into the Florida congressman, sources said. It is unclear if those records were turned over.",
      "However, the committee had obtained some Venmo records from Gaetz after issuing the company a subpoena, sources told ABC News. During the Justice Department's investigation into Gaetz, public reporting, including by The Daily Beast, largely focused on Venmo records from Greenberg, who, according to his plea agreement, used his account to \"pay for commercial sex acts\" with women he also introduced to others.",

      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth, according to new data from an organization co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and released Friday at the United Nations climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan.",
      "Nations at the talks are trying to set new targets to cut such emissions, and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",

Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",
      "\u201cOne of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,\u201d Gore said. \u201cAnd maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.\u201d",
      "China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution.",
      "The dataset \u2014 maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups \u2014 also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air.

    "story": [
      "Vance will be Trump's \"eyes and ears\" in the Senate, a source said.",
      "During the general election, Vice President-elect JD Vance made it clear that he was the policy attack dog and one of the primary messengers for Donald Trump's campaign. Now his vice presidential responsibilities are taking shape, with expectations that he will be Trump's \"eyes and ears\" in Congress, a source told ABC News.",
      "Leading up to the election, Vance kept a busy schedule that was a mix of campaign events and vast media appearances, including TV interviews, sitting down for digital interviews, and appearing on some of the world's most listened-to podcasts.",
      "During his election night speech, Trump called his running mate \"feisty\" and praised his work on the campaign trail.",
      "But as Vance enters his new role, a source familiar told ABC News that we should expect him to play a different role than the one we've become accustomed to over the past nearly four months.",
      "Vance has been tasked to ensure that all of the priorities of the Trump administration move forward and will work on any of the issues Trump needs him to further, a source familiar told ABC News, signaling that Vance will not be assigned one specific issue to work on, but will be involved in several policy issues.",
      "Some of the policy issues Vance could be dispatched on include the economy and immigration, which were the core issues Trump ran on during his campaign, the source said.",
      "It's also expected that Vance will be Trump's \"eyes and ears\" in the Senate to ensure that his agenda moves forward, the source also said.",
      "It's familiar territory for Vance, who was elected to the Senate in 2022. When Vance is sworn in as vice president in January, he will be the youngest vice president in modern American history and will be entering the office with a very brief political portfolio, having just those two years in the Senate as the first political office he ever held.",
      "Vance will also be succeeding Trump's last vice president, Mike Pence, who broke with Trump when it came to accepting the results of the 2020 election and refused to concede to the pressure from Trump not to certify the election results.",
      "Vance has shown to be different from Pence, remaining steadfast in his loyalty to the president-elect and defending him at every turn, something he spoke on before becoming Trump's vice presidential pick. Still, Vance once made clear his disdain for Trump, saying he was a \"never-Trump guy\" in an interview with Charlie Rose in 2016.",
      "A source familiar with Vance and Trump's relationship said Vance is focused on doing whatever is needed to support the president-elect and the administration.",
      "\"So, whether that means focusing on a specific policy issue or serving as his hammer to get things across the finish line in the Senate, JD is ready to deliver for the president,\" the source told ABC News. \"They've built a close personal friendship over the past few years and because of that, have a lot of trust in each other.\"",
      "In June of this year, Vance spoke at a Turning Point event where he was asked what Trump needed in a vice president and Vance said someone who is \"not trying to stab him in the back.\"",
      "\"There are a lot of smart, good people that Trump is looking at, but it also applies to our senators. It applies to our congressmen and women too. We need to have people who are supporting Trump -- not trying to stab him in the back. It's very, very simple,\" he said.",

      "Trump announced Hegseth as his nominee for Secretary of Defense on Tuesday.",
      "Across hours of podcast and television interviews, Army veteran and Fox News host Pete Hegseth has articulated his plan for a \"frontal assault\" to reform the Department of Defense from the top down, including by purging \"woke\" generals, limiting women from some combat roles, eliminating diversity goals and utilizing the \"real threat of violence\" to reassert the United States as a global power.",
      "As President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for the Secretary of Defense, Hegseth, 44, could have the chance to implement that vision, commanding the country's more than a million active duty soldiers.",
      "An infantry officer in the U.S. Army National Guard, Hegseth deployed to Guantanamo Bay, Iraq and Afghanistan before leaving the service with the rank of major, according to military records. Hegseth has worked for Fox News since 2014, where he co-hosts \"FOX & Friends Weekend.\" Once a critic of Trump's foreign policy and military stances during Trump's 2016 campaign, Hegseth grew to become one of Trump's fiercest on-air defenders.",
      "\"Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First. With Pete at the helm, America's enemies are on notice - Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,\" Trump said announcing the nomination.",
      "A New York Times best-selling author, Hegseth has frequently commented on military policy and suggested one of his first orders of business would be firing any generals who supported the Pentagon's diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.",
      "\"First of all, you got to fire the Chairman Joint of the Chiefs and obviously going to bring in a new Secretary of Defense, but any general that was involved -- general, admiral, whatever -- that was involved in, any of the DEI woke s---, has got to go,\" Hegseth said during a recent interview on the \"Shawn Ryan Show\" podcast. \"Either you're in for warfighting, and that's it. That's the only litmus test we care about.\"",
      "Hegseth had preemptively defended the move, saying it would be a return to normalcy for soldiers rather than a \"MAGA takeover.\"",
      "While Hegseth has described countries like Russia and China as threats, he has framed the military's biggest threat as an internal one, arguing that \"wokeness\" divided the military internally and created an issue that adversaries can exploit.",
      "\"I think our biggest threat is internal. I think we're committing cultural suicide, and we've lost complete focus on the basics and building blocks of what made Western civilization in America exceptional, fruitful, prosperous, strong, free,\" Hegseth said on the podcast.",
      "Hegseth has proposed a wholesale purge of military officials who have supported DEI policies, urging a \"frontal assault right back at what's been done to this military from the top and to the bottom.\"",
      "\"The dumbest phrase on planet Earth in the military is our diversity is our strength,\" Hegseth said on the podcast, arguing that uniformity between soldiers is a key to the military's strength.",
      "\"Every time I hear a military leader say [diversity is our strength], I throw up in my mouth a little bit more, because if they believe it, it shows you how sideways and how indoctrinated they are,\" Hegseth said on \"The Right Take With Mark Tapson\" podcast.",
      "While 17.5% of active-duty military personnel are women, Hegseth has argued that military leaders should acknowledge that their main constituency is \"strong, normal men,\" rebuffing efforts to diversify the ranks of the armed services.",
      "\"There aren't enough lesbians in San Francisco to staff the 82nd Airborne like you need, you need the boys in Kentucky and Texas and North Carolina and Wisconsin,\" Hegseth said on Tapson's podcast earlier this year.",
      "Hegseth was on the \"Take It Outside with Jay Cutler and Sam Mackey\" podcast and said that transgender soldiers are \"not deployable\" because they are \"reliant on chemicals\" and suggested that women should not serve in certain combat roles.",
      "\"Everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat means casualties are worse,\" Hegseth said on Ryan's podcast, arguing that men are \"more capable\" in combat roles because of biological factors.",
      "An ardent defender of the president-elect, Hegseth has argued that the United States military under Trump was more effective by posing both \"uncertainty\" and the \"real threat of violence.\"",
      "\"At least under Trump, there were missiles falling on terrorists' heads,\" Hegseth said on the \"Man of War\" podcast with Rafa Conde. \"They knew he meant business. Kim Jong Un, even though it didn't work, knew Trump meant business. Fire and fury was a real thing. Uncertainty is a real thing. The real threat of violence is a real thing, and none of that exists under these globalists who think they can sanction their way.\"",
      "He has also criticized international institutions like the United Nations as a \"farce\" and \"giant joke\" while advocating a military policy that aims to end long-term conflicts through decisive action.",
      "\"We expect this clinically sanitized, you know, no civilian casualties. Everything's going to be perfect. No one's going to get hurt, everything. It's just not how war operates, and that's unfortunate,\" Hegseth said on \"The Way I Heard It with Mike Rowe\" podcast. \"But if we try to do it with kid gloves or with surgical gloves, we're never really going to get rid of, actually exterminate the enemies that we need to defeat to create a peace on the other side.\"",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's announcement that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a newly formed Department of Government Efficiency has alarmed some government ethics experts.",
    "story": [
      "Experts warn the pair's role could raise possible conflict concerns.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's announcement Tuesday that tech billionaire Elon Musk and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy will lead a newly formed advisory Department of Government Efficiency has alarmed some government ethics experts, who say the pair's deep financial interests could lead to potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Some ethics experts are particularly alarmed that Musk and Ramaswamy's roles have been described as \"outside of government\" -- an arrangement that could potentially mean they would not be subject to normal financial disclosure rules, despite the major impact their work could have on the federal government.",
      "\"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" Trump said of Musk and Ramaswamy, both of whom were vocal supporters of Trump's reelection campaign.",
      "As outside governmental advisers, Musk -- who owns Tesla, X and SpaceX -- and Ramaswamy -- who founded the biotech firm Roivant Sciences -- might not be subject to federal requirements mandating that officials disclose their financial interests to the Office of Government Ethics.",
      "Certain categories of advisers from outside the government can be required to disclose their interests under the Federal Advisory Committee Act -- including if they are classified as a \"Special Government Employee\" -- but ethics experts say that not enough is known about the proposed department to know if they would be covered under that act.",
      "Musk has promised transparency, posting on X shortly after the announcement, \"All actions of the Department of Government Efficiency will be posted online for maximum transparency.\"",
      "\"The transition team will ensure the Department of Government Efficiency and those involved with it are compliant with all legal guidelines related to conflicts of interest,\" Trump transition spokesperson Brian Hughes told ABC News.",
      "Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center, told ABC News that the possibility that Musk and Ramaswamy would not have financial disclosure obligations is alarming because their work cutting government regulations or spending could directly impact their business interests without the public knowing.",
      "\"It could be simply an attempt to stop the regulations on their business interest at the expense of government workers and the public,\" said Payne, who added that they could also be in a position to get more government contracts for their businesses.",
      "\"If you eliminate the government from doing certain tasks, then those tasks can go to government contracts for consultants,\" Payne said.",
      "Payne also stressed the highly unusual nature of Musk and Ramaswamy's proposed roles as outside advisers with significant influence.",
      "\"It's extremely rare to do it like this,\" he said. \"It is common to have outside experts give advice to the government ... where it might just be a meeting, or something that's over a period of time. But to have a situation where we have outside entrepreneurs with business interests, possibly changing how they are regulated, and having this much power, that's not common.\"",
      "Payne also said called for transparency regarding who else would be working with Musk and Ramaswamy in the new department, saying their interests would need to be made public as well.",
      "Noah Bookbinder, the president of Citizens for Responsible Ethics in Washington, echoed some of Payne's concerns about potential conflicts of interest given Musk and Ramaswamy's business interests, while emphasizing that more details are necessary to determine whether there would be any violation of federal ethics laws.",
      "\"We don't yet know enough about how these positions will operate to know whether there will, in fact, be conflicts of interest and what those conflicts will be,\" Bookbinder said. \"If Musk and Ramaswamy are in a position where they can influence governmental decisions and if some of those decisions could impact their businesses, then there could be a danger of illegal conflicts of interest. Other laws and rules could also be at issue today depending on what they do and how this 'Department' works.\"",
      "Bookbinder also floated the possibility that others in government could feel pressed to look favorably on Musk's interests given his significant influence over Trump, which sources tell ABC News has recently seen Musk offering input on Trump's staffing decisions and playing a significant role in shaping the future Trump administration.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump's vision for education revolves around a single goal: to rid America\u2019s schools of perceived \u201c wokeness \u201d and \u201cleft-wing indoctrination.\u201d",
      "The president-elect wants to keep transgender athletes out of girls\u2019 sports. He wants to forbid classroom lessons on gender identity and structural racism. He wants to abolish diversity and inclusion offices.",
      "Throughout his campaign, the Republican depicted schools as a political battleground to be won back from the left. Now that he\u2019s won the White House, he plans to use federal money as leverage to advance his vision of education across the nation.",
      "Trump\u2019s education plan pledges to cut funding for schools that defy him on a multitude of issues.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump has repeatedly said he will cut money to \u201cany school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children.\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump said he would \u201cnot give one penny\u201d to schools with vaccine or mask requirements.",
      "He said it would be done through executive action, though even some of his supporters say he lacks the authority to make such swift and sweeping changes.",
      "Trump\u2019s opponents say his vision of America\u2019s schools is warped by politics \u2014 that the type of liberal indoctrination he rails against is a fiction. They say his proposals will undermine public education and hurt the students who need schools' services the most.",
      "\u201cIt's fear-based, non-factual information, and I would call it propaganda,\u201d said Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president for Education Trust, a research and advocacy organization. \u201cThere is no evidence that students are being taught to question their sexuality in schools. There is no evidence that our American education system is full of maniacs.\u201d",
      "Trump's platform calls for \u201cmassive funding preferences\u201d for states and schools that end teacher tenure, enact universal school choice programs and allow parents to elect school principals.",
      "Perhaps his most ambitious promise is to shut down the U.S. Education Department entirely, a goal of conservative politicians for decades, saying it has been infiltrated by \u201cradicals.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s public K-12 schools get about 14% of their revenue from the federal government, mainly from programs targeting low-income students and special education. The vast majority of schools' money comes from local taxes and state governments.",
      "Colleges rely more heavily on federal money, especially the grants and loans the government gives students to pay for tuition.",
      "Trump's strongest tool to put schools' money on the line is his authority to enforce civil rights \u2014 the Education Department has the power to cut federal funding to schools and colleges that fail to follow civil rights laws.",
      "The president can't immediately revoke money from large numbers of districts, but if he targets a few through civil rights inquiries, others are likely to fall in line, said Bob Eitel, president of the conservative Defense of Freedom Institute and an education official during Trump's first term. That authority could be used to go after schools and colleges that have diversity and inclusion offices or those accused of antisemitism, Eitel said.",
      "\u201cThis is not a Day One loss of funding,\u201d Eitel said, referencing Trump's campaign promise. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the president will get his way on this issue, because I do think that there are some real legal issues.\u201d",
      "Trump also has hinted at potential legislation to deliver some of his promises, including fining universities over diversity initiatives.",
      "To get colleges to shutter diversity programs \u2014 which Trump says amount to discrimination \u2014 he said he \u201cwill advance a measure to have them fined up to the entire amount of their endowment.\u201d",
      "His platform also calls for a new, free online university called the American Academy, to be paid for by \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump occasionally threatened to cut money from schools that defied him, including those slow to reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic and colleges he accused of curbing free speech.",
      "Most of the threats came to nothing, though he succeeded in getting Congress to add a tax on wealthy university endowments, and his Education Department made sweeping changes to rules around campus sexual assault.",
      "Universities hope their relationship with the administration won\u2019t be as antagonistic as Trump\u2019s rhetoric suggests.",
      "\u201cEducation has been an easy target during the campaign season,\u201d said Peter McDonough, general counsel for the American Council on Education, an association of university presidents. \u201cBut a partnership between higher education and the administration is going to be better for the country than an attack on education.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats of severe penalties seem to contradict another of his education pillars \u2014 the extraction of the federal government from schools. In closing the Education Department, Trump said he would return \u201call education work and needs back to the states.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to end education coming out of Washington, D.C.,\u201d Trump said on his website last year. In his platform, he pledged to ensure schools are \u201cfree from political meddling.\u201d",
      "Rather than letting states and schools decide their stance on polarizing issues, Trump is proposing blanket bans that align with his vision.",
      "Taking a neutral stance and letting states decide wouldn't deliver Trump's campaign promises, said Max Eden, a senior fellow at AEI, a conservative think tank. For example, Trump plans to rescind guidance from President Joe Biden's administration that extended Title IX protections to LGBTQ+ students. And Trump would go further, promising a nationwide ban on transgender women in women's sports.",
      "\u201cTrump ran on getting boys out of girls' sports. He didn\u2019t run on letting boys play in girls' sports in blue states if they want to,\u201d Eden said.",
      "Trump also wants a say in school curriculum, vowing to fight for \u201cpatriotic\u201d education. He promised to reinstate his 1776 Commission, which he created in 2021 to promote patriotic education. The panel created a report that called progressivism a \u201cchallenge to American principles\u201d alongside fascism.",
      "Adding to that effort, Trump is proposing a new credentialing body to certify teachers \u201cwho embrace patriotic values.\u201d",
      "Few of his biggest education goals can be accomplished quickly, and many would require new action from Congress or federal processes that usually take months.",
      "More immediately, he plans to nullify executive orders issued by Biden, including one promoting racial equity across the federal government. He's also expected to work quickly to revoke or rewrite Biden\u2019s Title IX rules, though finalizing those changes would require a lengthier rulemaking process.",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t detailed his plans for student loans, though he has called Biden\u2019s cancellation proposals illegal and unfair.",
      "Most of Biden\u2019s signature education initiatives have been paused by courts amid legal challenges, including a proposal for widespread loan cancellation and a more generous loan repayment plan. Those plans could be revoked or rewritten once Trump takes office.",

    "summary": "What we know about Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018Department Of Government Efficiency\u2019 and bromance with Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk will lead the \"Department Of Government Efficiency.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk have formed a close bond as Trump campaigned for the presidency in 2024.",
      "Musk showed continued support to Trump leading up to Election Day and, as a reward, Trump announced that Musk would lead the newly created \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" or DOGE, also the name of a cryptocurrency backed by Musk.",
      "The two powerful leaders who have redefined the spheres of politics and technology are closer than ever before. Which leaves the question: Will their bromance last?",
      "\"I don't think so,\" Adam Clark Estes, senior technology correspondent at Vox, said. \"I don't think those two personalities can stay friends for too long. Even if he'll last the next two months, I think that he'll leave a tremendous impression on the Trump administration.\"",
      "For now, Musk is becoming one of the president-elect's most trusted advisers, even appearing by his side on Capitol Hill.",
      "This summer, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX endorsed the future president after an assassination attempt on Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.",
      "Musk, who owns X and has more than 200 million followers on the social media platform, quickly became one of the most prominent and outspoken figures in the Trump campaign. He organized town halls and fielded questions from voters, not shying away from making controversial statements.",
      "\"President Trump is the only one who can save democracy,\" Musk told an Allegheny County audience on Oct. 20, 2024.",
      "Musk's unconventional entrance into Trump's inner circle included a place in the family photo on election night. One of his first ventures was co-founding PayPal during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s, which quickly propelled him to stardom in Silicon Valley.",
      "\"He used to be this true genius and visionary, this technological wunderkind who could think of something that would lead us to a brighter future and take us there,\" Estes said.",
      "In 2002, he founded a private space exploration company, SpaceX. Two years later, his next project was Tesla, a little-known startup that grew into the most valuable car company in the world over two decades.",
      "Tesla and Musk's other companies, such as internet provider Starlink and SpaceX, were transformed into innovative powerhouses thanks to contracts and subsidies from the federal government.",
      "Musk defined himself as apolitical throughout the 2000s. That started to change as Musk became increasingly critical of the government and federal regulation.",
      "\"It's become clear, especially in the past two or three years, that he's taken a sharp turn to the right,\" Estes said. \"And now he's widely viewed as Trump's biggest supporter and a main character in the MAGA sphere.\"",
      "Since then, Musk has promoted conspiracy theories, reposted antisemitic messages, and spread misinformation, such as attempting to downplay the violence that occurred on Jan. 6 at the Capitol.",
      "He invested at least $175 million into his Super PAC, called \"America PAC,\" for the Trump campaign. The billionaire's influence on the Trump agenda is already becoming evident.",
      "Musk was present for at least two phone calls that Trump had with foreign leaders, including a conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Starlink has been a critical provider of internet services in Ukraine.",
      "Musk's financial connections to Trump's campaign and presidency and his businesses' ties to the federal government redefine the relationship between money and politics.",
      "But his businesses are also facing federal investigations - like a probe of Tesla\u2019s self-driving features by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.",
      "\"He is simultaneously being targeted by the federal government and being paid billions of dollars by the federal government,\" New York Times investigative reporter Eric Lipton said. \"He's a guy who just becomes obsessed with getting things done. He wants to basically change the oversight of his company, and who best to ask to help do that than the president of the United States?\"",

      "\"This can't be real,\" a Justice Department official told ABC News.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's selection of Rep. Matt Gaetz as his future attorney general has sent many Justice Department officials into a state of shock following an already tumultuous eight days since the election.",
      "Several of the department's roughly 110,000 career workforce, who spoke to ABC News on the condition of anonymity, described an atmosphere of dread over the prospect of Gaetz potentially taking the helm of the nation's top law enforcement agency.",
      "The Florida congressman, who has been an unvarnished critic of the DOJ, was recently the subject of a criminal sex trafficking investigation by the federal department he's now been tapped to lead.",

      "Others expressed doubts Gaetz would ultimately be successful in receiving confirmation from the Senate, based on the initial wave of reaction on Capitol Hill.",
      "One official who spoke to ABC News, however, said they worried Gaetz's nomination could be part of a broader effort to eventually secure confirmation of someone else who would previously have been seen as less palatable.",
      "A major debate going on in the minds of many career officials at the moment is whether to remain in the Department of Justice for Trump's second administration.",
      "Trump has been vocal about using the agency as a tool of retribution against his enemies. Some federal prosecutors fear Trump's direction could tear down important institutional norms that have governed the DOJ's work since the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 08:24:21 -0500",
    "summary": "The ban is set to go into effect on Jan. 19, a day before Trump's inauguration.",
    "story": [
      "The ban is set to go into effect on Jan. 19, a day before Trump's inauguration.",
      "Social media platform TikTok is hurtling toward a U.S. ban that could upend its business and frustrate more than 150 million American users -- unless President-elect Donald Trump finds a way to reverse the policy.",
      "Trump, who boasts 14 million followers on TikTok, voiced opposition to the ban earlier this year. The policy, which orders TikTok to find a U.S. parent company or face a ban, is set to take effect on Jan. 19, a day before Trump\u2019s inauguration.",
      "An effort to eliminate the ban may present formidable political challenges and legal hurdles, experts told ABC News. The outcome could depend on support from an array of major institutions ranging from Congress and the Supreme Court to tech giants like Google and Oracle, they added.",
      "The China-owned app has faced growing scrutiny from government officials over fears that user data could fall into the possession of the Chinese government and the app could be weaponized by China to spread misinformation.",
      "There is little evidence that TikTok has shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government or that the Chinese government has asked the app to do so, cybersecurity experts previously told ABC News.",
      "In response to ABC News' request for comment, Trump's transition team did not directly address the TikTok ban. But the transition team said Trump plans to following through on commitments made during the presidential race.",
      "\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver,\" Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump-Vance Transition, told ABC News.",
      "TikTok did not immediately respond to ABC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "The president is expected to try to stop the ban of TikTok after he takes office, The Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with his views on the matter.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the different ways that Trump could try to stop the TikTok ban, according to experts:",
      "Push Congress to repeal the TikTok ban",
      "The most straightforward way to reverse the policy would be a repeal of the law that enacted the ban in the first place, experts told ABC News.",
      "A repeal would require passage in both houses of Congress, landing the measure on Trump\u2019s desk for his signature.",
      "\u201cThe easiest way is to ask Congress to reverse the ban,\u201d Anupam Chander, a professor of law and technology at Georgetown University, told ABC News. But, he added, it isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds.",
      "Congress voted in favor of the ban only seven months ago. In the House of Representatives, the ban passed by an overwhelming margin of 352-65. In the Senate, 79 members voted in favor of the measure, while 18 opposed and 3 abstained.",
      "A repeal effort carries political risks for Trump, since it could be perceived as conciliatory toward China, in contrast with the adversarial tone voiced by Trump on the campaign trail, James Lewis, a data security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told ABC News.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a political problem,\u201d Lewis said, noting that Trump could soften potential backlash by seeking a reform of the law rather than an outright repeal.",
      "Trump may not need Congress to repeal the ban. A lawsuit against the ban brought by TikTok on First Amendment grounds currently stands before a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.",
      "Experts who spoke to ABC News said they expect the court to rule against TikTok, but the company could then appeal, potentially sending the case to the Supreme Court before the ban takes effect. The Supreme Court may determine that the legal challenge holds sufficient merit to delay implementation of the ban, leading ultimately to a rejection of the law.",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court may want a crack at this,\u201d Alan Rozenshtein, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who focuses on the First Amendment, told ABC News.",
      "Refuse to enforce the TikTok ban",
      "Instead of repealing the law or counting on court intervention, Trump could try to prevent the Justice Department from enforcing the measure, experts said.",
      "The law orders distributors like Apple and Google to stop offering the social media platform in their app stores, and it requires cloud service providers like Oracle to withhold the infrastructure necessary for TikTok to operate.",
      "Companies that violate the law risk a penalty of $5,000 for each user who accesses TikTok. \u201cThat adds up,\u201d Rozenshtein said.",
      "In theory, Trump\u2019s Justice Department could opt against enforcement of the law, reassuring the likes of Apple and Oracle that the companies would not face prosecution in the event of a violation, experts said.",
      "Along similar lines, the Trump administration could take up an interpretation of the ban that affords it wide latitude in finding that TikTok has complied with a requirement that it divest from parent company ByteDance, experts said.",
      "In other words, even if TikTok has made little effort to comply with the law, the Trump administration could attempt a reading of the measure that finds the company has met the threshold necessary to avoid a ban, Rozenshtein said.",
      "If Trump opts against enforcement, the move could still prove insufficient. Companies like Apple and Oracle may decide to comply with the ban anyway, since they could face legal risk if the Trump administration reverses its approach, Rozenshtein added.",
      "\u201cTrump is mercurial,\u201d Rozenshtein said. \u201cIf you are Apple\u2019s general counsel, do you really want this hanging over you?\u201d",
      "Help TikTok find a U.S. buyer",
      "Finally, Trump could try to find a U.S. buyer for TikTok, allowing the platform to avoid a ban. This approach may appeal to Trump\u2019s self-image as a business dealmaker, but time is running short for such a significant business transaction and TikTok has shown little appetite for it, experts said.",
      "The law allows for a 90-day extension of the deadline for a TikTok sale, as long as the company is advancing toward an agreement. Under such a scenario, the deadline would move back to April, providing Trump with additional time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s possible that he\u2019ll try to force TikTok to come to some kind of deal with American buyers,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt\u2019s not likely. TikTok will hold out as long as they can.\u201d",
      "China has signaled opposition to the sale of TikTok to a U.S. company, The Wall Street Journal reported in March.",
      "Alternatively, Trump could seek a compromise measure in Congress that affords him additional time and wider latitude to establish a U.S.-based operation for TikTok, experts said. Or the Trump administration could offer up an interpretation of the law that gives it space to strike a compromise with TikTok.",
      "TikTok previously proposed a solution called \u201cProject Texas,\u201d in which the company would keep all data on U.S. users within the country through a partnership with Oracle. When TikTok CEO Shou Chew testified before Congress last year, several members raised concern about a potential lack of third-party oversight in such an arrangement.",
      "Trump could seek to assuage the concerns of members of Congress while reaching terms satisfactory to TikTok, Chander said.",
      "\u201cTrump may be able to do things that reassure the American people that the app is safe, and that it is bringing a lot of the programming here to U.S. soil,\u201d Chander said.",

      "The two men, seated by a roaring fire, shook hands before reporters and news cameras.",
      "President Biden spoke first, calling for a \"smooth transition\" and telling Trump he would do \"everything we can to make sure you're accommodated.\"",
      "Trump followed by thanking Biden.",
      "\"Politics is tough, and it's, in many cases, not a very nice world but it is a nice world today,\" Trump said. \"And I appreciate it very much. A transition that's so smooth, it'll be as smooth as it can get, and I very much appreciate that, Joe.\"",
      "They did not answer questions.",
      "The meeting, which the White House later described as cordial, came after an intense (and at times insult-ridden) campaign before Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "First lady Jill Biden joined President Biden in greeting Trump upon his arrival, according to the White House. She gave Trump a handwritten letter of congratulations for Melania Trump, which also expressed her team's readiness to assist with the transition.",
      "The first lady's office confirmed that a joint invitation was extended to the Trumps for Wednesday's meeting, but Melania Trump did not travel to Washington with her husband.",
      "\"Her husband's return to the Oval Office to commence the transition process is encouraging, and she wishes him great success,\" Melania Trump's office said in a statement.",
      "In 2016, Michelle Obama hosted Melania Trump at the White House when then-President Barack Obama hosted Trump in the Oval Office for 90 minutes.",
      "But after the 2020 election, Trump broke not only with inviting the president-elect to the White House but he also skipped Biden's inauguration, instead leaving Washington mere hours before the ceremony began.",
      "Wednesday marked Trump's first time back in the White House since ending his presidency under a cloud of election denialism four years ago. A week before his departure, he was impeached by the House for a second time as lawmakers charged him with \"incitement of insurrection\" after his supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Trump at the time vowed to return and his comeback was made complete last week. He swept all seven swing states, clinching 312 electoral votes to Vice President Kamala Harris' 226 votes, and is on track to win the popular vote.",
      "Biden spoke with Trump on Nov. 6 to congratulate him and to extend a political olive branch with an invitation to the White House. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that Biden did so because \"he believes in the norms\" of the institution.",
      "Vice President Harris did not attend the meeting. According to the White House, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients and incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles were present for the conversation.",
      "Jean-Pierre, at Wednesday's press briefing, described the discussion between Biden and Trump as \"very gracious and substantive.\"",
      "They discussed foreign policy, including Biden's view on standing with Ukraine in the face of Russia's aggression, national security and domestic issues, she said, and Trump came prepared with a list of questions for Biden.",
      "When asked by ABC News Chief White House Correspondent Mary Bruce if there was any indication the advice Biden gave was being well-received by Trump, Jean-Pierre said, \"I think so.\"",
      "Biden also spoke to Trump about \"important items\" for Congress to achieve in the lame-duck session. Lawmakers will have to come to an agreement on government funding, pass the annual defense bill and more before the end of the year.",
      "\"Finally, the president reiterated what he said to the president elect the day after the election and to the American people in the Rose Garden just last week: we will have an orderly transition and a peaceful transition of power,\" Jean-Pierre said.",
      "Jean-Pierre said Biden would keep the line of communication open with the president-elect.",
      "\"We got to remember, this is not about the two presidents. This is not about President Biden or President elect Trump,\" she said. \"This is about the American people and what's right for the American people.\"",
      "Trump spoke to the New York Post after the meeting, saying he spoke with Biden about Russia and the Middle East.",
      "\"I wanted -- I asked for his views and he gave them to me,\" Trump told the newspaper.",
      "Before meeting with Biden, Trump received a warm welcome back to Washington by House Republicans. Flanked by Elon Musk, a newly influential figure in his orbit, Trump spoke to the conference and thanked them for delivering a House majority.",

      "ROME -- The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights \u2014 albeit staged \u2014 for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb that aims to promote \u201ca more conscious tourism.\u201d",
      "But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students.",
      "Under the deal announced by Airbnb and the Colosseum on Wednesday, the sponsorship by the short-term rental giant will cover the renewal of an educational program inside the ancient Roman amphitheater covering the history of the structure and gladiators.",
      "Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on Nov. 27 at no cost, and the \u201cgladiators\u201d will be chosen by lottery.",
      "The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film \u201cGladiators II,\" which opened in Italy on Thursday.",
      "Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park.",
      "The Italian fashion brand Tod's, for example, has funded a multimillion renovation of the Roman monument, including a cleaning, replacing the locking system of arches with new gates and redoing the subterranean areas.",
      "Alberto Campailla, the coordinator of the Nonna Roma nonprofit organization that focuses on housing and food for the poor, called the campaign with Airbnb \u201ca disgrace,\u201d and a form of \u201ctouristification.\u201d",
      "Airbnb and other platforms offering short-term rentals \u201care literally driving people out of not only the city center, but also the outskirts and suburban neighborhoods,\u201d Campailla said.",
      "Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,\u201d said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. \u201cIn the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.\u201d",
      "Visiting from Naples, Salvatore Di Matteo saw the deal as \u201cyet another takeover of the territory\u201d by big companies.",
      "\"If they start to touch sacred monuments such as the Colosseum here in Rome, it is obviously something that should make us think and is, in any case, a bit worrying,\" he said.",
      "The Colosseum is the most important and largest amphitheater constructed by the ancient Romans. Built in the 1st century, it was the center of popular entertainment, hosting hunts and gladiator games, until the 6th century.",

      "ROME -- The city of Florence took new measures Tuesday to crack down on overtourism, just as the Italian government hosts the Group of Seven tourism ministers in the Renaissance city and seeks to significantly boost the country\u2019s place as a top visitor destination.",
      "Mayor Sara Funaro\u2019s Cabinet approved a 10-point plan that, among other things, would ban key boxes on buildings in Florence\u2019s historic center as well as the use there of loudspeakers by tour guides, a statement from City Hall said.",
      "The keyboxes \u2014 small boxes with a digital pad that are used by owners of short-term rental apartments to easily leave keys for visitors \u2014 have become something of the symbol of local Florentine anger at tourists, whose numbers have rebounded after COVID-19.",
      "In a recent protest, Florentines taped red Xs over the keyboxes, outraged at the transformation of the city center and its magnificent palazzi and narrow streets into a collection of short-term vacation rentals that have displaced local residents and the long-standing businesses that served them.",
      "According to national statistics bureau ISTAT, 2023 saw the most visitors ever in Italy with 134 million arrivals and 451 million people staying in hotels or other registered lodgings. The number of visitors opting for non-hotel lodging grew nearly 17% compared to 2022, ISTAT said in a June report.",
      "Italy ranks fourth on the U.N. World Tourism Barometer of international tourist destinations, after France, Spain and the United States. The tourism industry contributed some 10.5% of Italy\u2019s gross domestic product in 2023, according to Statista research.",
      "Florence, long run by the center-left, last year announced a ban on new short-term private rentals in the center in hopes of stemming the exodus of locals. It has repeatedly pressed for a special regulation from the national government, currently headed by right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni, to cap the number of days a property can be rented out at 120.",
      "To date, only Venice has been permitted to limit short-term rentals. The lagoon city has been drowning under overtourism for years and this year began imposing a day-tripper tax to try to regulate tourist flows.",
      "The right-left political divide over Florence and its tourism woes could come to a head precisely as Italy hosts the G7 tourism ministers starting Wednesday in Florence.",
      "At a warm-up event this weekend, Tourism Minister Daniela Santanche acknowledged some art cities were suffering from too many visitors. But she said that overall Italy is hardly taking advantage of its tourism potential and needed 50 million visitors more a year.",
      "Lamenting Italy\u2019s fourth-place position on the list of the world's top destinations, she said Italy needed to sustainably grow its tourism potential with quality offerings.",
      "\u201cWe can grow much more, we can develop much more and the industry of tourism can truly become the leading industry of our nation,\u201d she said.",

Officials with ConocoPhillips and Hess Corp., which operate the oil wells, say they are still reviewing the reports.",
      "No one was killed or injured in the two fires that both began Oct. 5, but a combined 14 square miles (36.3 square kilometers) were burned, damaging land and livestock.",
      "The fires were among several in northwestern North Dakota in October that burned up to 118,000 square miles (477.6 square km). Two people died and six were injured in other North Dakota wildfires. Agencies are still investigating what caused the other fires.",
      "Flaring is the act of burning off excess natural gas that comes up along with oil. Oil and gas companies are required to flare natural gas from oil wells that cannot be captured or moved \u2014 venting natural gas is illegal and creates more pollution than flaring it.",

      "Momeni testified Lee, 43, suddenly pulled a knife on him after he cracked a \u201cbad joke\u201d suggesting Lee should spend his last night in the city with family instead of trying to visit a strip club. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",

      "Omid Talai, the assistant district attorney, grilled Momeni on Thursday on details of exactly how the attack unfolded. He asked Momeni why he did not call police after the attack and learning Lee had died, and why he did not respond to his sister's text asking where he had dropped off Lee.",
      "Momeni said he did not learn of Lee\u2019s death until the following day and was puzzled by his sister\u2019s query. He said he thought Lee could have been stabbed by someone else shortly after he saw him walk off, unharmed.",
      "In response to questions, Momeni said he didn't know what the prosecutor was getting at, accused him of misrepresenting his statements and said he had already answered.",

      "WASHINGTON -- After a resounding election victory, delivering what President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans call a \u201cmandate\u201d to govern, an uneasy political question is emerging: Will there be any room for dissent in the U.S. Congress?",
      "Trump is laying down a gauntlet even before taking office challenging the Senate, in particular, to dare defy him over the nominations of Matt Gaetz, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other controversial choices for his Cabinet and administration positions.",
      "The promise of unified government, with the Republican Party\u2019s sweep of the White House and GOP majorities in the House and Senate, is making way for a more complicated political reality as congressional leaders confront anew what it means to line up with Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a red alert moment for American democracy,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said on CNN after Trump tapped Gaetz for attorney general.",
      "Trump is returning to the White House at the height of his political power, having won both the Electoral College and the popular vote for his party for the first time in decades. The trifecta in Washington offers a tantalizing political opportunity for Republicans, opening up a universe of political and policy priorities \u2014 from tax cuts to mass deportations to the gutting of the regulatory and federal bureaucracy, along with Trump's vows to seek vengeance and prosecution of his perceived enemies and pardon those who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "But for Congress, it\u2019s also a potentially existential moment, one that is testing whether its status as a co-equal branch of U.S. government can withstand a second Trump administration.",
      "\u201cOne of the possible futures for Congress is that it becomes a rubber stamp,\u201d said Phillip Wallach, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, who writes extensively about Congress.",
      "Wallach said the threat to Congress has been on his mind, but he also believes it would be more pronounced if Republicans had won larger majorities. The House, in fact, may end up with slimmer numbers, and the Senate's 53-seat advantage, while more than the simple majority needed to confirm nominees, can hardly be seen as mandates.",
      "Besides, \u201cthey\u2019re not wimps,\u201d he said of elected lawmakers. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason for them to just turn themselves into a doormat.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a changed Washington from Trump\u2019s first term. Congress has been purged of his strongest critics. At the same time, the Supreme Court has shifted dramatically rightward, with three Trump-appointed justices, and a majority decision over the summer that granted the president broad immunity from prosecution.",
      "Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks are posing the biggest early test for Congress.",
      "While Trump's choice of Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., for secretary of state is expected to have somewhat broad support, including from Democrats, others like Kennedy, Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and Pete Hegseth as defense secretary are raising more scrutiny.",
      "The choice of Gaetz, a fierce Trump loyalist who talks about the wholesale upheaval of the Justice Department, is all the more troubling for senators because of a House ethics probe over alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. He denies the allegations but submitted his resignation from Congress as soon as he was nominated, effectively shutting down the probe.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would consider the Gaetz nomination, called on the House to \u201cpreserve and share their report\" with the panel.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, a Republican member of the Judiciary committee, said he expects \u201cany and all\u201d information on the nominees will be made available.",
      "Other Republicans in the House and Senate stood with Gaetz, supporting his effort to take on the Justice Department over what they see as perceived bias, particularly over its prosecutions of Trump for trying to overturn the 2020 election ahead of the Capitol attack and for hoarding classified documents.",
      "\"I know the Democrats are clutching their pearls right now, and they\u2019re very, very upset about everything,\" said Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., on Fox News.",
      "\u201cBut if you think about how they have weaponized the DOJ, this is a situation that needs serious reform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s President Trump\u2019s prerogative to choose who he wants to nominate.\u201d",
      "Incoming Senate GOP Leader John Thune said confirming Trump's nominations will be a priority next year and senators \u201cshould expect an aggressive schedule until his nominees are confirmed.\u201d",
      "Complicating the matter for senators is the Trump campaign's decision to not engage, so far, in the traditional transition process, having declined to sign agreements with the federal government that would launch FBI background checks of nominees, among other standard steps before confirmation hearings.",
      "Senators may be forced to consider nominees that have not been vetted in the traditional ways.",
      "Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., a former member of the House Intelligence Committee, worried Americans may be left in the dark about their top officials. \u201cPeople have a right to know who\u2019s leading critical aspects of their government,\u201d he said.",
      "Intensifying his demands on the Senate, Trump suggested it should consider so-called recess appointments of his nominees \u2014 a highly unorthodox request that essentially asks the Senate to drop its constitutional advise-and-consent role and allow his nominees to be installed without a vote.",
      "Wallach said if senators chose that route it would be \u201can act of extreme institutional self-sabotage.\u201d",
      "Congress has been here before, in the first Trump administration, when the White House tested the limits of its executive power.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump's vision for education revolves around a single goal: to rid America\u2019s schools of perceived \u201c wokeness \u201d and \u201cleft-wing indoctrination.\u201d",
      "The president-elect wants to keep transgender athletes out of girls\u2019 sports. He wants to forbid classroom lessons on gender identity and structural racism. He wants to abolish diversity and inclusion offices.",
      "Throughout his campaign, the Republican depicted schools as a political battleground to be won back from the left. Now that he\u2019s won the White House, he plans to use federal money as leverage to advance his vision of education across the nation.",
      "Trump\u2019s education plan pledges to cut funding for schools that defy him on a multitude of issues.",
      "On his first day in office, Trump has repeatedly said he will cut money to \u201cany school pushing critical race theory, transgender insanity, and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content on our children.\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump said he would \u201cnot give one penny\u201d to schools with vaccine or mask requirements.",
      "He said it would be done through executive action, though even some of his supporters say he lacks the authority to make such swift and sweeping changes.",
      "Trump\u2019s opponents say his vision of America\u2019s schools is warped by politics \u2014 that the type of liberal indoctrination he rails against is a fiction. They say his proposals will undermine public education and hurt the students who need schools' services the most.",
      "\u201cIt's fear-based, non-factual information, and I would call it propaganda,\u201d said Wil Del Pilar, senior vice president for Education Trust, a research and advocacy organization. \u201cThere is no evidence that students are being taught to question their sexuality in schools. There is no evidence that our American education system is full of maniacs.\u201d",
      "Trump's platform calls for \u201cmassive funding preferences\u201d for states and schools that end teacher tenure, enact universal school choice programs and allow parents to elect school principals.",
      "Perhaps his most ambitious promise is to shut down the U.S. Education Department entirely, a goal of conservative politicians for decades, saying it has been infiltrated by \u201cradicals.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s public K-12 schools get about 14% of their revenue from the federal government, mainly from programs targeting low-income students and special education. The vast majority of schools' money comes from local taxes and state governments.",
      "Colleges rely more heavily on federal money, especially the grants and loans the government gives students to pay for tuition.",
      "Trump's strongest tool to put schools' money on the line is his authority to enforce civil rights \u2014 the Education Department has the power to cut federal funding to schools and colleges that fail to follow civil rights laws.",
      "The president can't immediately revoke money from large numbers of districts, but if he targets a few through civil rights inquiries, others are likely to fall in line, said Bob Eitel, president of the conservative Defense of Freedom Institute and an education official during Trump's first term. That authority could be used to go after schools and colleges that have diversity and inclusion offices or those accused of antisemitism, Eitel said.",
      "\u201cThis is not a Day One loss of funding,\u201d Eitel said, referencing Trump's campaign promise. \u201cBut at the end of the day, the president will get his way on this issue, because I do think that there are some real legal issues.\u201d",
      "Trump also has hinted at potential legislation to deliver some of his promises, including fining universities over diversity initiatives.",
      "To get colleges to shutter diversity programs \u2014 which Trump says amount to discrimination \u2014 he said he \u201cwill advance a measure to have them fined up to the entire amount of their endowment.\u201d",
      "His platform also calls for a new, free online university called the American Academy, to be paid for by \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump occasionally threatened to cut money from schools that defied him, including those slow to reopen during the COVID-19 pandemic and colleges he accused of curbing free speech.",
      "Most of the threats came to nothing, though he succeeded in getting Congress to add a tax on wealthy university endowments, and his Education Department made sweeping changes to rules around campus sexual assault.",
      "Universities hope their relationship with the administration won\u2019t be as antagonistic as Trump\u2019s rhetoric suggests.",
      "\u201cEducation has been an easy target during the campaign season,\u201d said Peter McDonough, general counsel for the American Council on Education, an association of university presidents. \u201cBut a partnership between higher education and the administration is going to be better for the country than an attack on education.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s threats of severe penalties seem to contradict another of his education pillars \u2014 the extraction of the federal government from schools. In closing the Education Department, Trump said he would return \u201call education work and needs back to the states.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to end education coming out of Washington, D.C.,\u201d Trump said on his website last year. In his platform, he pledged to ensure schools are \u201cfree from political meddling.\u201d",
      "Rather than letting states and schools decide their stance on polarizing issues, Trump is proposing blanket bans that align with his vision.",
      "Taking a neutral stance and letting states decide wouldn't deliver Trump's campaign promises, said Max Eden, a senior fellow at AEI, a conservative think tank. For example, Trump plans to rescind guidance from President Joe Biden's administration that extended Title IX protections to LGBTQ+ students. And Trump would go further, promising a nationwide ban on transgender women in women's sports.",
      "\u201cTrump ran on getting boys out of girls' sports. He didn\u2019t run on letting boys play in girls' sports in blue states if they want to,\u201d Eden said.",
      "Trump also wants a say in school curriculum, vowing to fight for \u201cpatriotic\u201d education. He promised to reinstate his 1776 Commission, which he created in 2021 to promote patriotic education. The panel created a report that called progressivism a \u201cchallenge to American principles\u201d alongside fascism.",

      "Few of his biggest education goals can be accomplished quickly, and many would require new action from Congress or federal processes that usually take months.",
      "More immediately, he plans to nullify executive orders issued by Biden, including one promoting racial equity across the federal government. He's also expected to work quickly to revoke or rewrite Biden\u2019s Title IX rules, though finalizing those changes would require a lengthier rulemaking process.",

      "Most of Biden\u2019s signature education initiatives have been paused by courts amid legal challenges, including a proposal for widespread loan cancellation and a more generous loan repayment plan. Those plans could be revoked or rewritten once Trump takes office.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Lawyers for the state of Louisiana asked a federal appeals court Wednesday to immediately block a judge's ruling ordering education officials to tell all local districts that a law requiring schools to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms is unconstitutional.",
      "U.S. District Judge John deGravelles in Baton Rouge declared the law \u201cunconstitutional on its face\u201d in a lengthy decision Tuesday and ordered education officials to notify the state\u2019s 72 local school boards of that fact.",

      "The Republican president-elect's victory and the GOP takeover of the Senate leaves just seven weeks of Democratic control of the chamber.",
      "Democrats have confirmed 213 of Biden\u2019s judicial nominees during his presidency. Another few dozen are still pending. To add to those confirmations, Senate Democrats would need to stay in Washington far longer than they had planned and also navigate a razor-thin margin that hamstrung them at times on other Biden priorities.",
      "Trump focused heavily on filling court vacancies in his first term, getting 234 judges confirmed, including three to the Supreme Court. Democrats are seeking to deny him more opportunities to name conservative judges as the party determines its path forward after a sweeping defeat that will leave it out of power come January.",
      "\u201cSenate Democrats cannot give up and go home just because they lost the chamber,\u201d said Skye Perryman, a senior adviser to Demand Justice, whose push will include widespread lobbying, Capitol Hill events and targeted ads. \u201cIt is even more critical now that good, qualified, fair-minded judges are confirmed so they can serve as a backstop and uphold the rights of ordinary people and protect our Constitution.\u201d",
      "According to the United States Courts website, 17 pending judicial nominees have advanced out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, eight are waiting for votes from the committee and six are waiting for committee hearings. The White House announced new judicial nominees in October and November.",
      "The Senate returned this week from their break around the election. The Senate calendar has the legislative body being out of town around the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. But the calendar is subject to change, and it is common for senators to leave Washington for extended weekend breaks.",
      "The push will confront an already full schedule in the Senate, too. In addition to confirmations, the legislative body will be tasked with providing more disaster aid after a string of deadly storms, passing the annual defense policy bill, and keeping the government funded and open.",
      "Some Democratic-caucusing senators like West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin and Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema, both independents, are leaving the chamber at the end of this session. And if Republicans are unified to oppose Biden's picks, Manchin has said he will not support judicial appointments that are not bipartisan, shrinking the Democratic margin.",
      "One nominee, April Perry, was confirmed on Monday evening for the northern district of Illinois.",
      "Asked about the effort to pressure Senate Democrats to do all they can to confirm these nominees, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, \u201cWe are going to get as many done as we can.\u201d",
      "Trump on Sunday urged Republicans to oppose Schumer\u2019s efforts. \u201cNo Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cDelaying the confirmation of strongly qualified, experienced judges takes a real-life toll on constituents and leads to backlogs of criminal cases \u2014 meaning there is every urgent reason for Republicans and Democrats to continue working together in good faith to staff the federal bench,\u201d White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in response to Trump. \u201cThere is no excuse for choosing partisanship over enforcing the rule of law.\u201d",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he hoped Republicans would not seek to delay confirmation votes for judges, noting that Democrats agreed to a package of 12 judicial confirmations at the end of the first Trump presidency.",
      "\u201cI hope they follow the precedent,\u201d Durbin said.",
      "He added that he hopes to get about two dozen judicial nominees confirmed during the lame-duck session.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just about all we can do,\u201d he added.",
      "Perryman from Demand Justice echoed that sentiment. \u201cThere is no excuse not to put these qualified individuals on the floor for a vote. Americans all across the country are working overtime to make ends meet, and the Senate should work overtime too: Americans deserve better from their elected officials than excuses or delays,\" Perryman added.",
      "According to operatives working with Demand Justice, the group\u2019s plan includes a widespread lobbying effort aimed at key senators, press events urging action and a new website that gives constituents a chance to see where the effort stands.",
      "\u201cWith only weeks left before the new Congress, it\u2019s more urgent than ever that Democratic senators do whatever it takes \u2014 staying late, working weekends \u2014 during the lame duck session,\u201d said Maggie Jo Buchanan, a top operative at the progressive organization.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Just hours after Republican Sen. John Thune was elected as the incoming Senate majority leader on Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump presented him with one of his first tests \u2014 an announcement that he intends to nominate controversial Rep. Matt Gaetz as attorney general.",
      "The Florida Republican is one of the more universally disliked members of Congress, including among GOP lawmakers after he led the effort to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last year. He has spent his congressional career agitating against the Justice Department and has been under a House Ethics investigation probing whether he engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct. Gaetz denies the allegations.",
      "Asked about the nomination as he left a Senate vote, Thune smiled and declined to answer. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a good question for the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,\u201d he said.",
      "An hour earlier, the likely incoming chairman of the Judiciary panel, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, also deflected, saying he doesn\u2019t know Gaetz but will look at the nomination. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me any other questions,\u201d Grassley said.",
      "It\u2019s a familiar posture for Republican senators who have lived through the last eight years dodging questions about Trump and defending him, even after he tried to overturn his election defeat in 2020 and his supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol. But the stakes are even higher now that he has been decisively elected to a second term. Congressional Republicans have rallied intensely around him, betting their political futures on his success.",
      "Two months before Trump even takes office, he is already challenging those congressional Republicans to defy him as he nominates potentially controversial figures to his Cabinet \u2014 including Gaetz, former Democratic House Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and conservative media personality Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense. On Sunday, Trump even said in a post on X that he wants the new Senate leader to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing confirmation votes altogether.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a little bit of a test,\u201d said Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who called the Gaetz nomination a \u201cHail Mary\u201d pass from Trump. Cramer said he sees Gaetz as a disruptive force in the House and has concerns about the \u201cserious allegations\u201d against him, but stopped short of saying he wouldn\u2019t vote for his confirmation.",
      "\u201cIt will take a lot of political capital to get him across,\u201d Cramer said, adding that \u201cthere will forever be tension between the branches.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s unclear is how much political capital Trump will have to expend to get his picks through \u2014 or whether it will even be necessary. Republicans will have a 53-seat majority in the Senate next year, giving them room to lose a few votes.",
      "Immediately after his election as the incoming GOP leader, Thune suggested that the Senate will not fully relinquish its power to vet nominations \u2014 but kept the door open to Trump\u2019s suggested changes.",
      "\u201cThe Senate has an advise and consent rule in the Constitution,\u201d Thune said, adding that Senate Republicans will do everything they can to get Trump\u2019s nominees quickly in place.",
      "\u201cHow that happens remains to be seen,\u201d Thune said.",
      "While Trump\u2019s announcement about Gaetz sent an immediate shock wave around Capitol Hill, many Republican senators who will be tasked with confirming him were reluctant to publicly criticize the pick.",
      "Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the Judiciary panel, said he didn\u2019t know Gaetz \u201cother than his public persona,\" and said he won\u2019t \u201cprejudge any of these\u201d nominations.",
      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, elected Wednesday as the incoming No. 2 Republican in the Senate next year, would only say that Trump \u201cis going to continue to make his appointments. We\u2019re going to continue to look forward to them coming to the Senate and have hearings and get his Cabinet confirmed as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing for you,\u201d said Sen. Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d said Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin when asked whether he would support Gaetz\u2019s confirmation.",
      "A few GOP senators praised Gaetz, who resigned from the House shortly after the announcement, ending the House Ethics investigation and making way for a replacement to be elected before the new Congress is sworn in Jan. 3.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known Matt for a very long time, we\u2019re friends,\u201d said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who was nominated for secretary of state Wednesday, but was instead flooded with questions about Gaetz. \u201cI think he would do a very good job for the president.\u201d",
      "Gaetz is \u201ca smart, clever guy,\u201d said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, though he said \u201che\u2019ll have to answer some tough questions in the hearing, and we\u2019ll see how he does.\u201d",
      "Other Republican senators, like Cramer, were skeptical while stopping short of saying they would oppose his nomination.",
      "Gaetz \u201cwill have his work cut out for him,\u201d said North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, adding that it should \u201cmake for a popcorn-eating confirmation hearing.\u201d",
      "Maine Sen. Susan Collins said she was \u201cshocked\u201d by Gaetz\u2019s nomination.",
      "\u201cI recognize that the president-elect has the right to nominate whomever he wishes, but we in Congress have a responsibility under the Constitution and our advise and consent, which will lead to hearings, an FBI background check and an awful lot of questions being asked in this case,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Gaetz has vehemently denied any wrongdoing, and said last year that the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into sex trafficking allegations involving underage girls had ended with no federal charges against him.",
      "Democrats were appalled.",
      "\u201cThis nomination is the first test of whether Republicans are willing to stand up to Donald Trump and go with conscience and conviction as opposed to just politics,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democratic member of the Judiciary panel.",
      "New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., was even more blunt.",

      "Two attorneys representing Rudy Giuliani in a lawsuit related to a $148 million defamation judgment against him have asked a judge to remove them from the case over disagreements with the former New York City mayor",
      "NEW YORK -- Two lawyers say they can no longer represent Rudy Giuliani in a legal fight over property he's been ordered to give up to satisfy part of a $148 million defamation judgment against him. They asked a judge to remove them from the case, citing disagreements with the former New York City mayor.",
      "The request in federal court comes a week after a judge ordered Giuliani to turn over by Friday a Mercedes that once belonged to actress Lauren Bacall, an heirloom watch and other prized assets to two former Georgia election workers who sued him over his remarks about them as he fought to overturn President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss.",
      "The women were awarded the judgment last year. Giuliani then filed for bankruptcy, but a judge cut that short after finding that the ex-mayor had flouted the process. Lawyers for the election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, say Giuliani has avoided turning over his assets.",
      "In a filing late Wednesday, attorney Kenneth Caruso sought permission for himself and co-counsel David Labkowski to stop representing Giuliani.",
      "Caruso wrote that lawyers may withdraw from representing clients when there is a \u201cfundamental disagreement,\u201d or when a client insists on presenting a claim that is not warranted under the law and cannot be supported by a good-faith argument, or when the client fails to cooperate.",
      "Several paragraphs of the publicly posted filing are blacked out. The redacted version does not provide details on possible issues.",

He told reporters outside court last week he was the victim of a \u201cpolitical vendetta.\u201d On Election Day, Giuliani was seen riding near a polling place in Palm Beach, Florida, in a Mercedes that appeared to be the car he was supposed to turn over.",

      "Long before the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was building up a following with his anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, and becoming one of the world\u2019s most influential spreaders of fear and distrust around vaccines.",
      "Now, President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate Kennedy to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which regulates vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism. He has also pushed other conspiracy theories, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "No medical intervention is risk-free. But doctors and researchers have proven that risks from disease are generally far greater than the risks from vaccines.",
      "Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that he is not anti-vaccine, saying he only wants vaccines to be rigorously tested, but he also has shown opposition to a wide range of immunizations. Kennedy said in a 2023 podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told Fox News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism. In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccines.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, better not get them vaccinated,\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "That same year, in a video promoting an anti-vaccine sticker campaign by his nonprofit, Kennedy appeared onscreen next to one sticker that declared \u201cIF YOU\u2019RE NOT AN ANTI-VAXXER YOU AREN\u2019T PAYING ATTENTION.\u201d",
      "The World Health Organization has estimated that global immunization efforts have saved at least 154 million lives in the past 50 years.",
      "In a study of verified Twitter accounts from 2021, researchers found Kennedy\u2019s personal Twitter account was the top \u201csuperspreader\u201d of vaccine misinformation on Twitter, responsible for 13% of all reshares of misinformation, more than three times the second most-retweeted account.",
      "He has traveled to states including Connecticut, California and New York to lobby or sue over vaccine policies and has traveled the world to meet with anti-vaccine activists.",
      "Kennedy has also aligned himself with businesses and special interests groups such as anti-vaccine chiropractors, who saw profit in slicing off a small portion of the larger health care market while spreading false or dubious health information.",
      "An Associated Press investigation found one chiropractic group in California had donated $500,000 to Kennedy\u2019s Children\u2019s Health Defense, about one-sixth of the group\u2019s fundraising that year. Another AP investigation found he was listed as an affiliate for an anti-vaccine video series, where he was ranked among the Top 10 for the series\u2019 \u201cOverall Sales Leaderboard.\u201d",
      "His group has co-published a number of anti-vaccine books that have been debunked. One, called \u201cCause Unknown,\u201d is built on the false premise that sudden deaths of young, healthy people are spiking due to mass administration of COVID-19 vaccines. Experts say these rare medical emergencies are not new and have not become more prevalent.",
      "An AP review of the book found dozens of individuals included in it died of known causes not related to vaccines, including suicide, choking while intoxicated, overdose and allergic reaction. One person died in 2019.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit."

      "Republicans have won enough seats to control the U.S. House, completing the party\u2019s sweep into power and securing their hold on U.S. government alongside President-elect Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans have won enough seats to control the U.S. House, completing the party\u2019s sweep into power and securing their hold on U.S. government alongside President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "A House Republican victory in Arizona, alongside a win in slow-counting California earlier Wednesday, gave the GOP the 218 House victories that make up the majority. Republicans earlier gained control of the Senate from Democrats.",
      "With hard-fought yet thin majorities, Republican leaders are envisioning a mandate to upend the federal government and swiftly implement Trump\u2019s vision for the country.",
      "The incoming president has promised to carry out the country\u2019s largest-ever deportation operation, extend tax breaks, punish his political enemies, seize control of the federal government\u2019s most powerful tools and reshape the U.S. economy. The GOP election victories ensure that Congress will be onboard for that agenda, and Democrats will be almost powerless to check it.",
      "When Trump was elected president in 2016, Republicans also swept Congress, but he still encountered Republican leaders resistant to his policy ideas, as well as a Supreme Court that was ideologically divided. Not this time.",
      "When he returns to the White House, Trump will be working with a Republican Party that has been completely transformed by his \u201cMake America Great Again\" movement and a Supreme Court dominated by conservative justices, including three that he appointed.",
      "Trump rallied House Republicans at a Capitol Hill hotel Wednesday morning, marking his first return to Washington since the election.",
      "\u201cI suspect I won\u2019t be running again unless you say, \u2018He\u2019s good, we got to figure something else,\u2019\u201d Trump said to the room full of lawmakers who laughed in response.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who with Trump's endorsement won the Republican Conference's nomination to stay on as speaker next year, has talked of taking a \u201cblowtorch\u201d to the federal government and its programs, eyeing ways to overhaul even popular programs championed by Democrats in recent years. The Louisiana Republican, an ardent conservative, has pulled the House Republican Conference closer to Trump during the campaign season as they prepare an \u201cambitious\u201d 100-day agenda.",
      "\u201cRepublicans in the House and Senate have a mandate,\u201d Johnson said earlier this week. \u201cThe American people want us to implement and deliver that \u2018America First\u2019 agenda.\u201d",
      "Trump's allies in the House are already signaling they will seek retribution for the legal troubles Trump faced while out of office. The incoming president on Wednesday said he would nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz, a fierce loyalist, for attorney general.",
      "Meanwhile, Rep. Jim Jordan, the chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, has said GOP lawmakers are \u201cnot taking anything off the table\u201d in their plans to investigate special counsel Jack Smith, even as Smith is winding down two federal investigations into Trump for plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Still, with a few races still uncalled the Republicans may hold the majority by just a few seats as the new Congress begins. Trump's decision to pull from the House for posts in his administration \u2014 Reps. Gaetz, Mike Waltz and Elise Stefanik so far \u2014 could complicate Johnson's ability to maintain a majority in the early days of the new Congress.",
      "Gaetz submitted his resignation Wednesday, effective immediately. Johnson said he hoped the seat could be filled by the time the new Congress convenes Jan. 3. Replacements for members of the House require special elections, and the congressional districts held by the three departing members have been held by Republicans for years.",
      "With the thin majority, a highly functioning House is also far from guaranteed. The past two years of Republican House control were defined by infighting as hardline conservative factions sought to gain influence and power by openly defying their party leadership. While Johnson \u2014 at times with Trump's help \u2014 largely tamed open rebellions against his leadership, the right wing of the party is ascendant and ambitious on the heels of Trump's election victory.",
      "The Republican majority also depends on a small group of lawmakers who won tough elections by running as moderates. It remains to be seen whether they will stay onboard for some of the most extreme proposals championed by Trump and his allies.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, meanwhile, is trying to keep Democrats relevant to any legislation that passes Congress, an effort that will depend on Democratic leaders unifying over 200 members, even as the party undergoes a postmortem of its election losses.",
      "In the Senate, GOP leaders, fresh off winning a convincing majority, are already working with Trump to confirm his Cabinet picks. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota won an internal election Wednesday to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest serving party leader in Senate history.",
      "Thune in the past has been critical of Trump, but praised the incoming president during his leadership election bid.",
      "\u201cThis Republican team is united. We are on one team,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe are excited to reclaim the majority and to get to work with our colleagues in the House to enact President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "The GOP\u2019s Senate majority of 53 seats also ensures that Republicans will have breathing room when it comes to confirming Cabinet posts, or Supreme Court justices if there is a vacancy. Not all those confirmations are guaranteed. Republicans were incredulous Wednesday when the news hit Capitol Hill that Trump would nominate Gaetz as his attorney general. Even close Trump allies in the Senate distanced themselves from supporting Gaetz, who had been facing a House Ethics Committee investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.",
      "Still, Trump on Sunday demanded that any Republican leader must allow him to make administration appointments without a vote while the Senate is in recess. Such a move would be a notable shift in power away from the Senate, yet all the leadership contenders quickly agreed to the idea. Democrats could potentially fight such a maneuver.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's social media supporters, including Elon Musk, the world's richest man, clamored against picking a traditional Republican to lead the Senate chamber. Thune worked as a top lieutenant to McConnell, who once called the former president a \u201cdespicable human being\u201d in his private notes.",
      "However, McConnell made it clear that on Capitol Hill the days of Republican resistance to Trump are over.",

      "In text and social media messages, members threatened rivals and talked up violent plans, according to the indictment. One defendant told an ally to hang out with one of their rivals, smoke pot with him and bring him downstairs, adding, \u201cHe gonna get it bad.

    "story": [
      "The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources has issued the first round of permits allowing Enbridge to reroute an aging pipeline around a tribal reservation",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Enbridge's contentious plan to reroute an aging pipeline around a northern Wisconsin tribal reservation moved closer to reality Thursday after the company won its first permits from state regulators.",
      "Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources officials announced they have issued construction permits for the Line 5 reroute around the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa's reservation. The energy company still needs discharge permits from the DNR as well as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.",
      "The project has generated fierce opposition. The tribe wants the pipeline off its land, but tribal members and environmentalists maintain rerouting construction will damage the region's watershed and perpetuate the use of fossil fuels.",
      "The DNR issued the construction permits with more than 200 conditions attached. The company must complete the project by Nov. 14, 2027, hire DNR-approved environmental monitors and allow DNR employees to access the site during reasonable hours.",
      "The company also must notify the agency within 24 hours of any permit violations or hazardous material spills affecting wetlands or waterways; can\u2019t discharge any drilling mud into wetlands, waterways or sensitive areas; keep spill response equipment at workspace entry and exit points; and monitor for the introduction and spread in invasive plant species.",
      "Enbridge officials issued a statement praising the approval, calling it a \u201cmajor step\u201d toward construction that will keep reliable energy flowing to Wisconsin and the Great Lakes region.",
      "Bad River tribal officials warned in their own statement Thursday that the project calls for blasting, drilling and digging trenches that would devastate area wetlands and streams and endanger the tribe's wild rice beds. The tribe noted that investigations identified water quality violations and three aquifer breaches related to the Line 3 pipeline\u2019s construction in northern Minnesota.",
      "\u201cI'm angry that the DNR has signed off on a half-baked plan that spells disaster for our homeland and our way of life,\u201d Bad River Chairman Robert Blanchard said in the statement. \u201cWe will continue sounding the alarm to prevent yet another Enbridge pipeline from endangering our watershed.\u201d",
      "Line 5 transports up to 23 million gallons (about 87 million liters) of oil and natural gas daily from Superior, Wisconsin, through Michigan to Sarnia, Ontario. About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of the pipeline run across the Bad River reservation.",
      "The tribe sued Enbridge in 2019 to force the company to remove the pipeline from the reservation, arguing the 71-year-old line is prone to a catastrophic spill and land easements allowing Enbridge to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.",
      "Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation's southern border.",
      "The company has only about two years to complete the project. U.S. District Judge William Conley last year ordered Enbridge to shut down the portion of pipeline crossing the reservation within three years and pay the tribe more than $5 million for trespassing. An Enbridge appeal is pending in a federal appellate court in Chicago.",
      "Michigan\u2019s Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel, filed a lawsuit in 2019 seeking to shut down twin portions of Line 5 that run beneath the Straits of Mackinac, the narrow waterways that connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Nessel argued that anchor strikes could rupture the line, resulting in a devastating spill. That lawsuit is still pending in a federal appellate court.",
      "Michigan regulators in December approved the company\u2019s $500 million plan to encase the portion of the pipeline beneath the straits in a tunnel to mitigate risk. The plan is awaiting approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."

      "The owners of the Cup Foods convenience store and other businesses operating near 38th Street and Chicago Avenue argue that the city's failure to address deterioration and crime in the neighborhood has ruined their businesses and constitutes an unlawful taking of their property without just compensation, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported Thursday. They're seeking $30 million in damages.",

      "Burgum, 67, grew up in tiny Arthur, North Dakota, population 328. He earned a bachelor's degree from North Dakota State University and his master\u2019s of business administration from the Stanford University Graduate School of Business.",
      "He went on to become a wealthy software executive. He led Great Plains Software, which Microsoft acquired for $1.1 billion in 2001. Burgum stayed on as a vice president until 2007. He's also led other companies in real estate development and venture capital.",
      "In 2016, Burgum ran for governor, his first campaign for elected office. He touted a message of \u201creinventing\u201d government as the state dealt with a massive revenue shortfall.",
      "In a major upset, Burgum defeated North Dakota's longtime attorney general in the Republican gubernatorial primary. He handily won his first term in the strong Republican state, which has about 784,000 residents.",

      "Burgum has taken a business-oriented bent as governor of North Dakota, where agriculture and oil are the main industries.

Burgum also emphasized a \u201cdata-driven\u201d approach to governing, advocated for a Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in the state and prioritized engagement with tribal nations.",
      "Burgum and his wife, Kathryn, have been public about her recovery from addiction, and as governor he has prioritized resources for addiction treatment.",

      "He has largely resisted wading into social issues, such as anti-LGBTQ measures pushed by members of his own party, vetoing a few such bills in 2021 and 2023. But also in 2023, as he was planning a run for president, he signed a pile of bills opponents said targeted transgender people. They included a ban on gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender kids, sports bans for transgender athletes, and transgender restrictions in schools.",

      "He appeared in two Republican debates \u2014 including the first, which he attended after hurting his Achilles tendon playing basketball. He drew attention for his campaign offering $20 gift cards to people who would donate $1 to his campaign so he would have enough individual donors to make the debate stage.",
      "In January, before the Iowa caucuses, he endorsed Trump. The same month, he declined to seek a third term as governor.",
      "When he entered office in December 2016, he dealt with the final months of the sometimes-chaotic protests of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. He's led the state through terrible droughts and crippling storms.",
      "He was the face of North Dakota's response to the coronavirus pandemic, holding dozens of press conferences, many of them daily in early 2020, including an emotional plea about face masks. He and his wife publicly received their COVID vaccinations in 2021.",

      "Louisiana House lawmakers have postponed a vote on a key plank in Gov. Jeff Landry's tax reform package",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana lawmakers on Thursday postponed a vote on a key bill in Gov. Jeff Landry's sweeping and complex tax reform package.",
      "Most of Landry's proposed bills, granting approximately $2 billion in income and corporate tax cuts, have moved smoothly through the House of Representatives during the state's third special legislative session of the year. But lawmakers have raised more resistance to a sales tax on dozens of services such as lawnmowing, getting tattoos and using coin-operated laundry machines.",
      "Tabling the bill, which would have raised an estimated $500 million to plug the revenue hole created by the tax cuts, raises questions about whether Landry and his allies have rounded up enough support. The GOP-dominated House requires 70 of its 105 members to vote in support of the bill.",
      "\u201cI think the bill is on life support if it isn\u2019t dead already,\u201d said Republican Rep. Joe Stagni.",
      "Exiting the House chamber on Thursday evening, Landry denied there were not enough votes to pass the bill.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t ever go in the kitchen halfway through the meal being cooked, judge it once it\u2019s cooked,\" Landry said.",
      "Rep. Julie Emerson, who is responsible for several of the tax reform bills, said some of her colleagues were opposed outright to the entire bill increasing taxes on services, while others had issues with specific services being taxed.",
      "In committee hearings, lobbyists have argued the proposed services to be taxed, including for property repairs and maintenance, would raise costs for small businesses and elevate insurance rates.",
      "But House lawmakers voted 71-23 to make a temporary 0.40% sales tax increase permanent. Lawmakers shaved off 0.05% to bring the state\u2019s proposed overall sales tax rate down to 4.40%. They also planned to repeal dozens of tax breaks, but would keep household groceries from being taxed.",
      "That sales tax expansion would raise around $820 million in annual revenue.",
      "\u201cWith a sales tax, a person has a choice,\" said Republican Rep. Mark Wright, who sponsored the increased sales tax bill. \u201cWith an income tax, there is no choice.\u201d",
      "Some fiscal conservatives have indicated opposition to levying new sales taxes on services, with a small group of Republicans voting against making the sales tax increase permanent.",
      "A group of Democratic lawmakers have also argued that the sales tax expansion will weigh more heavily on lower-income households.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s tax system is one of the most regressive in the nation, with lower-income families paying a higher percentage of their earnings toward income and sales taxes than wealthier households, according to research from the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. A study funded by a coalition of non-partisan economic policy groups found the proposed reforms would make the existing system modestly more progressive, but did not factor in potential increases in local sales taxes.",
      "Landry has said the tax reform is modeled after policies adopted by states like North Carolina and Texas, which he says are out-competing Louisiana economically. He has said passing the tax reform package will make the state more attractive for job-generating businesses, and his allies point out that the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, currently ranks Louisiana as 40th in terms of tax competitiveness.",
      "Some lawmakers have questioned whether the proposed taxes on numerous services can be effectively enforced.",
      "Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier, representing several southwest Louisiana parishes, said in a committee hearing on Nov. 13 that he did not believe his constituents would fully comply with the new sales taxes.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t count on my district to do it, them boys they take cash, they\u2019ll trade it for a fifth ... of vodka or food stamps,\u201d he said.",
      "On Wednesday, the House passed a bill to reduce corporate income tax from a 7.5% to 3.5% flat rate and another to add new taxes on digital goods and services like online streaming sites, expected to bring in around $40 million a year. They have also passed bills to eliminate the 0.275% corporate franchise tax \u2014 worth more than $500 million in annual revenue \u2014 and to flatten the individual income tax to 3%, costing the state approximately $1.3 billion in revenue.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump has had few defenders in Congress as reliable as Matt Gaetz",

      "Donald Trump has had few defenders in Congress as reliable as Matt Gaetz",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has had few defenders in Congress as reliable as Matt Gaetz, who has thundered at one prosecutor after another for perceived bias against the president-elect and emphatically amplified the Republican's rallying cry that the criminal investigations into him are \u201cwitch hunts.\u201d",
      "That kinship was rewarded Wednesday when Trump named Gaetz as his pick for attorney general, turning to a conservative loyalist in place of more established lawyers who'd been seen as contenders.",
      "In announcing his selection of Gaetz as attorney general and John Ratcliffe a day earlier as CIA director, Trump underscored the premium he places on loyalty, citing both men's support for him during the Russia investigation as central to their qualifications and signaling his expectation that leaders in his administration should function not only as a president's protector but also as an instrument of retribution.",
      "The dynamic matters at a time when Trump, who will enter office in the wake of two federal indictments expected to soon evaporate and a Supreme Court opinion blessing a president's exclusive authority over the Justice Department, has threatened to pursue retaliation against perceived adversaries.",
      "\u201cMatt will root out the systemic corruption at DOJ, and return the department to its true mission of fighting Crime, and upholding our Democracy and Constitution. We must have Honesty, Integrity, and Transparency at DOJ,\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post about Gaetz, a Florida Republican.",
      "The rhetoric from Trump reflects an about-face in approach from President Joe Biden, who has repeatedly taken a hands-off approach from the Justice Department even while facing a special counsel investigation into his handling of classified information and as his son, Hunter, was indicted on tax and gun charges.",
      "Democrats immediately sounded the alarm, with Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying Gaetz \u201cwould be a disaster\u201d in part because of Trump's threat to use the Justice Department \u201cto seek revenge on his political enemies.\u201d The president of Common Cause, a good government group, called the selection \u201cshocking\" and \u201ca serious threat to the fair and equal enforcement of the law in our nation.\u201d Even several Senate Republicans expressed concern about the Gaetz pick.",
      "That Trump would openly value Gaetz's role in \u201cdefeating the Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax, and exposing alarming and systemic Government Corruption and Weaponization\u201d is not altogether surprising. In his first term, Trump fired an FBI director who refused to pledge loyalty to him at a private White House dinner and an attorney general who recused himself from the Justice Department's investigation into potential ties between Russia and his 2016 presidential campaign.",
      "\u201cI think this selection indicates that President-elect Trump was looking for an attorney general whose views were closely aligned with him with respect to the appropriate role of the Department of Justice,\u201d said former federal prosecutor Robert Mintz.",
      "Ratcliffe, who served as Trump's director of national intelligence in the final months of his first term, rose to prominence on Capitol Hill as a staunch defender of Trump. He was a member of Trump's advisory team during his first impeachment in 2019 and pointedly grilled multiple witnesses about the Russia investigation \u2014 including an FBI agent who led the inquiry and also traded anti-Trump text messages with a colleague.",
      "That work was credited by Trump in his selection announcement as he praised Ratcliffe for \u201cexposing fake Russian collusion\u201d and having \u201cbeen a warrior for Truth and Honesty with the American Public.\u201d",
      "Gaetz would be the first attorney general in 20 years without prior Justice Department experience, and in recent years became embroiled himself in a federal sex trafficking investigation that ended without criminal charges.",
      "Hours before the announcement, Gaetz said in a social media post that there needs to be a \u201cfull court press against this WEAPONIZED government that has been turned against our people.\u201d He added: \u201cAnd if that means ABOLISHING every one of the three letter agencies, from the FBI to the ATF, I\u2019m ready to get going!\u201d If confirmed as attorney general, he would oversee both the FBI and the ATF.",
      "Advancing the theme of vengeance, billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk weighed in on the Gaetz appointment with a post that said: \u201cThe Hammer of Justice is coming.\u201d",
      "Gaetz has used the seat in Congress he first won in 2016 to rail against the Justice Department, repeatedly decrying what he \u2014 and Trump \u2014 contends is a criminal justice system biased against conservatives. He has blasted law enforcement officials he has perceived as being either overtly anti-Trump or ineffective in protecting Trump's interests.",
      "When Robert Mueller visited Capitol Hill to discuss the findings of the Russia investigation, Gaetz condemned the prosecutor for leading a team that the congressman said was \u201cso biased.\u201d The Trump Justice Department appointed a special prosecutor, John Durham, to examine errors in the Russia investigation, but Gaetz scolded Durham too for failing to uncover enough damaging information about the FBI's inquiry into Trump.",
      "\u201cFor the people like the (committee) chairman who put trust in you, I think you let them down. I think you let the country down. You are one of the barriers to the true accountability that we need,\u201d Gaetz told Durham.",
      "He's directed outright fury at FBI Director Christopher Wray, snapping at him last year that FBI applicants in Florida \u201cdeserve better than you\u201d and at the current attorney general, Merrick Garland, who appointed special counsel Jack Smith to investigate Trump's hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Both investigations ended in indictments expected to wind down before Trump takes office. Smith, too, is also likely to be gone by the time Gaetz arrives, and a new FBI director is also expected to be appointed  given Trump's lingering discontent with Wray, his own appointee.",
      "\u201cNone of us can predict exactly what will happen there,\u201d said Ryan Fayhee, a former Justice Department national security prosecutor.",
      "He added: \u201cI think it's just more of a question of the department continuing to be independent and largely resting on the broad shoulders of the career prosecutors and agents that have held themselves to the highest standards.\u201d"

    "summary": "Makers of a new generation of European electric aircraft are struggling to raise money.",
    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",

      "A bid by the department for rural affairs to soften changes to inheritance tax for farms - possibly by exempting some older farmers - has been rejected by the Treasury.",
      "The Treasury said there would be no change or mitigations to the policy, which will see an end to inheritance tax exemption for some farms.",
      "From April 2026, farms worth more than \u00a31m will face an effective inheritance tax rate of 20% - half the usual rate of 40%.",
      "BBC Newsnight understands that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which represents the interests of farmers in government, believes it was not properly consulted over the change.",

      "Defra suggested softening the policy to exempt some older people, possibly those over the age of 80.",
      "The April 2026 start for the policy means they may not have time to make use of existing rules to skip inheritance tax by passing on an asset seven years before death.",
      "But this suggestion has been dismissed by the Treasury, which said it had taken \"a fair and balanced approach\".",
      "Since its introduction in 1984, agricultural property relief (APR) has allowed small family farms \u2013 including land used for crops or rearing animals, as well as farm buildings, cottages and houses - to be exempt from inheritance tax.",
      "The Treasury said 40% of APR had been going to \"the 7% wealthiest claimants\", and that it had \"made a difficult decision to ensure the relief is fiscally sustainable\".",
      "It put this against a backdrop of \u201cpublic services crumbling [and] a \u00a322bn fiscal hole inherited from the previous government\".",
      "\u201cAround 500 claims each year will be impacted and farm-owning couples can pass on up to \u00a33m without paying any inheritance tax - this is a fair and balanced approach,\" a spokesperson added.",
      "There are divisions in government over the change.",
      "Some ministers believe it will only have an impact on relatively wealthy farmers - a couple using all their inheritance tax benefits will be able to pass on a \u00a33m farm tax free. Any inheritance tax charge on farms can be paid over 10 years.",
      "But other ministers believe the chancellor is in danger of undermining Labour\u2019s relations with rural Britain while raising a relatively small amount of money.",
      "The change could raise around \u00a3560m.",

      "There is also a dispute around the figures used to calculate the changes.",
      "Farmers' leaders have been told by Defra that the figures come from the Treasury and not their department.",
      "Tom Bradshaw, the president of the NFU, said that Defra figures showed the changes would have an impact on 66% of estates.",
      "The Treasury said the figure was 28%.",

      "He added there were ways the change could \"be managed\" and called on Conservatives to \"join me in reassuring British farmers about their future\".",

    "story": [
      "People who were mis-sold finance agreements when buying cars could face a delay to potential compensation payouts.",
      "A decision by judges at the Court of Appeal has blown open an ongoing saga into hidden commission payments, with buyers possibly in line for payouts totalling billions of pounds.",
      "Now the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is consulting on giving dealers extra time to deal with complaints.",
      "However, lawyers say this could further delay compensation which should be paid to car buyers who may not have given their informed consent for the commission payments.",
      "Who may be in line for payouts?",
      "The vast majority of new cars, and many second-hand ones, are bought with finance agreements.",
      "About two million are sold this way each year, with customers paying an initial deposit, then a monthly fee with interest for the vehicle.",
      "In a complicated, and long-running, series of developments, many of these agreements have come under scrutiny.",
      "In 2021, the FCA banned deals in which the dealer received a commission from the lender, based on the interest rate charged to the customer. It said this provided an incentive for a buyer to be charged a higher than necessary interest rate.",
      "Since January, it has been considering whether compensation should be paid to people with these deals before 2021.",
      "That has created the prospect of banks and other lenders having to make payouts totalling millions of pounds.",
      "Last month, a decision at the Court of Appeal broadened the net of those who could receive compensation, potentially increasing the lenders' final bill to billions of pounds.",
      "Why was the judges' decision so important?",
      "While the initial investigations surrounded discretionary commission arrangements, which were banned in 2021, the Court of Appeal decision widened the scope to any car finance commissions.",
      "The three judges unanimously agreed that it would be illegal for the lender to pay any commission to the dealer without the informed consent of the buyer.",
      "In other words, customers should be clearly told how much commission would be paid, and agree to it, without those details being buried in the terms and conditions of the loan.",

      "He was not informed the car dealership was being paid 25% commission, which was added on to what he had to pay back.",
      "\"I signed a few documents and then drove away in the car,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He said he had no option but to use finance when he bought the car, describing it as \"heartbreaking\" to find out so much extra money had been taken.",
      "\"Someone in my situation at that time, not being able to buy that kind of age car with cash, you would use finance,\" he said.",
      "Following the judges decision in his - and two other car buyers' - favour, banks have set aside millions of pounds for potential compensation. Other lenders have temporarily paused any new deals.",
      "It's thought the cost of compensation could reach \u00a316bn, according to analysts.",
      "How has the regulator responded?",
      "The FCA said that the decision could lead to dealers receiving a deluge of new complaints.",
      "Some could come from people previously told they had no claim for compensation because they did not have a discretionary commission arrangement.",
      "The regulator is consulting on extending the time car dealers will have to respond to complaints.",
      "It also wants the Supreme Court to make a quick decision on whether it will reconsider the Court of Appeal's ruling.",
      "It wants an orderly compensation system, if it comes to that.",
      "The Finance and Leasing Association, the trade body for motor finance providers, described the FCA's plan as a \"sensible move\".",

      "Mr Williamson faced prosecution for paying \u00a31.90 less than he should have done despite admitting his error and offering to pay a fine or a new fare, prompting widespread criticism of Northern.",

      "Northern responded by withdrawing all live prosecutions against those pursued in similar circumstances and promised to review historical cases.",
      "The terms and conditions of Mr Williamson's railcard specified the discount was only valid for on-peak services where the original fare was \u00a312 or more. However, despite the small-print, he was able to buy a ticket that informed him he could travel at \"anytime\".",
      "Stephanie Tobyn, ORR director of strategy, policy and reform, welcomed the review.",
      "\"It is important passengers are treated fairly and dealt with consistently and proportionately when ticketing issues arise, whilst also balancing the legitimate revenue protection interests of operators and taxpayers,\" she added.",

      "The Hague court of appeal said it could not establish that Shell had a \"social standard of care\" to reduce its emissions by 45% or any other amount, even though it agreed the company had an obligation to citizens to limit emissions.",
      "Three years ago, a court in The Hague backed a case by Friends of the Earth and 17,000 Dutch citizens requiring Shell to reduce its CO2 emissions significantly, in line with the Paris climate accords.",
      "The ruling came as climate talks involving some 200 countries got under way in Azerbaijan.",
      "Shell said it was pleased with the court's decision, but Friends of the Earth Netherlands said the ruling was a setback that affected them deeply.",
      "The environmental group can now take its case against Shell to the Supreme Court - but a final verdict could be years away.",
      "Donald Pols from the group said \"it's a marathon, not a sprint and the race isn't yet over\".",
      "At the time, the 2021 ruling marked the first time a court had ordered a private company to align its workings with the Paris climate agreement, meaning that it was not sufficient for a company simply to comply with the law - it had to comply with global climate policy too.",
      "Under the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate change, nearly 200 nations agreed to keep global temperatures \"well below\" 2C above pre-industrial levels.",
      "The appeals court judge said that companies such as Shell were obliged to contribute to combating climate change based on the human right to protection against dangerous climate change.",
      "However, the court said Shell was already working to reduce its emissions and the court could not establish whether it should make a 45% cut or another percentage, as there was no current accepted agreement in climate science on the required amount.",
      "Shell has argued that it is already taking \"serious steps to reduce emissions\". It complained the original ruling was unfair as it singled out one company for a global issue, and said it was unrealistic to try to hold Shell accountable for its customers' choices.",
      "Shell said if people considered progress was too slow towards cutting emissions then they should lobby governments rather than Shell to change policies and bring about a green transition.",
      "The oil firm says its aim is to reduce the carbon intensity of products it sells by 15-20% by 2030 from a 2016 baseline. Shell also aims to become a \"net zero\" emissions company by 2050.",
      "Part of the historic legal case hinged on the interpretation of an \"unwritten duty of care\" that exists under Dutch law, which requires companies to prevent hazardous negligence.",
      "Friends of the Earth Netherlands argued that there was an international consensus that human rights offered protection against dangerous climate change and that companies had to respect human rights.",
      "Shell's successful appeal could have far-reaching implications for corporate climate responsibility.",
      "A number of environmental groups around the world are now trying to force companies and governments to comply with the accords through the courts.",

    "summary": "Campaigners want to stop the Rosebank oil and Jackdaw gas fields, but oil companies say they are vital.",
    "story": [
      "A legal challenge over the decision to give consent to the UK\u2019s largest untapped oil field is taking place in Edinburgh.",
      "A judicial review brought jointly by the environment groups Greenpeace and Uplift is being heard at the Court of Session.",
      "The campaigners want to stop the development of Rosebank oil field, which is off Shetland, and the Jackdaw gas field, off Aberdeen. But oil companies say the projects are vital.",
      "If the challenge is successful, operators would have to resubmit environmental impact assessments for approval before drilling can begin.",
      "Campaigners calling for the projects to be halted held a protest outside the court on Tuesday morning.",
      "What is the judicial review about?",
      "Consent for drilling in the Rosebank field was granted by the regulator, the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA), in September last year.",
      "Shell\u2019s proposals to develop the Jackdaw field were approved by the NSTA in 2022, after initially being rejected on environmental grounds.",
      "The environment groups say that when consent was granted for the fields, the impact of emissions caused by burning extracted oil and gas was \u201cunlawfully ignored\u201d by regulators.",
      "Uplift accused regulators of \"failing to be transparent\" in granting the consents and said Rosebank would damage marine life in the North Sea.",
      "The UK government said in August that it would not fight any cases over Rosebank and Jackdaw.",
      "It effectively accepted the original decisions were unlawful.",
      "This came after the Supreme Court ruled in June that regulators must consider the total environmental impact of new projects - including the way fossil fuels are used by end consumers.",
      "It is understood that the oil companies will accept that the decisions to give the go-ahead for Rosebank and Jackdaw were unlawful because the emissions they would create were not properly assessed.",
      "They are expected to focus instead on how to move forward with the projects, given that work is already under way.",
      "What do the campaigners say?",
      "Ruth Crawford KC, who is acting for Greenpeace during the case, told the court that the greenhouse gas emissions from Rosebank and Jackdaw would be \u201csizeable and significant\u201d and would have a \u201csubstantial impact\u201d on the environment and human health.",
      "She said the UK government had admitted that it was an \u201cerror of law\u201d to have failed to have taken into account greenhouse gas emissions from the eventual burning of oil and gas extracted from Rosebank and Jackdaw (known as Scope 3 emissions).",
      "Ms Crawford said granting a licence was ultimately a political decision but it must be done only after a lawful consenting process which included an environmental impact assessment taking into account Scope 3 emissions.",
      "She said politicians must not simply consider short-term issues when considering oil and gas projects but also the long-term effect on the climate.",
      "In this case, she argued, they failed to do so (because information about Scope 3 emissions was not available).",
      "To allow these two fields to proceed without a new environmental impact assessment taking into account Scope 3 emissions \u201cwould be to completely ignore that a crucial part of the decision making has not happened and will never happen.\u201d",
      "Greenpeace, she said, was not asking for oil rigs and drilling equipment to be removed. It was only asking that the oil and gas companies involved \u201cdo no further work to get petroleum from the fields.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe work must stop. No more. No less,\u201d she concluded.",
      "Alastair Duncan KC, for Uplift, echoed or endorsed many of the submissions made on behalf of Greenpeace.",
      "He also addressed written submissions made on behalf of oil and gas companies, whose lawyers are expected to address the court later this week.",
      "These, he said, amounted to the companies arguing that they were \u201can innocent third party\u201d who had reasonably relied on what appeared to be a \u201cstable legal landscape\u201d when making multi-million pound investment decisions.",
      "On the contrary, argued Mr Duncan, the legal landscape had been far from stable and Rosebank\u2019s developers Equinor and Ithaca were now \u201cthe beneficiaries of an unlawful decision,\u201d who wanted the court \u201cto allow them to continue to be the beneficiaries of an unlawful decision.\u201d",
      "Mr Duncan went on to outline another objection to the granting of consent for Rosebank.",
      "He argued that, in approving the field, the Oil and Gas Authority (now known as the North Sea Transition Authority) had unlawfully and irrationally failed to give reasons for its decision.",
      "Uplift has a third objection to the decision, claiming that the previous government and the regulator failed to adequately assess the marine impacts of Rosebank.",
      "What do the oil companies say?",
      "Norwegian energy giant Equinor and British firm Ithaca Energy jointly own the Rosebank field.",
      "They have said it would create about 1,600 jobs during its construction and support about 450 UK-based jobs during its lifetime.",
      "Equinor declined to comment while the court challenge was ongoing, but said it was continuing to \"work closely with all relevant parties to progress the project\".",
      "It added: \"It is vital for the UK and will bring benefits in terms of local investment, jobs and energy security.\"",
      "A Shell spokesman said the Jackdaw development had been developed in line with all relevant consents and permits.",
      "He added: \"Jackdaw is a vital project for UK energy security and the project is already well advanced.",
      "\"Stopping the work is a highly complex process, with significant technical and operational issues now that infrastructure is in place and drilling has started in the North Sea.",
      "\"Jackdaw will provide enough fuel to heat 1.4m UK homes as older gas fields reach the end of production.\"",
      "The UK government has previously pledged that oil and gas would play an important role in the economy \"for decades to come\" as the UK transitions to clean energy.",
      "The Scottish government has previously said it had a \"presumption against\" new oil and gas exploration.",
      "However, First Minister John Swinney said in June that it would still be needed \"for a period of time\" to help the country meet its net-zero targets by 2045.",

    "story": [
      "Uranium is making a comeback thanks to a renewed focus on nuclear energy as a climate crisis solution. Canada, rich with high-grade deposits, could become a nuclear \u201csuperpower\u201d. But can its potential be realised?",
      "Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.",
      "In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal - a critical component for nuclear fuel - cratered.",
      "But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200%, becoming one of this year's top-performing commodities.",
      "Mr Curyer, an Australian-born businessman, credits this to a changing attitude that began soon after Microsoft founder Bill Gates touted nuclear energy as \u201cideal for dealing with climate change\u201d in 2018.",
      "Four years later, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed forward a policy of generating at least 25% of the country\u2019s energy from nuclear.",
      "Shortly after, the European Union voted to declare nuclear energy climate-friendly.",
      "These events were \u201ccatalytic\u201d for the uranium industry and a turning point for Mr Curyer's company NexGen, which is behind the largest in-development uranium mine in Canada.",
      "His phone began to ring with calls from investors worldwide - something that \u201chad never happened in my previous 17 years in the industry\u201d, he said.",
      "NexGen, whose project is located in Canada's remote, uranium-rich Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, is now worth nearly $4bn (\u00a32.98bn), despite the fact that the mine won\u2019t be commercially operational until at least 2028.",
      "If fully cleared by regulators, NexGen\u2019s project alone could push Canada to become the world\u2019s largest producer of uranium over the coming decade, knocking Kazakhstan out of the number one spot.",
      "Other companies have also rushed to Saskatchewan to capitalise on the boom, starting their own exploration projects in the region, while existing players re-opened dormant mines.",
      "With its rich resources, Canada\u2019s mining companies see the country playing a major role in the future of nuclear energy, meeting a demand for uranium that is poised to rise after nearly two dozen countries committed in COP28 climate conference to tripling their nuclear energy output by 2050.",
      "Nuclear energy is often hailed for its low carbon emissions compared to other sources like natural gas or coal.",
      "The World Nuclear Association estimates that 10% of power generated worldwide comes from nuclear sources, while more than 50% is still generated by gas or coal.",
      "At this year's COP29, the focus has been on ramping up funding for nuclear projects in the wake of a recent UN report indicating that current policies and investments fall short of what is needed to slow global temperature rise.",
      "Canada\u2019s role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.",
      "Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to America\u2019s nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",
      "Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.",
      "But what makes Canada\u2019s Athabasca Region unique is that its uranium is especially high grade, said Markus Piro, a professor of nuclear engineering at McMaster University.",
      "Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.",
      "The country is also referred to as a \u201ctier-one nuclear nation\u201d, he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.",
      "Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake. It can then be enriched, if needed, at facilities overseas to create fuel for nuclear reactors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a one-stop shop here in Canada, not every nation\u2019s like that,\u201d Prof Piro said.",
      "Canada is currently the world\u2019s second largest producer of uranium, accounting for roughly 13% of the total global output, according to the Canadian government. NexGen anticipates that once its mine is operational, it will boost that to 25%.",
      "Meanwhile, Cameco, which has been mining uranium in Saskatchewan since 1988 that supplies 30 nuclear reactors around the world, re-opened two of its mines in late 2022 to increase output.",
      "CEO Tim Gitzel told the BBC that he believes \u201cCanada could be a nuclear superpower around the world\u201d.",
      "But enthusiasm around nuclear energy is not without its critics.",
      "Some environmental groups worry nuclear projects are too costly and come with timelines that do not meet the urgency of the climate crisis.",
      "Data from the UK-based World Nuclear Association shows that 65 nuclear reactors are under construction across 16 countries, most of them in China, and a further 90 are in the planning stages.",
      "Some are expected to come online this year - others won\u2019t be ready until at least the end of the decade.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 100 nuclear plants have been closed in the last two decades around the world, including the sole nuclear power plant near New York City, which was retired in 2021 due to high operating costs and environmental and safety concerns.",
      "Plants were also shuttered in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Quebec, Canada.",
      "And not all of Canada is on board with the country\u2019s uranium industry.",
      "British Columbia sits on its own supply of uranium but has not allowed any nuclear plants or uranium mines to operate in the province since 1980.",
      "Critics have also expressed concern about radioactive waste nuclear reactors leave behind for future generations.",
      "Others fear another Fukushima-scale disaster, where a tsunami disabled three reactors, causing the release of highly radioactive materials and forcing mass evacuations.",
      "\u201cThe risk is not zero, that is for sure\u201d though it can be reduced, said Prof Piro.",
      "\u201cEven though amongst the general public there are mixed feelings about it, the reality is that it has produced very safe, very reliable and affordable electricity worldwide.\u201d",
      "The industry maintains the technology is both promising and viable.",
      "Mr Gitzel of Cameco said the industry has learned from past safety errors.",
      "\u201cAnd the public is buying on,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that we have in Canada great public support for nuclear power.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Ipsos poll indicates that 55% of Canadians support nuclear energy.",
      "Still, past uranium booms in Canada have turned into dramatic busts.",
      "North of NexGen\u2019s proposed mine stands Uranium City, once home to 2,500 residents in its mid-20th Century heyday. In 1982, a major local mining firm shuttered operations over high costs and a soft market for uranium.",
      "Now, Uranium City\u2019s population is 91 people.",
      "But investors argue that there is a true global burgeoning demand for the commodity that poses a golden opportunity for Canada.",
      "NexGen anticipates that construction on its mine - which is awaiting clearance from Canada\u2019s federal nuclear regulator - will begin early next year.",
      "Mr Gitzel says around 100 other companies are now actively exploring Saskatchewan for deposits.",
      "As to when it will be on the market remains unclear.",
      "Mr Gitzel cautioned that some companies have started explorations in the past that never reached production stage. The timeline to get mining projects approved in Canada can also be lengthy.",

      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",

      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",

      "Beheadings, mass killings, child abuse, hate speech \u2013 all of it ends up in the inboxes of a global army of content moderators.",
      "You don\u2019t often see or hear from them \u2013 but these are the people whose job it is to review and then, when necessary, delete content that either gets reported by other users, or is automatically flagged by tech tools.",
      "The issue of online safety has become increasingly prominent, with tech firms under more pressure to swiftly remove harmful material.",
      "And despite a lot of research and investment pouring into tech solutions to help, ultimately for now, it\u2019s still largely human moderators who have the final say.",
      "Moderators are often employed by third-party companies, but they work on content posted directly on to the big social networks including Instagram, TikTok and Facebook.",
      "The Moderators: Listen to the full story on BBC Sounds",
      "They are based around the world. The people I spoke to while making our series The Moderators for Radio 4 and BBC Sounds, were largely living in East Africa, and all had since left the industry.",
      "Their stories were harrowing. Some of what we recorded was too brutal to broadcast. Sometimes my producer Tom Woolfenden and I would finish a recording and just sit in silence.",
      "\u201cIf you take your phone and then go to TikTok, you will see a lot of activities, dancing, you know, happy things,\u201d says Mojez, a former Nairobi-based moderator who worked on TikTok content. \u201cBut in the background, I personally was moderating, in the hundreds, horrific and traumatising videos.",
      "\u201cI took it upon myself. Let my mental health take the punch so that general users can continue going about their activities on the platform.\u201d",
      "There are currently multiple ongoing legal claims that the work has destroyed the mental health of such moderators. Some of the former workers in East Africa have come together to form a union.",
      "\u201cReally, the only thing that\u2019s between me logging onto a social media platform and watching a beheading, is somebody sitting in an office somewhere, and watching that content for me, and reviewing it so I don\u2019t have to,\u201d says Martha Dark who runs Foxglove, a campaign group supporting the legal action.",
      "In 2020, Meta then known as Facebook, agreed to pay a settlement of $52m (\u00a340m) to moderators who had developed mental health issues because of their jobs.",
      "The legal action was initiated by a former moderator in the US called Selena Scola. She described moderators as the \u201ckeepers of souls\u201d, because of the amount of footage they see containing the final moments of people\u2019s lives.",
      "The ex-moderators I spoke to all used the word \u201ctrauma\u201d in describing the impact the work had on them. Some had difficulty sleeping and eating.",
      "One described how hearing a baby cry had made a colleague panic. Another said he found it difficult to interact with his wife and children because of the child abuse he had witnessed.",

      "I was expecting them to say that this work was so emotionally and mentally gruelling, that no human should have to do it \u2013 I thought they would fully support the entire industry becoming automated, with AI tools evolving to scale up to the job.",
      "But they didn\u2019t.",
      "What came across, very powerfully, was the immense pride the moderators had in the roles they had played in protecting the world from online harm.",
      "They saw themselves as a vital emergency service. One says he wanted a uniform and a badge, comparing himself to a paramedic or firefighter.",
      "\u201cNot even one second was wasted,\u201d says someone who we called David. He asked to remain anonymous, but he had worked on material that was used to train the viral AI chatbot ChatGPT, so that it was programmed not to regurgitate horrific material.",
      "\u201cI am proud of the individuals who trained this model to be what it is today.\u201d",
      "But the very tool David had helped to train, might one day compete with him.",
      "Dave Willner is former head of trust and safety at OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. He says his team built a rudimentary moderation tool, based on the chatbot\u2019s tech, which managed to identify harmful content with an accuracy rate of around 90%.",
      "\u201cWhen I sort of fully realised, \u2018oh, this is gonna work\u2019, I honestly choked up a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201c[AI tools] don't get bored. And they don't get tired and they don't get shocked\u2026. they are indefatigable.\u201d",
      "Not everyone, however, is confident that AI is a silver bullet for the troubled moderation sector.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s problematic,\u201d says Dr Paul Reilly, senior lecturer in media and democracy at the University of Glasgow. \u201cClearly AI can be a quite blunt, binary way of moderating content.",
      "\u201cIt can lead to over-blocking freedom of speech issues, and of course it may miss nuance human moderators would be able to identify. Human moderation is essential to platforms,\u201d he adds.",
      "\u201cThe problem is there\u2019s not enough of them, and the job is incredibly harmful to those who do it.\u201d",
      "We also approached the tech companies mentioned in the series.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson says the firm knows content moderation is not an easy task, and it strives to promote a caring working environment for employees. This includes offering clinical support, and creating programs that support moderators' wellbeing.",
      "They add that videos are initially reviewed by automated tech, which they say removes a large volume of harmful content.",
      "Meanwhile, Open AI - the company behind Chat GPT - says it's grateful for the important and sometimes challenging work that human workers do to train the AI to spot such photos and videos. A spokesperson adds that, with its partners, Open AI enforces policies to protect the wellbeing of these teams.",
      "And Meta - which owns Instagram and Facebook - says it requires all companies it works with to provide 24-hour on-site support with trained professionals. It adds that moderators are able to customise their reviewing tools to blur graphic content.",

      "Influencers excitedly wonder what eyeliner, serum or hand cream will be behind door one, and gush over the beautiful box it has come in.",
      "But are these products, which can cost hundreds of pounds, actually worth the money?",
      "Yes, says TikToker Cissy Jones from Manchester.",
      "We\u2019re just over a week into November and the 27-year-old, who is a social media manager at fashion brand PrettyLittleThing but also makes TikToks on her personal account, has already posted a dozen advent calendar videos. Everything from chocolate, to beauty products and wine, and even a Pets At Home calendar for her dog.",
      "\"There\u2019s one - the Harrods 12-day one \u2013 where every product in it is something that I would buy,\" she says. \"So I\u2019m saving money.\"",
      "That idea of saving money is something that brands latch on to with their marketing. A calendar may cost \u00a3250 but it\u2019s actually \"worth \u00a31,000\", they say, if you add up all the individual items.",
      "\"But you do have to want the actual products,\" says Cissy. \"Otherwise, it\u2019s a bit of a waste of money.\"",
      "Retailers can afford to make such seemingly good offers because there\u2019s a lot of margin built into beauty products, analysts say.",
      "And rather than aiming to make a big profit on them, they view advent calendars as a marketing tool to get you to buy more products afterwards.",
      "\"A lot of retailers recognise advent calendars are a great way of getting new products to the consumer and a way to get them to convert,\" says Natalie Berg from NBK Retail.",
      "However, Sarah Johnson from Flourish Retail says that while there are many lovely bespoke calendars out there, \"a lot [of companies] just use advent calendars to shift stock that may not be popular, rather than having to discount it\".",
      "Shoppers warned over luxury advent calendar scams",
      "The size of the items in advent calendars can vary \u2013 with some offering full-sized bottles, some smaller versions, and some a mix of the two.",
      "But smaller sizes may be what people want, says Ms Berg, as it's common to want to try something out before fully committing.",
      "Holly May Arnott agrees. \"They\u2019re a fantastic way to try new and trending products that I might have seen previously on social media,\" she says.",
      "The 26-year-old has been buying beauty calendars for several years now. It's something she and her mum do together.",
      "\"It\u2019s like prolonging that Christmas morning thrill,\" she says, adding a sense of excitement throughout December.",
      "The most expensive one she's bought was from Selfridges, which was \"such a luxury\".",
      "But she says while beauty calendars \"can feel like a bit of an investment, they\u2019re worth it for us\".",
      "With so many products out there, Cissy Jones\u2019s advice is to look for a brand you like and to look for value for money, in terms of the total cost of all the items individually versus the price of the calendar.",
      "However, even if a product may seem like good value for money, for some, spending more than \u00a3200 on an advent calendar is simply a luxury they cannot afford.",
      "As a result, many scam websites have sprung up, trying to take advantage of people looking for a good deal on an expensive item.",
      "Emma Jones and Nihal, who did not want us to use her last name, got in touch with the BBC after falling for fake adverts claiming to sell the Space NK \u00a3250 advent calendar for \u00a328.99. Both women were attracted by the apparent discount, and say they would not pay full price.",
      "\"I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable spending that amount of money, mainly because I wouldn\u2019t have that amount of spare cash,\" says Emma.",
      "\"They can be very expensive \u2013 I\u2019m not the type that would pay full price,\" Nihal says.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. If you\u2019re going to use every single product then maybe yes. But sometimes in these prepacked stuff, you\u2019ll probably only use two or three of these products.\"",
      "But part of the reason beauty advent calendars are so popular is because shoppers still want to treat themselves, says Natalie Berg.",
      "And many are willing to pay full price \u2013 and beyond.",
      "The likes of Space NK, Harrods and Sephora have all sold out of their main calendars already.",
      "The Harrods beauty calendar was priced at \u00a3250 but claimed to include items worth \u00a31,600, while Sephora\u2019s \u00a3199 calendar said it included items worth \u00a31,000.",
      "But you can find people selling them on eBay, asking for as much as \u00a3550 for the Harrods one and \u00a3399 for the Sephora one.",
      "\"It goes back to supply and demand - dynamic pricing,\" says Sarah Johnson.",
      "It might make sense to buy it even at an overinflated price, she says, if the retailer is sold out and you can\u2019t get it anywhere else, especially if you perceive it as still making a saving on the total value of all the items.",
      "This begs the question though of why firms don't just make more.",
      "Ms Johnson points out that it's a seasonal product and they don't want to over-order and be left with surplus stock that they would then have to discount.",
      "Space NK told the BBC that it produced 30% more stock this year than last year but due to \"unprecedented\" demand still sold out within two and a half weeks. It plans to increase production next year.",
      "Despite the expensive nature of beauty calendars, Ms Johnson says there is a \"value perception\" there.",
      "\"People could buy it to break it out and give [individual items] as gifts. There\u2019s an element of people treating themselves and also being quite savvy and saving themselves money in the long run.\"",
      "With more and more of these calendars on sale now, there was a thought a few years ago that we might have reached \"peak\" advent calendar.",
      "But Cissy Jones disagrees \u2013 and thinks the opposite is the case.",
      "\"They always sell out every year, so I feel like there\u2019s room for more.\""

    "summary": "More than three quarters of universities are expected to face financial problems next year.",
    "story": [
      "Almost three quarters of universities in England will face financial problems next year - despite tuition fees increasing, the BBC has been told.",
      "A report published on Friday reveals how financial issues faced by most universities are even worse than previously thought. The Office for Students (OfS) predicts more than a third are likely to have serious cash flow problems.",
      "Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Sir David Behan, the regulator\u2019s chairman, called for radical change, saying course closures and university mergers might be needed for financial stability.",
      "The government is considering the long-term funding and reform of universities.",
      "Tuition fees in England will rise for current and existing students by \u00a3285 to \u00a39,535 a year for those on full-time degrees, in autumn 2025.",
      "Even so, new analysis by the OfS, the independent regulator of higher education in England, shows a worsening position for universities.",
      "The regulator had said it expected 40% of universities to be in financial deficit in 2023-24.",
      "Now the OfS says by 2025-26, 72% could be spending more money than they have coming in and may have to use an overdraft or financial reserves, with a total \u00a31.6bn deficit forecast across the sector.",
      "In 40% of institutions, cash flow may become so tight there will only be enough money in the bank to cover one month at a time of bills including salaries.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the OfS findings show \"why universities must do more to make their finances work\".",
      "Radically reimagined",
      "Sir David Behan, the OfS chairman, says a university going bust \u201cisn\u2019t imminent now\u201d, but to reduce the risk higher education needs to be \u201cradically reimagined\u201d.",
      "He suggests universities should think about \u201ca transformation of their offer\u201d, looking closely at the length and range of courses, and how to increase degree apprenticeships where tuition fees are covered mainly through the levy on larger employers.",
      "Apprentices are paid to work while they study, so students end up with less debt.",
      "Sir David says universities also need to collaborate more, and should consider mergers or whether courses at nearby institutions are too similar - saying it \"doesn't make sense\" for those universities to compete with one another.",
      "But, he says, as some universities reduce the number of courses on offer he doesn\u2019t want to see \u201ccold spots\u201d where students in more rural locations don\u2019t have a choice of courses at their nearest university.",
      "Why tuition fees are set to rise - and what this means for students",
      "'My 12 hours of uni each week are incredible value'",
      "Why are university tuition fees going up?",
      "The outlook has worsened for universities because they have recruited fewer UK and international students than predicted.",
      "For home students, the OfS says, Ucas figures suggest numbers have increased by around 1.3% this year, compared with the optimistic 5.8% universities had predicted.",
      "Universities that traditionally required higher entry grades have fared better, because they have simply taken a bigger share by accepting some students with lower results.",
      "This has led to lower recruitment and increased pressure in universities that accept middling grades, and some smaller institutions.",
      "International recruitment has also fallen, with overall visa applications down by about 16% this year, and 20% fewer applications from India alone.",
      "Since January, most international students have been banned from bringing family members to live with them in the UK.",
      "The rule was introduced last year by Rishi Sunak's government, which committed to bringing immigration numbers down.",
      "Difficult decisions",
      "All of this comes as the government considers what to do about university funding in England from 2026, in a review likely to conclude next year.",
      "The OfS report acknowledges that the scale of change needed will not be easy.",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents 140 institutions, says universities are already \"making tough choices to control costs\", adding that the sector \"needs to continue evolving\".",
      "She says the size of the challenge \"is a source of serious concern\".",
      "The University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich has cut \u00a330m in the last 18 months - almost 10% of its annual spending.",
      "Prof David Maguire, the vice chancellor, says \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d have led to a 20% reduction in the number of courses, increased lecture group sizes, less one-to-one contact between academics and students, and fewer staff in student support including in mental health and counselling.",
      "Unlike big city universities, there are no nearby institutions to collaborate with, so remaining financially sustainable is crucial, especially for the many local students who live at home.",
      "Prof Maguire says universities need to know what tuition fees or direct funding they will get through to the next election.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want boom and bust, where one year we\u2019re up, the next year we\u2019re down,\" he says.",
      "\"That doesn\u2019t help anybody.\u201d",
      "The increase in National Insurance contributions the university has to pay as an employer will more than wipe out the increase in tuition fees next year, he adds.",
      "As universities cut back there is a risk to the student experience - this year the largest annual study of undergraduates found only 36% in England thought their course was good or very good value for money.",
      "Sir David says he expects \u201cabsolute transparency\u201d about what students are getting in return for fees, whether on contact hours or important services such as mental health support.",
      "He suggests business degrees are one area that might need more scrutiny to demonstrate which offer the best outcomes for students.",
      "Teddy Darvill-Cutts is a UEA occupational therapy student who says he can see where his tuition fee goes.",
      "\u201cI'm surrounded by all this up-to-date technology, everything's working well,\u201d he says.",
      "But another UEA student, Amber Bramham, says not \u201call students see the benefits equally\u201d.",
      "The financial pressures on universities could lead to very visible changes such as institutions focusing on a smaller number of courses to which they can recruit well.",
      "The forecasts published on Friday will also form part of the public debate, and private negotiations between universities and ministers considering whether tuition fees should rise further in the future.",
      "The heat is now on universities to bring down costs, with renewed scrutiny from ministers and the regulator over how they spend money.",
      "This could renew pressure around vice chancellors pay, even though it is a tiny fraction of the spending of universities with a turnover of \u00a3500m or more."

      "Over time Infowars was increasingly embraced by Donald Trump\u2019s allies and his supporters. During his first run for president, Trump appeared on Infowars and told Jones: \u201cYour reputation is amazing. I will not let you down.\u201d",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 03:48:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Williams was fined $5m in a plagiarism lawsuit, but a film about his life doesn't touch on the issue.",
    "story": [
      "Piece By Piece, the new documentary about musician Pharrell Williams, is unusual in many respects - not least because it is entirely animated with Lego.",
      "Critics have welcomed the film's unique visual style, calling it \"disarmingly joyous\" and \"oddly charming\" - but they've also questioned one of the film's big omissions.",
      "Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines, which Williams co-wrote, is heard briefly on the soundtrack, without referencing the song's infamous plagiarism trial, which left the musician owing $5m to the estate of Marvin Gaye.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, director Morgan Neville said he had wanted to address the controversy, but the sequence ultimately derailed the story he was trying to tell.",
      "\"I definitely thought about it. I even interviewed Robin Thicke,\" he said. \"And as a documentary filmmaker, I'm obsessed with copyright law.",
      "\"But every time I looked at trying to work it in, a scene about copyright law, it felt like it belonged in a different movie.\"",
      "The Blurred Lines trial was hugely consequential for the music industry, after a jury ruled that Williams and Thicke had copied the sound and \"feel\" of Marvin Gaye's Got To Give It Up - rather than plagiarising a specific melody.",
      "The general consensus among music lawyers and songwriters is that the verdict failed to distinguish between influence and theft.",
      "It has now become common practice for musicians to assign a share of their royalties to songs that directly inspired them.",
      "\"My take on the Blurred Lines case is that it's one of the worst judicial decisions about creativity in history,\" Neville told the BBC. \"I think Pharrell was in the right on it, and I think most creatives agree with him.\"",
      "Ultimately, that led to him omitting the story from the documentary.",
      "\"It's not like Pharrell learned a big lesson from the case. I don't know if it actually changed him in any way, which is what I'm looking for, when I'm looking at a story.\"",
      "Williams has been contacted for comment.",
      "Neville previously won an Oscar for 20 Feet From Stardom - a documentary about the forgotten lives of backing singers who feature on some of rock's biggest songs.",
      "His other documentary subjects include Keith Richards, Brian Wilson, Johnny Cash and, as a producer, Taylor Swift.",
      "With Piece By Piece hitting cinemas this month, Neville told us about the film's unexpected genesis, how he convinced Lego to come on board, and the stars who had notes about their Lego minifigures.",
      "In the film, you dramatise the moment Pharrell asked you to make the film in Lego, and your response is \u201cLego? Seriously?\u201d How true to life was that?",
      "The main difference is that when Pharrell said \u201cLego movie\u201d, I thought, \u201cHell, yeah!\u201d",
      "I knew it was a crazy idea, but an exciting idea. I think it took me five minutes to fully buy into it.",
      "Can you break it down for me? What was Pharrell\u2019s pitch?",
      "He basically said, \"People have always wanted me to tell my story, and I've never been that interested, but I love your films, and I had the idea that you could make a documentary about me, and when you were done with it, you could throw away the visuals and do it again as Lego.\"",
      "That\u2019s almost exactly what he said to me \u2013 but beyond that, he had no sense of what that meant, or what his story was. So I really had to think, what does that mean?",
      "And one thing I instantly I realised is that it's not just about taking the real-life documentary footage and making it Lego. It's using what animation can do, which is time travel and go to outer space and all kinds of things that you can't normally do in a documentary.",
      "How quickly did it go from a crazy idea to reality?",
      "It took us about a year from when we first met to starting production, because we had to meet with Lego and tell them about it.",
      "How did the conversation with Lego go?",
      "I said, \"Look, it's not a G-rated movie, but I get that it can't be R-rated [either]. It's something that has to have a little edge, and it's going to get into questions of race and other things\".",
      "And Lego, to their complete credit, said, \"Those are conversations that are good for us to have.\"",
      "They knew it would push them, but in ways that they thought were good.",
      "But they didn\u2019t fund it, they don't own it, they're just partners.",
      "What was the moment you knew it would work?",
      "Well, we had to figure out how to get somebody to pay for it, so we did a 90 second proof of concept.",
      "I interviewed Pharrell, and I cut together a scene of him listening to Stevie Wonder as a boy, on his parents' stereo \u2013 and his synaesthesia kicks in. Suddenly there's lots of colour and you can almost see what's going on in his mind. That convinced me it would work.",
      "I love the way you visualise Pharrell\u2019s beats as Lego sculptures, each with its own unique shape. It really helps illustrate the abstract concept of songwriting.",
      "Do you know, what was interesting about the beats? Pharrell, in his mind, can tell you the colour and the shape of every beat he's made. So for each of those Lego pieces, we actually worked with Pharrell to make sure they looked like what he saw in his head.",
      "When you interviewed other people for the film \u2013 Missy Elliot, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg \u2013 did you tell them it was going to be rendered in Lego?",
      "We didn\u2019t, partly because we filmed those interviews five years ago and we wanted to keep it on the down low.",
      "Then, cut to a couple years later, and I started sending out 3D renders of their characters, like, \"Here you go. This is what you're gonna look like\".",
      "It was a bit of a roll of the dice, but everyone was really excited about it.",
      "Did anyone ask for changes?",
      "Missy had a comment on her earrings, so one of the few bespoke [Lego] pieces that we made for the film were Missy's earrings.",
      "The Lego characters have a limited range of facial expressions. Did that pose a problem?",
      "The face stuff was the thing I was most worried about, because when you have close up shots of a Lego minifig crying, is that going to be emotional? I didn't know.",
      "But there were a few animators on our team who were really good at facial animation, and we gave them the most emotional scenes, the close-up scenes. And oftentimes, if something wasn't quite right, we would send them videos.",
      "Somewhere in the world, there are a whole lot of clips me and Pharrell making very strange faces!",
      "The arc of the film is Pharrell re-discovering his muse after a period where he gets lost, creatively. Why did you focus on that aspect of his story?",
      "Without a doubt, the film reflects a lot of questions I've had about my own career.",
      "To me, the story about this black nerd from the projects of Virginia who sees the world differently... and it makes him an outcast for a long time. Then he finds a fellow outcast in Chad Hugo [Williams' co-writer in The Neptunes] and they start making music.",
      "But their beats were just too weird for people. The signature Neptunes sound was very unorthodox. Nobody got it until everybody got it. Then you end up in this hall of mirrors \u2013 where the thing that makes you different becomes the sound of the mainstream. When that happens, how do you stay true to yourself?",
      "Your film comes out at the same time as the Robbie Williams biopic Better Man, where he's played by a CGI monkey. Do you think music biopics had become too formulaic?",
      "I do. There's so many tropes of music films, and I think we need to do more to help people identify with the people and with their characters.",
      "I haven\u2019t seen Better Man yet but the idea's perfect because, in a way, Robbie Williams is the performing monkey. He wants the attention. He's always lived that life.",
      "And Pharrell is the Wizard of Oz. He's like, \"I want to be the guy behind the curtain.\""

      "Ensuring that the exam runs smoothly is a nationwide effort. Shops and the stock market opened late on Thursday to reduce traffic congestion, and authorities adjusted public transport operating hours and put more than a dozen spare trains on standby in case of breakdowns.",
      "More than 10,000 police officers were deployed, including some tasked to ferry students to school during emergencies.",
      "Besides grounding planes to minimise noise disturbances during the 20-minute English listening test, authorities have also asked bus and taxi drivers to refrain from honking while the tests are taking place.",
      "Disruptions to the Suneung are treated as a serious matter. Last December, dozens of students sued the government after teachers accidentally cut their test short by 90 seconds.",
      "There are a record number of candidates retaking the exam this year, after authorities announced they would expand enrolment in medical schools - a move that was met with widespread protests among trainee doctors while being welcomed by aspiring medical students."

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Tickets go on sale this week, so here are some tips to maximise your chances of securing entry.",
    "story": [
      "Tickets for the Glastonbury Festival go on sale this week, with millions of fans expected to fight it out for a chance to attend the event, which will run from 25-29 June 2025.",
      "No headliners have been announced yet, but demand is expected to be higher than ever because the festival will take a year off in 2026.",
      "Last year, all 210,000 tickets sold out in just 58 minutes as more than 2.5 million people tried to log on and secure a place.",
      "\"There aren't enough tickets for everybody,\" organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast earlier this year. \"It's one of the worst parts of the job [because] we can't do anything about it. We definitely can't do two weekends.",
      "\"But a lot of the time,\" she added, \"people who really, really want to come often get tickets through volunteering or through competitions.\"",
      "So there's always hope... But if you're brave enough to run the gauntlet of the online ticketing system, here are a few tips that might (might) help improve your chances.",
      "1) Check your registration",
      "As part of an ongoing (and successful) campaign to stop touts, anyone who wants to attend Glastonbury has to be registered in advance.",
      "The registration window closed on Monday, 11 November - so if you're not on the list already, it's too late.",
      "Everyone else is urged to check their details in advance, to make sure everything is up to date.",
      "You will need to have the registration number and postcode for each person you are buying a ticket for when the sale begins.",
      "2) Decide between coach or general entry",
      "Glastonbury tickets come in two flavours - standard weekend tickets and coach weekend tickets.",
      "Weekend tickets mean you can arrive under your own steam by train or car - although beware Glastonbury's legendary tailbacks, and how depleted your energy levels might be on the way home.",
      "Coach tickets are more environmentally friendly and, according to some, increase your chances of success, depending on how remote your starting point is. However, it's important to note that festival tickets are distributed on the coach itself, so you can't cheat the system.",
      "Ticket and coach packages will go on sale at 18:00 GMT on Thursday, 14 November.",
      "General admission tickets will go on sale at 09:00 on Sunday, 17 November.",
      "3) Team up with your friends",
      "You can purchase up to six tickets once you reach the booking stage, as long as you have the registration details for each attendee.",
      "Logically, the more people trying for tickets, the better the chances are of securing a space - so make sure all six of you are trying to log on when tickets go on sale (NB not in the same house... see below for why).",
      "Your syndicate doesn't have to be formed of people you're physically going to the festival with. It can be friends, colleagues, aunts, uncles, neighbours or Chris Martin from Coldplay. The point is that you're working together.",
      "Make a group chat so you can co-ordinate your efforts and, most importantly, put all of your registration numbers and postcodes in a shared document so the first person to reach the front of the queue is ready.",
      "4) Don't fall for scam websites",
      "The demand for Glastonbury tickets inevitably attracts scam artists and fraudsters, who prey on people's desperation to separate them from their money.",
      "Tickets are sold exclusively at glastonbury.seetickets.com. Avoid the temptation of buying from elsewhere.",
      "5) Log on early",
      "This year, Glastonbury has introduced a new queueing system that requires you to log on in advance.",
      "That way, when the ticket sale starts, you will be randomly assigned a place in the queue.",
      "People who join later will automatically be placed at the back of the line, so it pays to be punctual.",
      "Also, 09:00 on Sunday isn't the most sociable time of the week. Set an alarm. Set multiple alarms. Get an insomniac friend to come over to your house and poke you with a stick. Whatever works.",
      "If it's possible (and I apologise for this in advance), you could even drag yourself into work. No matter how good your wifi is at home, a work computer could have a more stable connection.",
      "6) Don't use multiple devices",
      "Using multiple devices and browser tabs can result in errors and may even get you kicked out of the queue, which you definitely don't want.",
      "Sticking to one device per household also makes the process more fair, according to the Glastonbury website.",
      "\"Whilst we understand that everyone wants to have the best possible chance of booking a ticket, running multiple devices simultaneously to attempt to access the website is a waste of valuable resources, and doesn\u2019t reflect the ethos of the festival.",
      "\"Please stick to one device and one tab, so that you can focus on entering your details without confusing your browser and help us make the ticket sale as quick and stress free as possible for all.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 03:55:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

      "Selena Gomez, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Adriana Paz launched the movie at the London Film Festival last month, where it continued to build its momentum.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez follows a dangerous Mexican Cartel leader (played by Gasc\u00f3n), who asks a high-powered lawyer named Rita (Salda\u00f1a) to help him fake his own death.",
      "But the reason he wants to retire and disappear from the world of crime isn't what you might expect - the drug baron wants to change gender and live a new life as a woman.",
      "The rest of the film focuses on four women, including the newly-transitioned Emilia P\u00e9rez, as they each pursue their own version of happiness in modern-day Mexico.",
      "P\u00e9rez is portrayed by Spanish trans actress Gasc\u00f3n, who has been tipped as a possible best actress contender in the forthcoming awards race.",
      "French director Jacques Audiard came up with the idea for the film after reading a chapter in Boris Razon's 2018 novel \u00c9coute about a drug lord who changes identity.",
      "Audiard went one step further for the film, and made it a story of changing gender.",
      "\"I was less interested in a change of identity to evade competitor drug barons, and more interested in the change of identity for the sake of the person she was and is,\u201d the director tells BBC News. \"I was more interested in the past and what led to that transition.\"",
      "The role required someone very specific \u2013 a trans actress, who was a Spanish speaker, who could also sing and dance.",
      "Recalling the casting process, Gasc\u00f3n explains: \u201cI was contacted when I was in Mexico by a production team, and was told 'We need an actress as crazy as you - you're the only one who can do this role, but you need to learn five songs for tomorrow!'",
      "\u201cAnd I was like 'OK, let's record the whole album and we'll go on tour as soon as you want!\u2019\" she jokes. \u201cBut I did say, \u2018this is going to be difficult, I'm not a singer'. But the team in the film, they worked with me incredibly, they really helped me with all the songs and made it so that we could do the best work possible.\u201d",
      "Asked about Gasc\u00f3n's casting, Audiard adds simply: \u201cWithout her, there would be no film.\u201d",
      "Interestingly, Gasc\u00f3n campaigned to play both the male and female roles \u2013 in other words, the character both before and after transition.",
      "Audiard had originally intended for a different actor to play the male drug lord Manitas, because, the director explains, he was \"uncomfortable asking [Gasc\u00f3n] to revisit something she was moving away from\".",
      "But, Gasc\u00f3n recalled: \u201cI said to Jacques, I want to play this role in the complete arc, because for me it is important to do the full part. It wouldn't be the same film if another actor played [Manitas].\"",
      "That meant using effects and make-up such as a fake beard, so she could play the drug baron in the first section of the musical.",
      "\"This film is this film because the same actress played the complete performance,\" Gasc\u00f3n continues. \"It's that kind of role you have once in your life and I didn't want to lose the opportunity to play this.\u201d",
      "The ongoing debate about whether actors should have lived experience of characters they play is complex, and Gasc\u00f3n herself says: \"I prefer that all actors have the full opportunities. When you chose this career, it's because you want to express another life that's not like your life.",
      "\"But,\" she continues, \"obviously when you are closer to the role of the character, it's better. In this case, I think it's beautiful, because I give all of myself to this role.\"",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has been described as a \"wonderful discovery\" by the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney, who said she gives \"a magnificent performance\".",
      "\"The warmth, the joyous self-realisation, the complexity and authenticity... that illuminate her characterisation no doubt owe much to the parallels in the Spanish star\u2019s life - in her own words, she was an actor before becoming an actress, a father before becoming a mother.\"",
      "Gomez plays the drug lord's wife, who is kept in the dark about her former lover's new identity, while Paz portrays Emilia's new romantic interest after transitioning.",
      "Reviews of Emilia P\u00e9rez, which is released on Netflix next month, have been generally positive so far.",
      "\"It's a wild, gritty, glitter-soaked ride that defies convention and classification,\" said Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker.",
      "She praised the film's performances, commenting: \"Selena Gomez is a welcome surprise, shedding any remaining hints of her Disney Channel origins in her portrayal of a hard-loving wife of a narco.",
      "\"The film's climax in particular allows Gomez to shine as a dramatic actress in new ways. She conveys heartache and anguish through a tortured physicality that propels her into the unpredictable state of a woman on the verge of something dangerous.\"",
      "Asked by the BBC's Graham Norton if it was comfortable going back to the world of singing and dancing for the musical, Gomez said: \"No, because this was completely different.",
      "\"It was intricate dance moves I never knew my body could do, and it was also me playing a character so if anything I tried to avoid what I was comfortable with.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey described the film as \"amazingly confident \u2013 it\u2019s clever, earnest, ridiculous, knowing, forceful and absolutely bonkers\", while Hoai-Tran Bui of Inverse said it was \"an emotionally fulfilling triumph\".",
      "Not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film, however.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez was originally intended to be an opera, which perhaps partly explains its saccharine sentimentality, repetitive lyrics, and diverging story branches. But that doesn\u2019t excuse its almost random, whiplash-inducing tonal pivots,\" said Slant's Kyle Turner.",
      "However, Lauren Bradshaw of Fangirl Freakout said: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez is a magnificent, genre-bending thrill ride that transcends the typical movie construct, breathing a fresh burst of excitement into the way we think about film.\"",
      "As an actress, Gomez is best known for starring in Only Murders in the Building, but also has a successful singing career with hits including Back To You, Wolves and Love You Like a Love Song.",
      "Her co-star Salda\u00f1a, meanwhile, has starred in a large number of blockbusters in the last two decades, with roles in the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Emilia P\u00e9rez could be a big awards player, but Academy voters may see an opportunity to recognise Salda\u00f1a's box office success via this more critically acclaimed work.",
      "Their co-star Adriana Paz is a Mexican actress whose credits include Not Forgotten, Hilda and La Caridad, while Gasc\u00f3n also had a successful acting career before transitioning in 2018.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez has already been selected as France's entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars, which take place in March.",
      "But despite the film's awards traction, Paz tells BBC News: \u201cI never think about that, really. I get into a project because I'm interested in the topic, character, director or actors, you do it because it really matters to you.\u201d",
      "She adds that the attention in recent months is unlike anything she's experienced in her career. \"It's been a lot,\" she says, \"because I've been working in Spain and have a long career in Mexico, and people have a recognition of my work, but not like [it's been] since Cannes.",
      "\"In my country they feel very proud of me, and there was a lot of people that didn't know about my work, and now thanks to Emilia they are getting to know my work... and they see 'we feel so proud as Mexicans that you won this award.'\"",
      "After the success of Emilia Perez, Paz says she would \"love to\" appear in more musicals in future, and loves singing.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n has a slightly different take. \"I don't like musicals!\" she laughs, adding that she hopes casting directors aren't too enthusiastic about her performance.",
      "\"I don't like to sing, I don't want to be compared to Shakira or something like that, and I don't like dancing, so please don't call me!\"",

      "How Lineker went from football sensation to BBC star",
      "So, who are the potential star signings that could fill the vacant hot seat to become the show's sixth main presenter in its 60-year history?",
      "Mark Chapman",
      "A familiar face to football fans, Mark 'Chappers' Chapman is considered by many to be a front-runner with his warm presenting style.",
      "He brings a wealth of experience, having regularly stood in to present Match of the Day and fronted its sister programme, Match of the Day 2, for over a decade.",
      "Chapman has also recently begun hosting the BBC's new mid-week Champions League highlights show, secured under a three-year deal with Uefa.",
      "Outside television, the broadcaster presents a number of shows on BBC Radio 5 Live, including its football-orientated Monday Night Club.",
      "Gabby Logan",
      "Gabby Logan is one of the UK's most well-known sports presenters, with 20 years' experience hosting major football coverage across various networks.",
      "After starting her broadcasting career at Sky, she moved to ITV, deputising for Des Lynam on The Premiership, the channel's highlights show launched after they won the rights from the BBC between 2001 and 2004.",
      "Logan later succeeded Lynam to front Champions League coverage on the station, before departing under what she described as a \"cloud\" when her job as a World Cup anchor was given to a male presenter instead.",
      "She swiftly joined the BBC in 2007 and has stood in for Lineker on Match of the Day, alongside covering the biggest sporting events, including the Six Nations, the Olympics, the men's and women's football World Cup and this summer's Euros.",
      "Logan has recently begun hosting live games shown on streaming service Amazon Prime, further boosting her Premier League credentials.",
      "Gary Lineker to leave BBC's Match of the Day",
      "How Gary Lineker went from football sensation to BBC star",
      "Alex Scott",
      "Scott, another regular Match of the Day stand-in, broke through as one of the first mainstream female football pundits after retiring from the game in 2017.",
      "The former England and Arsenal midfielder became the first female analyst to be taken to a men's World Cup by the BBC when Russia hosted the tournament in 2018.",
      "Later that summer, she also debuted as Sky Sports' first woman football pundit.",
      "In 2021, she took over hosting duties for the BBC's Football Focus - replacing the departing Dan Walker on the weekend preview show.",
      "An ever-present broadcaster at men\u2019s and women\u2019s tournaments since, Scott wore a rainbow armband during England\u2019s first match of the Qatar World Cup - showing support for the LGBT community in a country where homosexuality remains illegal.",
      "The recipient of an MBE, she defended her London accent after ex-House of Lords member Digby Jones criticised her pronunciation.",
      "Kate Scott",
      "Following a stint at TNT Sport, Kate Scott has found her career transformed at the helm of CBS' Champions League coverage.",
      "She previously told GQ that the show's success relies on its uninhibited feel, calling it the \"locker room environment translated onto television\" - mirroring the personality-driven tone younger audiences are used to from online sports content.",
      "One of its pundits, Micah Richards (see below), has separately described Scott as the \"glue\" that keeps the controlled chaos of the show together; balancing frolics (such as being teased into revealing her first kiss) with genuine analysis from the panel.",
      "As young audiences increasingly turn their back on terrestrial TV, the BBC is under pressure to adapt - particularly as individual match highlights now appear on YouTube long before Match of the Day's 10:30pm time slot.",
      "There's no doubt the new-age formula has worked for CBS, but it is a far cry from the traditions of Match of the Day. Could it work on the BBC? And would Scott want to risk jeopardising CBS' popular dynamic?",
      "Alan Shearer",
      "Alan Shearer, alongside Lineker, is one of England's all-time great goal-scorers. Despite retiring in 2006, he still holds the Premier League goal record and remains top scorer for Newcastle United.",
      "This pedigree helped him become a mainstay pundit on the BBC and Match of the Day. He also formed a strong trio with Lineker and Richards, first on the BBC's Match of the Day podcast and latterly The Rest is Football - produced independently on Lineker's hugely successful Goalhanger podcast company. These have allowed him to show off more of his personality.",
      "Now almost 20 years into his media career, Shearer is however yet to host a show - could that step up to becoming Match of the day anchor finally be on the horizon?",
      "Micah Richards",
      "The ex-Manchester City and England defender burst onto the footballing scene as a teenager, but, after an on-pitch career curtailed by a knee injury, Richards has blossomed as the ever-animated pundit with a mega-watt personality to boot.",
      "He embodies the modern take on the role, engaging viewers not only with analysis but also fun-loving camaraderie shared between analysts and presenter.",
      "His media career blossomed as a jovial foil to the tough-talking, former Manchester United captain Roy Keane on Sky Sports' Super Sunday.",
      "Similar roles have followed on Match of the Day and for CBS' Champions League coverage - where humorous off-script moments between presenter Abdo, Richards himself and Premier League legends Jamie Carragher and Thierry Henry regularly trend on social media.",
      "Asking Richards to make the step up to presenting duties on a show as prestigious as Match of the Day would represent a risk from bosses, but certainly mark a fresh start and shift in tone.",
      "He also has the backing of Lineker, who, when discussing the speculation over his future on The Rest is Football, told Richards: \"I'd love to see you take over. I think you'd be brilliant in the chair.\"",
      "Colin Murray",
      "Beginning his career in music as a fun-loving, noughties upstart on BBC Radio 1, Colin Murray soon moved into sport broadcasting.",
      "The Northern Irishman balanced hosting BBC Radio 5 Live's raucous sport comedy panel show Fighting Talk with anchoring European football on Channel 5, before moving to precede Mark Chapman in the hot seat on Match of the Day 2.",
      "But Murray chose to leave that role in 2013, as he had an offer to join TalkSport radio. He has continued to work at the BBC however, presenting  various shows on 5 Live, along with becoming host of Channel 4's long-running word show, Countdown.",
      "Murray is certainly a tried, tested and trusted football anchor with appeal spanning all age groups.",
      "Dan Walker",
      "Prior to quitting the BBC for Channel 5 in 2022, Dan Walker shared his high-profile  BBC Breakfast presenting role with 12 years as the host of Football Focus.",
      "Walker would offer bosses a clean cut image and a safe pair of hands were he to take the role, having previously also covered Olympics and football World Cups for the BBC. He has also recently covered games for Amazon Prime.",
      "But questions remain over Walker's own interest - he is on a bumper contract at Channel 5 and has persistently batted away suggestions of a return to the BBC.",
      "Laura Woods",
      "Laura Woods made her name on TalkSport, receiving plaudits for her relatable style as a host and interviewer.",
      "She has since stepped up to become lead presenter for TNT Sports' Champions League coverage, replacing Jake Humphrey when the channel rebranded from BT Sport last year.",
      "Woods also presents football on Amazon Prime and ITV - joining the latter for coverage of this summer's Euros.",
      "Earlier this summer she spoke of receiving \"numerous death threats\" online after commenting on an article questioning the eligibility of Olympic champion boxers Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting.",
      "Woods fits the mould of Scott and Richards in bringing a more personality-led style to her broadcasting.",
      "Jake Humphrey",
      "Humphrey is a vastly experienced sports broadcaster, with a catalogue of BBC experience to draw upon prior to his later career exploits.",
      "After an early career on BBC children's TV, by 2006 he had started working with BBC Sport, presenting Formula 1, Football Focus, Final Score and becoming the youngest ever host in Match of the Day's history.",
      "Since stepping back from BT Sport, Humphrey has focused on his successful High-Performance podcast, exploring the lives of high-achieving individuals. However, Humphrey remains a fan of Match of the Day, previously telling The Express he would \"never say never\" to hosting the \"legendary show\".",
      "Kelly Cates",
      "An experienced anchor across radio and TV, football is Cates' life-blood, quite literally - she is the daughter of Liverpool and Scotland legend Kenny Dalglish.",
      "The broadcaster has hosted BBC Radio 5 Live's 606 football phone-in and, more recently, the station's Football Daily podcast, in amongst numerous other roles at major tournaments.",
      "But she is best-known in front of the camera as part of the presenting roster for Sky Sports' Premier League coverage - including its flagship Super Sunday programme.",
      "Cates, like Logan, brings both pedigree and gender diversity - but it remains to be seen if she could be tempted away from Sky.",
      "Correction 12 November 2024: An earlier version of this article incorrectly suggested that Colin Murray left the BBC over a controversy on Fighting Talk. It has been amended to make clear he left to take a presenting job at Talk Sport Radio."

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 00:17:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The South Korean hit drama returns for a second season in December.",
    "story": [
      "When I ask the creator of the hit Korean drama Squid Game about reports that he was so stressed while shooting the first series he lost six teeth, he quickly corrects me. \u201cIt was eight or nine,\u201d he laughs.",
      "Hwang Dong-hyuk is speaking to me on set as he films the second series of his dystopian Netflix thriller, which sees hundreds of debt-laden contestants fight it out for a whopping cash prize, by playing a string of life-or-death children\u2019s games.",
      "But another series was not always on the cards. At one point, he swore against making one.",
      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",
      "\u201cMoney,\u201d he answers, without hesitation.",
      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",
      "As I toured the show\u2019s playful set, with its distinctive brightly-coloured staircase, I picked up a few clues as to how the director\u2019s despair will be reflected this time around.",
      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",
      "According to Lee Jung-jae, who plays the leading character, he is \"more desperate and determined\u201d than before.",
      "The floor of the dormitory, where the contestants sleep at night, has been divided in two.",
      "One half is branded with a giant red neon X symbol, the other with a blue circle.",
      "Now, after every game, the players must pick a side, depending on whether they want to end the contest early and survive, or keep playing, in the knowledge all but one of them will die. The majority decision rules.",
      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",
      "\u201cPeople will see more of the Front Man\u2019s past, his story and his emotions,\u201d reveals the actor Lee Byung-hun, who plays the mysterious role.",
      "\u201cI don't think this will make viewers warm to him, but it may help them better understand his choices.\u201d",
      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",
      "This explains the love-hate relationship South Korea\u2019s film and television creators currently have with international streaming platforms.",
      "Over the past few years, Netflix has stormed the Korean market with billions of dollars of investment, bringing the industry global recognition and love, but leaving creators feeling short-changed.",
      "They accuse the platform of forcing them to relinquish their copyright when they sign contracts \u2013 and with it, their claim to profit.",
      "This is a worldwide problem.",
      "In the past, creators could rely on getting a cut of box office sales or TV re-runs, but this model has not been adopted by streaming giants.",
      "The issue is compounded in South Korea, creators say, due to its outdated copyright law, which does not protect them.",
      "This summer, actors, writers, directors and producers teamed up to form a collective, to fight the system together.",
      "\u201cIn Korea, being a movie director is just a job title, it\u2019s not a way to earn a living,\u201d the vice-president of the Korean Film Directors Guild, Oh Ki-hwan, tells the audience at an event in Seoul.",
      "Some of his director friends, he says, work part-time in warehouses and as taxi drivers.",
      "Park Hae-young is a writer at the event. When Netflix bought her show, 'My Liberation Notes', it became a global hit.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been writing my whole life. So, to get global recognition when competing with creators from across the world, has been a joyful experience,\u201d she tells me.",
      "But Park says the current streaming model has left her reluctant to \u201cpour her all\u201d into her next series.",
      "\u201cUsually, I\u2019ll spend four or five years making a drama in the belief that, if it's successful, it could somewhat secure my future, that I'll get my fair share of compensation. Without that, what's the point of working so hard?\u201d",
      "She and other creators are pushing the South Korean government to change its copyright law to force production companies to share their profits.",
      "In a statement, the South Korean government told the BBC that while it recognised the compensation system needed to change, it was up to the industry to resolve the issue. A spokesperson for Netflix told us it offers \u201ccompetitive\u201d compensation, and guarantees creators \u201csolid compensation, regardless of the success or failure of their shows\u201d.",
      "Squid Game\u2019s Hwang hopes his candor over his own pay struggles will initiate that change.",
      "He has certainly sparked the fair pay conversation, and this second series will surely give the industry another bump.",
      "But when we catch up after filming has wrapped, he tells me his teeth are aching again.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen my dentist yet, but I\u2019ll probably have to pull out a few more very soon.\u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 11 Nov 2024 04:05:39 GMT",
    "summary": "Everything we learned on the red carpet and behind the scenes of the MTV Europe Music Awards.",
    "story": [
      "The MTV Awards came to Manchester for the first time in their 30-year history on Sunday night, but somehow didn't feel very Mancunian.",
      "There was no sign of Take That or Aitch, or Liam Gallagher - even though he won best rock star.",
      "Organisers made a few subtle nods to the city: The stage was framed in the black and yellow stripes of Factory Records, and New Order's Blue Monday pumped through the speakers every time nominees were announced.",
      "But the show took a more global perspective, highlighting acts from Mexico, South Korea, South Africa and America - including a predictable victory for Taylor Swift in the night's two biggest categories, best artist and video of the year.",
      "She only appeared by video, choosing instead to spend the night watching her boyfriend, American Football player Travis Kelce, lead the Kansas City Chiefs to victory against the Denver Broncos.",
      "But there were plenty of other stars at the show and on the red carpet. Here's some of the gossip we picked up along the way.",
      "1) Raye gave an update on her missing song books",
      "Two weeks ago, Raye told fans her second album had been delayed by thieves who stole her car and, with it, several notebooks full of lyrics and song ideas.",
      "On the red carpet, she confirmed the police hadn't been able to track them down, saying: \"I've just had to let it go.\"",
      "The singer said she couldn't recreate a lot of the ideas, because the act of writing them down freed her mind to work on other things.",
      "\"You let it go, because you think you can come back to it - and now there are so many ideas that are just gone. It's so sad.\"",
      "But the singer, who won best UK artist, maintained a positive outlook.",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason. I'll have to start again and maybe it's a blessing in disguise.\"",
      "2) Busta Rhymes revealed his unlikely comedy hero",
      "The decision to bring rap legend Busta Rhymes to Manchester to receive a global icon award wasn't as random as it sounded.",
      "Before he developed his rapid-fire rap delivery, an 11-year-old Rhymes spent two summers living with his Aunt Velma in Morecambe.",
      "\"I went to karate school, and we illegally went into nightclubs, to make a little money break-dancing,\" he told us.",
      "\"I remember Boy George was cool, Wham was cool,\" he continued.",
      "\"But our favourite was Benny Hill. Benny Hill is still our favourite to this day. I don't think anybody has as ever been as funny or as charismatic as Benny Hill.\"",
      "So, during those halcyon days of watching smutty comedy in Morecambe, did he ever think he'd be back, winning a lifetime achievement prize?",
      "\"You can never foresee something like that,\" he said. \"When we first got involved with hip-hop, we didn't do it for none of the accolades. We just did it because we loved it.",
      "\"But with that being said, tonight is a dream come true.\"",
      "To honour that moment, he gave a nine-minute acceptance speech thanking everyone from his mother to an art teacher he'd met backstage.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never got an award from MTV before. Thirty four years of professionally recording [and] this is the first time I\u2019m getting an award from MTV. It feels incredible.\"",
      "3) Olly Alexander had advice for next year's Eurovision contestant",
      "Olly Alexander played a pre-show party on Saturday night, and couldn't quite believe the reception for Dizzy - the song which earned him 18th place at this year's Eurovision Song Contest.",
      "\"That went down a lot better than it did in Eurovision,\" he laughed, shortly before Jedward invaded the stage and caused utter chaos.",
      "At the main ceremony, Alexander was there to award song of the year to Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso. But he also had a few words for anyone considering representing the UK at next year's contest.",
      "\"I would say to them, whoever it is, 'Call me, and we will have a serious conversation about it',\" he said with the haunted look of a man who has seen some things.",
      "4) Benson Boone has a new fan: Bez",
      "In addition to winning best new artist, US singer Benson Boone opened the ceremony with a spectacular performance that saw him suspended mid-air on a grand piano, before pulling off a spectacular front flip from a platform at the side of the stage.",
      "\"The insurance is always crazy,\" he laughed, \"but I love to perform.\"",
      "One person who couldn't believe his eyes was Happy Mondays star Bez, who accosted Boone during an interview with Rita Ora.",
      "\"I was so blown away by that performance, mate,\" he told the singer.",
      "\"When you came down on that shiny piano, I thought, 'Elton John is going to be so gutted.'\"",
      "5) Le Sserafim escaped to Manchester's Christmas market",
      "Manchester is home to the UK's biggest K-Pop shop and, on Sunday morning, the staff couldn't quite believe one of the genre's biggest girl bands had landed in their city.",
      "\"Le Sserafim were posting pictures from the Christmas market,\" one of them told me. \"That's only five minutes from here!\"",
      "The five-piece, who've been setting chart records over in the US, jetted in for their first-ever UK performance, a mash-up of Chasing Lightning and the 90s house banger Crazy.",
      "But they were more excited to be out on the town without being mobbed.",
      "\"It was so good, we had baklava!\" enthused singer Huh Yun-Jin; while her bandmate Sakura tucked into a portion of fish and chips.",
      "\"It was my first time,\" she said. \"I loved it.\"",
      "On stage at the EMAs, the band got one of the biggest screams of the night, despite being relatively unknown in the UK... for now.",
      "\"Coming to Europe is something that we've always dreamt of, so this is absolutely surreal,\" said Yun-Jin. \"We just want to make a good impression.\"",
      "Mission accomplished.",
      "6) Jedward spent two hours on the red carpet",
      "For absolutely no reason at all, Jedward went on a massive charm offensive for the international press.",
      "\"Oasis are back and Jedward are back!\" they declared, before racing over to baffled German and French journalists, while singing Stop Crying Your Heart Out.",
      "This went on for two deliriously brilliant hours, as the twins, who found fame on The X Factor 15 years ago, insisted that \"a lot of artists have been inspired by Jedward\".",
      "And, to be fair, they have proof. Mercury Prize nominee CMAT recently said the brothers had encouraged her to finish her second album, with a motivational voice message.",
      "\"You have to think about it, in life,\" explained John.",
      "\"Don't always think you're the main character. Reach out to other people. Serve that tennis ball and see what they do.\"",
      "\"It's always about keeping that spark alive,\" added Edward. \"We're like a support animal for all the artists.\"",
      "They were, to be honest, an absolute blast.",
      "7) The Liam Payne tribute was perfectly judged",
      "Liam Payne won 12 MTV EMAs during his time in One Direction, and later used the ceremony to launch his solo career, performing his global smash hit Strip That Down at the 2017 ceremony.",
      "It was only fitting that the event marked his death - but striking the right tone in the middle of a huge showbiz event is never easy.",
      "In the end, his friend and collaborator Rita Ora just spoke from the heart.",
      "\"There were so many ways that we were talking about honouring him,\" she said. \"But sometimes simply speaking is enough.\"",
      "Addressing the camera directly, she shared her memories of the 31-year-old, as her voice cracked.",
      "\"Liam Payne was one of the kindest people that I knew,\" she said. \"He brought so much joy to every room he walked into. And he left such a mark on this world.\"",
      "It was sombre and restrained, yet powerfully emotional. Ora wasn't the only one crying.",
      "8) Tyla paid tribute to Aaliyah",
      "South African star Tyla, best known for her viral hit Water, clinched both the best R&B and best Afrobeats awards.",
      "The awards marked her continued ascent, after being named one of the BBC's Sounds of 2024 - but she made sure to honour her inspirations.",
      "On the red carpet, she rocked a vintage Roberto Cavalli dress with a turquoise blue zebra print.",
      "The exact same dress had previously been worn by US rapper Eve at the 2000 Soul Train Awards.",
      "And R&B legend Aaliyah wore a canary yellow version at the 2000 MTV Awards, where she won best female video for Try Again.",
      "The ceremony took place in September 2000, less than a year before Aaliyah's tragic death in an plane accident.",
      "The singer was just 22 at the time - the same age that Tyla is now."

    "story": [
      "I can feel the anger rising. How am I facing this abuse again after 20 years?",
      "My name is Alex. But increasingly young people shout \u201cTimmy\u201d at me in the street. This isn\u2019t mistaken identity - it\u2018s mockery because I use a wheelchair.",
      "I should ignore it, but this time, I react. I turn to see a group of young teenage boys smirking in front of me. \u201cI heard you,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI know exactly who Timmy is.\u201d",
      "I know this because although we do not share a name, I have felt the shadow of Timmy since childhood - never through choice.",
      "A disabled character from dark-humoured satire cartoon series South Park, he uses a wheelchair and can only shout his name, mainly loudly and uncontrollably.",
      "Growing up at the show\u2019s initial peak during the turn of the millennium, Timmy followed me through school corridors, classrooms and playgrounds - no matter my friends, sociability or relatively good grades.",
      "Now, in my 30s, he\u2019s back. For the third time in a year, this time heading to my local train station in my wheelchair, I hear the familiar, brutish drawl: \u201cTimmaaah.\u201d",
      "A laugh. A snigger. An assumption I either won\u2019t hear or be unable to understand.",
      "When I confront the group of boys, one feigns innocence, claiming he\u2019d been speaking to his friend.",
      "\u201cYou weren\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cI was watching the show before you were born.\u201d",
      "Initially I was baffled as to how this phenomenon had returned to a new young generation, 24 years after the character first appeared.",
      "The answer lies in social media, particularly TikTok, where hundreds of short user-edited clips of Timmy and audio of him saying his name are sparking the revival.",
      "TikTok users often take part in trends by using the audio of popular videos and overlaying it with their own clips.",
      "That\u2019s what many have done with Timmy, where the name is used as a punchline, or played on top of unrelated clips of wheelchair users, reinforcing harmful and dehumanising stereotypes.",
      "The irony is that the character Timmy is presented with warmth in South Park and given character depth by co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.",
      "An equal in the show\u2019s unflinching satire, his disability isn\u2019t necessarily the butt of the joke.",
      "Timmy is an accepted member of the class: he fails to complete homework, faces adversity and causes trouble with his disabled best friend Jimmy. His personality is conveyed through the different intonations in which he delivers his name.",
      "One episode, Timmy 2000, sees him win a battle of the bands as frontman for a metal group. The adult characters are shown to respond in an over-protective and condescending way - a striking criticism of the way society often treats disabled people.",
      "Nearly 20 years ago, a poll by Ouch! - the former name of the BBC\u2019s disability section - crowned Timmy as the most popular disabled TV character.",
      "Seattle Times\u2019 late disabled critic Jeff Shannon described Timmy as the most \u201cprogressive, provocative and socially relevant disability humour ever presented on American television\u201d.",
      "\u201cWithout telling viewers what to think, South Park challenges [the audience\u2019s] own fears and foibles regarding disability, and Timmy emerges triumphant,\u201d he wrote in 2005.",
      "In interviews Stone and Parker have spoken of how carefully and purposefully they integrated him into the show.",

      "Screening men born with a high risk of developing prostate cancer, once they reach the age of 45, makes financial sense, a cancer charity says.",

      "There is no prostate cancer screening programme in the UK, unlike those for breast, bowel and cervical cancer.",

      "Following his recent terminal cancer diagnosis, Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy has called for more, younger men to be tested - including those with a family history of the disease - and the government has asked the NHS to examine the evidence again.",
      "Oliver Kemp, head of the charity Prostate Cancer Research, said the current system is not working.",
      "He told the BBC's Today Programme: \"Not everyone is even aware that they have a prostate, never mind that they are at higher risk.",
      "\"Not as many people are turning up to their doctors as they should be.\"",
      "The BBC's Inside Health has been looking at the issue.",
      "More men dying",
      "The debate around prostate screening revolves around an imperfect test and the trade-off between finding some men\u2019s aggressive cancers earlier and the harms of diagnosing and treating slow-growing tumours that would never have affected a man\u2019s health or lifespan.",
      "The case for and against is constantly reviewed in the UK, with the most recent report from the National Screening Committee, in 2020, saying the harms were too great.",
      "Further updates are expected this year.",
      "Despite more men dying from prostate cancer than women from breast cancer, there is no reliable test for the disease.",
      "The blood test men over 50 can request from their GP measures prostate-specific antigen (PSA), released by the prostate, a small gland located below the bladder involved in the production of semen.",
      "But PSA levels can be high for a variety of reasons - including an enlarged prostate, inflammation or infection, recent vigorous exercise or sex - or remain normal despite cancer.",
      "What are the symptoms of prostate cancer?",
      "I'm more grateful for each day - Sir Chris Hoy",
      "And there are many different kinds of prostate cancer - not all deadly.",
      "\"There are prostate cancers that are so slow-growing that they will not affect a man's lifespan,\" GP Dr Margaret McCartney says.",
      "These are found in one in three men over 50.",
      "\"And then you have a small number of very aggressive prostate cancers which do move quickly and cause harm,\" Dr McCartney says.",
      "Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and a tissue biopsy can help  narrow down which men have cancer and need treatment - but some still end up being treated for something that would never cause a problem.",
      "\"Far more men have tests done to try to work out what kind of prostate cancer it is, than are going to benefit from it - there's the problem,\" Dr McCartney says.",
      "Conflicting results",
      "Clinical trials have produced conflicting results about screening.",
      "One, in Europe, says it saves lives.",
      "Another, in the UK, shows a more marginal benefit.",
      "And a third, in the US, says it does not.",
      "Prof Hashim Ahmed, chair of urology at Imperial College London, says: \u201cWe need to screen 570 men to prevent one death - that\u2019s a lot of men to counsel.\u201d",
      "Screening means aggressive cancers can be treated before symptoms appear.",
      "But trials show there are harms to testing large numbers of healthy men - and once a cancer is spotted, even a low-risk one, it needs to be followed up.",
      "Many men with a low-risk cancer are simply monitored or begin \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d - but a cancer diagnosis and the invasive tests it involves have a psychological impact.",
      "One in 10 of these men opts for radical surgery rather than live with the anxiety of wondering whether their cancer will grow, Prof Ahmed says.",
      "But this can leave them unable to maintain an erection - and a third spend the rest of their life needing a pad because they leak urine.",
      "\u201cAt the age of 47-48, if we're talking about testing and diagnosing men at that age, that's two or three decades of those kinds of symptoms,\" Prof Ahmed told BBC Radio 4's Inside Health programme.",
      "\"So I would rather avoid finding low-risk disease.\u201d",
      "Much research in the field has focused on refining the process to minimise the harms of screening.",
      "And Prof Ahmed is running the Transform trial, starting next year, to compare the most promising technologies.",
      "But the results could be 10 years away.",
      "In the meantime, Prostate Cancer Research's report says, screening 45-69-year-olds at high risk - black men and those with a family history of the disease or particular gene mutations - would deliver an economic benefit, after factoring in the cost of treatment and the impact on working lives and carers.",
      "\"Finding and treating cancers early outweighs the harms of over-treatment by four times,\" the charity's chief executive, Oliver Kemp, says.",

    "story": [
      "Boris Johnson\u2019s government blocked a request to fund another 10,000 hospital beds at the height of the Covid pandemic, the chief executive of NHS England has said.",
      "Amanda Pritchard told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry the decision, made by the Treasury in July 2020, had been \u201cvery disappointing\u201d.",
      "Extra beds and staff would have been used to cut waiting lists for planned care and \u201cbuild resilience\u201d going into a second winter wave of the pandemic, she said.",
      "The government has said it cannot comment while the inquiry is in progress.",
      "Health ministers from the time are expected to give evidence later this month, to the third section of the inquiry, looking at Covid's impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across the UK.",
      "Ms Pritchard served as NHS England\u2019s chief operating officer from 2019 until she was promoted to chief executive, in August 2021.",
      "In her evidence, she said a request had been made to the government, for 10,000 extra permanent, staffed hospital beds, in July 2020.",
      "\u2018Very disappointing\u2019",
      "The demand had been based on modelling the spread of the virus, along with the need to deal with other pressures that coming winter and resume more planned, or elective, surgery and other treatments for non-Covid patients.",
      "But the inquiry heard the Treasury and the prime minister\u2019s private office had refused the request, saying they wanted more use made of temporary Nightingale hospitals along with the private sector.",
      "And Ms Prichard had been told the decision would be looked at again as part of a wider spending review expected in the autumn of 2021.",
      "She called the decision \u201cvery disappointing\u201d, saying waiting lists for planned NHS treatment in England would be in \u201cquite a different position\u201d today had the extra funding been agreed.",
      "\u201cIf we had had that capacity, we could certainly have treated thousands more patients\u2026 as well as being more resilient going into the second wave of the pandemic and into winter more generally,\u201d Ms Prichard said.",
      "In the summer of 2020, the NHS in England had a total permanent bed capacity to treat about 95,000 patients in acute hospitals.",
      "That was increased by another 4,000 from winter 2023, under a recovery plan agreed by then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.",
      "\u2018Completely overwhelming\u2019",
      "Later in her evidence, Ms Pritchard said the health service had faced a period of \u201cextreme pressure\u201d in the winter of 2020-21, as another wave of Covid spread across the country.",
      "By that point, new treatments had been discovered, including the cheap steroid dexamethasone, and the first Covid vaccines were starting to be rolled out in small numbers.",
      "But the level of community transmission at the time meant some intensive-care units were still being pushed \u201cto the brink\u201d and were \u201cright on the edge\u201d of running out of bed space.",
      "Nationally, the health service had never had to \u201csystematically limit\u201d access to treatments because hospitals could not cope with demand, Ms Pritchard said.",
      "\u201cThat does not mean, though, that it did not feel completely overwhelming to staff at this time in those places - and it does not mean that the kind of care that was being provided was anything like normal,\u201d she added.",
      "'Field hospitals'",
      "Ms Pritchard was also asked about the seven temporary Nightingale hospitals built quickly, in March and April 2020, across England to treat Covid patients.",
      "Data seen by the inquiry shows the total cost to the taxpayer, including setting up and decommissioning, is now estimated at \u00a3358.5m.",
      "The hospitals \u2013 in Birmingham, Bristol, Exeter, Harrogate, London, Manchester and Sunderland \u2013 treated 141 Covid patients in the first wave of the virus and 1,097 Covid and other patients in the second wave.",
      "In total, \u00a350.4m was spent on one site, Birmingham, which was never used by patients in the pandemic.",
      "The site in Bristol also carried out 6,554 assessments for patients from the eye hospital in the city.",
      "Ms Pritchard told the inquiry the programme had still been \u201cuseful\u201d, as the sites had been envisaged as \u201cmilitary field hospitals\u201d at the time.",

      "A report found \"corners [were] cut\" so the site could be acquired quickly to house asylum seekers despite an assessment deeming it \"high risk\".",
      "The Home Office said the report related to the last government's actions and it remained \"committed to ending the use of hotels\".",
      "In December 2022, then-prime minister Rishi Sunak delivered a statement in Parliament in which he vowed to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers, saying that the government would \"work to achieve this as quickly as possible\".",
      "In its report, the NAO said the statement \"generated significant pressure within the Home Office to identify and secure sites for asylum accommodation at pace\".",
      "It added that, the following January, a decision to acquire Northeye was taken by a small group of ministers and officials from across Whitehall, despite the \"technical due diligence and approvals process not having been undertaken\".",

      "The Treasury said there would be no change or mitigations to the policy, which will see an end to inheritance tax exemption for some farms.",
      "From April 2026, farms worth more than \u00a31m will face an effective inheritance tax rate of 20% - half the usual rate of 40%.",

      "Defra suggested softening the policy to exempt some older people, possibly those over the age of 80.",
      "The April 2026 start for the policy means they may not have time to make use of existing rules to skip inheritance tax by passing on an asset seven years before death.",
      "But this suggestion has been dismissed by the Treasury, which said it had taken \"a fair and balanced approach\".",
      "Since its introduction in 1984, agricultural property relief (APR) has allowed small family farms \u2013 including land used for crops or rearing animals, as well as farm buildings, cottages and houses - to be exempt from inheritance tax.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 18:34:15 GMT",
    "summary": "The PM insists the government will not \"tell people how to live their lives\" in achieving the aim.",
    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has announced fresh climate change targets at a global summit, saying he wants the UK to lead on cutting emissions.",
      "The UK will now aim for an 81% cut in its emissions by 2035, he told the UN conference of parties (COP29) in Azerbaijan.",
      "The target updates a 78% pledge by 2035 under the previous Conservative government, although that also included international aviation and shipping emissions, and goes beyond another pledge of a 68% reduction by 2030.",
      "Sir Keir insisted the government would not \"tell people how to live their lives\" but the target was vital to the UK's future prosperity and energy security.",
      "Climate talks open in shadow of Trump victory",
      "What is COP29 and how will Trump\u2019s election affect the climate talks?",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "The prime minister said the new target was based on recommendations from the UK's independent climate change committee (CCC) aimed at limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to levels in 1990.",
      "He was one of only seven G20 leaders attending the summit, with 13 absentees including the premiers of the US, China, France and Germany.",
      "Sir Keir would not be drawn on his views about president-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to cut climate rules during his election campaign.",
      "He said: \"Make no mistake, the race is on for the clean energy jobs of the future, the economy of tomorrow, and I don't want to be in the middle of the pack - I want to get ahead of the game\".",
      "The target will be included in papers to go before Parliament before February and, although Sir Keir did not announce any new policies, he did commit to continuing to provide \u00a311.6bn of climate finance until March 2026, a pledge made under the previous government.",
      "Announcing a \u00a31bn investment in a wind turbine project in Hull, which he said would create 1,300 local jobs, Sir Keir said the world was standing at a \"critical juncture in the climate crisis\".",
      "The UK has called for other countries to match the new target, following stark warnings from the United Nations that the world is on course for a 3.1C rise without further cuts.",
      "The latest target is broadly in line with the UK\u2019s legally-binding carbon-cutting path towards net zero emissions by 2050, contained in the 2015 Paris Agreement.",
      "That international agreement ties the UK to ratcheting up new \"nationally determined contributions\" (NDCs) for carbon reduction every five years, which has seen the a 68% cut by 2030 increase to an 81% cut by 2035.",
      "The Climate Change Act 2008 also set legally-binding domestic agreements on carbon budgets in five year chunks until 2050, which unlike the NDC targets also include international aviation and shipping emissions.",
      "The latest of these is the sixth carbon budget, which runs between 2033-2037, and has already been set at 78%.",
      "Since taking power in July, Labour has ended an effective ban on new onshore wind projects and pledged not to issue any new oil and gas exploration licenses in the North Sea, as well as closing the UK's last coal power plant in September.",
      "The switch towards greener energy has already halved the UK's annual greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 - but the CCC has previously said further reductions will be difficult without lifestyle changes.",
      "The government advisers said taxes on meat and dairy might be needed if people do not voluntarily reduce their consumption of the products, and there should be moves to phase out the use of petrol cars.",
      "Speaking at the summit, Sir Keir said the new UK target would be \"difficult\" but \"achievable\", and he wanted government to \"tread lightly on people's lives\".",
      "\"It\u2019s not about telling people how to live their lives \u2013 I\u2019m not interested in that,\" he added.",
      "\"I am interested in making sure their energy bills are stable, that we\u2019ve got energy independence, and that we also along the way pick up the next generation of jobs.\"",
      "However, shadow energy secretary Claire Coutinho claimed the new target would lead to \"hardship\" for the British people.",
      "During energy questions in the Commons, Coutinho said making \"already stringent carbon emission targets even higher\" would require a \"shift away from meat and dairy\" and \"less travel\".",
      "The Conservative MP claimed the approach would \"see our reliance on Chinese imports - a country which is 60% powered by coal - go through the roof\".",
      "In response, energy minister Kerry McCarthy said: \"It's really important that we are stepping up and showing global ambition.",
      "\"Reaching net zero in this country and getting to clean power by 2030 is a massive opportunity - it is not a cost.\"",
      "The interim chair of the CCC, Professor Piers Forster, welcomed the new target and said it was feasible based on the latest science, technological developments, and the UK\u2019s national circumstances.",
      "\"Our analysis shows that this is a feasible target that will support jobs and investment,\" he said, adding the UK was currently running behind schedule on delivering its 2030 target of 68% cuts.",
      "He added: \"A target is only as meaningful as the delivery against it.",
      "\"The UK needs to get back on track to deliver against our existing 2030 NDC commitment.",
      "\"We need to see further urgent action to speed up deployment of low-carbon solutions such as electric vehicles, heat pumps, and tree planting.\"",
      "All countries who have signed up to the Paris Agreement should submit their latest carbon reduction targets by a deadline of February next year and a copy of that memo, known as the Information to facilitate Clarity, Transparency and Understanding (ICTU), will be presented to MPs before then."

    "story": [
      "Financially troubled Thurrock Council is considering legal claims against more than 20 other local authorities.",
      "The unitary council in south Essex became effectively bankrupt two years ago after it borrowed and invested hundreds of millions and racked up a \u00a31.5bn debt.",
      "It received valuations for its solar investments from the Association for Public Service Excellence (APSE), which is owned by local councils.",
      "Thurrock \"believes that valuations of the solar assets undertaken by APSE, which they allowed the council to rely on, were negligent and overvalued those assets\". APSE said it \"entirely rejected\" Thurrock's statement that valuations \"led to significant financial losses to Thurrock with negative impact on taxpayers\".",
      "The councils that face being sued include Luton, Southampton, Cardiff, South Tyneside, Preston, Wolverhampton and Hertfordshire, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (full list at the bottom of this story).",
      "Mo Baines, chief executive of APSE, said this would lead to \"significant legal costs on other councils which we believe has no merit\".",
      "APSE provides advice to local authorities and warned if Thurrock proceeded it could end up affecting all 250 councils in the UK as co-defendants. Seeking independent legal advice could cost each council around \u00a325,000, according to APSE.",
      "Ms Baines said she \"remains hopeful there is a positive resolution\" but told the BBC that Thurrock's action would mean \"other councils become embroiled\" in paying for their financial failure.",
      "She questioned whether \"council taxpayers of Norwich to Northumberland take a hit for the losses of a council they have had nothing to do with?\".",

    "summary": "The chancellor says she wants to \u201cfire up the UK\u2019s economy\u201d with a \"Canadian-style\" pensions model.",
    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",
      "Individually, the UK\u2019s 86 local government pension schemes vary in size, from Greater Manchester\u2019s massive \u00a330bn fund all the way down to several schemes which are \u201csub-\u00a31bn\u201d, according to Joanne Donnelly, board secretary at the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs, which can build up \u2013 last year, they increased by \u00a328m.",
      "Like her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who also announced plans for a Canadian-style model, the chancellor believes consolidation would save money.",
      "That would in turn \u201cdeliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment\u201d.",
      "Other chancellors have aimed to make similar moves, including George Osborne who, in 2015, set out plans for local government schemes to pool resources,",
      "Does everyone agree with the idea?",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC: \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",
      "However, some argue megafunds would not invest so much in smaller projects while some claim the changes could bring risks for pension savers.",
      "\"Conflating a government goal of driving investment in the UK and people\u2019s retirement outcomes brings a danger because the risks are all taken with members\u2019 money,\" said Tom Selby at investment platform AJ Bell.",
      "He said the current system encourages trustees to deliver the best outcome for members rather than focus on UK-wide economic growth, which might mean investing outside the UK.",
      "Others question whether there are enough big UK projects to invest in.",
      "\"Large funds need substantial, reliable projects to generate returns, but the market may struggle to offer enough of these opportunities, especially in the infrastructure sector,\" said Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at wealth manager Quilter."

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 07:43:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Labour government is expected to make major changes to the Right To Buy scheme launched in the 1980s.",
    "story": [
      "When Harold Wilson was Labour prime minister in the late 1960s, up to a third of people in England lived in a council house or flat.",
      "But by the time Keir Starmer became prime minister in July this year, the proportion of people in England living in social housing had fallen to about 16% of the population \u2013 about four million.",
      "About two million council-built properties have been sold to their tenants at significantly discounted prices under the Right To Buy (RTB) scheme since it was introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government in the early 1980s.",
      "Michael Heseltine described the advent of RTB as \"laying the foundations of one of the most important social revolutions of the century\", but was selling off council houses more cheaply than new ones could be built simply laying the foundations of a housing crisis?",
      "Waiting lists",
      "Historically, money raised from selling off council houses has not gone far towards building new ones - new ones desperately needed, considering about 1.3 million people are on waiting lists for them in England.",
      "Across the north-west of England, for example, about 4,350 council houses have been sold off in the last 10 years, with the money made from the sales going towards building or buying just over 1,400 others, according to government data.",
      "While the \u00a3336,612,000 raised from those sales may sound a reasonable sum, it works out on average at about \u00a377,000 per house. And, generally, councils have not been allowed to keep the whole amount, instead having to hand a sizeable chunk back to the government.",
      "About 200,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing in the region.",
      "While housing associations may have built homes, and there may have been schemes funded by cash from other government pots, the fact that the money raised from selling off homes is nowhere near enough to rebuild or buy like-for-like has been a long-standing concern.",
      "And it would seem Labour deputy prime minister and minister for housing Angela Rayner \u2013 who famously bought her own council house in Stockport under RTB \u2013 has taken on board the views of RTB critics.",
      "Rayner has said recently she may impose restrictions so that people who move into newly built council houses will not be able to buy them in the future.",
      "It is a decision that is likely to be welcomed by Labour politicians in regions where the need for social housing is arguably as great as ever, but the amount of it available is very low.",
      "The Labour metro-mayors of both Liverpool and Manchester regions have both said they want to see more social housing built in their regions.",
      "In May, Andy Burnham, leader of Greater Manchester, called on the-then Conservative government to pause RTB on new builds after losing 500 social homes to the scheme in 2022.",
      "He argued that if planned homes could be bought by their tenants, it would be \"like trying to fill a bath without the plug in\".",
      "On Merseyside, virtually all former council housing stock was transferred to housing associations over the last two decades.",
      "But metro mayor Steve Rotheram says registered social landlords (RSLs) have inherited some of the problems that came with RTB.",
      "He says one Merseyside RSL had lost about a third of its homes through sales to tenants in the decade since the housing stock was transferred.",
      "People who are tenants of RSLs can buy their homes under \u201cpreserved\u201d RTB if they lived in their homes when the council owned them.",
      "And once someone has lived in an RSL property for three years, they can apply for the Right To Acquire.",
      "Rotheram says cheaper borrowing rates for RSLs and a moratorium on sales would help boost growth in social housing.",
      "\"You are not going to build a lot of houses for someone to come along in three or four years and buy it below market value,\" he says.",
      "\"How we deal with this is part of our growth plan going to the government, and we are now trying to see if we can work with [Rayner] to come up with proposals.\"",
      "Blackpool Council\u2019s cabinet member for economy and the built environment, Mark Smith, is clear that while the money generated from RTB sales is used to support various investments in housing, the RTB receipts his council receives are \"not sufficient to replace lost social rent housing\".",
      "And he says even with changes such as the government giving councils more flexibility to allow RTB receipts to be used alongside cash from other streams such as funds given by developers who get planning permission for private schemes, there is still some red tape in the way of using different types of funding together to build council housing.",
      "\"We do the best we can within the parameters of the policy as it exists currently but there is always room for improvement,\" he says.",
      "Under the new Labour government policies, councils and housing associations are being given \u201cmore freedom\u201d to decide how to use their RTB money.",
      "Previously, only 50% of the money a council received from a sale could go towards building or buying a new house.",
      "But in future councils will be able to use all that money, and put money received from private developers handed over as part of planning agreements into projects as well.",
      "These deals, known as Section 106 agreements, see developers give money to councils to mitigate any negative impacts their private schemes might have on local communities or housing markets.",
      "Sources within the social housing sector say that in the past the \"policy has never achieved anything like a one-for-one replacement ratio\".",
      "\"If it had then there would be a lot less concern about the policy,\" one says.",
      "\"Yes, a Right To Buy home continues to be a home after it\u2019s sold, but it contributes to a huge loss of social housing stock and contributes to housing waiting lists, or people having to live in unsuitable accommodation.\"",
      "'Serious shortage'",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, says there is a \"serious housing shortage in this country\" and \"record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation\".",
      "Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, says: \u201cWhile the Right To Buy can and has delivered home ownership for many the scheme in its current form does not work.",
      "\"Rising discounts, alongside other measures that restrict councils\u2019 use of Right To Buy receipts, mean that the money raised from the sale of property is usually not sufficient to cover the building costs of replacing the property.",
      "\"We have long called for the removal of rules and restrictions which disincentivise local authorities from building social homes, at risk of losing them.",
      "\"Councils must be given the control, power and flexibility to use receipt monies in a way that works best for their local areas, which includes retaining 100 per cent of the receipts permanently.\"",
      "'Scandal'",
      "In 2012, the Conservative-led government increased the discount a tenant could receive when buying their home.",
      "Since coming to power, Labour has said the discount will be reduced to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000, depending on the location \u2013 a significant reduction from the \u00a3136,000 discount currently available in London and the discount of just over \u00a3100,000 elsewhere.",
      "Rayner, who bought her Stockport council house under a RTB discount in 2007 and sold it several years later for \u00a348,000 more than she paid for it, said she wanted to see a \u201cfairer\u201d system.",
      "Her department says it is a \"scandal\" that only about one third of homes lost to RTB have been replaced since 2012, and that it was \"working at pace to reverse the continued decline of social rented homes\".",
      "But while the government stresses there are \"no plans to abolish the RTB\", the \"social revolution\" Lord Heseltine heralded nearly 45 years ago is clearly facing a radical change to everything but its name.",

    "summary": "Marine scientist uncovers the story behind Andruha's escape from Russian military training programme.",
    "story": [
      "The mystery as to why a beluga whale appeared off the coast of Norway wearing a harness may finally have been solved.",
      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

      "The planet Uranus and its five biggest moons may not be the dead sterile worlds that scientists have long thought.",
      "Instead, they may have oceans, and the moons may even be capable of supporting life, scientists say.",
      "Much of what we know about them was gathered by Nasa\u2019s Voyager 2 spacecraft which visited nearly 40 years ago.",
      "But a new analysis shows that Voyager's visit coincided with a powerful solar storm, which led to a misleading idea of what the Uranian system is really like.",
      "Uranus is a beautiful, icy ringed world in the outer reaches of our solar system. It is among the coldest of all the planets. It is also tilted on its side compared to all the other worlds \u2013 as if it had been knocked over \u2013 making it arguably the weirdest.",
      "We got our first close-up look at it in 1986, when Voyager 2 flew past and sent back sensational pictures of the planet and its five major moons.",
      "But what amazed scientists even more was the data Voyager 2 sent back indicating that the Uranian system was even weirder than they thought.",
      "The measurements from the spacecraft\u2019s instruments indicated that the planets and moons were inactive, unlike the other moons in the outer solar system. They also showed that Uranus\u2019s protective magnetic field was strangely distorted. It was squashed and pushed away from the Sun.",
      "A planet\u2019s magnetic field traps any gases and other material coming off the planet and its moons. These might be from oceans or geological activity. Voyager 2 found none, suggesting that Uranus and its five largest moons were sterile and inactive.",
      "This came as an enormous surprise because it was unlike the solar system\u2019s other planets and their moons.",
      "But the new analysis has solved the decades-long mystery. It shows that Voyager 2 flew past on a bad day.",
      "The new research shows that just as Voyager 2 flew past Uranus, the Sun was raging, creating a powerful solar wind that might have blown the material away and temporarily distorted the magnetic field.",
      "So, for 40 years we have had an incorrect view of what Uranus and its five largest moons are normally like, according to Dr William Dunn of University College London.",
      "\u201cThese results suggest that the Uranian system could be much more exciting than previously thought. There could be moons there that could have the conditions that are necessary for life, they might have oceans below the surface that could be teeming with fish!\u201d.",
      "Linda Spilker was a young scientist working on the Voyager programme when the Uranus data came in. She is now still serving as the project scientist for the Voyager missions. She said that she was delighted to hear about the new results, which have been published in the Journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\u201cThe results are fascinating, and I am really excited to see that there is potential for life in the Uranian system,\u201d she told BBC News.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also so pleased that so much is being done with the Voyager data. It\u2019s amazing that scientists are looking back at the data we collected in 1986 and finding new results and new discoveries\u201d.",
      "Dr Affelia Wibisono of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, who is independent of the research team, described the results as \u201cvery exciting\u201d.",
      "\u201cIt shows how important it is to look back at old data, because sometimes, hiding behind them is something new to be discovered, which can help us design the next generation of space exploration missions\u201d.",
      "Which is exactly what Nasa is doing, partly as a result of the new research.",
      "It has been nearly 40 years since Voyager 2 last flew past the icy world and its moons. Nasa has plans to launch a new mission, the Uranus Orbiter and Probe, to go back for a closer look in 10 years\u2019 time.",
      "According to Nasa\u2019s Dr Jamie Jasinski, whose idea it was to re-examine the Voyager 2 data, the mission will need to take his results into account when designing its instruments and planning the scientific survey.",
      "\u201cSome of the instruments for the future spacecraft are very much being designed with ideas from what we learned from Voyager 2 when it flew past the system when it was experiencing an abnormal event. So we need to rethink how exactly we are going to design the instruments on the new mission so that we can best capture the science we need to make discoveries\u201d.",
      "Nasa\u2019s Uranus probe is expected to arrive by 2045, which is when scientists hope to find out whether these far-flung icy moons, once thought of as being dead worlds, might have the possibility of being home to life."

    "summary": "Britain's oldest satellite is in the wrong part of the sky, but no-one's really sure who moved it.",
    "story": [
      "Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why.",
      "Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.",
      "When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.",
      "But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.",
      "Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.",
      "Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?",
      "It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.",
      "\"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.",
      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",
      "But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.",
      "UK military satellite launches to boost space power",
      "MoD contracts Airbus for Skynet telecoms satellite",
      "How do we solve the problem of space debris?",
      "What we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket.",
      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",
      "Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.",
      "Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.",
      "\"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated.",
      "The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.",
      "But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\".",
      "This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.",
      "Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.",
      "Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.",
      "At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.",
      "That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort.",
      "The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.",
      "Ultimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location.",
      "Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space.",
      "Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A.",

      "He laundered the stolen cryptocurrency with the help of his wife Heather Morgan, who used the alias Razzlekhan to promote her hip hop music.",
      "At the time of the theft, the bitcoin was worth around $70m (\u00a355.3m), but had risen in value to more than $4.5bn by the time they were arrested. At today's prices they would be worth more than double that.",

      "According court documents, Lichtenstein used advanced hacking tools and techniques to hack into Bitfinex.",
      "Following the hack, he enlisted Morgan's help to launder the stolen funds.",
      "They \"employed numerous sophisticated laundering techniques\", the Department of Justice said in a statement.",
      "The methods included using fictitious identities, switching the funds into different cryptocurrencies and buying gold coins.",
      "Lichtenstein, who was born in Russia but grew up in the US, would then meet couriers while on family trips and move the laundered money back home, prosecutors said.",
      "Morgan's Razzlekhan persona went viral on social media when the case emerged.",
      "Even as the couple attempted to cover up the hack, she published dozens of expletive-filled music videos and rap songs filmed in locations around New York.",
      "In her lyrics she called herself a \"bad-ass money maker\" and \"the crocodile of Wall Street\".",
      "In articles published in Forbes magazine, Morgan also claimed to be a successful technology businesswoman, calling herself an \"economist, serial entrepreneur, software investor and rapper\"."

      "The past two years have also seen mass lay-offs from some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Xbox makers Microsoft and Sony, which makes PlayStation, following a period of record growth and profits during the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "Rachel Watts, games journalist and co-host of the Indieventure Podcast, believes the announcement is a reflection of a wider movement from companies towards announcing their games online.",
      "\"Now that bigger gaming companies are running their own digital events, there's no reason for them to spend time, money, and resources on being present at in-person events.\"",

      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",

      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",

      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",

      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",

    "summary": "It can be hard to find good advice on how to make homes more energy efficient.",
    "story": [
      "When Simon Duffy gets another energy bill, his heart sinks. \u201cIt\u2019s madly expensive,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Duffy lives in a traditional stone-walled detached house in Sheffield. He estimates that he spends \u00a33,100 every year on heating and electricity.",
      "Despite being someone who cares about climate change, and keen to retrofit his property to make it more efficient, there\u2019s a problem.",
      "\u201cThe whole question of how to better insulate the house is a real mystery to me,\u201d says Mr Duffy, a director of sustainability think-tank Citizen Network. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the expertise for that is.\u201d He also adds that he\u2019s also not sure whether he could install solar panels, given that he lives in a conservation area.",
      "Millions of homeowners across the country could be facing the same dilemma.",
      "Around 29 million British homes require retrofitting by 2050, according to the UK Green Building Council, an industry body.",
      "Retrofitting might involve measures such as improving your home\u2019s insulation, upgrading the heating system, or installing energy-generating devices such as solar panels, or even a private wind turbine.",
      "These adjustments can cost thousands of pounds up front, but, if properly executed, they could improve comfort and reduce people\u2019s bills in the long-run.",
      "Plus, increased energy efficiency ought to cut carbon emissions from homes, especially if property owners switch away from gas or oil-fired boilers, for example.",
      "Roughly one fifth of the UK\u2019s total emissions comes from residential buildings.",
      "Amy Peace and her husband live in the northwest of England, near Warrington. The pair both work in sustainability, advising businesses on their path to net zero.",
      "They were keen to improve the quality of their home and apply the principles they promote at work to their own lives \u2013 but they too faced challenges when deciding on how to go about it.",
      "\u201cEven though we\u2019ve got this background, and we\u2019re engineers as well, what we weren\u2019t entirely clear on was where was best to spend the money,\u201d says Mrs Peace.",
      "The couple spoke to multiple consultants, but Mrs Peace found the advice they received was often geared towards meeting Passivhaus standards \u2013 an ultra-energy efficient type of building.",
      "\u201cThere weren\u2019t many in that pragmatic middle space where you are literally saying, \u2018We\u2019ve got this much money, where would we be best putting it?\u2019,\u201d Mrs Peace adds.",
      "Perseverance during the past three years paid off, however, and the couple\u2019s 1930\u2019s detached house now has improved insulation, a heat pump, and an electric car charging point. Solar panels and battery will follow shortly, if all goes to plan.",
      "Conscious of the confusion around approaches to retrofit, some organisations are moving to improve the advice available to homeowners. Among them is Ecofurb.",
      "\u201cWe can model all the different options that are available, suitable for your home and your budget, and identify a package of measures,\u201d says Liz Lain\u00e9, of Parity Projects, a housing data analysis company, which runs Ecofurb.",
      "The firm offers this initial consultation for free, but full plans, with personalised input from a retrofit coordinator, start at \u00a3470. Ecofurb can also oversee any works as they are carried out by contractors to avoid \u201chorror stories\u201d, says Ms Lain\u00e9.",
      "There are many other organisations that offer to help homeowners plan a retrofit.",
      "The work often involves carrying out a heat-loss survey, to spot cold areas that require insulation, and to better understand a property\u2019s heating demand. Experts might also advise on the suitability of solar panels for your home, for example.",
      "There\u2019s the Get a Heat Pump website, launched by the charities Nesta and The MCS Foundation, which explains what heat pumps are and how they might fit into a home renovation plan.",
      "RICS, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, has also just launched a new retrofit standard for its members \u2013 essentially, it encourages surveyors with the appropriate training to offer their services to homeowners planning or undergoing a retrofit.",
      "The RICS website will soon include a range of retrofit advice and a tool to help homeowners find a suitable surveyor in their local area, says Steve Lees, from the RICS retrofit project team.",
      "Improving the energy efficiency of homes is \u201cessential\u201d for decarbonisation, says Gerald Charles, head of housing retrofit at the Centre for Sustainable Energy, but he adds that the current lack of good advice remains a genuine problem.",
      "\u201cThe industry as a whole don\u2019t appreciate the importance of good retrofit advice,\u201d he says.",
      "One entrepreneur who has noticed a knowledge gap in the market is James Major, founder and chief executive of HubbPro, which helps architects plan energy efficient buildings. Architects don\u2019t always have the latest information about how to incorporate energy-saving technologies into their designs, notes Mr Major.",
      "\u201cClean tech isn\u2019t part of what they do or what they should know \u2013 that\u2019s an engineering function,\u201d he says. And yet architects\u2019 clients increasingly ask about such tech when planning a new home or an extension.",
      "Through an initiative called MyHubb, Mr Major is now offering architects detailed reports that estimate the carbon reduction potential and payback period on retrofitted measures - such as heat pump-based heating systems or solar panels, for instance.",
      "He says these reports cost around \u00a31,000, though he adds that this price is not yet finalised.",
      "Mr Duffy says he will keep looking for solutions to his own retrofit conundrum. But he makes another point. So much of the currently available technology and advice is tailored to individual homeowners.",
      "He suggests that neighbourhood-scale schemes, for example to provide solar power to a whole street, might make more sense and could include more people in one go.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what I would think is the logical way of thinking about this,\u201d he says.",

      "The Paris climate agreement, signed in 2015, outlines a long-term plan to rein in rising temperatures, as countries strive to keep that rise under 1.5C this century.",
      "They have also agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, and to treble renewable power by 2030.",
      "But while the authors of this letter recognise these achievements, they feel that the slow-moving COP process is \u201cno longer fit for purpose\u201d in dealing with a fast-moving climate crisis.",
      "\"Its current structure simply cannot deliver the change at exponential speed and scale, which is essential to ensure a safe climate landing for humanity,\" said its signatories. They include former UN Secretary General Ban-Ki Moon, former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres and former president of Ireland Mary Robinson.",

      "COP29 chief exec filmed promoting fossil fuel deals",
      "At the start of COP29, the country\u2019s authoritarian leader, Ilham Aliyev, defended Azerbaijan\u2019s current exports of gas and plans to expand production by a third in the next decade.",

      "Such strongly expressed views are extremely rare from the leader of a COP host, where the aim is to build consensus on how to tackle rising temperatures.",
      "The authors of the letter are also concerned by the selection process for hosting COPs. Azerbaijan followed on from another major oil producer, the United Arab Emirates, which held the conference in Dubai last year.",
      "\u201cAt the last COP, fossil fuel lobbyists outnumbered representatives of scientific institutions, Indigenous communities and vulnerable nations,\" said former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres.",

      "At the time of the theft, the bitcoin was worth around $70m (\u00a355.3m), but had risen in value to more than $4.5bn by the time they were arrested. At today's prices they would be worth more than double that.",

      "Dissanayake, who was elected in September, needed a clear majority to deliver his promise to combat corruption and restore stability after the island's worst-ever economic crisis.",
      "The high cost of living was one of the key issues for many voters.",
      "Analysts had expected the NPP to do well in the elections but what remained to be determined was the margin of victory, and whether it would get the two-thirds majority it wanted to be able to pass its ambitious reforms.",
      "In the outgoing assembly, Dissanayake's Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) party, which now leads the NPP, had just three seats.",
      "The 55-year-old earlier told reporters that he believed this was \"a crucial election that will mark a turning point in Sri Lanka\".",
      "Sajith Premadasa, the man Dissanayake defeated in the presidential elections, led the opposition alliance.",

      "Disenchantment with established political players greatly helped the left-leaning Dissanayake during September's election. His party has traditionally backed strong state intervention and lower taxes, and campaigned for leftist economic policies.",
      "Dissanayake made history as Sri Lanka's first president to be elected with less than 50% of the vote. Many observers think his alliance will do better this time.",
      "How his alliance fares will be partly due to a fragmented opposition \u2013 with many leaders and parties breaking away into either smaller groups, or contesting as independent candidates.",
      "Observers say the JVP-led alliance ran a more vibrant campaign than the opposition.",
      "The coalition will now be under massive pressure to perform and live up to their campaign promises.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:46:38 GMT",
    "summary": "A new study finds that caste plays a vital role in high rates of stunting in children in India.",
    "story": [
      "Decades of caste discrimination have contributed to India having higher levels of child stunting rates than across Sub-Saharan Africa, new research has revealed.",
      "The two regions together are home to 44% of the world\u2019s under-five population but account for about 70% of stunted children globally - a key indicator of malnutrition.",
      "But, while both have made significant strides in recent years, India\u2019s rate stands at 35.7%, with the average across Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s 49 countries at 33.6%.",
      "A child is considered stunted when they fall short of the expected height for their age - a clear sign of critical nutritional gaps.",
      "However, the study by Ashwini Deshpande (Ashoka University) and Rajesh Ramachandran (Monash University, Malaysia) found that focusing only on the height gap - or why Indian children are shorter than children in Sub-Saharan Africa - overlooks an important factor: the crucial role of social identity, especially caste, in child malnutrition in India.",
      "The first 1,000 days of a child's life, often called the \"golden period\", are pivotal: by age two, 80% of the brain develops, laying the foundation for lifelong potential. In these early years, access to healthcare, good nutrition, early learning, and a safe environment profoundly shapes a child's future.",
      "India and Sub-Saharan Africa, both with rapidly growing middle classes, young populations and significant workforce potential, share longstanding comparisons. In 2021, the World Bank reported, \u201cSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [including India] account for over 85% of the global poor,\u201d underscoring similar challenges in poverty and development.",
      "Using official data, the authors looked at the most recent estimates of the stunting gaps between India and a sample of 19 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Official data shows that more than 35% of India\u2019s 137 million children under five are stunted, with over a third also underweight. Globally, 22% of children under five are stunted.",
      "Then they examined six broad socially disadvantaged groups in India. Among them are adivasis (tribespeople living in remote areas) and Dalits (formerly known as untouchables), who alone comprise more than a third of the under-five population.",
      "The economists found that children from higher-ranked, non-stigmatised caste groups in India stood at 27% - markedly lower than the Sub-Saharan African rate.",
      "They also found that children from higher-ranking caste groups in India are some 20% less likely to experience stunting compared with those from marginalised groups, who occupy the lowest tiers of the caste hierarchy.",
      "This conclusion remains significant even after accounting for factors like birth order, sanitation practices, maternal height, sibling count, education, anaemia and household socio-economic status.",
      "This difference is despite seven decades of affirmative action, India's caste system - a four-fold hierarchy of the Hindu religion - remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\u201cThis should not be surprising given that children from better-off groups in India have access to more calories and face a better disease environment,\u201d the authors say.",
      "The reasons behind high stunting rates among Indian children have sparked a complex debate over the years.",
      "Some economists have argued that the differences are genetic - that Indian children are genetically disposed to lower heights.",
      "Others believe that improved nutrition over generations has historically closed height gaps thought to be genetic.",
      "Some studies have found that girls fare worse than boys and others just the opposite, using different global standards.",
      "To be sure, stunting has decreased across social groups - a separate 2022 study found that improvements in health and nutrition interventions, household living conditions and maternal factors led to reduction in stunting in four Indian states. (More than half of India's under-five children were stunted, according to a federal family health survey of 1992-93).",
      "Children from marginalised groups like adivasis are likely to be more malnourished.",
      "In Africa, the rate of stunting has also fallen since 2010, although the absolute number increased.",
      "But what is clear is that children from poor families, with less-educated mothers, or from marginalised groups, are especially vulnerable to stunting in India.",
      "\u201cThe debate on the height gap between Indian and Sub-Saharan African children has resulted in overlooking the role of social identity, especially caste status,\u201d the authors say.",
      "\u201cThis is a crucial dimension to understanding the burden of child nutrition in India.\u201d",
      "The analysis uses data from demographic and health surveys. For India, it includes the latest data from 2019-21, and for Sub-Saharan Africa, it includes data from 19 countries with surveys from 2015 onwards. The dataset covers anthropometric - measurements related to the physical dimensions and composition of the human body- outcomes for 195,024 children under five in India and 202,557 children under five in Sub-Saharan Africa."

      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",

      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",

      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March.

As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",

      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",

      "Israel has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity by deliberately causing the mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, a report by Human Rights Watch (HRW) says.",
      "About 1.9 million people - 90% of Gaza\u2019s population - have fled their homes over the past year, and 79% of the territory is under Israeli-issued evacuation orders, according to the UN.",
      "HRW\u2019s report says this amounts to \u201cforcible transfer\u201d and that \u201cevidence shows it has been systematic and part of a state policy\u201d. It also says Israeli actions appear to \u201cmeet the definition of ethnic cleansing\u201d.",
      "Israel said the report was \"completely false and detached from reality\".",
      "\"Contrary to claims in HRW's report, Israel's efforts are directed solely at dismantling Hamas's terror capabilities and not at the people of Gaza,\" Oren Marmorstein, a spokesperson of Israel's ministry of foreign affairs posted on X.",
      "He added that Israel would \"continue to operate in accordance with the law of armed conflict\".",
      "HRW has also accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields by operating inside homes and civilian infrastructure.",
      "The report was published as Israeli forces continued a ground offensive in northern Gaza that has displaced up to 130,000 people over the past five weeks.",
      "The UN has said 75,000 people remain under siege with dwindling supplies of water and food in the towns of Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, where the Israeli military says it is preventing a Hamas resurgence.",

      "Under the laws of war, the forced displacement of any civilians inside an occupied territory is prohibited, unless it is necessary for their security or for an imperative military reason.",
      "For displacement to be lawful, civilians must be moved safely and provided with accommodation and essential supplies. They must also be able to return to their homes after the end of hostilities in the area.",
      "HRW\u2019s report - based on interviews with displaced Palestinians, analysis of Israeli evacuation orders, satellite imagery showing destruction of buildings, and videos and photos of strikes - concludes that there is no plausible imperative military reason to justify the displacement of nearly all of Gaza\u2019s population and that the other conditions for it be lawful have also not been met.",
      "The US-based group says the Israeli evacuation orders have been \u201cinconsistent, inaccurate, and frequently not communicated to civilians with enough time\u201d, and that they \u201cdid not consider the needs of people with disabilities and others who are unable to leave\u201d. Israeli forces have also \u201crepeatedly struck designated evacuation routes and safe zones\u201d, it adds.",
      "It accuses Israeli authorities of blocking \u201call but a small fraction of the necessary humanitarian aid, water, electricity, and fuel from reaching civilians in need\u201d, as well as carrying out attacks that have damaged and destroyed vital resources like hospitals and bakeries.",
      "HRW also alleges that Israel\u2019s military has \u201cintentionally demolished or severely damaged civilian infrastructure, including controlled demolitions of homes, with the apparent aim of creating an extended \u2018buffer zone\u2019 along Gaza\u2019s perimeter with Israel and a corridor which will bifurcate Gaza\u201d.",
      "\u201cThe destruction is so substantial that it indicates the intention to permanently displace many people,\u201d it warns.",
      "Israeli government ministers are also cited as saying that Gaza\u2019s territory would decrease and that land would be handed to Israeli settlers.",
      "\u201cForced displacement has been widespread, and the evidence shows it has been systematic and part of a state policy. Such acts also constitute crimes against humanity,\u201d HRW says.",
      "It also says that the \u201corganised, violent displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, who are members of another ethnic group, is likely planned to be permanent in the buffer zones and security corridors\u201d, and that such actions \u201camount to ethnic cleansing\u201d.",
      "In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement that the report was \u201cboth selectively presents information in a manner that obscures context, as well as makes certain blatant misrepresentations\".",
      "\u201cThe IDF\u2019s warnings to members of the civilian population to temporarily distance themselves from areas expected to be exposed to intense warfare are made in accordance with the obligation under international law to take feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm by providing advance warnings prior to attacks,\u201d it added.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 13:57:52 GMT",
    "summary": "John Smyth, a known child abuser in the UK, went to Zimbabwe and set up Christian holiday camps.",
    "story": [
      "The sister of a 16-year-old boy who drowned while swimming naked at a Christian holiday camp in Zimbabwe run by child abuser John Smyth blames the Church of England for his death.",
      "\"The Church knew about the abuses that John Smyth was doing. They should have stopped him. Had they stopped him, I think my brother [Guide Nyachuru] would still be alive,\" Edith Nyachuru told the BBC.",
      "The British barrister had moved to Zimbabwe with his wife and four children from Winchester in England in 1984 to work with an evangelistic organisation.",
      "This was two years after an investigation revealed he had subjected boys in the UK, many of whom he had met at Christian holiday camps run by a charity he chaired that was linked to the Church, to traumatic physical, psychological and sexual abuse.",
      "The 1982 report, prepared by Anglican clergyman Mark Ruston, about the canings said \"the scale and severity of the practice was horrific\", with accounts of boys beaten so badly they bled, with one describing how he needed to wear nappies until his wounds scabbed over.",
      "Despite these shocking revelations, mainly involving boys from elite British public schools, the Ruston report was not widely circulated.",
      "A decade on, aged 50, Smyth had established himself as a respected member of the Christian community in Zimbabwe. He had set up his own organisation, Zambesi Ministries, with funding from the UK - and was meting out similar punishments at camps that he marketed at the country\u2019s top schools.",
      "Ms Nyachuru says her brother\u2019s trip had been an early Christmas present from one of his other sisters, who had picked up one of Smyth\u2019s brochures and been impressed with all the activities on offer for the week.",
      "As she looks at an old photograph of Guide, she says he was the youngest of seven siblings, and the only boy: \"He was very loved by everyone.",
      "\"A lovely boy... Guide was due to be made head boy the following year,\" she remembers, adding that he was \"an intelligent boy, a good swimmer, strong, healthy with no known medical conditions\".",
      "But within 12 hours of him being dropped at the camp at Ruzawi School in Marondera, 74km (46 miles) from the capital, Harare, on the evening of 15 December 1992, the family received a call to say he had died.",
      "Witnesses say that like all the boys, Guide had gone swimming naked in a pool before bed - a camp tradition. The other boys returned to the dormitory, but Guide\u2019s absence was not noticed - which his sister finds surprising - and his body was found at the bottom of the pool the next morning.",
      "His family rushed to the mortuary but Ms Nyachuru\u2019s shock was compounded by confusion when she was stopped by officers from viewing his body: \"They told me: 'You can\u2019t go in there because he is indecently dressed.'",
      "\"It was only my father, my brother-in-law and our pastor who went in and put him in the coffin.\"",
      "Nakedness appears to be something Smyth was fixated on at his camps. Camp attendees have told of how he would often parade around without clothes in the boys\u2019 dormitories - where he also slept, unlike other staff members.",
      "He would also shower naked with them in the communal showers and the boys were ordered not to wear underpants in bed.",
      "\"He promoted nakedness and encouraged the boys to walk around naked at the summer camp,\" a former student who attended a camp at Ruzawi in 1991 told the BBC.",
      "But his jocular manner put many of them at ease, he said.",
      "\"Smyth was very friendly, laid-back, approachable, he was really fun, always joking.",
      "\"Smyth would also walk the dorms and shower area wearing nothing but a towel slung over his shoulder.\"",
      "The reason given for the no-underwear-in-the-evening rule was \"because it would make them grow\", he recalled.",
      "Smyth gave talks on masturbation, would sometimes lead prayers in the nude and encouraged naked trampolining, an activity he described as \"flappy jumping\" - all behaviour noted in an investigation by Zimbabwean lawyer David Coltart that was launched in May 1993.",
      "It was the thrashings that Smyth was giving boys with a notorious table tennis bat, dubbed \"TTB\", that led a parent to the door of Coltart, who worked at a law practice in Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo.",
      "She wanted to know why one of her sons had returned from a holiday camp with bruises on his buttocks so severe that she took him to a doctor, who found a \"12cm x 12cm bruise\".",
      "\"She saw these and demanded to know what happened and then it came out that her son had been badly beaten in the nude, and she came to me for advice,\" Coltart, now mayor of Bulawayo, told the BBC.",
      "\"When I heard that this was a Christian organisation - I\u2019m an elder in the Presbyterian Church - I got hold of my pastor and we got hold of the Baptist Church, Methodist Church and two other churches in the city and then I was instructed by those churches to investigate the matter,\" he said.",
      "Forty-four-year-old Jason Leanders, who went on the camp that immediately followed Guide\u2019s death, said he was beaten three to four times a day by Smyth, who would put his hands into his pants to check he had not put on extra layers to cushion his buttocks.",
      "\"My bum was black,\" he told the BBC. \"But being a boy, you act tough.\"",
      "For many boarding school students, corporal punishment was regarded as \"normal\", former Zimbabwean cricketer Henry Olonga, who was attending the camp the night Guide died, said in his 2015 autobiography.",
      "But after Coltart managed to track down the Ruston report, the severity of the problem became apparent. He wrote to Smyth instructing him to immediately stop the Zambesi Ministries camps.",
      "\"It was calculated, he focused on boys. He groomed young men. He encouraged them to take showers in the nude with him. There was a pattern of violence,\" he said.",
      "But Coltart\u2019s dealings with Smyth proved difficult.",
      "\"He was a highly articulate man and quite aggressive in the meetings that I had with him. He employed all his skills as a barrister to seek to intimidate. He was older than me. I was then a relatively young lawyer in my 30s. He exploited the fact that he was an English QC [Queen's Counsel].\"",
      "Rather than comply with Coltart\u2019s various requests, he doubled down and in a letter to parents ahead of the August 1993 camps, described himself as \"a father figure to the camp\" and defended the nudity and corporal punishment, writing: \"I never cane the boys, but I do whack with a table tennis bat when necessary\u2026 although most regard TTB (as it is affectionately known) as little more than a joke.\"",
      "This time there appears to have been no cloaking of the beatings as \"spiritual discipline\" as had been the case in the UK. He also admitted to Coltart that he took photographs of naked boys, but said they were \"from shoulders up\" for publicity purposes.",
      "Coltart contacted two psychologists with his findings, both of whom advised that Smyth should stop working with children.",
      "His 21-page report was then published in October 1993, and circulated to head teachers and church leaders in Zimbabwe.",
      "\"The report was never published widely, conscious of the dangers of a defamation suit,\" Coltart said.",
      "However it \"basically stopped him in his tracks in Zimbabwe\" as the private schools were his harvesting ground, he said. Zambesi Ministries camps did continue in some guise, but not at schools or under Smyth\u2019s leadership",
      "Coltart then instructed another law firm to pursue a legal case against Smyth who was eventually charged with culpable homicide over Guide\u2019s death, as well as charges relating to the beatings.",
      "But, according to former BBC TV producer Andrew Graystone in his 2021 book about the abuse, the case was bedevilled with problems, police documents were missing and Smyth\u2019s legal prowess led to the prosecutor being removed - another one was never appointed, so the case was essentially shelved in 1997.",
      "Ms Nyachuru says no post-mortem was carried out at the time - Guide was buried on the day he drowned in the family's home village, with Smyth presiding over the funeral.",
      "Following the Coltart report, Smyth faced deportation from Zimbabwe but Graystone says he used his significant connections to avoid this, lobbying various cabinet ministers - some of whose sons had attended his camps - with suggestions that even then-President Robert Mugabe was approached by one of Smyth\u2019s associates.",
      "But from the time of Smyth\u2019s prosecution, the family were given temporary residency permits, which had to be renewed every 30 days.",
      "In 2001, having spent too long out of the country on a trip, Smyth and his wife Anne were refused re-entry, prompting their move to South Africa\u2019s coastal city of Durban and then a few years later to Cape Town, where the couple were living when the Church of England became fully aware in 2013 of the abuses he had committed in the UK.",
      "\"The Anglican church in Cape Town in which John Smyth worshipped\u2026 has reported that it never received any reports suggesting he abused or groomed young people,\" Thabo Makgoba, the archbishop of Cape Town, said in statement responding to this week's resignation of Justin Welby as Archbishop of Canterbury.",
      "Smyth was only excommunicated by his local church the year before his death in 2018, after he was named publicly as an abuser in a Channel 4 News report.",
      "Ms Nyachuru told the BBC it was not until 2021 that she received a written apology from Welby about the death of her brother, in which he admitted that Smyth was responsible and the church had failed her family.",
      "She wrote back describing the apology as \"too little, too late\" and is now calling for other senior church leaders who failed to intervene to prevent Smyth's abuse to resign: \"I just think people of the church, if they see something not going in the right direction, if it needs the police they should go to the police.\"",
      "Coltart feels it is not just the Church that is to blame, and suggests other institutions in the UK need to face up to their failure to warn people in Zimbabwe.",
      "He commended the Church of England\u2019s recent Makin report, saying it \"left no stone unturned\". The report estimates that around \"85 boys and young men were physically abused in African countries, including Zimbabwe\".",
      "Coltart urged the Church to reach out to them.",
      "\"I think possibly there are still victims in Zimbabwe, perhaps in South Africa, who are suffering from PTSD and I think the Anglican church has a responsibility to identify those individuals and to supply them with the medical assistance that they might require,\" he said.",
      "Mr Leanders says many of his friends are still \"so traumatised by the beatings they are not even prepared to talk about it\".",
      "\"Smyth was protected in England and he was protected in Zimbabwe. The protection went on for so long it robbed victims the chance to confront Smyth as adults.\"",

    "summary": "About 1,000 gold miners have already been arrested and the army and police are waiting for the rest.",
    "story": [
      "An estimated 4,000 illegal gold miners are hiding underground in South Africa after the government cut off food and water in an effort to \"smoke them out\" and arrest them.",
      "The miners have been in a mineshaft in Stilfontein, in the North West province, for about a month.",
      "They have refused to cooperate with authorities as some are undocumented - coming from neighbouring countries like Lesotho and Mozambique - and fear being deported.",
      "Illegal miners are called \"zama zama\" (\"take a chance\" in Zulu) and operate in abandoned mines in the mineral-rich country. Illegal mining costs the South African government hundreds of millions of dollars in lost sales each year.",
      "Many South African mines have closed down in recent years and workers have been sacked.",
      "To survive, the miners and undocumented migrants go beneath the surface to escape poverty and dig up gold to sell it on the black market.",
      "Some spend months underground - there is even a small economy of people selling food, cigarettes and cooked meals to the miners.",

      "WATCH: The dangerous world of illegal mining in South Africa",
      "South African miner feared for his life during 'hostage situation'",
      "Local residents have pleaded with the authorities to assist the miners, but they have refused.",
      "\"We are going to smoke them out. They will come out. We are not sending help to criminals. Criminals are not to be helped - they are to be persecuted [sic],\" said Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni on Wednesday.",
      "Police are hesitant to go into the mine as some of those underground may be armed.",
      "Some are part of criminal syndicates or \"recruited\" to be in one, Busi Thabane, from Benchmarks Foundation, a charity which monitors corporations in South Africa, told the BBC's NewsDay programme.",
      "Without any access to supplies, conditions underground are said to be dire.",
      "\"It is no longer about illegal miners \u2013 this is a humanitarian crisis,\" said Ms Thabane.",
      "On Thursday, community leader Thembile Botman told the BBC that volunteers had used ropes and seat belts to pull a body out of the mine.",
      "\"The stench of decomposing bodies has left the volunteers traumatised,\" he said.",
      "It's not clear how the person died.",
      "Although the authorities have been blocking food and water, they have temporarily allowed local residents to send some supplies down by rope.",
      "Mr Botman said they had been communicating with the miners by notes written on pieces of paper.",
      "Police have blocked off entrances and exits in an effort to compel the miners to come out.",
      "This is part of the Vala Umgodi, or \"Close the Hole\", operation to curb illegal mining.",
      "Five miners were pulled out on Wednesday by rope, but they were frail and weak. Paramedics attended to them, and then they were taken into police custody.",
      "In the last week, 1,000 miners have emerged and been arrested.",
      "Police and the army are still at the scene waiting to detain those who are not in need of medical care after resurfacing.",
      "\"It\u2019s not as easy as the police make it seem \u2013 some of them are fearing for their lives,\" said Ms Thabane.",
      "Many miners spend months underground in unsafe conditions to provide for their families.",
      "\"For many of them it's the only way they know how to put food on the table,\" said Ms Thabane.",
      "Local residents have also attempted to convince the miners to come out of the mineshaft.",
      "\"Those people must come out because we have brothers there, we have sons there, the fathers of our kids are there, our children are struggling,\" local resident Emily Photsoa told AFP.",
      "The South African Human Rights Commission says it will investigate the police for depriving the miners of food and water.",
      "It said there is concern that the government\u2019s operation could have an impact on the right to life.",
      "Minister Ntshavheni's remarks have provoked mixed reaction from South Africans, with some praising the government's unyielding approach.",
      "\"I love this. Finally, our government is not tiptoeing on these serious matters. Decisiveness will help this country,\" one person wrote on X.",
      "While others felt the stance was inhumane.",
      "\"In my view, this kind of talk from the Minister in the Presidency is disgraceful and dangerous hate speech,\" one user said.",
      "Another wrote: \"They are criminals but they have rights too.\"",
      "Illegal mining is a lucrative business across many of South Africa's mining towns.",
      "Since December last year, nearly 400 high-calibre firearms, thousands of bullets, uncut diamonds and money have been confiscated from illegal miners.",
      "This is part of an intensive police and military operation to stop the practice that has severe environmental implications.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:43:18 GMT",
    "summary": "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has moved speedily since winning the US presidential election to set the foundations of his second term in the White House.",
      "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",
      "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from his rollercoaster first week as president-elect.",
      "1) He\u2019s building a loyal team to shake up government",
      "Trump started building his top team almost immediately, nominating cabinet picks for Senate approval and appointing White House advisers and other senior aides.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.",
      "His selections make clear that he plans a radical shake up of government, eschewing more conventional and experienced picks for those who are loyal to him and share his vision for a second term that will upend the status quo in Washington.",
      "His choice for defence secretary, for example, has called for a purge of military chiefs enacting \u201cwoke\u201d policies. His nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has said he wants to \u201cclear out corruption\u201d at America\u2019s health agencies and cut \u201centire departments\u201d at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "And that\u2019s not to mention a promised new department helmed by advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, which Trump says will focus on slashing regulations and historic cost-cutting.",
      "The bigger picture is that Trump\u2019s proposed team is almost universally loyal, and favour overhauling their respective government departments.",
      "You can take a deeper look at who\u2019s in the frame for his top team here.",
      "2) He\u2019ll have a friendly Congress on his side",
      "Republicans have won control of the House as well as the Senate, giving the party a crucial (albeit narrow) majority in both chambers for at least the next two years, when there will be the usual midterm elections.",
      "This is a major boost to Trump\u2019s agenda. It means he will be more easily able to pass legislation and gives his policy priorities a friendly path to becoming law.",
      "The Democratic Party will, naturally, be less able to block and resist his agenda too. And Trump should for now be able to avoid the kind of congressional investigations he faced in the second half of his first term.",
      "Ultimately, Republican control of Congress could prove key in pushing through his big pledges such as mass deportations, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing for Trump in Congress, however, as our correspondent Gary O\u2019Donoghue explains here.",
      "3) But Senate Republicans won\u2019t always roll over",
      "Trump\u2019s influence was put to the test earlier this week when Republicans in the Senate picked their new leader.",
      "While he did not weigh-in on the race directly, there had been a concerted effort from the president-elect\u2019s most vocal allies as well as favourable \u2018Maga\u2019 media outlets to get hard-line Trump loyalist Rick Scott elected.",
      "But he was defeated in the first round and Republicans opted for a more orthodox pick in John Thune, who has had a more rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that this was a secret ballot, so it was far from a public repudiation of Trumpworld.",
      "There will be sterner tests of Trump\u2019s power on Capitol Hill to come, notably when confirmation hearings are held for his more divisive cabinet picks.",
      "Some Senate Republicans, for example, have already signalled their opposition to Trump's shock choice of Matt Gaetz to lead the justice department.",
      "4) Trump's criminal conviction could soon be wiped",
      "While much of the focus was on the president-elect\u2019s nominations and appointments, we also had a reminder that his legal troubles have been upended by his victory.",
      "In New York specifically, his criminal fraud conviction in the hush-money case lives on for at least a few more days.",
      "But it could soon be consigned to history. Earlier this week a judge delayed his decision as to whether Trump\u2019s conviction should be thrown out because of a Supreme Court ruling in the summer that expanded presidential immunity.",
      "That decision is now expected to come next week. And while it\u2019s not clear whether the conviction will be tossed out, Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing on 26 November is likely to be delayed regardless.",
      "Here\u2019s a reminder of how Trump\u2019s election win impacts his cases.",
      "What are recess appointments and how will Trump administration picks be vetted?",
      "Trump picking Gaetz to head justice sends shockwaves - and a strong message",
      "Trump's pick of Huckabee and Witkoff a clue to Middle East policy",
      "Who has joined Trump's team so far?",
      "5) He has China firmly in his sights",
      "It\u2019s no secret that Trump views the world differently to Biden, and could drastically shift US foreign policy over the next few years.",
      "One clear theme that's emerged in recent days is the prominence of China hawks in his proposed team - those who believe Beijing poses a serious threat to US economic and military dominance and want to challenge this more forcefully.",
      "And they are present from the top down.",
      "His nomination for secretary of state - America\u2019s most senior diplomat - Marco Rubio, has described China as the \u201cmost advanced adversary America has ever faced\u201d.",
      "Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China. Other nominees such as his proposed ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, have directly accused China of election interference.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first administration, relations with Beijing were tense, and they barely warmed under Biden. With tariffs, export controls and pointed rhetoric, the president-elect appears ready to take an even tougher stance this time around."

    "story": [
      "Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of congressman Matt Gaetz to be his attorney general has arrived like a thunderclap in Washington.",
      "Of all the president-elect\u2019s picks for his administration so far, this is easily the most controversial - and sends a clear message that Trump intends to shake up the establishment when he returns to power.",
      "The shockwaves were still being felt on Thursday morning as focus shifted to a looming fight in the Senate over his nomination.",
      "Trump is assembling his team before he begins his term on 20 January, and his choice of defence secretary, Fox News host Pete Hegseth, and intelligence chief, former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, have also raised eyebrows.",
      "But it is Gaetz making most headlines. The Florida firebrand is perhaps best known for spearheading the effort to unseat then-Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy last year. But he has a history of being a flamethrower in the staid halls of Congress.",
      "In 2018, he brought a right-wing Holocaust denier to the State of the Union, and later tried to expel two fathers who lost children in a mass shooting from a hearing after they objected to a claim he made about gun control.",
      "His bombastic approach means he has no shortage of enemies, including within his own party. And so Trump's choice of Gaetz for this crucial role is a signal to those Republicans, too - his second administration will be staffed by loyalists who he trusts to enact his agenda, conventional political opinion be damned.",
      "Gasps were heard during a meeting of Republican lawmakers when the nomination for America's top US prosecutor was announced, Axios reported, citing sources in the room.",
      "Republican congressman Mike Simpson of Idaho reportedly responded with an expletive.",
      "\u201cI don't think it's a serious nomination for the attorney general,\u201d Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said. \u201cThis one was not on my bingo card.\u201d",

      "Could Musk really cut $2tn from government spending?",
      "Seven things Trump says he will do in power",
      "Gaetz does have some allies on Capitol Hill who share an unwavering loyalty to Trump. The Florida lawmaker has been one of the president-elect's most aggressive and relentless defenders - at congressional hearings, in press conferences and during television appearances.",
      "On Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson, another devoted Trump loyalist, called Gaetz an \"accomplished attorney\".",
      "\"He's a reformer in his mind and heart, and I think that he'll bring a lot to the table on that,\" said Johnson.",
      "In a social media post, Trump spelled out how he intends to use Gaetz as a wrecking ball to radically change the US Department of Justice, which he has regularly blamed for his multiple legal troubles.",
      "\u201cMatt will root out the systemic corruption at the DOJ, and return the department to its true mission of fighting crime and upholding our democracy and constitution,\u201d he wrote.",
      "During the campaign, Trump promised retribution for the numerous investigations launched against him. Now, it appears, Gaetz will be at the frontlines of Trump\u2019s efforts to bring the justice department to heel.",
      "The department also investigated Gaetz himself.",
      "Last year, it declined to bring charges over allegations he violated sex-trafficking laws during a trip he took to the Bahamas with paid escorts.",
      "He was the subject of an ongoing ethics investigation in the House of Representatives into allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and misuse of campaign funds.",
      "But on Wednesday evening, reportedly just two days before a highly critical House report on the investigation, Johnson said Gaetz had resigned as a lawmaker, effectively ending the House probe since the committee only investigates members.",
      "On Thursday, top Senate Democrat Dick Durbin asked the House committee to preserve and share the findings of that report, saying the sequence and timings of the resignation raised questions.",
      "\"Make no mistake: this information could be relevant to the question of Mr Gaetz\u2019s confirmation as the next Attorney General of the United States.\"",
      "Gaetz has denied all the allegations against him.",

      "Who Trump has appointed to his top team so far",
      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "According to CBS News, Gaetz had asked Trump for a pre-emptive pardon for any related crimes prior to the president leaving office in January 2021.",
      "All this makes him an unlikely choice for a position that typically goes to more senior politicians, well versed in law.",
      "Gaetz, 42, has a law degree and worked for a Florida law firm before his eight years in Congress. Joe Biden\u2019s attorney general, Merrick Garland, was a senior federal appellate court judge. Trump in his first term picked US Senator Jeff Sessions, and later Bill Barr, who had decades of experience in Republican presidential administrations.",
      "The Senate will be responsible for confirming Gaetz\u2019s nomination, and the Florida congressman has ruffled more then a few feathers in that chamber \u2013 including among Republicans. While his party has a majority, it would only take four \u201cno\u201d votes, joined by unified Democratic opposition, to sink his chances.",
      "Gaetz himself said last year that he would love to be attorney general while acknowledging it was unlikely.",
      "\u201cThe world is not ready, probably,\u201d he told Newsmax in an interview. \u201cCertainly Senate confirmation wouldn\u2019t be, but you know, a boy can dream.\u201d",
      "For the moment, however, Trump\u2019s closest supporters are celebrating his pick.",
      "\u201cThe hammer of justice is coming,\u201d Elon Musk posted about Gaetz on X.",
      "Regardless of the ultimate outcome of Gaetz\u2019s bid to be attorney general, Trump has fired a warning shot across the bow of US government. While his second term in office may be more organised than his first, it may end up being even more confrontational.",

      "She will require Senate confirmation to take up the role.",

      "But the nomination has sparked criticism in some quarters.",
      "Reacting to the appointment on X, Democratic Virginia congresswoman member of the House Intelligence Committee Abigail Spanberger said she was \"appalled at the nomination of Tulsi Gabbard\".",
      "\"Not only is she ill-prepared and unqualified, but she traffics in conspiracy theories and cozies up to dictators like Bashar-al Assad and Vladimir Putin,\" she said.",

      "In the same year, she also faced criticism for her perceived support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, seen as a key Russian ally.",
      "She said Assad \"is not the enemy of the United States because Syria does not pose a direct threat to the United States\" - and defended meeting him in 2017, during Trump's first term.",

    "story": [
      "For now, Mike Huckabee seems to be keeping his cards close to his chest.",
      "Shortly after being announced as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for US ambassador to Israel, the former Republican governor of Arkansas said: \u201cI won't make the policy. I will carry out the policy of the president.\u201d",
      "But he did give an indication of what he expected that policy to be, citing the previous Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise the occupied Golan Heights as Israeli territory \u2013 decisions as warmly welcomed by the Israeli right wing as they were categorically rejected by Palestinians.",
      "\u201cNo-one has done more,\u201d he told an Israeli radio station. \u201cPresident Trump and I fully expect that will continue.\u201d",
      "What approach Trump will take to the Israel-Gaza war is still unclear. But the right wing of Israeli politics has welcomed the president-elect\u2019s appointment of Huckabee, seeing it as predicting another term of American policy highly favourable to their longstanding aims of holding on to territory in the West Bank and expanding settlements.",
      "The appointment was greeted with joy by two far-right ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. On the social media platform X, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich messaged his congratulations to \u201ca consistent and loyal friend\", while Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, wrote \"Mike Huckabee\" with heart emojis.",

      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have reason to be cheered by Huckabee\u2019s appointment. He has been a consistent supporter of many Israelis\u2019 ambitions to expand into territories that would form part of any future Palestinian state.",
      "Holding a press conference in 2017, shortly after a cornerstone-laying ceremony at one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Huckabee said: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a settlement. They\u2019re communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d",
      "The following year, he said: \u201cI think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the name used by many in Israel for the area which became the occupied West Bank when it was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "The previous Trump administration declared in 2019 that it did not consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law, contradicting decades of US policy. Other decisions, including a 2020 peace plan greenlighting the annexation of Israeli settlements, were seen as more favourable to the settlers than any previous administration.",
      "The Israeli far right has indicated that it sees Huckabee\u2019s appointment as a sign that it will be able to further advance its agenda, including annexation of the West Bank, during the next Trump term.",
      "On Monday, Smotrich said that 2025 would be \"the year of sovereignty\" in the West Bank, adding that he had instructed Israeli authorities to begin preparatory work for annexation of the occupied territory.",
      "That happening is a genuine fear for Mustafa Barghouti, a West Bank-based veteran Palestinian politician who is leader of the Palestinian National Initiative political movement.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the reaction of other powerful countries in the world would be, when the idea of annexing occupied territories, obtained by war, becomes legal and acceptable,\" he says. \"So it's not just about Palestinians and our suffering, it's about the international order.\u201d",
      "Whether Smotrich will get his wish remains to be seen. Tal Schneider, a political correspondent at the Times of Israel, says it is not a foregone conclusion that a pro-settler US ambassador will result in pro-settler policies in Washington.",
      "\u201cFour years ago, some of the people that surrounded Trump were very much pro-settlements and pro-annexing, but it didn't work like that last time. I predict it's not going to work like that this time around.\u201d",
      "Huckabee was not the only appointee announced on Tuesday. The president-elect also said Steve Witkoff would serve as his special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "As well as being a real estate developer, Witkoff is also a longtime golf buddy of Trump\u2019s. The pair were playing together at the time of a second failed assassination attempt in September.",
      "It is not clear what foreign policy experience Witkoff brings to the role, but he has previously praised Trump\u2019s dealings with Israel.",
      "In July, he argued that Trump\u2019s \u201cleadership was good for Israel and the entire region\u201d.",
      "\u201cWith President Trump, the Middle East experienced historic levels of peace and stability. Strength prevents wars. Iran\u2019s money was cut off which prevented their funding of global terror,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s decision to nominate a hardline settler leader for Israeli ambassador to Washington three days after Trump\u2019s election also indicates that the prime minister believes the next administration will be receptive to right-wing arguments.",
      "US-born Yechiel Leiter, who was Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff when he was finance minister, supports the annexation of the West Bank. According to the Haaretz newspaper, he was once active in the US-based Jewish Defence League, the organisation founded by far-right rabbi Meir Kahane. His son was killed fighting in Gaza.",
      "He was also reported to support the Abraham Accords, Trump\u2019s efforts to normalise relations between Israel and Arab states, which had some success. However, advancing that process has been derailed by the ongoing war in Gaza and Arab anger over the suffering of the Palestinians.",
      "Palestinians, already disillusioned with the US over Joe Biden\u2019s support for Israel during the war in Gaza, say Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador suggests the next president will make the prospect of an eventual two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict even more remote.",
      "\u201cMr Huckabee has said things that are absolutely contradictory to international law,\u201d says Mustafa Barghouti, a West Bank-based Palestinian politician.",

But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",

      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",

      "While other presidents have used them, Prof Chafetz says: \"I can't think of an instance in which the Senate majority has triggered a recess simply so that a president could make recess appointments.\"",
      "When can Trump make recess appointments?",
      "According to Prof Chafetz, there are two paths Trump could take to making recess appointments.",
      "The first would involve the Senate agreeing to recess for 10 days or more by majority vote.",
      "The second would involve the House voting for a longer recess than the Senate, which would allow Trump to invoke a never-used constitutional power to adjourn both chambers of Congress.",
      "According to the US Constitution, \"in Case of Disagreement\" a president can adjourn both chambers of Congress until \"such Time as he shall think proper\" - which would then provide Trump an opportunity to make recess appointments.",
      "Trump previously threatened to use this power when he was in the White House.",
      "In 2020, during a pandemic briefing, Trump said that he would \"exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress\u201d to make recess appointments if his nominees before Congress were not approved.",
      "Prof Chafetz stressed that this route has never been used before in US history, and so \"no-one is quite sure how it would work\".",
      "He added that Trump cannot make any recess appointments until he is president. His inauguration is scheduled for 20 January.",

      "\"We know that on day one he is going to launch the largest mass deportation of illegal immigrants in American history,\" she said.",

      "He tapped veteran immigration official Tom Homan as his \"border tsar\"; selected South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to oversee homeland security; and appointed Steven Miller as White House deputy chief of staff for policy. Mr Miller is best known for shaping some of Trump's most restrictive policies on illegal immigration during his first term.",
      "Any mass deportation programme could face logistical difficulties as well as a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.",
      "Trump could also re-implement his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy that required asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while claims are processed.",
      "President Joe Biden had called the programme \"inhumane\" and tried to end it on his first day in office, but faced legal challenges. In 2022, the Supreme Court allowed him to move ahead.",
      "During the Trump administration, about 70,000 asylum seekers were returned to Mexico to wait for their hearings.",
      "Another day one promise was to end birthright citizenship - the 150-year-old principle that says anyone born on US soil is an American citizen.",
      "It's not clear how Trump plans to achieve this policy. He has pledged an executive order but birthright citizenship is explicitly guaranteed by the US Constitution, meaning it can only be altered under specific circumstances.",

      "\"Oh, absolutely, I would. If they're innocent, I would pardon them,\" Trump said during a panel at the National Association of Black Journalists.",
      "US presidents have wide authority to forgive people convicted of federal crimes or end their prison sentences. Prosecutors may also decide to drop pending cases depending on who Trump might choose to pardon.",
      "What's less clear is who might get a pardon.",
      "At one point, Trump told CNN: \"I am inclined to pardon many of them. I can't say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.\"",
      "Ms Leavitt told the Washington Post that he will decide \u201con a case-by-case basis when he is back in the White House\u201d.",
      "More than 1,500 people were arrested in connection with the Capitol riot. According to federal numbers, more than 750 of them were sentenced for crimes ranging from trespassing to assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Jack Smith",
      "Trump has also faced his own legal challenges over his actions following the 2020 election and a separate classified documents case.",
      "Special Counsel Jack Smith, a veteran prosecutor appointed to oversee the US Department of Justice's investigations into Trump, filed charges, to which the president-elect has pleaded not guilty.",
      "This week, sources told CBS News that Mr Smith plans to resign before Trump takes office and avoid Trump's promises to fire him. The BBC's US media partner also reported that his office would wind down the two cases it was pursuing against Trump.",

      "In his 2016 campaign, Trump made withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement a priority. Within six months of taking office, the United States moved to exit the landmark deal.",
      "President Joe Biden made rejoining the agreement one of his top priorities when he ran against Trump in 2020. Biden signed a letter requesting the US be readmitted on his first day in office.",
      "How will Trump respond in his second term? Media reports suggest that his team is preparing orders to withdraw once again when he takes office in January.",
      "Leaving the agreement would mean the US is no longer beholden to meeting set carbon emissions reductions.",
      "Among other priorities at odds with the Paris standards, Trump has said he wants to prioritise US production of oil and gas. He promised to quickly expedite permitting and fracking - \"We\u2019re drilling, drilling, drilling,\" he told Fox News host Sean Hannity last year.",
      "Trump has also criticised the Biden administration's plans to expand wind energy and increase electric car production, which could be early targets in his new administration.",
      "Russia and Ukraine",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump said he could end the war in Ukraine \"in a day\". He has also repeatedly criticised the US government's continued support of Ukraine, casting the war as a drain on resources.",

      "Trade and economy",
      "The economy is an issue that Trump heavily campaigned on, vowing to end inflation as soon as he takes office.",
      "\u201cWe will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,\u201d Trump has said.",
      "\u201cI will instruct my cabinet that I expect results within the first 100 days, or much sooner than that.\u201d",
      "He said he would sign an executive order that directs every cabinet secretary and agency head to \u201cuse every tool and authority at their disposal\u201d to defeat inflation and to bring consumer prices down.",
      "Trump\u2019s plan includes imposing tariffs on imported goods, especially those coming in from China, arguing that these taxes would keep manufacturing jobs in the US.",
      "It\u2019s still unclear how widespread these tariffs will be, but Trump has raised the prospect of at least a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods, as well as a 60% import tax on goods from China.",
      "He also vowed to target Mexico with his tariffs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to inform (the Mexican president) on Day 1 or sooner that if they don\u2019t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I\u2019m going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the US,\u201d he has said.",
      "These tariffs would probably not need congressional approval.",
      "Trump already introduced tariffs in his first term, citing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which empowers a president to impose duties on goods that could affect US national security.",
      "Another promise is to \u201cend the Biden-Harris war on American energy\u201d, Trump has said, vowing to ramp up oil drilling and fracking as a way to lower the cost of energy bills for consumers.",
      "Trump can do this with an executive order that rolls back environmental protections, which would allow him to halt clean energy projects and scrap climate targets set by the Biden administration.",
      "The president-elect has also vowed to fire Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, on day one. Gensler, who was appointed by Biden, pushed for climate disclosure rules and strong enforcement of the cryptocurrency market.",
      "Trump has championed cryptocurrency, and his election saw the value of Bitcoin go up by 30% in the past week due to an expectation that his administration will be more crypto-friendly.",
      "Title X",
      "Donald Trump has vowed to undo the changes made by President Biden to Title X, the country\u2019s only national, federally-funded family planning programme.",
      "In 2019, during his first term, Trump\u2019s administration implemented a new rule that prohibited any health provider in the Title X network from mentioning abortion to patients, even if a patient raised questions about it themselves.",
      "The change effectively stripped tens of millions of dollars from organisations such as Planned Parenthood that offer or refer patients for abortions.",
      "But just months later, when Biden took office, he had that policy reversed.",
      "Now, it\u2019s expected that Trump will change the rules again.",

      "It is a role that the tech entrepreneur has arguably prepared for through his business leadership, and one he has spent months pushing for.",

      "Will Trump be sentenced over hush money case?",
      "Second-term priorities take shape",
      "Musk told a Trump rally in October that he believed the US government's budget could be cut by \"at least\" $2tn from about $6.5tn. He has also frequently suggested the number of government employees could be significantly reduced.",
      "Ramaswamy, meanwhile, has put forward plans to scrap a number of federal departments including the Department of Education, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.",
      "Railing against regulation",
      "Musk has cast his plans to optimise government efficiency in heroic terms, pointing to his hopes of one day colonising Mars, while arguing that the feat would only be possible \"so long as it is not smothered by bureaucracy\".",
      "At the time, he said creating the new Doge was \"the only path to extending life beyond Earth\".",
      "Any major cuts to government agencies could also have potentially significant implications for his business interests, which are closely entwined with the government.",
      "Rocket firm SpaceX alone has more than $8bn-worth of ongoing contracts with the US government, according to public contracting sites, and could stand to benefit further from closer government ties.",
      "Meanwhile, his electric car company Tesla is facing investigations from numerous government agencies over issues such as the safety of its self-driving features. His desire to cut regulation could affect such probes.",
      "In recent years, Musk has repeatedly accused regulators of launching trivial probes and standing in the way of his companies.",
      "In September he threatened to sue the Federal Aviation Administration over its plans to fine his SpaceX company $633,000 for alleged licence infringements related to some of its rocket launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida. He accused the agency of \"regulatory overreach\".",
      "Musk \"stands to benefit personally from a lot of the deregulation that he touts,\" says Christopher Phelps, a professor of modern US political history, adding: \"I think putting someone who is a billionaire and runs major corporations in charge of a federal project of deregulation is innately full of conflicts of interest.\"",
      "Others said Musk, who has long described himself as having a libertarian bent, appeared to be a true believer in the benefits of smaller government.",
      "\"There\u2019s no doubt that Musk has significant vested interests in the US regulatory landscape as a result of his many business enterprises,\" says Thomas Gift, a political science professor and director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London.",
      "\"At the same time, it\u2019s hard to make the case that this is the only impetus driving him.",
      "\"Musk has undertaken huge personal and political risks in coming out for Trump, and many of his activities and rhetoric seem to reflect an individual ideologically committed to causes he believes in.\"",
      "\"Clearly he has got skin in the game and there\u2019s a self-interest, but equally you can have a sincere belief that there is too much government regulation and too much government bureaucracy,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Reward for loyalty",
      "For years, Musk did not play a big role in politics, despite his large fortune, now worth more than $300bn, according to Forbes estimates.",
      "But he spoke out against the pandemic lockdowns of 2020. His criticism of the Biden administration mounted after the White House did not invite Tesla to an electric car summit in 2021.",
      "He formally endorsed Trump this year after an assassination attempt, ultimately donating more than $100m (\u00a379m) to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and appearing at numerous rallies.",
      "Prof Phelps describes Musk's relationship with Trump as \"transactional\", adding that the new role \"gives him a lot of symbolic clout - and possibly the clout to get the things that matter most to him done\".",
      "As the South African-born billionaire is not a US citizen by birth, Musk cannot become president - something that has frustrated other famous faces who became involved in politics in the past.",
      "But he can have an influence on US policy, and Trump will have a sympathetic adviser to call upon.",
      "\"Trump is looking to surround himself with loyalists in his new administration, and there\u2019s no-one who\u2019s been more loyal than Musk since he announced his endorsement for Trump,\" says Prof Gift.",
      "\"Not only did Musk go 'all in' in supporting Trump personally and financially during the campaign, but he\u2019s also evolved into a trusted adviser on topics as diverse as technology policy to the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "In an early sign of the influence the tech entrepreneur may be rewarded with for his loyalty, Musk was party to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following the election. The war in Ukraine will be a major foreign policy concern when Trump takes office.",
      "\"That is actually quite extraordinary,\" says Prof Waddan. \"Normally, even your biggest donors wouldn\u2019t get that kind of access.\"",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Musk first raised the idea of a cost-cutting effort while hosting Trump on X this summer. The official name is a winking reference to a meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, which then gave its name to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, a favourite of Musk that has seen its value soar since the election.",
      "Prof Phelps says the name is \"a nod to crypto deregulation being part of what they\u2019ll do\".",
      "But it is not clear how much of Musk's talk of cutting might actually become reality.",
      "For one thing, the new department will not have an official role, but provide \"advice and guidance from outside government\", according to the announcement.",
      "Experts have also warned that cuts of the scale discussed could be enormously disruptive - and face pushback in Congress - depending on how rapidly they are implemented.",
      "Musk himself acknowledged the risks, saying Americans should be ready to stomach temporary hardship for long-run gain.",
      "The way he has run his own firms may hint at what Americans can expect.",
      "After his October 2022 takeover of the social media platform Twitter - which he branded as X - Musk introduced radical changes, including the reduction X's workforce from around 8,000 to 1,500 in a matter of weeks.",
      "\"His idea of efficiency was to let a lot of people go,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Musk also loosened content moderation, stopped verifying accounts and welcomed users back to the platform who had been banned for violating its rules on hate speech and disinformation.",
      "Among the users he reinstated was Trump, who had been banned following the Capitol riot in January 2021 after continuing to claim the 2020 election had been rigged against him.",
      "Critics argue his changes have given prominence to hate-speech and misinformation - though Musk maintains the site is politically neutral.",
      "The overhaul also prompted an exodus of advertisers - the main way the site has made money. Though Musk has introduced new ways to raise revenue, such as paid subscriptions, the company today is worth far less than the $44bn Musk paid for it just two years ago.",
      "His record at his other big companies - Tesla and SpaceX - is stronger.",
      "Among car companies, Tesla stands out for making electric vehicles at a large profit, thanks in part to streamlined operations. His rocket firm SpaceX is credited with enabling rocket launches at significantly lower cost.",
      "\"As a serial entrepreneur, Musk has been relentless in trying to improve institutional efficiency at his own enterprises,\" Prof Gift says.",
      "He adds that though Musk's primary role will be \"slashing through the thicket of red tape that is the US federal government\", his position will also give him influence in the new administration.",
      "\"While his role in the Department of Government Efficiency will be a more informal one, there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s got Trump's ear - at least for the moment.\"",

During Trump's first term, Miller was involved in developing some of the administration's strictest immigration policies.",

While Trump has been more circumspect, limiting most of his China critiques to the realm of trade, he is filling his foreign policy team with vocal China critics.",
      "The president-elect picked Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Army colonel, as his national security adviser \u2013 a key foreign policy post within the White House. Waltz has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China and was one of the first members of Congress to call for a US boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.",

      "While Trump has yet to officially name his choice for secretary of state, Florida Senator Marco Rubio \u2013 another China hawk \u2013 appears to be the leading contender for the top diplomatic job. In 2020, Rubio was sanctioned by the Chinese government after he pushed measures to punish the nation for its crackdown on pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.",

      "Older, white conservatives were reducing in number, and non-white Americans were projected to be in the majority by 2044. College-educated professionals, younger people, black Americans, Latinos and other ethnic minorities, and blue-collar workers were part of a \u201ccoalition of the ascendant\u201d.",
      "These voters were left-leaning on cultural issues and supportive of an active federal government and a strong social safety net. And they constituted a majority in enough states to ensure a Democratic lock on the Electoral College \u2013 and the presidency.",

      "LIVE UPDATES: Trump projected to win Arizona",
      "Cracks began forming when non-college educated voters slipped away from the Democrats in midterm elections in 2010 and 2014. They then broke en masse to Trump in 2016. While Joe Biden, with his working-class-friendly reputation built over half a century, won enough back to take the White House in 2020, his success proved to be only a temporary reprieve.",
      "How small gains delivered Trump a big win",
      "Why Latinos flocked to Trump's coalition",
      "This year, Trump supplemented his gains with the blue-collar workers by also cutting into the Democratic margins among young, Latino and black voters. He has carved up the coalition of the ascendant.",
      "According to exit polls, Trump won:",
      "- 13% of the black vote in 2024 compared to Republican John McCain\u2019s 4% against Obama",
      "- 46% of the Latino vote this time, while McCain got 31% in 2008",
      "- 43% of voters under 30 against the 32% for McCain",
      "- 56% of those without a college degree - back in 2008, it was Obama who won a majority",
      "Speaking on Thursday after his comeback victory, Trump celebrated his own diverse coalition of voters.",
      "\u201cI started to see realignment could happen because the Democrats are not in line with the thinking of the country,\" the president-elect told NBC News.",
      "Immigration and identity politics",
      "Trump did it with a hard-line message on immigration that included border enforcement and mass deportations \u2013 policies that Biden and the Democrats recoiled from when they took power back from Trump in 2021, lest they anger immigrant rights activists in their liberal base.",
      "Illegal border crossings reached record levels under the Biden administration, with more than eight million encounters with migrants at the border with Mexico.",
      "\u201cIf you watch a video from Hillary Clinton back in 2008 in the primaries, she talks about making sure there's wall-building, making sure that immigrants who violate the law get deported, making sure everybody learns English,\u201d said Kevin Marino Cabrera, a Republican commissioner in Miami-Dade County. \u201cIt's funny how far to the left [the Democrats] have gone.\u201d",
      "This week, Trump became the first Republican since 1988 to win that heavily Latino county in Florida. He also won Starr County in south Texas, with its 97% Latino population, with 57% of the vote. In 2008, only 15% of the county voted for McCain, the Republican.",
      "Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican strategist who specialises in Latino voting trends, told the BBC that the problem with \u201cdemography is destiny\u201d was that it risked treating all non-white Americans as an \u201caggrieved racial minority\u201d. \u201cBut that is not and nor has it ever been the way Latinos have viewed themselves,\u201d he added.",

He said he agreed with Republicans on some things and felt Democratic politicians took black voters for granted.",
      "With some states still tabulating their results, Trump currently has improved on his electoral margins in at least 2,367 US counties, while slipping in just 240.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just the number of counties that Trump won that made a difference, either. Kamala Harris needed to post significant margins in the cities to offset Republican strength in rural areas. She consistently fell short.",
      "In Detroit\u2019s Wayne County, for example, which the latest US Census reports is 38% black, Harris won 63% of the vote \u2013 significantly lower than Joe Biden\u2019s 68% in 2020 and Obama\u2019s 74% in 2008.",
      "Polls consistently suggested that the economy, along with immigration, were the two issues of highest importance to voters - and where polls indicated Trump had an advantage over Harris.",
      "His economic message cut across racial divides.",
      "\u201cWe're just sick of hearing about identity politics,\" said Nicole Williams, a white bartender with a black husband and biracial children in Las Vegas, Nevada \u2013 one of the key battleground states that Trump flipped this year.",

      "Democrats are already engaged in considerable soul-searching, as they come to grips with an election defeat that has delivered the White House, the Senate and, perhaps, the House of Representatives to Republican control.",
      "Various elements within the party are offering their own, often conflicting, advice on the best path from the wilderness back to power.",
      "Left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders, who twice ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, also criticised identity politics and accused the party of abandoning working-class voters.",
      "Some centrist Democrats, meanwhile, have argued that the struggle to connect with voters goes beyond the economy and immigration. They point to how the Trump campaign was also able to use a cultural message as a wedge to fracture the Democratic coalition.",
      "Pelosi blames Biden for election loss as finger pointing intensifies",
      "Who's in the frame to join Trump's new top team?",
      "Among the positions that Republicans targeted in this year\u2019s election were calls to shift funding away from law enforcement, decriminalise undocumented border-crossings and minor crimes like shoplifting, and provide greater protections for transgender Americans.",
      "Many arose after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the resulting rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as other efforts to advance social justice and acknowledge darker parts of American history.",
      "Within a few years, however, some of those positions proved a liability for Democrats when trying to win over persuadable voters and keep their coalition from fraying. Harris, for example, backed away from some positions she\u2019d taken when she first ran for president in 2019.",
      "In the last month of the presidential campaign, the Trump team made the vice-president\u2019s past support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners and detained immigrants a central focus.",
      "One advert ended with the line: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d",
      "The Trump campaign spent more than $21m on transgender issue ads in the first half of October \u2013 about a third of their entire advertising expenditures and nearly double what they spent on spots on immigration and inflation, according to data compiled by AdImpact.",
      "It\u2019s the kind of investment a campaign makes if it has hard data showing an advert is moving public opinion.",
      "After Trump\u2019s convincing win, Congressman Seth Moulton, a moderate from Massachusetts, said his party needed to rethink its approach on cultural issues.",
      "\u201cDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,\u201d Moulton told the New York Times. \u201cI have two little girls, I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d",
      "Progressive Democrats, meanwhile, reject that characterisation, and argue that standing up for the rights of minorities has always been a core value of the party. Congressman John Moran wrote on X in response: \"You should find another job if you want to use an election loss as an opportunity to pick on our most vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Mike Madrid, the political strategist, has a brutal assessment of where the Democratic coalition is today.",
      "\u201cThe Democratic Party was predicated on what really is an unholy alliance between working-class people of colour and wealthier white progressives driven and animated by cultural issues,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cThe only glue holding that coalition together was anti-Republicanism.\u201d",
      "Once that glue came unstuck, he said, the party was ripe for defeat.",
      "Future elections are sure to be held in a friendlier political environment for Democrats. And Trump, who has shown a unique ability to attract new and low-propensity voters to the polls, has run his last campaign.",
      "But 2024\u2019s results will provide plenty of fuel for Democratic angst in the days to come.",
      "The Harris campaign itself believes she lost to Trump because she was facing a restive public angry over the economic and social turbulence in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic.",
      "\u201cYou stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control,\u201d campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote in a letter to her staff. \u201cThe whole country moved to the right, but compared to the rest of the country, the battleground states saw the least amount of movement in his direction. It was closest in the places we competed.\u201d",
      "Moses Santana, a Puerto Rican living in Philadelphia, is from a demographic which seemed reliably Democratic a decade or so ago. But when he spoke to the BBC this week, he was not so convinced the Democrats had delivered when in power - or that their message today connected with Americans like him.",
      "\u201cYou know, Joe Biden promised a lot of progressive things, like he was going to cancel student debt, he was going to help people get their citizenship,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd none of that happened. Donald Trump is bringing [people] something new.\u201d",

      "Their task at the start was to \u201cgive certain rules to our language, to render it pure and eloquent\u201d \u2013 to which end they set about writing their first dictionary.",
      "However, the job has proved so slow \u2013 the first book was not produced until 1694 and today it takes more than a year to get through a single letter of the alphabet \u2013 that the relevance of the enterprise is increasingly in question.",
      "\u201cThe effort is praiseworthy, but so excessively tardy that it is perfectly useless,\u201d a collective of linguists wrote in the Liberation newspaper on Thursday.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 03:55:04 GMT",
    "summary": "Before Tupac's murder, producer Quincy Jones brought stars together to try to end violence in hip-hop.",
    "story": [
      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

      "The tame white whale, which locals named Hvaldimir, made headlines five years ago amidst widespread speculation that it was a Russian spy.",
      "Now an expert in the species says she believes the whale did indeed belong to the military and escaped from a naval base in the Arctic Circle.",
      "But Dr Olga Shpak does not believe it was a spy. She believes the beluga was being trained to guard the base and fled because it was a \"hooligan\".",
      "Seeking sanctuary for whale dubbed a Russian spy",
      "Russia has always refused to confirm or deny that the beluga whale was trained by its military.",
      "But Dr Shpak, who worked in Russia researching marine mammals from the 1990s until she returned to her native Ukraine in 2022, told BBC News: \u201cFor me it\u2019s 100% (certain).\u201d",
      "Dr Shpak, whose account is based on conversations with friends and former colleagues, features in a BBC documentary, Secrets of the Spy Whale, which is now on BBC iPlayer and being shown on BBC Two on Wednesday at 21:00 GMT.",
      "Secrets of the Spy Whale",
      "The mysterious whale first came to public attention five years ago when it approached fishermen off the northern coast of Norway.",
      "\u201cThe whale starts rubbing against the boat,\u201d Joar Hesten, one of the fishermen, says. \u201cI heard about animals in distress that instinctively knew that they need help from humans. I was thinking that this is one smart whale.\u201d",
      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",

      "When does he become president again?",
      "Who has Trump appointed to his top team so far?",
      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "In his first two years, Trump passed a signature tax bill - reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, and cutting some taxes on individuals.",
      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",
      "In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",
      "He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.",
      "The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.",
      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",
      "All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years. But, as recent history indicates, these trifectas don't last all that long. The incoming administration will want to get a move on.",

      "Thornton's character works in the world of oil rigs, securing land and overseeing everyone from workers to billionaires who fuel the oil industry. The role was made with Thornton in mind since Sheridan wrote the role specifically for him.",
      "\"He said, 'I'm going to write it in your voice.' So when I read the first script, sure enough, it's like, yeah, if I were a landman, I think I'd try to be like that,\" said Thornton.",

      "PREFACE",
      "Los Angeles, Summer 1956",
      "Staring at the television open-mouthed, I let my peanut butter and jelly sandwich drop onto the plate in my lap as chills ran up and down my body.",
      "Home alone after school, I was sitting cross-legged (my favorite position, still) on the floor in front of the TV enjoying the peace and quiet and watching my favorite show, American Bandstand. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, Ray Charles,\" Dick Clark announced as the camera panned to a handsome man in sunglasses sitting at a piano.",
      "\"Georgia, Georgia . . . ,\" he began, and I burst into tears. I couldn't believe he was singing a song about my mom. As tears dripped onto my sandwich, I'd never felt more connected to anything in my life. Ray Charles's voice and the melody seemed to express exactly how I felt.",
      "It took me weeks to get over seeing him sing, and in some ways, I never did, but then someone whose songs I first heard on the radio blew a hole in my understanding of the world and I was never, ever the same. As I stared at the TV with my mom watching The Ed Sullivan Show, a popular young singer named Elvis Presley filled the screen. Mom and I were two of the sixty million Americans who witnessed that historic performance in September 1956.",
      "Even though Elvis was dressed quite traditionally that Sunday night, he looked and moved differently than any performer I'd ever seen. He began by singing \"Don't Be Cruel,\" and by the time he broke into \"Love Me Tender,\" I felt as if he was singing only to me. I wanted to jump right into the TV and be Elvis.",
      "When I heard a year later that he was giving a concert at the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles, I rushed home with stars in my eleven-year-old eyes. \"Mom, Mom! Elvis is going to be at the Pan-Pacific! Can we go? . . . Please?\" I was convinced that I had to be there. Secretly, I thought that he would spot me in the crowd and pick me, although I'm sure that's what every girl thought.",
      "Luckily for me, my thirty-one-year-old mother was as crazy about Elvis as I was, a fact that impressed my friends because their moms didn't approve of his raw sexuality. To this day I don't know where she found the money, but somehow Georgia did. Mom and I dressed up and made our way into town, more like sisters than mother and daughter. Feeling the tension grow the closer we got to the Fairfax District, we soon found ourselves caught up in a pulsing mob of nine thousand noisy girls.",
      "We were swept inside the auditorium on a wave of pure adrenaline. Our folding seats were about halfway back in the audience, but that was fine by me. Looking around at all the girls gazing in anticipation at the darkened stage, I could feel my heart pounding inside my flat little chest\u2014a sensation I was to become all too familiar with later in life.",
      "The stage was dark, but when the spotlights hit him, Elvis was there and he was magic. There was a roar from the crowd that was like nothing I had ever heard. An explosion of flashbulbs went off. I only wished I'd brought our little Kodak Brownie. Elvis was standing there in his famous gold suit, which was shimmering and changing color in the spotlights.",
      "He was so handsome with that amazing smile and lustrous black hair, exactly the same color as mine. Everyone around us jumped to their feet and started screaming so hysterically that we could hardly hear a word of \"Heartbreak Hotel.\" But, boy, we could see his moves\u2014the way he gyrated his hips and shook his legs so that they quivered. Not content with making as much noise as they could, the girls began jumping up onto their chairs for a better view, which meant that from then on, we could only see Elvis's head and shoulders.",
      "Being in the middle of that shrieking crowd was like being caught up in a massive swivel-hipped tidal wave, swept along with the hysteria toward the stage. I had no idea why everyone was acting so insane. I was too young to get that part of it, truthfully (but if I had been three years older and my mom had been three years younger, we would have fainted). It was the most exciting experience I'd ever had because I knew that I wanted to be on that stage in the spotlight one day too.",
      "When I looked over at my mother, she was down for the count. We were both mesmerized. She looked so beautiful dressed in some amazing outfit that of all the girls in the place, including me, I felt sure that Elvis would have picked her.",
      "Pressing my mouth to her ear so that she could hear, I cupped my hand over it and yelled, \"Mom, can we stand on our seats and scream, too?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied, grinning like a teenager and taking off her high heels. \"Come on, let's do it!\" So we did, straining on our tip-toes to see him.",
      "Glowing with happiness, I tried to work out if Elvis would be too old to marry me by the time I was grown, so that he could sing to me every day. Dreaming of being Mrs. Presley, I couldn't stop talking to Mom about Elvis for weeks as I floated around on a gold lam\u00e9 cloud.",

      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \"cutie marks\" on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",
      "The collectibles were recognized for encouraging fantasy and storytelling \u2014 the kind of creative play the Hall of Fame demands of inductees \u2014 along with popularity over time.",
      "\"The My Little Pony line has endured for decades because it combines several traditional forms of doll play with children's fascination with horses,\" said Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, curator of dolls and toys. \"The variety of figures promotes collecting as a pastime, too.\"",
      "Transformers",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids' imaginations and fantasy play.\"",
      "Phase 10",
      "Also inducted was Phase 10, which was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur\u00a0Ken Johnson\u00a0in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\" said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 10:06:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Cheers\" actor's new series is the Netflix comedy \"A Man on the Inside,\" in which he plays a retired widower-turned-investigator who goes undercover in a nursing home.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting down to talk about his new TV show, Ted Danson admits he is nervous. Why? \"Because I want people to see it, I really do,\" he said. \"I think it's an important conversation.\"",
      "It's strange to think of Danson as nervous about anything, but in this case, it's not hard to see why: his latest project means a lot to him, about a subject that touches everyone. In the new Netflix series \"A Man on the Inside,\" Danson is a recently-retired widower without much to do, until he answers an ad from a private investigator, and becomes a mole inside a nursing home.",
      "Like a lot of TV series, the premise seems a little far-fetched, but this one's true: it's based on \"The Mole Agent,\" a 2020 documentary about a real-life 83-year-old who goes undercover in a Chilean nursing home looking for signs of patients being mistreated. What the documentary found was a group of elderly people fighting loneliness and loss with heart and humor.",
      "\"A Man on the Inside\" is no different, says series creator Mike Schur. \"I would say the purpose of this show is simply to discuss a subject that very few people discuss, which is aging,\" said Schur. \"It's this subject that we just don't like to talk about. It's thought of in this country (I think more than other countries) as something almost shameful or embarrassing.\"",
      "\"If you're dying, you somehow made a mistake,\" said Danson.",
      "\"You screwed up! Yeah, you screwed up, you got old, you know?\" Schur said. \"And I think that's weird, because this is what happens if we're lucky. If we're lucky, we get old!\"",
      "At 76, Danson himself is aging gracefully, with an attitude inspired by a Hollywood legend: Jane Fonda. \"She was turning 80, and at 70 I was starting to go, 'Well, I'd better look for a nice place to land, you know, this life plane,' or whatever,\" he said. \"And I looked at her and it was like, no. She has her foot on the gas pedal! She's, like, doing a 12-hour day, shooting her show, jumping on a bus to go, you know, support the service industry in Sacramento with a handful of women.",
      "\"Don't slow down, just keep going, keep living your life. I think that's one of the things our elders can pass on to us. This is how you live life right up until the end.\"",
      "Seems like Danson's elders set a good example: his parents wouldn't allow a TV in their home. \"My mother didn't like them,\" he said. \"She'd rather you read, or go out and play, or be creative.\"",
      "But then, Danson got famous, on TV. \u00a0His parents finally got one. \"But they put kind of this beautiful tapestry over the front of it, so when you walked in their house, you didn't see a TV, you saw this beautiful tapestry with a candle on top, and they would take it off and watch 'Cheers,'\" he said.",
      "Danson still credits his success today to that one show about a Boston bar. But since he hung up his bartender apron in 1993, he's been in hit after hit. He was the title character in \"Becker.\" In \"Damages,\" he held his own with Glenn Close. He went to heaven and hell in \"The Good Place.\" And he's even played himself in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",
      "Along the way Danson has used his fame to draw attention to his passion project, Oceana, an organization dedicated to preserving the world's oceans. Asked if he feels they have made progress, he replied, \"Yes. I mean, our focus is fishing, over-fishing, making sure that the fisheries of the world are healthy. Because if done right, you could feed a billion people a fish meal every day.\"",
      "That sounds a little like a miracle \u2013 something he touches on in his new show, and something he says he lives with every day.",
      "Asked what are the miracles in his life, Danson replied, \"Mary Steenburgen is, you know, literally heaven-sent. I did some work on myself for about a year before I met her, after 'Cheers,' becoming emotionally mature and real. And I worked hard at it. And then along came Mary Steenburgen. \u2026 We are so blessed. To love somebody and to be loved, is just one of those heaven-on-earth miracles, you know? And that came with Mary.\"",
      "And the idea Ted Danson is hoping to share with his latest project is that miracles can be found in any life, right up until the very end. \"This is your life,\" he said, \"not just up to, you know, 65 and then you retire and are going down. No, you get to live right up until you don't live. And it's your life. It's such a gift. Explore it, and be excited about it. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's sad. Yes, there's grief. Yes, there's all of that. But embrace it. Embrace it, is kind of what I think the message of the show is. It's what I hope I live with.\"",
      "He got emotional sharing that. \"I'm just emotional 'cause I finally said something I wanted to say!\" he laughed.",

      "Just about everyone in music worshipped the work of the late, great Quincy Jones, among them Frank Sinatra, who not only gave the fabled musician and producer the nickname \"Q,\" but also bequeathed him a ring bearing the Sinatra family crest when Sinatra died in 1998.",
      "Asked by \"Sunday Morning\" in 2008 what it was like to work with the Chairman of the Board, Jones replied, \"You know, he had no gray. He either loved you or rolled over you in a Mack truck in reverse. There was nothing in-between!\"",
      "Jones was behind the scores for some 30 motion pictures, along with theme songs for TV classics like \"Ironside\" and \"Sanford and Son.\"",
      "In 1985 he brought the world's biggest stars together for \"We Are the World\" to raise money for famine relief \u2013 a feat all the more remarkable considering a decade earlier he had suffered two brain aneurysms so severe his doctors gave him only a one-percent chance of survival.",
      "Loving friends had actually scheduled a memorial, a service that \u2013 some 30 days after being stricken \u2013 the recovering Jones was strong enough to attend, to enjoy songs from guests like Marvin Gaye, Sarah Vaughan and Ray Charles.",

    "story": [
      "T Bone Burnett is best known as a music producer, but in April, he released \"The Other Side,\" his first album of new music in 18 years. Asked why he releases his own music so infrequently, Burnett replied, \"I've always been a behind-the-scenes person. I like creating in private.\"",
      "Maybe even more remarkable, this fall, he's touring behind it.",
      "He was quoted earlier this year saying he always viewed the audience as a mob coming to get him. \"Yeah, like a lynch mob or something,\" he laughed. \"It was just raw paranoia, but also just insecurity.\"",
      "Burnett is more at home in the studio, where he's produced albums for The Wallflowers, Greg Allman, and Elton John.",
      "Asked what he thinks he can get out of musicians that maybe other people don't, Burnett said, \"Well, what I try to get out of them is just their full love, their full being.\"",
      "He certainly did with Robert Plant and Alison Krauss on \"Raising Sand,\" and won the Grammy for album of the year in 2009:",
      "He described \"accidentally\" ending up in the commercial mainstream in a big way a couple of times. \"I mean, it's always a fluke, but, yes, I have.\"",
      "\"Has that surprised you?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Yeah. Well, in a way, there have been times when you see around a corner, like with 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'\"",
      "Burnett produced and curated the music for the 2000 Coen Brothers film:",
      "\"When the Coens came and said they wanted to do a movie about the history of American music, I thought, oh, this all fits together,\" said Burnett.",

      "Mason asked, \"When you're working on a TV project or a film, what do you see the role of music as? Is it an effective character in a way?\"",
      "\"Yeah, sometimes it is,\" said Burnett. \"It's always the subconscious, the unconscious of the character.\"",

      "\"That was a vibe and it had to do with the swamp, and it had to do with the darkness of it all.\"",
      "\"Sounds kind of fun, actually!\"",
      "\"It was so fun!\" Burnett laughed. \"That's what I mean. It's fun to do the dark world, you know, as long as you don't have to actually live in it!\"",
      "Joseph Henry Burnett III grew up in Fort Worth, Texas. He can't recall how he got his nickname T Bone.",

Isn't that crazy? You know, I'm just sonically oriented.\"",
      "In 1975, Bob Dylan recruited Burnett to play guitar in his \"Rolling Thunder\" revue, starting a lifelong friendship. In 2021, they played together again, re-recording Dylan's classic, \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" using a special high fidelity analog system that Burnett says creates the highest quality audio ever.",
      "\"We decided to just make one disc; there are no copies,\" he said. \"The germ of it was, I wanted to do something that couldn't be put online. It couldn't be commoditized. I'm not doing this to keep it away from anybody. I'm just doing it to work at the highest possible level.\"\u00a0The disc sold at auction in 2022 for nearly $1.8 million.",
      "Burnett said, \"I love the process of recording. I love going into a room where there's nothing, and then you come out and there's something.\"",
      "\"It's a mystical kind of thing,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Yeah, it is to me. And you build a world of resonance, and that's the stuff that's the most thrilling to me, and the part of life that a machine will never comprehend.\"",
      "T Bone Burnett's new record earned a Grammy nomination this past week for best Americana album, and at 76, he's even starting to enjoy another sound \u2026 the sound of a crowd. \"I think I had a much more benevolent view of the audience than I used to have,\" he said.",
      "\"And that's because you're just not overthinking it?\" asked Mason.",
      "\"Yeah. That's exactly right!\" he laughed.",

      "Kennedy has insisted that he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and has pledged not to ban vaccines under Trump. Instead, Kennedy has promised to \"restore the transparency\" around vaccine safety data and records that he accuses HHS officials of hiding.",

      "\"They do what they do to protect the American people. Not for any kind of nefarious purpose. And during the COVID pandemic, people worked 14 hours a day,\" Marks said of the agency's staff.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Allowing enhanced subsidies for health insurance bought through ACA marketplaces to expire would cause premiums to soar, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "A deadly E. coli outbreak linked to slivered onions on McDonald's Quarter Pounder burgers has sickened 104 people in 14 states, federal health officials said in an update on Wednesday.",
      "At least 34 people have been hospitalized, and four developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious condition that can cause kidney failure. An 88-year-old man who resided in Grand Junction, Colorado, died, as previously reported. The illnesses began at the end of September, and the most recent onset of illness occurred as of October 21, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",
      "McDonald's in late October said its Quarter Pounders \u2014 without slivered onions \u2014 would return to the menus of hundreds of its impacted restaurants after testing ruled out beef patties as the source of the outbreak.",
      "The hamburger chain pulled the burgers from restaurants in several states after the outbreak was announced.",
      "The FDA and Colorado officials have collected onion and environmental samples from McDonald's stores and distribution centers. One sample of recalled onions tested positive for E. coli, but did not match the outbreak strain.",
      "Onion supplier Taylor Farms recalled yellow onions in the wake of the outbreak, and McDonald's has reintroduced slivered onions from a different supplier.",
      "\"There does not appear to be a continued food safety concern related to this outbreak at McDonald's restaurants,\" the FDA stated.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night obtained by CBS News, McDonald's said it had found an \"alternate supplier\" for the approximately 900 restaurants which had temporarily stopped serving Quarter Pounders with slivered onions",
      "\"Over the past week, these restaurants resumed the sale of Quarter Pounder burgers with slivered onions,\" McDonald's said.",
      "It usually takes three to four weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak. Most people infected with the toxin-producing E. coli experience severe stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. Most recover without treatment after five to seven days.",
      "People are advised to call their health care provider if they ate a McDonald's Quarter Pounder and have severe\u00a0E. coli symptoms.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 20:43:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Overdose deaths have slowed 18% since a peak last year, the CDC estimates.",
    "story": [
      "Opioid overdose deaths have now slowed to the lowest levels nationwide since 2020, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This marks the 12th straight month of decline since a peak last year.",
      "Around 70,655 deaths linked to opioids like heroin and fentanyl were reported for the year ending June 2024, the CDC now estimates, falling 18% from the same time in 2023.",
      "Almost all states, except for a handful in the West from Alaska through Nevada, are now seeing a significant decrease in overdose death rates. Early data from Canada also suggests overdose deaths there might now be slowing off of a peak in 2023 too.",
      "\"While these data are cause for optimism, we must not lose sight of the fact that nearly 100,000 people are still estimated to be dying annually from drug overdose in the U.S.\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a statement.",
      "Other types of drug overdoses beyond opioids are also slowing. While they make up a smaller share of overall deaths, overdoses linked to drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine are also showing signs of dropping nationwide following a peak last year.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this data, but boy, it is time to double down on the things that we know are working. It is not a time to pull back, and I feel very strongly, and our data shows, that the threat continues to evolve,\" Dr. Allison Arwady, head of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, told CBS News.",
      "Arwady pointed to a long list of factors that officials hope are contributing to the decline, ranging from broader availability of the overdose reversing spray naloxone, also known as Narcan, to efforts to ease gaps in access to medications that can treat opioid use disorder.",
      "Trends in what health officials call \"primary prevention\" have also improved in recent years \u2014 meaning fewer people using the drugs to begin with. As an example, Arwady cited CDC surveys showing a clear decline in high school students reporting that they have tried illegal drugs.",
      "The CDC and health departments have also gotten faster at gathering and analyzing data to respond to surges in overdoses, Arwady said, often caused by new so-called \"adulterants\" that are mixed in. Health authorities study this by testing blood and drug samples taken in the wake of surges, in search of potential emerging drug threats.",
      "Agency researchers are now looking closer at what could be behind gaps in communities that are still not seeing slowdowns, Arwady said.",
      "\"Unfortunately, for the most affected groups, namely Native Americans and Black American men, the death rates are not decreasing and are at the highest recorded levels,\" said Volkow.",
      "Why are drug overdose deaths declining?",
      "In the months since CDC data first began showing real signs of a nationwide change to the deadly record wave of opioid overdose deaths, experts have floated a number of theories to explain what caused the change.",
      "\"We had been seeing the numbers go down, on the national aggregate level, since last April, and we were skeptical and kind of holding our tongues. Then we started hearing from a lot of folks on the ground, frontline providers,'\" said Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who studies opioid overdose deaths.",
      "Dasgupta led an analysis in September by the university's Opioid Data Lab illustrating the nationwide scope of the downturn and probing a number of theories that might explain it.",
      "Some explanations they dismissed as unlikely, like stepped-up law enforcement operations. Other ideas they judged as plausible, but complicated to prove, like a so-called \"depletion of susceptibles\" \u2014 essentially the epidemic burning itself out, as users either found ways to survive the influx of fentanyl or died \u2014 or the wider availability of naloxone.",
      "Dasgupta said they received a flood of interest since their initial post proposing more theories, like new scanners that were deployed on the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "There are likely a number of factors all playing a role in the shift, Dasgupta says. But he said early data from research they are wrapping up now supports one leading explanation: a shift in the illegal drug supply.",
      "\"Our hypothesis is that something has changed in the drug supply. This kind of pronounced shift, something that happens suddenly, if numbers had suddenly shot up, we would definitely be pointing to a change in the drug supply to explain it,\" said Dasgupta.",
      "Amid its downsides, xylazine's rise might have led to less injection drug use, they speculate. Its longer high could also be reducing the number of times people use fentanyl each day.",
      "\"We're not in our offices celebrating. We're still losing too many people that we love. So I just want it to be very clear that with like a hundred thousand people still dying, that's obscenely high,\" he said.",

      "23andMe, the struggling ancestry tracing company, continues to spiral, raising questions about its business prospects and what could happen to its sensitive customer genetic testing data.",
      "23andMe on Tuesday announced it is slashing 40% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan. The move comes after its entire board resigned in September. Its stock price has since plunged, prompting speculation that the company could be acquired by another buyer and sparking concern among customers about the security of their genetic information.",
      "CEO Anne Wojcicki has said she intends to take the company private and is not considering third-party takeover proposals.",
      "Customer data collected from its genetic testing tools makes up the company's most valuable asset. Because 23andMe is not a health care company, health privacy laws don't apply, raising questions about what the business might opt to do with its 15 million users' personal genetic data.",
      "Under 23andMe's current user agreement, users must opt-in to allow the company to share their personal DNA or data. The agreement states that if the company is acquired, customers' data may be accessed or sold as part of such a transaction.",
      "23andMe told CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady that while there are no plans for a sale, the current privacy agreement would apply.",
      "Meanwhile, at least 11 states have passed privacy laws that would require customers' consent before their genetic data is transferred.",
      "Still, experts say a new owner could change 23andMe's privacy terms following a sale, potentially putting the onus on consumers to push back against any move to share their data.",
      "23andMe said that roughly 80% of its customers consent to participate in the company's research program, which it said has generated more than 270 peer-reviewed publications uncovering new genetic insights into disease. Any data that shared is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual customers, according to the company.",
      "Still, users can can take additional steps to protect their data, including deleting their 23andMe accounts \u2014 a process that is automated and straightforward.",
      "\"If, at any time, you are no longer interested in participating in our Services, you may delete your 23andMe account directly within your Account Settings,\" the company states on its website.",
      "That requires you to log in to your account and submit a request. The company then emails you a data deletion request confirmation, which you must verify.",
      "\"They'll get rid of your sample, they'll delete all of your personal information and they will close the account,\" O'Grady said.",
      "23andMe, which went public in 2021, has struggled to generate profits, with most buyers of its saliva-based testing kits only needing to make a single purchase. The company reported a net loss of $667 million for its last fiscal year, more than double the loss of $312 million for the year prior.",
      "23andMe posted another loss in quarterly earnings released Tuesday. The company reported a net loss of $59.1 million for the 2025 fiscal year's second quarter, compared to a loss of $75.3 million for the same year prior.",

      "Health officials had been hoping for improved COVID-19 vaccination rates this year, after authorities worked to launch this year's COVID shots closer to when the annual flu shot is also shipped out to doctor's offices and pharmacies.",
      "Last year's round of COVID-19 vaccines did not get off the ground in many places until late September, long after providers had already begun offering flu shots. CDC officials said that led to confusing messaging and logistical fumbles that may have hampered vaccination rates.",

      "All are under the banner of fighting what Kennedy sees as a common thread behind a broad swath of ailments: that Americans have been \"mass poisoned by big pharma and big food,\" and that federal agencies have failed to stop it. In response, he has also floated a number of specific policy ideas to remake the federal government's public health institutions.",
      "\"[Trump] asked me to end the chronic disease epidemic in this country. And he said, I want to see results, measurable results in the diminishment of chronic disease within two years. And I said, Mr. President, I will do that,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",

      "\"I'm going to urge President Trump on day one to do the same thing they did in COVID, which is to declare a national emergency, but not for infectious disease, but for chronic disease,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 26.",

      "Trump agrees with his plans to \"get the chemicals out\" of America's food supply, Kennedy says, which also includes upending the use of common pesticides and herbicides by American farmers.",

      "\"When he ate any kind of pasta in this country, he would get these terrible, terrible outbreaks, you know, really agonizing. And he moved to Italy and he lived off of pasta for a year and a half and he never got a case,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy suspects that was caused by glyphosate, used in Roundup brand weed-killers, which Italy moved to start restricting in 2016. Italy's decision was over worries that it could pose a cancer risk, and some advocacy groups in the U.S. have also voiced similar concerns.",
      "Agricultural trade associations have defended glyphosate as \"one of the safest, most effective\" tools farmers have to manage weeds and support \"important conservation practices.\"",
      "Kennedy's plea to crack down on food additives and chemicals comes as the FDA is in the middle of launching its own new effort \u2014 and is calling on Congress to step up funding for \u2014 scrutinizing chemicals currently allowed in foods.",
      "Food industry groups have generally voiced support for the FDA to step up its vetting of chemicals in food, in hopes that it \"negates the ill advised and disruptive state by state patchwork\" of legislatures drawing up their own restrictions.",
      "Reducing unhealthy and processed foods in federal programs",
      "Kennedy has also promised to \"get processed food out of school lunch immediately\" and voiced frustration over the amount of federal food assistance for low-income Americans that goes towards sugary drinks and processed food.",
      "One way Kennedy could try to get at this issue is through the federal dietary guidelines process, jointly run by the USDA and HHS, which is in the final stages of crafting the next edition of recommendations that influence a broad range of government nutrition programs.",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be eating grains. They should definitely not be eating seed oils. And they for sure should not be eating sugar. And yet that is what we're forcing them to eat,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "On seed oils, Kennedy has claimed that the switch away from oils like beef tallow which were high in saturated fats in favor of vegetable oils was a mistake, and is to blame for a rise in obesity rates. That puts him at odds with longstanding recommendations to limit saturated fats.",
      "\"The guidance around this has been reviewed many times since, and has only become stronger in its conclusion for the role of saturated fat, particularly in its relationship with higher risks of cardiovascular disease,\" Deirdre Tobias, a researcher on this year's Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, said last month.",
      "Grains have been more divisive at this year's committee and the broader scientific community, which has debated setting lower limits to overall grain consumption alongside recommendations to switch from refined to whole grains.",
      "Setting new limits is difficult, scientists on the panel have said, because the only source of some key nutrients for many Americans is cereals and breads fortified with vitamins.",
      "Kennedy has also been critical of the panel of outside researchers put together to create the scientific report underpinning the recommendations, but acknowledges broader changes will also be needed to move the needle.",
      "While Kennedy says he personally would \"never eat anything in a package\" as a rule of thumb, he acknowledges \"most people don't have access to the resources I have.\"",
      "\"We need to start forcing these companies to internalize their costs. So the illusion of cheap food goes away, right? Because if you're drinking Coke and it seems cheap and it gives you diabetes over the long run, that's not very cheap,\" he said on Sept. 30.",
      "Curbing the influence of drugmakers",
      "Kennedy has called for a \"review\" of guidelines that govern advertising by pharmaceutical companies.",
      "The FDA currently regulates advertising about prescription drugs, going after drugmakers that misrepresent their products. Responsibility for some other medical products is shared between the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "Kennedy has urged Trump to go further, saying he is advising the president-elect to \"ban pharmaceutical advertising on TV\" over concerns that it is influencing news coverage of health issues.",
      "He has also urged reform of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which charges pharmaceutical companies millions of dollars for the cost of the FDA vetting their applications to decide whether to approve new drugs.",
      "\"We need to end the corruption. 50% of FDA's budget comes not from the taxpayer, but from the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said on Sept. 26.",
      "Kennedy has not said how Congress or the Trump administration would make up the difference from the fees if they were cut, which amount to around $3 billion out of FDA's budget.",
      "Undoing the fees could leave taxpayers effectively subsidizing a hefty bill previously paid for by drugmakers \u2014 or a return to the significant delays for new medications that initially spurred the creation of the fees.",
      "Promoting alternatives to drugs",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of waging a \"war on public health\" which he says includes \"aggressive suppression\" of anything \"that advances human health and can't be patented by Pharma.\"",
      "In his view, that includes treatments like psychedelics, which recently fell short of FDA approval, and foods like raw milk, which officials have stepped up warnings against amid this year's unprecedented bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Kennedy has also praised the dietary supplement industry for a court win against the FDA, after the agency tried to take action against what it said was an illegally marketed anti-aging drug.",
      "Also on Kennedy's list are things like \"clean foods\" and exercise, which he wants to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover.",
      "The promise has echoes of the \"food is medicine\" initiative, which has called for the health care system to offer more financial support for healthier lifestyle habits.",
      "\"If a doctor's patient has diabetes or obesity, the doctor ought to be able to say, I'm going to recommend gym membership, and I'm going to recommend, good food and Medicaid ought to be able to finance those things the same as they would Ozempic,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to promote healthier lifestyles in other ways, ranging from requiring nutrition classes in federally funded medical schools to reviving the presidential fitness test in schools.",
      "\"Informed choices\" on vaccines",
      "Kennedy has a long record criticizing the safety of vaccines, including recent misleading claims that shots have an \"exemption from pre-licensing safety testing\" before they are approved.",
      "In fact, the FDA requires new vaccines be studied for their safety and efficacy in large trials, results of which are published in peer-reviewed journals and publicly disclosed.",
      "His activism on the issue dates back decades, including a now-retracted article he published in Rolling Stone in 2005 claiming a link between autism and an ingredient called thimerosal that had been used in vaccines before 2001 \u2014 which medical research has disproven. His focus has broadened since then.",
      "\"This doesn't mean vaccines is the only cause of autism. Our kids today are swimming around in a toxic soup coming mainly from their foods that operate along the same biological pathways. But some of it's coming from pharmaceutical drugs,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 19.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that is not \"anti-vaccine\" and would not seek to ban them under Trump, instead saying he wants to \"restore the transparency\" around them \u2014 echoing lawsuits by the group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, over its Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "\"[Trump] doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country. You ought to know the risks and benefits of everything you take,\" Kennedy said on Nov. 2.",
      "But Kennedy has also asserted \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective,\" and encouraged people to \"resist\" CDC guidelines on vaccines for kids \u2014 raising concern among public health officials, who point to the success of vaccination in saving millions of children worldwide from debilitating illness or premature death from preventable diseases.",
      "Opposing water fluoridation",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy said one of Trump's first acts in the White House would be to \"advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water.\"",
      "While a number of health risks have been tied to higher levels of fluoride, most are extremely rare in the U.S. and involve far greater exposure than what is added to drinking water.",
      "Fluoride has been incorporated into a majority of U.S. water systems for decades. The American Dental Association estimates that the practice has reduced tooth decay by about 25%, though some research suggests modern use of toothpaste with fluoride has reduced the policy's benefits.",
      "Kennedy's announcement does come as the Environmental Protection Agency is now under a federal court order to take action over one specific risk: the concern that fluoride might lower children's IQ \"at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" stemming in large part from a report published by the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Beyond influencing what rule the Trump administration's EPA ends up pursuing in response to the order, Kennedy could also take aim at fluoride through another route: changing the CDC's widely-cited statement about the practice, which hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest \"public health achievements of the 20th century.\"",
      "Kennedy himself has described fluoride as \"a poison\" and praised the nonprofits for suing over the issue.",
      "\"The simple answer is I don't like it,\" Kennedy said on Sept. 30.",

    "story": [
      "Idit Negrin would try anything to beat the trauma haunting her since attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, when Hamas massacred hundreds of civilians. \"We saw the terrorists, and they started shooting at us,\" she said. She ran for her life.",
      "Afterwards, \"I woke up every night, every night around 3 o'clock screaming and sweating and shaking. I think after a day, or two days after, I felt that I'm falling down, crying.\"",
      "We met her this summer as she was two-thirds of the way through her 60-session course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). It's a treatment long used to combat compression sickness in divers, and wounds that will not heal. But at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, in Be'er Ya'akov, Israel, they're now also treating a very different malady: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.",
      "Negrin described her experiences with PTSD: \"You feel like you're going crazy. I call people and scream, 'There is a terror attack again!' And then you understand that you have no control of your brain.\"",
      "Negrin is trying to regain that control, along with about 650 other October 7th survivors suffering from PTSD who are being treated, for free, alongside military veterans at the Sagol Center \u2013 currently the largest hyperbaric center worldwide.",
      "Dr. Shai Efrati runs this clinic, where they're treating up to 350 patients a day, and are on the forefront of this sort of medicine. \"What we are doing is actually tricking the body,\" Efrati said. \"Hypoxia, lack of oxygen, is the most powerful trigger to induce all the repair mechanism cascade.\"",
      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",
      "Efrati said, \"The decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted at the similar level as hypoxia, as lack of oxygen. That causes the body to trigger the stem cells, and for the first time even in humans, we can see generation of new neurons, generation of new blood vessels in the brain. And this is mind-blowing.\"",
      "The treatment has been described as \"unapproved\" and \"not proven.\" \"When we speak about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, this is how it should look like,\" Efrati said.",
      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",

      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 21:45:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head an effort, dubbed DOGE, to reduce wasteful federal spending. Here's what it's about.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is vowing to reduce wasteful federal spending by tapping two billionaires \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 to spearhead the initiative, which the president-elect is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The appointments, announced by Trump on Tuesday, raise a host of questions about the effort, including whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal outlays, given that Congress authorizes the nation's spending, as well as where the businessmen might look to cut spending. Under the plan, meanwhile, DOGE is not an official government department, raising questions about its powers and how it will operate.",
      "Speaking Thursday night at Mar-a-Lago at a gala hosted by the right-leaning think tank the America First Policy Institute, Ramaswamy thanked Trump \"for making sure that Elon Musk and I are in a position to start the mass deportations of millions of unelected federal bureaucrats out of the D.C. bureaucracy.\"",
      "\"And I don't know if you've got to know Elon yet, but he doesn't bring a chisel, he brings a chainsaw, and we're going to be taking it to that bureaucracy,\" Ramaswamy added. \"It's going to be a lot of fun.\"",
      "The announcement comes a week after Trump won a second term\u00a0as president, with voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the economy under the Biden administration. As part of his campaign vows, Trump promised to slash government spending. Musk's bio on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022, now reads, \"The people voted for major government reform.\"",
      "\"Frankly, it does need to be done again, so every few decades you really need to look at everything,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But Kamarck harbors reservations about Musk and Ramaswamy's mandate, especially after the former recently suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 almost one-third of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual spending. Two-thirds of that spending is mandatory through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "\"This is the first warning sign that this is going to be a failed operation,\" Kamarck said. \"That's insane.\"",
      "Speaking on transformational change within government and organizations, Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia University's Columbia Business School, noted there are two models: a bottom-up, grassroots effort and a top-down strategy \u2014 sometimes called a shock-change approach. DOGE likely belongs to the latter, according to Morris, who is also author of the nonfiction book \"Tribal,\" about how people form and relate to each other through group dynamics.",
      "\"Unless you have a new leader with incredible legitimacy and the status quo with no legitimacy, you rarely have people responding well to shock therapy,\" he said. \"It's hard to see it happening in this case \u2014 I don't think Musk is going to be able to form a deep knowledge of government.\"",
      "The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Trump announced the DOGE in a statement on Tuesday, describing it as an effort to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "The name is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin has more than tripled in price during the last month, and now trades at 38 cents.)",
      "Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy's work \"will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,\" or by the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump only outlined the initiative's contours and didn't disclose how it will be staffed or funded. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request about the DOGE's funding or whether Musk or Ramaswamy will be paid for their work on the effort.",
      "On Thursday, an X account for DOGE said the group is accepting resumes from \"super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.\" In a separate post, Musk said \"compensation is zero.\"",
      "Can the DOGE actually cut federal spending?",
      "At the moment, that appears unlikely given that the DOGE isn't a real government department, which would need to be created by congressional approval. Federal spending is authorized by Congress, and senators and House representatives may hesitate to support cuts to major programs like Social Security or Medicare, which are popular with millions of voters, or to the nation's military.",
      "It's also not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "That doesn't amount to much, Kamarck said.",
      "\"They have no authority \u2014 none whatsoever,\" she added, while noting that the backing of the president can help convince lawmakers to throw their support behind efficiency efforts.",
      "However, Trump's aides are reportedly working on a way to enact some of DOGE's spending recommendations without requiring congressional approval, the Washington Post reported.",
      "What have Musk and Ramaswamy said about federal spending?",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $319 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has described the U.S. government as bloated and said it its spending is unsustainable. The Tesla founder also said he wants to reduce the number of federal agencies to 99, down from more than 400.",
      "\"There are so many [agencies] that people have never heard of, and that have overlapping areas of responsibilities,\" Musk\u00a0said earlier this month.",
      "While on the campaign trail with Trump, Musk also\u00a0said\u00a0he could cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the annual budget. \"Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency will fix that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk is known for cost-cutting at his own companies, slashing\u00a0most of X's workforce after he bought the business two years ago as well as focusing on manufacturing costs at Tesla. Even so, those efforts have had mixed results, with X's valuation falling by about 80% since his purchase. Tesla's stock price, meanwhile, has surged 48% in the past year, bumping its value above $1 trillion.",
      "Ramaswamy, whom Forbes says has a net worth of about $1 billion, dropped out of the presidential race in January after running on an \"anti-woke\"\u00a0campaign. He also advocated for government cuts by eliminating the Department of Education, a goal shared by President-elect Trump.",
      "Have administrations previously tried to cut costs?",
      "Yes, both Republican and Democratic presidents have created efforts to cut government spending.",
      "In 1982, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, led by wealthy businessman J. Peter Grace, the CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a chemicals business. About 150 business people volunteered for the commission, which ultimately recommended 2,500 reforms, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.",
      "\"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented,\" the library notes. \"However, the Commission's work provided a starting point for many conservative critiques of the federal government.\"",
      "In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review with the goal to create a government that would work better and cost less, Kamarck said. The group was staffed with civil servants who understood the bureaucracy, and many of whom had frustrations with it, she added.",
      "The group had some successes in streamlining operations and paring costs, eventually cutting more than 300,000 jobs, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service. Kamarck noted that the group also focused on integrating technology into departments at a time when the internet was just emerging, leading to efficiencies such as online tax filing.",
      "Where could the Trump administration cut spending?",
      "While experts are skeptical of Musk's claim he can cut $2 trillion in spending, they also point out there are opportunities to look at efficiencies.",

      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their financial assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",

      "Sealed bids were opened Wednesday at the auction, which had been\u00a0approved by a bankruptcy court earlier this year to allow the Sandy Hook families to receive payments from Jones. The conspiracy theorist and his company filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after losing defamation and emotional distress lawsuits by Sandy Hook families after he repeatedly called the Connecticut school shooting a hoax staged by \"crisis actors.\"",
      "The purchase was confirmed by conspiracy theorist Jones, who posted a video on X saying that The Onion bought his company. \"The Connecticut Democrats with the Onion newspaper bought us,\" he said in the post, describing the bidding as \"competitive.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Postal Service on Thursday\u00a0said its annual loss widened to almost $10 billion, although revenue rose slightly after two postage rate hikes this year, part of Postmaster Louis DeJoy's plan to get the postal agency on a better financial footing.",
      "The USPS said it lost $9.5 billion in the fiscal year ended September 30, compared with a loss of $6.5 billion a year earlier. The postal service blamed the wider loss on billions spent on noncash contributions to worker compensation.",
      "Excluding that expense as well as what it described as other \"certain expenses that are not controllable by management,\" the USPS said it would have lost $1.8 billion in fiscal 2024, compared with a loss of more than $2.2 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.7% to $79.5 billion in the most recent fiscal year.",
      "The USPS is in the midst of a 10-year overhaul engineered by DeJoy, who has argued that higher postal rates and other changes are essential to staunch the postal service's financial bleeding. Under his original plan, the USPS had aimed to turn a profit in fiscal 2024, but instead, the agency has now reported mounting losses for two consecutive years, raising questions about the effectiveness of the turnaround effort.",
      "DeJoy said the agency is focused on reducing its costs, but that it is also dealing with \"many economic, legislative and regulatory obstacles for us to overcome.\"",
      "The USPS has raised postage rates twice in 2024, with a two-cent per stamp increase in January and a second boost in July, which raised the cost of a Forever stamp to 73 cents.",
      "Fewer deliveries",
      "Mail volume declined in the most recent fiscal year, although revenue increased due to the higher postage rates, the USPS said. It delivered 112 billion pieces of mail, magazines, packages and other items last year, a decline of 3.2% from the prior fiscal year, it said in a financial report.",
      "Keep US Posted, an advocacy group of newspapers, magazines and other companies that rely on the USPS, described the agency's $9.5 billion loss as \"staggering,\" and said it was $3 billion higher than expected. The group also blamed the rate hikes for driving customers away from the USPS, reducing mail volume.",
      "\"The bottom line is that these consistent financial losses are driven by stamp hikes which lead to disastrous mail volume losses, plus the complete failure of USPS to capture parcel market share in already crowded package delivery space,\" said Keep US Posted executive director Kevin Yoder in a statement.",
      "Yoder, a former Republican Congressman from Kansas, also criticized the USPS for focusing on packages rather than traditional mail delivery, which he said remains the largest revenue generator for the postal service.",

      "It's unclear where the funding for DOGE will come from or the size of its budget, as well as whether Musk, the world's richest person, and Ramaswamy, who has an estimated net worth of $1 billion, will be paid for their efforts.

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",

      "A mysterious diamond-laden necklace with possible links to a scandal that contributed to the downfall of Marie Antoinette, sold for $4.8 million at an auction in Geneva Wednesday.",
      "The 18th century jewel containing around 300 carats of diamonds had been estimated to sell at the Sotheby's Royal and Noble Jewels sale for $1.8-2.8 million.",
      "But after energetic bidding, the hammer price ticked in at 3.55 million Swiss francs ($4 million), and Sotheby's listed the final price after taxes and commissions at 4.26 million francs ($4.81 million).",
      "The unidentified buyer, who put in her bid over the phone, was \"ecstatic,\" Andres White Correal, chairman of the Sotheby's jewelry department, told AFP.",
      "\"She was ready to fight and she did,\" he said, adding that it had been \"an electric night.\"",
      "\"There is obviously a niche in the market for historical jewels with fabulous provenances... People are not only buying the object, but they're buying all the history that is attached to it,\" he said.",
      "Some of the diamonds in the piece are believed to stem from the jewel at the center of the \"Diamond Necklace Affair\" \u2014 a scandal in the 1780s that further tarnished the reputation of France's last queen, Marie Antoinette, and boosted support for the coming French Revolution.",
      "The auction house said the necklace, composed of three rows of diamonds finished with a diamond tassel at each end, had emerged \"miraculously intact\" from a private Asian collection to make its first public appearance in 50 years.",
      "\"This spectacular antique jewel is an incredible survivor of history,\" it said in a statement prior to the sale.",

      "Members of this aristocratic family are believed to have worn the necklace twice in public: once at the 1937 coronation of King George VI and once at his daughter Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953.",
      "\"Spectacular piece of history\"",
      "Beyond that, little is known of the necklace, including who designed it and for whom it was commissioned, although the auction house believes that such an impressive antique jewel could only have been created for a royal family.",
      "Sotheby's said it was likely that some of the diamonds featured in the piece came from the famous necklace from the scandal that engulfed Marie Antoinette.",
      "That scandal involved a hard-up noblewoman named Jeanne de la Motte who pretended to be a confidante of the queen, and managed to acquire a lavish diamond-studded necklace in her name, against a promise of a later payment.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 07:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",
      "\"We would imagine that within a few months of him taking office, we would see the first tranche of tariffs taking effect,\" Manak said.",

An 88-year-old man who resided in Grand Junction, Colorado, died, as previously reported. The illnesses began at the end of September, and the most recent onset of illness occurred as of October 21, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",

      "U.S. inflation rose 2.6% on an annual basis last month, representing an uptick from September when the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates amid signs of cooling prices and a weaker labor market.",
      "That matched forecasts from economists polled by FactSet that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.6% in October. The CPI rose 2.4% in September, when the Fed ushered in a jumbo rate cut of 0.5 percentage points, followed by a second rate cut this month.",
      "The slight rise on a month-over-month basis signals that the Fed's battle to tame inflation to its goal of a 2% annual rate might take a bumpy path over the next months. Some types of goods and services, from housing to insurance products, are still experiencing sharply higher prices, crimping consumers' budgets and creating economic headwinds.",
      "\"Looking ahead to the next six months, we foresee consumers and businesses still spending but doing so more prudently amid still-elevated costs and rates,\" noted EY chief economist Gregory Daco in a November 11 research note.",
      "A key driver of last month's inflation bump was the housing market, with shelter prices rising 0.4% in October, contributing about half of the monthly increase, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Wednesday. Transportation costs also rose due to higher airfares and a 14% annual jump in auto insurance, the report said.",
      "Despite the monthly uptick in prices, the Federal Reserve is forecast to cut rates for a third time this year at its December meeting, with two-thirds of economists polled by FactSet predicting a 0.25 percentage point cut. The latest CPI report isn't likely to derail that, given that the inflation numbers were in line with expectations, noted Lindsay Rosner, head of multi sector fixed income investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management in an email.",

      "The inflation report marks the first since the November 5 election, which handed former President Donald Trump another win. But the president-elect's economic policies, which include a broad-based tariff on all imports and deporting millions of undocumented immigrants, could prove inflationary, economists say.",

      "Amazon Haul \u2014 whose name is a play on social media \"hauls,\" where people show off their purchases \u2014 focuses on selling items for $20 or less, or what Amazon calls \"crazy low prices.\" In a blog post, Amazon said the new service is available in its shopping app and mobile website.",
      "Temu and Shein have won over\u00a0many Gen Z shoppers and other bargain hunters by offering low-cost clothing, electronics and other items that typically ship directly from manufacturers in China. At the same time, U.S. consumers are still feeling the bite of inflation that hit a 40-year high in the pandemic, with many searching for deals as a result.",
      "\"Amazon Haul is a response to both the rise of low-price Chinese marketplaces and the fact that consumers are increasingly seeking value for money as they try to make their budgets stretch further,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData.",
      "He added, \"The value retail segment has been a major growth area over the past few years, and while the regular Amazon site has a good value-for-money reputation, its wide offer means that it is not primarily seen as an everyday low-price destination.\"",
      "What is Amazon Haul?",
      "Amazon Haul is an online storefront within the Amazon app that sells low-cost items, aimed especially at consumers who shop at discount retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "To find Amazon Haul, go to the Amazon app and search \"Haul\" in the search bar, or go to www.amazon.com/haul\u00a0on your browser.",
      "How much do Amazon Haul items cost?",
      "Amazon said everything on Amazon Haul costs less than $20, but most products are priced at $10 and less.",
      "Items available on Amazon Haul on Wednesday included a three-pack of fuzzy socks for $4.99 and a quilted tote bag for $7.99. The merchandise ranged from clothing to household items such as silicone baking mats and throw pillows.",
      "The company offers discounts on larger orders, such as 5% off orders above $50 and 10% off orders of $75 or more.",
      "What is the delivery time for Amazon Haul items?",
      "Longer than regular Amazon items, with the company noting that the goods are typically delivered within one to two weeks.",
      "What do the experts say?",
      "Amazon Haul could help the retailer appeal to younger shoppers, noted GlobalData's Saunders. But it also raises the risk that the low-cost shopping site could cannibalize sales from Amazon's main site, he added.",
      "Still, Saunders said, \"It is better that Amazon cannibalize its own sales than cede ground to rivals.\"",

    "title": "What could Trump's return, and his tariffs, actually mean for China?",
    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 12:02:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Could the tariffs Trump's threatened to slap on Chinese imports backfire and help Beijing? Some experts say they will.",
    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap up a tariff of up to 60% on all goods imported to the U.S. from China. While that may sound like a potent economic threat to a country where economic growth is already faltering, could it actually be just what China needs?",
      "\"I do expect U.S.-China economic relations to be more volatile under Trump, but I think overall, this may turn out to be better for China,\" Chen Zhiwu, the top finance professor at the University of Hong Kong and a former professor at Yale University, told CBS News.",
      "Chen said if Trump does follow through with his threat of such steep tariffs on China, it \"might force the leadership in Beijing to have no other choice but to focus on the economy \u2014 especially given that the Chinese economy right now is in very big trouble.\"",
      "Since the start of Trump's first term in the White House, and through President Biden's term, China's economic growth has slowed from roughly 7% to 4.5%. The country's property market has crashed because of massive overbuilding, leading to the rise of empty ghost cities. Youth unemployment rocketed to a new high of nearly 19% in September, dimming prospects for China's future workforce.",
      "Beijing's intense focus over the past decade on bolstering its military to meet its geopolitical ambition of rivaling the U.S. and its European and Asia-Pacific allies has further sacrificed opportunities for domestic economic growth, said Chen.",
      "\"If you count the number of warships, China has by far the highest number of warships than any country, higher than even the U.S.' naval ships. What industries have grown the most so far this year? Definitely those warfare-related industries have gone up the most, but those consumer-oriented industries have had no growth or negative growth,\" he said.",
      "Most of China's top 20 aerospace and defense stocks have recorded double-digit growth over the past year alone.",
      "Tariffs \"a good thing for China for the long term\"?",
      "\"The pressure the U.S. is putting on China will become a good thing for China for the long term,\" agreed Wang Xiangwei, a former editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong-based newspaper South China Morning Post.",
      "China has relied on two primary engines to support rapid economic growth over the past 40 years, since former leader Deng Xiaoping initiated reforms and started opening the country up, Wang told CBS News. Those have been manufacturing cheap exports for the world by leveraging China's long-cheap labor force, and later, spending billions on domestic infrastructure including roads, rail and airports.",
      "But labor has become more expensive with the rise of China's booming middle class, and the government is running out of new things to build across the country.",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "How China came to dominate the EV market, and what the U.S. can do to catch up",
      "Beijing has found it difficult, meanwhile, to fire up a potential third engine of economic growth: The capacity of the country's 1.3 billion people to consume domestically made products.",
      "Trump's threatened tariffs could give a needed external push for that to change, said Wang.",
      "\"I believe China's going to suffer in the short term. In the long term, he's [Trump] going to help China to make that painful transition,\" Wang said, noting that in the U.S., domestic consumption accounts for 70% to 80% of the national GDP, while in China, it's \"only about 60%.\"",
      "In effect, pushing China's own people to buy more of their country's own goods and services could, in the view of the two analysts, prove to be Beijing's best protection against Trump's threatened tariffs.",
      "\"The best tool would be to stimulate consumption growth inside China,\" said Chen. \"At the moment, the leadership has not really tried to help the Chinese consumers by sending them government checks and even tax costs to corporations. I think if the Chinese government really moves in that direction more aggressively, then it would help the Chinese economy generate more internal domestic consumption demand to make up for some of their possible lost exports to the U.S.\"",
      "Beijing needs Washington, but tariffs could have a complex impact",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 25% on Chinese agricultural products imported to the U.S., including seafood, pork and dairy. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs, kicking off a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.",
      "Nearly eight years later, however, Beijing appears less able to wage such a war, due to its close economic links with the U.S.",
      "\"In terms of retaliation choices for China, it's very limited,\" said Chen. \"China imports a lot of agricultural products like soybeans, corn. They may try to import more such agricultural products from Brazil, and also from Russia as one of their ways to retaliate against the U.S. But at the end of the day, China imports so much [computer] chips from Nvidia, Intel, especially Qualcomm,\" Wang said. \"Those products are what China needs. So, China cannot produce internally.\"",
      "In effect, if Beijing does impose retaliatory tariffs, it could be shooting itself in the proverbial foot. Tariffs would make all those products, vital to China's continued economic and technological development, more expensive for its own people.",
      "But another possible impact of Trump's expected protectionist policies could actually be to push some of America's oldest allies and trade partners closer to China, reversing the so-called decoupling of the U.S. and Western European economies from Beijing that Washington has pushed under Mr. Biden.",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy and your money",
      "\"The Biden administration did such a good job to more or less unite that,\" said Chen. \"If Trump makes the EU and NATO member countries upset, that makes it more possible for Germany, for France or Italy or even the U.K. to warm up more with China on the trade front. So, that may help neutralize, to some extent, the negative impact of the expected Trump tariffs on Chinese goods.\"",
      "Trump has claimed repeatedly that foreign companies would foot the bill, effectively absorbing the additional costs of exporting to the U.S. market imposed by his tariffs, but many economists disagree, and say it would effectively be a tax on American consumers.",
      "According to findings released by the National Retail Federation last week, U.S. consumers could lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power per year on everything from clothes and toys to household appliances and travel goods if there is a 60% blanket tariff on Chinese goods.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",
      "All of that said, and despite Trump's history of anti-China rhetoric, it remains unclear how quickly his administration might actually move to roll out sweeping tariffs, with some economists speculating that the president-elect plans, initially at least, to use the threat of additional levies as a cudgel to negotiate more favorable trade terms with Beijing. Trump could also choose to gradually phase in tariffs, delaying their full impact on China's economy.",
      "Will China attack Taiwan, and would Trump come to the rescue?",
      "Trump's return to the White House may also help Beijing further its interests with Taiwan, the democratically governed island of 23 million people just off China's east coast that the country considers a renegade province. President Xi Jinping has vowed to bring Taiwan back under Beijing's control, by force if necessary.",
      "Since the U.S. government enacted the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979, the U.S. is strategically committed to aid in Taiwan's defense in the event of any aggression, including by selling weapons to the island's government.",
      "Open to interpretation, however, and left deliberately vague in the U.S. law, is whether Washington is obligated to directly defend Taiwan, using the power of the American military, if it does come under attack.",
      "President Biden, during his first term, said Washington would, breaking with the long-time policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that the Biden White House later returned to.",
      "\"The sovereignty over Taiwan is the red line of all the red lines,\" Wang told CBS News. \"Trump, in his presidential campaign speeches, he made it very clear\u2026 [that he's] unlikely to send troops to defend Taiwan.\"",
      "\"I believe that China's not going to invade Taiwan anytime soon,\" Wang added, noting that Beijing has \"so many problems it'll have to fix at home.\"",
      "If Beijing did invade Taiwan, the fallout would be felt worldwide.",
      "\"That would be a devastating hit to the global economy,\" said Chen. \"I hope that it would not happen. So, maybe now, given the challenges with the Chinese economy, the leadership is realizing that without a stable economy, then all its global geopolitical ambitions would not have any economic foundation.\"",

      "Spirit acknowledged in a regulatory filing late Tuesday that it is in \"active and constructive discussions\" with bondholders to restructure its obligations as its business woes continue. If the talks succeed, the airline expects operations to continue, and for employees and customers to be shielded from any impact.",

The airline faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion over the next year, obligations that it's unlikely to be able to meet.",
      "In the first six months of 2024, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year, but spent 10% less per mile. The airline's revenue per mile from fares was down nearly 20%, contributing to its losses.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has called the Biden administration's student loan relief efforts a \"total catastrophe.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Joe Biden made student loan forgiveness a central issue to his administration, rolling out efforts to forgive debt as well as to lower repayments for millions of borrowers. But with President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House in January, the future of those efforts is now in question.",
      "During the presidential debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump described Mr. Biden's efforts to forgive student borrowers as \"a total catastrophe.\" While he hasn't explicitly addressed his plans for student loans, he's called for eliminating the Department of Education, which manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio.",
      "It's unclear which agency or group would manage those loans if the Education Department were to be eliminated, a step that would require approval from Congress. The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump's plans for student debt relief.",
      "There's a lot on the line for the 46 million Americans who hold $1.7 trillion in student loans, a financial burden that about half of borrowers say has impacted their life choices, delaying home purchases or starting their families, according to a 2021 Morning Consult study. Mr. Biden's term is drawing to an end with two of his key relief efforts tied up in the courts, adding to the uncertainty about what Trump's second presidency will mean for those plans.",
      "\"We know what is in Project 2025, and we know what we saw in the first Trump administration,\" Persis Yu, managing counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student loans. \"We just should be very concerned about what the next administration will mean for borrowers.\"",
      "The next Trump administration may be unlikely to continue the Biden administration's effort to fight against ongoing lawsuits targeting current student debt relief efforts, according to NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. That could mean an end to those programs, experts say.",
      "\"Programs that the Biden administration created or expanded access to via regulatory changes could be easily rolled back,\" she added.",
      "What has Trump said about student loan relief?",
      "During his September debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump bashed the Biden administration's efforts.",
      "\"When they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe. He went out, got rejected again by the Supreme Court,\" Trump said, referring to the high court's 2023 decision\u00a0that blocked Mr. Biden's initial student loan forgiveness program, which would have provided up to $20,000 in relief per borrower.",
      "\"So all these students got taunted with this whole thing about \u2014 this whole idea. And how unfair that would have been. Part of the reason they lost,\" he added.",
      "What does Project 2025 say about student loans?",
      "Project 2025\u00a0\u2014 an initiative overseen by the conservative Heritage Foundation to guide the next Republican president in an overhaul of the executive branch \u2014 calls for the abolishment of the Department of Education, and says student loans should be handled by the private sector. It also advocates for scuttling student loan relief.",
      "\"The new administration must end the practice of acting like the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political support and votes,\" Project 2025 says. \"The new administration must end abuses in the loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans.\"",
      "It's unclear whether Trump agrees with those views, although he has called for an end to the Education Department. While on the campaign trail, Trump distanced himself from Project 2025, calling some of the proposals \"abysmal.\"",
      "What is the status of Biden's student loan relief plans?",
      "Currently, there are two student loan relief plans that are tied up in court, both of which are being challenged by Republican-led states.",
      "The\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, is an income-driven repayment program, which pegs a borrower's monthly payment to their income, lowering their financial costs. Some lower-income borrowers in SAVE have monthly payments of $0.",
      "The plan's 8 million enrollees are now in limbo, however, after court rulings blocked the Biden administration from implementing the plan. Currently, those borrowers are in forbearance through April, meaning that their loans are essentially paused while the Biden administration defends the plan in court.",
      "Separately, another Biden administration plan to use\u00a0the Higher Education Act to erase all or some of the student debt held by 30 million borrowers has also hit a legal roadblock, with a court putting that plan on hold in October.",
      "In the latter case, the Republican states argued that Mr. Biden's plan sought to \"unlawfully mass cancel up to hundreds of billions of dollars in student loans.\" The Education Department vowed to defend both plans.",
      "What could happen to these programs under Trump?",
      "Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary, said he expects the president-elect will move to rescind the proposed loan cancellation regulations.",
      "\"The Trump administration may pursue different avenues of loan relief, but it will not be the mass, blanket types of forgiveness that the current administration has pursued,\" said Eitel, president and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "Some other student loan relief programs may remain, such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which would be tougher to eliminate but could become less accessible, said NerdWallet's Wood.",
      "That program, which was signed into law by former President George W. Bush in 2007, forgives student debt for public workers like teachers and police officers after 10 years in repayment. The Biden administration reworked the PSLF to make it easier for people to qualify for forgiveness, after the vast majority of people who applied were told they were ineligible.",
      "During Trump's first term, the Education Department was overseen by Betsy DeVos, who promoted school choice in K-12 and also called for deep spending cuts. She also proposed ending the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, although she was unsuccessful.",
      "Do Americans support student loan relief?",
      "It's a divisive issue among voters, with people's views colored by their political leanings and whether they themselves have student debt, according to an AP-Norc poll published in June.",
      "Only 15% of Republicans believe student loan forgiveness is important, versus 58% of Democrats. More than half of people currently paying student loans say it's an important issue, versus one-third of those with no experience with student debt, the poll found.",
      "Republicans have objected to Mr. Biden's efforts because they could deprive some lenders of revenue, while some object to forgiving loans for people who enrolled in college, given that a minority of Americans have college degrees.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 16:20:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The National Toy Hall of Fame in Rochester, New York, has enshrined a new class of honorees.",
    "story": [
      "My Little Pony finally made it to the winner's circle.",
      "After years as an also-ran, the pastel-colored ponies were enshrined in the National Toy Hall of Fame on Tuesday, along with Transformers action figures and the Phase 10 card game.",
      "The honorees rose to the top in voting by a panel of experts and the public from among 12 finalists. This year's field included: the party game Apples to Apples, balloons, \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" gamebooks, Hess Toy Trucks, Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game, remote-controlled vehicles, Sequence, the stick horse and trampoline.",
      "\"These are three very deserving toys that showcase the wide range of how people play,\" Christopher Bensch, vice president for collections and chief curator, said in a statement. \"But for My Little Pony in particular, this year is extra validating. The beloved toy was a finalist seven times before finally crossing the finish line!\"",
      "Hasbro's mini-horses, distinguishable by different \"cutie marks\" on their haunches, were introduced in the 1980s and reintroduced in 2003, outselling even Barbie for several years.",
      "The collectibles were recognized for encouraging fantasy and storytelling \u2014 the kind of creative play the Hall of Fame demands of inductees \u2014 along with popularity over time.",
      "\"The My Little Pony line has endured for decades because it combines several traditional forms of doll play with children's fascination with horses,\" said Michelle Parnett-Dwyer, curator of dolls and toys. \"The variety of figures promotes collecting as a pastime, too.\"",
      "Transformers",
      "Transformers came along in the 1980s, when Hasbro bought the rights to several existing Japanese toy lines featuring transforming robots. They were first marketed with a cartoon and have since graduated to a series of live-action films. Social media sites allow for debates over which figures are must-haves, as well as demonstrations of the sometimes complex process of manipulating them from robot to vehicle or other alternate form.",
      "Regular new Transformers characters keep collectors coming back, Bensch said, \"but the toys are also popular because they are so suited to the ways kids play. The toy line feeds kids' imaginations and fantasy play.\"",
      "Phase 10",
      "Also inducted was Phase 10, which was introduced by inventor and entrepreneur\u00a0Ken Johnson\u00a0in 1982. Today, Mattel sells 2 million decks of the card game annually in 30 countries and more than 20 languages. That makes it one of the bestselling card games in the world, according to the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, where the Toy Hall of Fame is housed.",
      "In the style of rummy, the game challenges players to collect groups of cards to complete 10 phases in sequential order before their opponents.",
      "\"Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, Phase 10 has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play,\" said Mirek Stolee, the museum's curator of board games and puzzles.",
      "Anyone can nominate a toy for the Hall of Fame. Museum staff narrows the field to 12 finalists each year. Fans can cast votes online for their favorites and their results are counted alongside ballots from a national advisory committee of historians, educators and others with industry expertise.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 23:14:51 -0500",
    "summary": "A recess appointment would allow Trump to install some officials and sidestep lengthy hearings and a floor vote.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's selection of former Rep. Matt Gaetz to be attorney general is his most controversial Cabinet pick yet, and the Florida Republican is likely to face obstacles in the confirmation process.",
      "But Trump is seeking an important change to the Senate confirmation process that would allow him to install some officials and sidestep lengthy hearings and a floor vote, in which nominees need a majority vote to be confirmed.",
      "Before Senate Republicans elected their leaders for the upcoming 119th Congress, Trump demanded that the candidates agree to recess appointments, which would give him the option of bypassing the Senate's role of approving or rejecting the president's nominations. Trump argued that without the ability to temporarily install nominees he would not be able to fill the positions in a timely manner.",
      "The legal basis for recess appointments emanates from a constitutional clause that gives the president \"the power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate.\" A Supreme Court ruling in 2014 concluded that recess appointments could only be made when the Senate is not in session for 10 or more days, after President Barack Obama made controversial appointments when senators were on break.",
      "Senators often leave Washington for long stretches of time, but have utilized pro forma sessions to prevent presidents from installing nominees without their consent.",
      "\"In recent years, the Senate \u2014 regardless of which party controlled it \u2014 has used pro forma sessions to ensure that it is never in recess for more than three days,\" said Josh Chafetz, a law and politics professor at Georgetown University.",
      "For Trump to make recess appointments, the Senate would have to agree, through a simple majority vote, to go on recess for at least 10 days. The House must also agree to allow the Senate to adjourn, but Chavetz says if the House does not agree, or if it disagrees with the Senate on the length of adjournment, then the president has the constitutional power to adjourn both chambers for a timeframe of his choosing.",
      "\"That second route has never been used before in U.S. history, so no one is quite sure how it would work,\" Chafetz said.",
      "A recess appointment, however, does not have the same benefits as a nominee confirmed by the Senate. Without Senate approval, the appointee would not be paid. The appointee can serve in the role for up to two years, depending on when the appointment was made. After that, the individual could be installed again through a recess appointment or the regular confirmation process.",
      "Some senators, including Republicans who will be in the majority come January, showed little appetite for giving up their constitutional power, especially after Trump announced that he intended to nominate Gaetz to lead the Justice Department.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said Wednesday. \"If the president proceeds with that nominee, I think it shows the importance of having the Senate advice and consent process.\"",
      "\"I have concerns that he can't get across the finish line, and we're going to spend a lot of political capital,\" Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told reporters Thursday. \"I say we. A lot of people will spend a lot of political capital on something that, that even if they got done, you'd have to wonder if it was worth it.\"",
      "Cramer added that Gaetz has \"got a really steep hill to climb to get lots of votes, including mine.\"",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress on Wednesday after Trump announced his selection. The timing came days before a House panel was set to vote on releasing a report on whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct. Gaetz was also the subject of a previous Justice Department investigation that sought to determine if he violated sex trafficking and obstruction of justice laws. No charges were filed, and Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "\"We have a process around here for considering presidential nominees,\" Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said Thursday when asked by reporters about Gaetz. \"That's a constitutional responsibility of the Senate, and I intend to play my part as a member of the Judiciary Committee in doing that vetting and advice and consent.\"",
      "\"I don't think we should be circumventing the Senate's responsibilities, but I think it's premature to be talking about recess appointments,\" Cornyn added.",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee is responsible for conducting confirmation hearings for the attorney general nominee. Several other Judiciary Committee members also weighed in Thursday.",
      "\"The bottom line is our responsibility in the Senate is advice and consent,\" said Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the committee chairman.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina said recess appointments should be used \"judiciously,\" adding that he has concerns about \"blanket recess appointments.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said he could name between \"five to 10 Republicans who are seriously considering voting against\" Gaetz \"and insisting that there will be a vote.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri indicated he would not have an issue if Trump made recess appointments, saying the president \"has total authority to make recess appointments.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware urged his Republican colleagues to protect their role in confirmations and encourage Trump to pick confirmable candidates.",

    "title": "What to know about Trump's DOGE, led by Musk and Ramaswamy",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 21:45:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head an effort, dubbed DOGE, to reduce wasteful federal spending. Here's what it's about.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is vowing to reduce wasteful federal spending by tapping two billionaires \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 to spearhead the initiative, which the president-elect is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The appointments, announced by Trump on Tuesday, raise a host of questions about the effort, including whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal outlays, given that Congress authorizes the nation's spending, as well as where the businessmen might look to cut spending. Under the plan, meanwhile, DOGE is not an official government department, raising questions about its powers and how it will operate.",
      "Speaking Thursday night at Mar-a-Lago at a gala hosted by the right-leaning think tank the America First Policy Institute, Ramaswamy thanked Trump \"for making sure that Elon Musk and I are in a position to start the mass deportations of millions of unelected federal bureaucrats out of the D.C. bureaucracy.\"",
      "\"And I don't know if you've got to know Elon yet, but he doesn't bring a chisel, he brings a chainsaw, and we're going to be taking it to that bureaucracy,\" Ramaswamy added. \"It's going to be a lot of fun.\"",
      "The announcement comes a week after Trump won a second term\u00a0as president, with voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the economy under the Biden administration. As part of his campaign vows, Trump promised to slash government spending. Musk's bio on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022, now reads, \"The people voted for major government reform.\"",
      "\"Frankly, it does need to be done again, so every few decades you really need to look at everything,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But Kamarck harbors reservations about Musk and Ramaswamy's mandate, especially after the former recently suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 almost one-third of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual spending. Two-thirds of that spending is mandatory through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "\"This is the first warning sign that this is going to be a failed operation,\" Kamarck said. \"That's insane.\"",
      "Speaking on transformational change within government and organizations, Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia University's Columbia Business School, noted there are two models: a bottom-up, grassroots effort and a top-down strategy \u2014 sometimes called a shock-change approach. DOGE likely belongs to the latter, according to Morris, who is also author of the nonfiction book \"Tribal,\" about how people form and relate to each other through group dynamics.",
      "\"Unless you have a new leader with incredible legitimacy and the status quo with no legitimacy, you rarely have people responding well to shock therapy,\" he said. \"It's hard to see it happening in this case \u2014 I don't think Musk is going to be able to form a deep knowledge of government.\"",
      "The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Trump announced the DOGE in a statement on Tuesday, describing it as an effort to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "The name is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin has more than tripled in price during the last month, and now trades at 38 cents.)",
      "Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy's work \"will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,\" or by the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump only outlined the initiative's contours and didn't disclose how it will be staffed or funded. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request about the DOGE's funding or whether Musk or Ramaswamy will be paid for their work on the effort.",
      "On Thursday, an X account for DOGE said the group is accepting resumes from \"super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.\" In a separate post, Musk said \"compensation is zero.\"",
      "Can the DOGE actually cut federal spending?",
      "At the moment, that appears unlikely given that the DOGE isn't a real government department, which would need to be created by congressional approval. Federal spending is authorized by Congress, and senators and House representatives may hesitate to support cuts to major programs like Social Security or Medicare, which are popular with millions of voters, or to the nation's military.",
      "It's also not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "That doesn't amount to much, Kamarck said.",
      "\"They have no authority \u2014 none whatsoever,\" she added, while noting that the backing of the president can help convince lawmakers to throw their support behind efficiency efforts.",
      "However, Trump's aides are reportedly working on a way to enact some of DOGE's spending recommendations without requiring congressional approval, the Washington Post reported.",
      "What have Musk and Ramaswamy said about federal spending?",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $319 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has described the U.S. government as bloated and said it its spending is unsustainable. The Tesla founder also said he wants to reduce the number of federal agencies to 99, down from more than 400.",
      "\"There are so many [agencies] that people have never heard of, and that have overlapping areas of responsibilities,\" Musk\u00a0said earlier this month.",
      "While on the campaign trail with Trump, Musk also\u00a0said\u00a0he could cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the annual budget. \"Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency will fix that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk is known for cost-cutting at his own companies, slashing\u00a0most of X's workforce after he bought the business two years ago as well as focusing on manufacturing costs at Tesla. Even so, those efforts have had mixed results, with X's valuation falling by about 80% since his purchase. Tesla's stock price, meanwhile, has surged 48% in the past year, bumping its value above $1 trillion.",
      "Ramaswamy, whom Forbes says has a net worth of about $1 billion, dropped out of the presidential race in January after running on an \"anti-woke\"\u00a0campaign. He also advocated for government cuts by eliminating the Department of Education, a goal shared by President-elect Trump.",
      "Have administrations previously tried to cut costs?",
      "Yes, both Republican and Democratic presidents have created efforts to cut government spending.",
      "In 1982, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, led by wealthy businessman J. Peter Grace, the CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a chemicals business. About 150 business people volunteered for the commission, which ultimately recommended 2,500 reforms, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.",
      "\"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented,\" the library notes. \"However, the Commission's work provided a starting point for many conservative critiques of the federal government.\"",
      "In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review with the goal to create a government that would work better and cost less, Kamarck said. The group was staffed with civil servants who understood the bureaucracy, and many of whom had frustrations with it, she added.",
      "The group had some successes in streamlining operations and paring costs, eventually cutting more than 300,000 jobs, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service. Kamarck noted that the group also focused on integrating technology into departments at a time when the internet was just emerging, leading to efficiencies such as online tax filing.",
      "Where could the Trump administration cut spending?",
      "While experts are skeptical of Musk's claim he can cut $2 trillion in spending, they also point out there are opportunities to look at efficiencies.",
      "Eliminating Medicare fraud is one area that could result in savings, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan group that looks at government spending. Its recommendations also include reducing the nation's contributions to the U.N. and ending subsidies for some agricultural products, like dairy and sugar. Its projected savings: $377 billion in the first year, or about 19% of the $2 trillion that Musk is eyeballing.",
      "But efficiency goes beyond cost-cutting, Kamarck noted. It's also about understanding how the bureaucracy works.",
      "\"Every single thing in the federal government is big and complicated, and there are layers and layers of complexity,\" she noted. \"Al Gore and I relied on hundreds of experienced civil servants to tell us how this worked \u2014 and if you don't do this, which I suspect they won't because Musk is an arrogant billionaire, you will fail.\"",
      "Does Musk have conflicts of interest?",
      "Yes, as Musk's SpaceX works with the Department of Defense and NASA, with the federal government pledging $3 billion to his companies last year, according to the New York Times. Tesla, meanwhile, has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as by other agencies.",
      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their financial assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",
      "Then there's also the question of Musk's ability to juggle another major role, given that he is also running several businesses, from Tesla to SpaceX, Columbia Business School's Morris noted.",
      "\"The whole question of Elon coming into government, that he's going to be this sort of roving efficiency expert, like a McKinsey consultant looking over the shoulders of the entire government \u2014 it's absurd on so many levels,\" Morris said. \"He's already the CEO of companies that are very demanding of his time.\"",
      "He added, \"To do work in government of this sort, you have to be process-oriented in a way that he has never been before.\"",

    "story": [
      "Suicides among military service members rose in 2023 continuing a gradual rise in suicides among active-duty forces, persisting despite prevention efforts.",
      "The Defense Department's annual report on suicides in the military released Thursday said suicides among active-duty military rose from 331 in 2022 to 363 in 2023.",
      "\"Admittedly yes, that long-term trend is gradually increasing,\" Dr. Timothy Hoyt, Deputy Director of the Office of Force Resiliency at the Defense Department told reporters on a call.",
      "The suicide rate has grown from 17 per 100,000 active duty service members in 2011 to 26 in 2023, according to data released in the annual report for 2023, although the rate decreased for one year from 2020-2021.",
      "Active duty service members who died by suicide in 2023 were largely enlisted males under the age of 30, accounting for 61% of suicides. The most common method of suicide was firearms, at 65%, followed by hanging or asphyxiation, at 28%.",
      "Defense officials said the suicide rates were similar to rates across the U.S. population between 2011 and 2022.",
      "\"We are not immune to the factors that drive suicide throughout the U.S., and our service members face, in addition to those, a number of unique military challenges,\" Hoyt said.",
      "He added recommendations from the Suicide Prevention Response and Independent Review Committee have given a \"mechanism by which we can address as many of those potential risks as possible and make investments in those spaces.\"",
      "The Pentagon set up the review committee to provide recommendations to reduce suicide deaths\u00a0in the military. Last year the committee made a series of recommendations, including broadly improving the delivery of mental health care, addressing stigma and other barriers to care and revising suicide prevention training.",
      "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who established the review committee mandated by Congress in 2022 said in a statement that the annual report's findings \"urgently demonstrate the need for the Department to redouble its work in the complex fields of suicide prevention and postvention.\" Austin said the Defense Department completed 20 of the 83 committee's recommendations.",
      "The Pentagon expects to spend about $250 million on suicide prevention in fiscal year 2025, the largest amount of funds the Defense Department has ever invested, Hoyt told reporters.",
      "\"A lot of the time where we've done initiatives during the past two decades, there's been insufficient investment in making sure that those have staying power, that we've got a long-term implementation of those programs,\" Hoyt said.",
      "The total number of suicides across the force, including both active duty and reserve, was 523 in 2023 compared to 493 in 2022.",
      "Suicide is one of the leading causes of death for veterans\u00a0as well. According to the most recent report from the Department of Veterans Affairs, the suicide rate for 2021 was 33.9 per 100,000, up from 32.6 per 100,000 in 2020.",

      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump said Thursday in a social media post that he'll nominate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "\"I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS),\" he said in a post on X. He said Americans have been \"crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation\" about public health, and Kennedy would \"Make America Great and Healthy Again!\"",
      "Kennedy has a long record of criticizing vaccines, including spreading misleading claims about their safety.",
      "He has vowed to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases and believes that large drug and food companies are to blame for a broad swath of ailments. Kennedy has claimed a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity. He has also urged removing fluoride from drinking water.",
      "Kennedy would need to be confirmed by the Senate. His odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called\u00a0\"anti-science, fringe public health stances,\"\u00a0but with\u00a0Republicans in the majority\u00a0come January, Trump's nominees will have an easier path to confirmation.",
      "Despite the expected opposition to Kennedy's nomination \u2014 along with other controversial choices to lead national security agencies and former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to lead the Justice Department \u2014 Trump has told associates in recent days he is standing by his pick for health chief.",
      "\"No one can talk him out of it,\" one of the sources familiar with the pick said Thursday.",
      "Trump promised during the campaign to let Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic and former environmental lawyer, \"go wild\" on issues relating to health, food and medicine.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines,\" Trump said in the final days before the election. \"The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet \u2026 sometimes referred to as oil and gas.\"",
      "The sprawling HHS Department encompasses a number of agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration. As HHS Secretary, Kennedy would also oversee the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is charged with caring for undocumented and unaccompanied children apprehended along the border.",
      "The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a watchdog group that often clashes with the FDA and in some ways is closely aligned with Kennedy's calls to get chemicals out of foods, put out a statement condemning his nomination.",
      "\"Nominating an anti-vaxxer like Kennedy to HHS is like putting a Flat Earther at the head of NASA,\" the group's president, Dr. Peter G. Lurie, said in a statement. \"CSPI opposes this nomination and any other nominees who are a direct threat to science and evidence-based solutions.\"",
      "But one prominent Democrat, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, said in a social media post that he was \"excited by the news\" of Kennedy's nomination. He praised Kennedy for helping to defeat vaccine mandates in Colorado in 2019 but said he hoped that Kennedy would embrace personal choice on vaccines, rather than banning them. He also said he was optimistic about Kennedy's vow to take on big pharma and high drug costs for Americans. Polis also backed Kennedy's criticism of \"entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA\" that \"are not doing their job, they're not protecting our kids,\" in particular from pesticides used in agriculture.",
      "Polis later clarified his praise, saying, \"Science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation's health policy and the science-backed decision to get vaccinated improves public health and safety.\"",
      "At the same time, Polis has also launched a policy entity with Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker aimed at taking on other parts of the Trump agenda.",
      "As a co-chair of Trump's transition, Kennedy has been vetting a slate of staffers who could fill top positions throughout the Trump administration. He has said he hopes \"to have every nutritional scientist\" across the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture \"fired on Day One.\"",
      "The FDA's top vaccines official, Dr. Peter Marks, said he hoped\u00a0to find common ground with Kennedy.",

And I think the data are essentially overwhelming, in certain areas, but we'll just have to engage in the dialogue,\" Marks said this week an event hosted by the Milken Institute in Washington, D.C., ahead of Trump's decision.",
      "Kennedy, who faced a costly and time-consuming process to appear on general election ballots as an independent candidate, ended his longshot bid for the White House in August and endorsed Trump.",
      "Kennedy said there were three issues that convinced him to endorse Trump: free speech, the war in Ukraine and what he called the \"war on our children.\" He said processed foods, chemicals and obesity were destroying the health of children in the U.S.",
      "At an August rally with Kennedy, Trump vowed to establish a panel to investigate chronic health problems and childhood diseases, as well as establish an independent presidential commission on assassination attempts that would be tasked with releasing all of the remaining documents related to President John F.

That includes about 20,000 mail-in and absentee ballots and about 60,000 provisional ballots.",
      "During the recount, Schmidt said, counties will use \"a different method or different equipment to tabulate the results\" than they used in the initial tally to identify any potential issues.",
      "The deadline for counties to certify election results this year is Nov. 25. Counties will certify all results except the Senate race by that day and will certify the Senate results as soon as their recounts are complete, Schmidt said.",
      "The results of the recount will be published online Nov. 27, which is the day before Thanksgiving, Schmidt said. In the meantime, the elections return page on the state website will continue to update as counties update their unofficial vote tallies in the original count, Schmidt said. These updates are separate from the recount.",
      "In a statement Wednesday, McCormick's spokesperson Elizabeth Gregory said, \"Senator-Elect McCormick's lead is insurmountable, which the AP made clear in calling the race. A recount will be a waste of time and taxpayer money, but it is Senator Casey's prerogative. Senator-Elect McCormick knows what it's like to lose an election and is sure Senator Casey will eventually reach the right conclusion.\"",
      "According to an earlier statement from the Pennsylvania Department of State, Casey's campaign did not waive an automatic recount by noon Wednesday.",
      "Casey has not made a public appearance since his election night watch party in Scranton, but he posted a video on his social media accounts Tuesday.",
      "\"The American democratic process was born in Pennsylvania, and that process will play out,\" he said in the video on X.",
      "Meanwhile, McCormick is moving forward. The businessman declared victory during a speech in Pittsburgh Friday, and he has spent this week in Washington going through the Senate orientation process.",
      "\"The people have spoken. There's a clear, clear victory,\" McCormick said last week.",
      "CBS News Philadelphia reached out to both campaigns Wednesday, but neither made the candidates available to speak.",
      "Casey's campaign has said it's been waiting for outstanding votes from around the state, from mail-in ballots to overseas and military votes and provisional ballots. In Philadelphia, the state's largest county and one where Casey has garnered more than 78% of the vote, commissioners say the number of votes left out there is running thin.",
      "\"We had about 20,000 provisional ballots to start with. We've already counted 11,000 of those,\" city commissioner Seth Bluestein said Wednesday.",
      "Bluestein told CBS News Philadelphia the election board wrapped up voting on outstanding mail-in votes Wednesday. He says a few thousand could not be counted for various reasons, mostly a lack of a signature or secrecy envelope.",
      "As for the remaining provisional ballots, Bluestein said the board will take those up on Friday. But he warned, \"most of those will probably end up not getting counted.\"",
      "The recount will cost more than $1 million in taxpayer funds, the Department of State estimates. Schmidt said Wednesday that the most recent legally triggered recount -- in the 2022 Senate primary between McCormick and Mehmet Oz -- cost about $1,053,000.",
      "McCormick files lawsuit against Bucks County",
      "Bucks County officials on Tuesday made the decision to count 405 mail-in ballots that had incorrect or missing dates on the outer envelopes.",
      "\"The courts I believe will take this up, so we're going to get sued either way. I'd rather be on the side of counting ballots than not counting them, is my thought,\" Bob Harvie, the chair of the Bucks County Board of Elections said prior to voting in favor of counting the ballots.",
      "Now, a lawsuit's been filed on behalf of Dave McCormick, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and the Republican National Committee against the Bucks County Board of Elections for voting 2 to 1 in favor of counting those ballots.",
      "The lawsuit says in part, \"The Board's baffling decision not to enforce the date requirement and to count noncompliant ballots thus directly contravenes binding Pennsylvania law.\"",
      "Dating issues on mail-in ballots has been a long-time controversy in Pennsylvania. Last month, the state supreme court ruled mail-in ballots with missing or incorrect dates should be tossed for this election.",
      "The RNC and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania are also asking the state Supreme Court to order election officials in all 67 counties to not count undated or misdated mail ballots.",
      "A statement Thursday from the RNC said it filed the lawsuit \"to defend the dated ballot requirement, a critical election integrity safeguard, and to stop radical Democrats from counting illegal ballots as Bob Casey tries to steal the election.\"",

      "\"There are interesting cases that with my physics and engineering background and time in the [intelligence community], I do not understand, and I don't know anybody else understands them,\" Dr. Jon Kosloski, director, All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) told reporters during a briefing on the unclassified version of the annual report mandated by Congress.",
      "Kosloski said the office has found \"no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technologies,\" and he said none of the cases point to foreign adversaries or breakthrough technologies.",
      "In total, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office received 757 reports of UAP between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024. Of the 757 received, 485 occurred during that time period, while 272 occurred outside of the reporting period but were not included in previous reports.",
      "The office resolved 49 of the cases by identifying the object as various types of balloons, birds or drones, and it expects to resolve 243 others by identifying them as one of those objects, as well.",
      "Another 444 didn't have enough data to keep investigating, so the office will go into the its active archive to see if other data can be found.",

    "story": [
      "The jail in Georgia's largest county, Fulton County, leaves its inmates vulnerable to \"substantial risk of serious harm from violence\" and violates their constitutional and statutory rights, according to a new Justice Department report released Thursday.",
      "After a more than year-long civil rights probe into the Fulton County Jail \u2013 which has long been plagued by overcrowding, understaffing and violence \u2014 federal investigators concluded detainees are subjected to \"dangerous and unsanitary\" conditions, like pest infestations and malnourishment. These conditions especially endanger those with mental health conditions, the report found.",
      "\"None of these problems are new,\" the report said. \"And despite widespread awareness of these issues, the unconstitutional and illegal conditions have persisted.\"",
      "The Justice Department launched its civil investigation into Fulton County's jail in July 2023, after at least four Black inmates died in the mental health unit in a matter of weeks, including two who were killed by their cellmates. \"Within weeks of opening our investigation, six more Black men had died in the Jail,\" the Justice Department revealed. The family of one inmate, Lashawn Johnson, said he died in in the jail in 2022, after he was \"eaten alive\" by insects and bedbugs. About 91% of the jail's total population is Black, according to the report, compared to 45% of the overall Fulton County population.",
      "Justice Department investigators conducted multiple site visits, expert consultations and interviews with inmates and staff.",
      "Crumbling infrastructure, failing security, abusive staff and insufficient medical and mental health treatment contributed to the overall unconstitutional conditions described in the report.",
      "According to the county sheriff, 62% of the jail's inmates suffer from mental health or substance use disorders and the staff failed to provide proper treatment or take steps to mitigate risks of suicide.",
      "\"We found that 75% of those who died in the Jail since January 2021 had a current mental health diagnosis or reported a history of mental illness,\" the report said.",
      "Justice Department investigators noted in their findings that Fulton County and the sheriff sought to remedy some of the issues, including by surging millions in emergency funding and sending some inmates to detention facilities in other districts.",
      "Still, the problems persisted. In 2024, three men in Fulton County's main jail have died, including one person who was stabbed 20 times in April. From 2022 to the present, according to the report, \"six incarcerated people have died in violent attacks.\" All six victims were Black men, the Justice Department said.",
      "Non-lethal violent assaults are also rampant inside the jail. In 2023, the Sheriff's Office said there were 1,054 assaults and more than 300 stabbings in the jail. The investigation also uncovered a pattern or practice of sexual abuse, according to the report.",
      "Announcing the report's findings, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Department said officials in Fulton County have taken \"preliminary steps\" to address the issues outlined in the report, but such measures are \"not enough.\"",
      "The Justice Department's report outlines various remedial measures the jail must carry out to improve the conditions, like increased accountability measures for staff, overhauling how the jail secures its facilities from violence and contraband, and ensuring proper suicide prevention measures.",
      "\"At the end of the day, people do not abandon their civil and constitutional rights at the jailhouse door,\" Clarke said. \"We can fix these problems,\" she added later.",

The committee has Gaetz's Venmo transactions that allegedly show payments for the women.",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and has called the committee's investigation a \"frivolous\" smear campaign.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 10:39:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Who are the high rollers who bankrolled Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election, and what do they want in return for their generosity?",
    "story": [
      "More than $20 billion flooded into the 2024 presidential campaign, shattering the record for political spending in a single election. In an accelerating trend in American politics, Donald Trump, Kamala Harris and their allies raised colossal sums of money from billionaires.",
      "A majority of these megadonors were Republicans, according to Open Secrets, the nonpartisan watchdog organization that tracks the influence of money on politics.\u00a0 And with Trump's decisive victory, they hit the jackpot.",
      "So, who are these high rollers and what do they want in return for their generosity?",
      "Often, megadonors get lumped together in a single basket as plutocrats whose largesse is mostly about increasing their wealth with government contracts, tax breaks and regulatory relief, corrupting the democratic process along the way, according to critics of the U.S.' campaign finance system. There's certainly truth to that, but the story is more complicated.",
      "The super wealthy titans of tech and industry don't always share the same motivations and goals.\u00a0 Some are single-minded about bankrolling candidates as a way to bolster their bottom lines. But others are more ideologically driven, passionate about pet policies or reforming the way the government operates. Still others are driven by the scale of their ambitions or they crave the contact high of proximity to power.",
      "In some ways political giving defies neat categories, and some megadonors may have overlapping interests.\u00a0 Some donors' primary motivation may be an ideological commitment to unleashing the power of free markets, but that may also benefit their personal business interests.",
      "Others may be more transactional, fending off government investigations into their businesses or securing lucrative contracts, although that might coincide with their political beliefs.",
      "\"Megadonors can have a variety of financial, ideological or personal motivations for pouring millions into politics,\" said Brendan Fischer, deputy executive director of Documented, an investigative watchdog group. \"These motivations can operate on a spectrum or as a Venn diagram.\"",
      "But either way, with so much money flooding into American politics, it is helpful to be aware of the agendas and interests behind the torrent of cash gushing into the system. What follows is a taxonomy of the Republican donor class in the wake of a momentous election that has many wondering where the country is headed and who stands to benefit from the money that is driving the change.",
      "The Oligarch",
      "One dictionary definition of an oligarch is a \"very wealthy business leader who helps to run the government.\" That would seem to fit Elon Musk, the world's richest man, who personally gave more than $130 million (and his super PAC gave $200 million) to help Trump win back the White House. Musk has wasted no time taking advantage of his election dividend.",
      "He's been weighing in on key staffing decisions, has been named to head up (along with Vivek Ramaswamy) a commission on government efficiency and, according to Axios, even joined a call that Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last week. Musk also traveled with Trump to Washington Wednesday for meetings with President Biden and with congressional Republicans.",
      "Musk stands to benefit financially from that clout he has with the incoming administration. His companies are mammoth players across some of the most powerful sectors of the economy, from electric vehicles to rocketry and space exploration, from satellite-powered internet technology to artificial intelligence. According to the New York Times, Musk has at least 100 different contracts with the federal government with 17 different agencies. His SpaceX rocket company already has tens of billions of dollars in government contracts and stands to gain billions more during a Trump presidency.",
      "And Musk has carefully cultivated key government regulators who could bring him a financial windfall after Trump takes office. One, according to Politico, is FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, who Trump is expected to name as the agency's chairman. Carr has been critical of his fellow commissioners for cutting Musk's Starlink satellite company out of the Biden administration's rural broadband program, denying him hundreds of millions or even potentially billions in subsidies.",
      "Meanwhile look for Musk to influence SEC and other regulatory appointments that could stop investigations into his businesses. But what makes Musk unique is that his influence far transcends U.S. policies that could benefit his own businesses. Musk, through his global business empire, has the power to affect geopolitics on a scale perhaps greater than any person outside of government in history.",
      "His personal wealth, estimated at $314 billion dollars (it jumped about $70 billion since Trump was elected), is greater than the GDP of multiple countries combined and the defense budgets of many industrialized Western countries. Musk's Starlink owns at least half of the satellites currently in orbit. Through Starlink, Musk has the power to alter the course of wars, since the communications constellation he controls is often the primary way governments can get internet access in combat zones. His ambitions seem boundless \u2014 he even hopes to be at the forefront of colonizing space.",
      "And none of that even takes into account his ownership of X, the social media platform he bought for $44 billion in 2022 and positioned as a MAGA megaphone to help Trump.",
      "\"All oligarchs have wealth power at their disposal, but not all are positioned in the same way,\" said Jeffrey Winters, a professor at Northwestern who is an expert on oligarchs. \"Some sell candy bars everyone eats. Others are engaged in space, high tech, own major media or have defense contracts. This takes their power to another level.\"",
      "The Pragmatist",
      "These are the megadonors who are laser-focused on influencing policy and legislation on behalf of their business interests. They may be hard-edged conservatives, but they are pragmatic about how their political giving can help their bottom line and the American economy. A quintessential example would be Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of the Citadel hedge fund, who gave $100,000,000 in the 2024 cycle, putting him at No. 5 on the list of top contributors, according to Open Secrets.",
      "A self-described \"Reagan Republican,\" Griffin has long given to more establishment-oriented Super PACs like the Senate Leadership Fund and its counterpart in the lower chamber, the Congressional Leadership Fund. He has not donated to Trump. Nor has he given money to political causes closely associated with Trump's America First agenda. Instead, he has been tactical in his giving, focusing often on Republican candidates in down-ballot races who have business experience or are military veterans and can give Congress a more business-oriented complexion.",
      "\"Griffin is more of an establishment Republican more aligned with the traditional goals of the party, rather than the Trumpy wing,\" says Anna Massoglia, a campaign finance expert.",
      "Griffin said in a statement to CBS News, \"I'm grateful for our country and for all those who've come before us. Going forward, we all share a duty to further strengthen our nation and improve the lives of our fellow citizens. As such, I support solution-oriented leaders who share my commitment to individual rights and freedom, economic policies encouraging prosperity and upward mobility, access to high-quality education for all children and young adults, safe communities, and a strong national defense.\"",
      "A more cutting-edge example of the pragmatists are donors who back the crypto-currency industry.\u00a0Crypto Super PACs such as Fairshake and Defend American Jobs have been determined in their contributions to help elect pro-crypto candidates.",
      "Defend America Jobs poured in $40 million to help elect Bernie Moreno, the crypto-friendly candidate who defeated long-time Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown in the Ohio Senate race. Among those boosters of crypto and other digital currencies who gave heavily during the 2024 cycle were Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz ponied up $45.2 million to pro-crypto super PACs. CBS News was not able to reach Andreesen Horowitz for comment.",
      "Winklevoss Capital Management, the firm run by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, chipped in another $5 million. \"The crypto army is striking!\" Tyler Winklevoss posted on X on Election NIght, hailing Brown's defeat. But bucking the trend toward purely partisan contributions, the crypto industry gives to Republicans and Democrats alike, so long as they commit to keeping their industry unshackled by government regulations.",
      "The Ideologue",
      "These megadonors are more driven by personal causes that are not directly tied to their business interests. A representative example is Miriam Adelson, who along with her now-deceased husband Sheldon Adelson has been a casino magnate and major supporter of Jewish and Israel causes. In 2024, Miriam Adelson contributed more than $132 million to help Trump's election effort. Adelson knows that her largesse drives results.",
      "After the Adelsons donated tens of millions of dollars to help Trump win the White House in 2016, the new president announced the U.S. government would recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and said he would move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. The Adelsons even offered to pay for the construction of the new embassy. Miriam Adelson has not responded to a request for comment.",
      "\"These are passion projects, not attempts to feather the nest,\" says one Republican who knows Adelson but asked not to be named in discussing her donations.",
      "Another high-profile example of ideological givers are the billionaire shipping supply magnates Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein. The Wisconsin-based manufacturers of cardboard boxes and other packaging supplies, the Uihleins' business skyrocketed in sales in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic ignited an e-commerce boom. The Uihleins did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "During the 2024 campaign cycle, they were among the top five political donors, contributing more than $133 million to conservative causes. While much of their money went to Trump's election, they also gave generously to other MAGA-allied causes. They've given to so-called election integrity groups that questioned the results of the 2020 election, as well as organizations like Moms for Liberty, which advocates against public school curricula that mention LGBTQ rights or critical race theory and supports book bans.",
      "The Enigma",
      "Some megadonors are so discreet about their political giving that it is hard to know what category they belong in. One example is Tim Mellon, the reclusive railroad magnate and heir to the Gilded Age Mellon fortune who happens to have given more money to Trump's election (at least $197 million) than any other donor.",
      "Mellon doesn't go on cable TV or hobnob with politicos at party conventions, but he has written a memoir and penned some opinion pieces that offer some clues. Early in his adult life, he held liberal views on race, the problem of income equality and the environment. But as Mellon's business career evolved, he developed a strong antipathy for what he viewed as intrusive government regulations on business, which seems to have strongly shaped his political views.",
      "One defining episode for Mellon occurred after he bought an airport in Connecticut in the late 1990s. He cut down 340 trees, arguing that they posed a danger to pilots landing their planes. But state environmental regulators ultimately sued him and won. He was ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in damages. Did that experience fuel his desire to influence politics with his vast fortune? Perhaps, but it is also the case that Mellon has contributed to causes that would seem to have little to do with his particular business interests.",
      "In the 2024 cycle he also gave $25 million to support Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s presidential run. Some speculated that Mellon was trying to be a spoiler to help Trump, whom he was also backing financially.\u00a0 But last August, he wrote an article in the American Spectator explaining his support for Kennedy.\u00a0 Mellon, it turns out, is a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic. \"I could not fathom how a 'vaccine' could be foisted on the general public with so little (if any) adequate testing.\"",
      "He began giving to Kennedy's Children's Health Defense, which promotes false information about vaccines \u2014 and later to the Super PAC supporting Kennedy. None of that would seem to help Mellon's personal business interests. Mellon did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "Trump to nominate Matt Gaetz for attorney general",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 10:28:58 -0500",
    "summary": "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Matt Gaetz, whose selection as attorney general prompted backlash, resigned from Congress.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump says he will nominate longtime ally GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida to serve as his attorney general\u00a0\u2014 a choice that quickly prompted backlash from Democrats and some Republicans over Gaetz's history. Following Trump's announcement, Gaetz resigned from his seat in the House of Representatives, House Speaker Mike Johnson said.",
      "Gaetz, who has represented Florida's 1st Congressional District since 2017, has been the focus of several investigations into his conduct.",
      "In a statement on social media, Trump praised him as a \"tenacious attorney\" who will \"end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans' badly shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department.\"\u00a0Gaetz said\u00a0said on X, \"It will be an honor to serve as President Trump's Attorney General!\"",
      "If confirmed, Gaetz would lead the Justice Department \u2014 a federal agency of more than 100,000 employees \u2014 and oversee its numerous investigative components, including the FBI. Gaetz's ascent to the Justice Department's top job will come at a unique time, after Mr. Trump spent all of his 2024 presidential campaign under federal investigation or prosecution.",
      "Johnson said Wednesday night that Gaetz had already submitted his letter resigning from Congress, effective immediately.",
      "\"That caught us by surprise a little bit,\" Johnson said. \"But I asked him what the reasoning was, and he said, 'Well, you can't have too many absences,'\" referring to the GOP's slim majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson said Florida law would allow Gaetz's replacement to be selected within the next eight weeks or so.",
      "\"I've already placed a call to Gov. DeSantis in Florida and said, 'Let's start the clock,'\" Johnson said.",
      "In the letter, later obtained by CBS News, Gaetz wrote: \"I hereby resign, as United States Representatives for Florida's First Congressional District, effective immediately, and I do not intend to take the oath of office for the same office in the 119th Congress, to pursue the position of Attorney General in the Trump Administration.\"",
      "In a confirmation process, Gaetz would undoubtedly face questions about an ongoing review by the bipartisan House Ethics Committee, which said in a statement earlier this year it was looking into allegations that Gaetz may have \"engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.\"",
      "Prior to his resignation, the committee had scheduled a vote Friday on whether to release its report into Gaetz, three sources with knowledge of the committee's work told CBS News. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, on Thursday called on the House Ethics panel to preserve and share the report, as well as \"all relevant documentation\" on Gaetz with his committee.",
      "Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing and maintained his innocence throughout a Justice Department probe \u2014 closed last year \u2014\u00a0 into allegations that he violated sex trafficking laws and obstructed justice. Federal prosecutors in Florida did not file any charges in the case and informed the congressman that the case was closed.",
      "Senators, who will vote on his confirmation, began to weigh in as they learned of Trump's intent to nominate Gaetz.",
      "\"He wants to be the top cop, so I would say that yeah, he's certainly going to have to answer all those things, whether they're legit or not legit,\" GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said of past allegations against Gaetz. \"Some of these investigations are still open, obviously.\" Cramer also said the pick was \"a surprise to me\" and expressed some reservations.",
      "\"The one thing about Matt was that concerned me a little bit. I didn't like the way he handled the squabble with with Speaker McCarthy.\" He said he was for every one of Trump's other nominees, adding, \"Matt could earn that, but I'm not there right out of the chute with Matt.\"",
      "\"This one was not on my bingo card,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told reporters. \"I don't think this is a serious nomination for attorney general. We need to have a serious attorney general.\"",
      "Senate Republican conference Chair John Barrasso, when asked by reporters about Gaetz, said, \"The president is going to continue to make his appointments. We're going to continue to look forward to them coming to the Senate and have hearings and get his Cabinet confirmed as quickly as possible.\"",
      "Sources told CBS News that the most conceivable, easiest and fastest way to install Gaetz would be for the House and Senate to recess shortly after Inauguration Day so that Gaetz and others could be installed through recess appointments, a temporary option that doesn't require Senate confirmation.",
      "One former senior Justice Department official during Trump's first administration told CBS News that \"Matt Gaetz has no business running DOJ.\"",
      "Gaetz, who has served on the House Judiciary Committee and has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration, would take over the post as the first confirmed attorney general under a Trump presidency since Bill Barr. Barr resigned in 2020 when then-President Trump sought to remain in power after he lost the election. Barr left office at the end of that year and was replaced by an acting attorney general, Jeff Rosen. Rosen and a number of his subordinates later testified against Trump during a hearing of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the Capitol. The former officials alleged that Trump had sought to pressure the Justice Department to investigate his claims of election fraud.",
      "Attorney General Merrick Garland, a former federal judge, appointed numerous special counsels to conduct investigations into high-profile figures, including Mr. Biden, his son Hunter and Mr. Trump.",
      "Gaetz's expected nomination comes as some of the president-elect's supporters have called for change inside the Justice Department. Attorney Mark Paoletta, who was thought to be in the running to serve as Mr. Trump's attorney general, said, \"Career DOJ lawyers must be fully committed to implementing President Trump's policies or they should leave or be fired.\"",
      "\"If the president wants to deport illegal aliens, secure the border, ban race-based 'affirmative action' and DEI, investigate antisemitism, halt Big Tech censorship, grant pardons and commutations to Jan 6th defendants, he has every right to expect that these perfectly lawful policies are implemented,\" Paoletta wrote. \"It is absolutely unacceptable for career employees to seek to thwart this policy agenda.\"",
      "Trump's first term brought tension between the White House and his two Senate-confirmed attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and Barr. Sessions, who angered Trump because he recused himself from the Justice Department investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, was forced out shortly after the 2018 midterm elections.",
      "In a statement released after last week's election results, the Justice Department said it is \"committed to ensuring an orderly and effective transition to the new Administration.\"",
      "Beyond the political implications, like attorneys general of both parties who have preceded him, Gaetz would likely try to shape the Justice Department around the priorities of the president. And he would be all but certain to reverse course on various Biden-era policies, too.",
      "Trump has called for mass deportations, pardons for some of those convicted in the ongoing Jan. 6 investigation and regulation slashing \u2014 all actions in which the Justice Department is likely to play a central role.",
      "Trump and Republicans have long criticized Garland's leadership and targeted various Justice Department initiatives, including the expansion of civil rights and business regulation cases. Under the Trump administration, that is likely to come to an end.",
      "Much of next attorney general's work would depend on who Trump appoints to lead various Justice Department divisions, like those that handle national security and criminal matters. Trump's pick to oversee the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel will also likely be key to Trump's agenda because this office will issue decisions on the department's legal interpretation of the president's decisions. For instance, it could cement the president's power to fire certain political appointees and career government officials.",
      "FBI Director Christopher Wray reports directly to the attorney general. He was nominated by Trump in 2017 for a ten-year term. Since then, however, the president-elect has criticized the Bureau amid the federal probes into Trump's conduct, and he has vowed to implement reforms.",
      "Michael Kaplan, \n                                                  \n                      Andres Triay, \n                                                  \n                                  Kaia Hubbard, \n                                                  \n                      Fin G\u00f3mez, \n                                                  \n                      Alan He and \n                                                  \n                                  Margaret Brennan\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "title": "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, experts say.",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 07:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",
      "\"We would imagine that within a few months of him taking office, we would see the first tranche of tariffs taking effect,\" Manak said.",

      "\"For over two decades, Tulsi has fought for our country and the freedoms of all Americans,\" Trump said in a statement announcing Gabbard as his pick. \"As a former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, she has broad support in both parties \u2014 she is now a proud Republican!\"",
      "The president-elect said Gabbard \"will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our intelligence community, championing our constitutional rights, and securing peace through strength.\"",

      "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in 2019 that she believed the Russians were \"grooming\" a Democratic presidential primary contender to be a third-party candidate, which appeared to be a reference to Gabbard. Gabbard sued Clinton for defamation in 2020, but dropped the suit shortly after it was filed.",
      "In 2019, Gabbard also expressed opposition to U.S. involvement in Syria's civil war and said the country's leader, Bashar al-Assad, \"is not the enemy of the United States because Syria does not pose a direct threat to the United States.\" Gabbard\u00a0met with Assad\u00a0in 2017, which she defended at the time as a \"fact-finding mission,\" but in 2019 she described him a \"brutal dictator.\"",

It requires the schools to designate separate bathrooms, locker rooms and overnight accommodations \"for the exclusive use\" of either males and females, based on one's gender assigned at or near birth, in both school buildings and facilities used for a school-sponsored event.",
      "The legislation would not apply to school employees, emergencies or people helping young children or those with disabilities, and schools would still be able to provide single-use and family bathroom facilities.",

      "Transgender and gender-nonbinary teens who were subject to restroom or locker room restrictions had a higher prevalence of sexual assault, according to a 2019 study published in the journal Pediatrics. About 36% of surveyed teens reported sexual assault, the study found.",

      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa.

      "Ryan and her fellow researchers showed that seal-shaped boards decked with bright horizontal lights were less likely to be attacked by great white sharks.",
      "This appeared to be because the lights distorted the silhouette on the ocean's surface, making it appear less appetizing.",
      "\"There is this longstanding fear of white sharks and part of that fear is that we don't understand them that well,\" said Ryan, from Australia's Macquarie University.",
      "The study, published in the journal Current Biology, was conducted in the waters of South Africa's Mossel Bay, a popular great white feeding ground.",
      "Seal-shaped decoys were strung with different configurations of LED lights and towed behind a boat to see which attracted the most attention.",
      "Brighter lights were better at deterring sharks, the research found, while vertical lights were less effective than horizontal.",
      "Macquarie University Professor Nathan Hart, one of the study's authors, said the lights caused a \"complex interaction\" with the shark's behavior.",
      "\"It's like an invisibility cloak but with the exception that we are splitting the object, the visual silhouette, into smaller bits,\" Hart said.",
      "The study's authors released a video showing some of the research in action.",
      "Ryan said the results were better than expected and is now in the process of building prototypes for use on the underside of kayaks and surfboards.",
      "Australia has some of the world's most comprehensive shark management measures, including monitoring drones, shark nets and a tagging system that alerts authorities when a shark is near a crowded beach.",
      "Ryan said her research could allow less invasive mitigation methods to be used.",
      "More research was needed to see if bull and tiger sharks -- which have different predatory behavior \u2014 responded to the lights in a similar way, the authors said.",
      "There have been more than 1,200 shark incidents in Australia since 1791, of which 255 resulted in death, official data shows.",
      "Great white sharks were responsible for 94 of those deaths.",
      "The overall number of deadly shark attacks worldwide in 2023 remained relatively low, but it was still twice the previous year's total, according to the latest iteration of the\u00a0International Shark Attack File\u00a0\u2014 a database of global shark attacks run by the University of Florida.",

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 07:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Oil and natural gas companies will have to pay a federal fee if they emit methane above certain levels under a rule being finalized by the Biden administration that incoming Trump officials are likely to reverse.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Oil and natural gas companies for the first time will have to pay a federal fee if they emit dangerous methane above certain levels under a rule being made final by the Biden administration.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency rule follows through on a directive from Congress included in the 2022 climate law. The new fee is intended to encourage industry to adopt best practices that reduce emissions of methane - the primary component of natural gas - and thereby avoid paying.",
      "Methane is a climate \"super pollutant\" that is far more potent in the short term than carbon dioxide and is responsible for about one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. The oil and natural gas sector is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the United States, and advocates say reduction of methane emissions is a crucial way to slow climate change.",
      "The rule, set to be announced Tuesday at an international climate conference in Azerbaijan, comes hours after President-elect Donald Trump named former New York congressman Lee Zeldin to head the agency in Trump's second term. If confirmed by the Senate, Zeldin is expected to move to reverse or loosen dozens of environmental regulations approved under President Biden as Trump seeks to establish U.S. \"energy dominance\u2033 worldwide.",
      "Trump is likely to target the methane fee amid a flurry of expected actions he has promised to deregulate the oil and gas industry.",
      "As outlined by the EPA, excess methane produced in 2024 could result in a fee of $900 per ton, with fees rising to $1,200 per ton in 2025 and $1,500 per ton by 2026. Industry groups are likely to challenge the rule, including any effort to impose a retroactive fee.",
      "The rule wouldn't become final until early next year, following publication in the Federal Register.",
      "EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement that the rule will work in tandem with a new EPA rule on methane emissions imposed this year. The rule targets the U.S. oil and natural gas industry for its role in global warming as Mr. Biden seeks to secure his legacy on fighting climate change.",
      "The fee, formally known as the Waste Emissions Charge, will encourage early deployment of available technologies to reduce methane emissions and other harmful air pollutants, Regan said. The fee \"is the latest in a series of actions under President Biden's methane strategy to improve efficiency in the oil and gas sector, support American jobs, protect clean air and reinforce U.S. leadership on the global stage,\" he said.",
      "Industry groups and Republican-led states have challenged the earlier methane rule in court, but lost a bid for the Supreme Court to block the rule while the case continues before lower-level judges.",
      "Opponents argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and set unattainable standards with the new regulations. The EPA, though, said the rules are squarely within its legal responsibilities and would protect the public.",
      "Many large oil and gas companies already meet or exceed methane-performance levels set by Congress under the climate law, meaning they are unlikely to be forced to pay the new fee, Regan and other officials said.",
      "Even so, the EPA estimates that the rule will result in cumulative emissions reductions of 1.2 million metric tons of methane (the equivalent of 34 million metric tons of carbon-dioxide) through 2035. That figure is similar to clean-air gains from taking nearly 8 million gas-powered cars off the road for a year, the EPA said. Cumulative climate benefits could total as much $2 billion, the agency said.",
      "Like the earlier methane rule, the new fee faces a near-certain legal challenge from industry groups. The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, called a fee proposed earlier this year a \"punitive tax increase\" that \"undermines America's energy advantage.''",
      "The API said it looks forward to working with Congress to repeal the \"misguided new tax on American energy.\"",
      "Environmental groups, for their part, have hailed the impending methane fee, saying oil and gas companies should be held accountable for pollution that contributes to global warming. Oil and gas companies routinely calculate that it's cheaper to waste methane through flaring and other techniques than to make necessary upgrades to prevent leaks, they said.",
      "The EPA said it expects that over time, fewer oil and gas companies will be charged for excess methane as they reduce emissions in compliance with the rule.",

    "story": [
      "Beirut \u2014 Declassified 1970s-era U.S. spy satellite imagery has led a British-Iraqi archeological team to what they believe is the site of a seventh-century battle that became decisive in the spread of Islam throughout the region.",
      "The Battle of al-Qadisiyah was fought in Mesopotamia \u2014 in present-day Iraq \u2014 in the A.D. 630s between Arab Muslims and the army of the Sassanid Persian dynasty during a period of Muslim expansion. The Arab army prevailed and continued on its march into Persia, now Iran.",
      "A joint team of archeologists from the U.K.'s Durham University and the University of Al-Qadisiyah stumbled across the site while undertaking a remote sensing survey to map the Darb Zubaydah, a pilgrimage route from Iraq's Kufa to Mecca in Saudi Arabia built more than 1,000 years ago. The findings were published Tuesday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "While mapping the route, the team noticed that a site some 20 miles south of Kufa in Iraq's southern Najaf province \u2014 a desert area with scattered plots of agricultural land \u2014 had features that closely matched the description of the al-Qadisiyah battle site described in historic texts.",
      "William Deadman, a specialist in archaeological remote sensing at Durham University, said the Cold War era satellite images are commonly used tools by archeologists working in the Middle East because the older images often show features that have been destroyed or altered and wouldn't show up on present-day satellite images.",
      "\"The Middle East has developed so much in the last 50 years, both agricultural expansion and urban expansion,\" he said. Some of the distinguishing features at the al-Qadisiyah site, such as a distinctive trench, were \"much more pristine and clear\" in the 1970s images, he said.",
      "A survey on the ground confirmed the findings and convinced the team that they had correctly identified the site.",
      "The key features were a deep trench, two fortresses and an ancient river that was reportedly once forded by elephant-mounted Persian troops, said Jaafar Jotheri, a professor of archeology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah who's part of the team that made the discovery. The survey team also found pottery shards consistent with the time period when the battle took place.",
      "A revealing, well-known battle",
      "Jotheri said Iraqis of his generation, who grew up under the rule of Saddam Hussein, were all familiar with the battle in minute detail, down to the names of the generals on both sides.",
      "The battle at the time had political connotations \u2014 Iraq was engaged in a devastating war with Iran through much of the 1980s. Saddam pointed to the Battle of Qadisiyah as a harbinger of victory for Iraq.",
      "Like most children growing up in that era, Jotheri said he'd watched a popular movie about the battle multiple times as it was on regular rotation on television.",
      "In the post-Saddam era, al-Qadisiyah has become something of a political litmus test. Iraqis' views of the battle vary depending on their feelings toward Iran, which has expanded its influence in the country since the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that toppled Saddam.",
      "\"There is some political and religious context in this battle because now, of course, we have religious differences, ethnic differences, political differences in Iraq and we read or we view everything based on our \u2026 differences,\" Jotheri said. But he added, \"We all agree that it is a very important battle, a decisive one, and we all know about it.\"",
      "Discovery was part of a regional trend",
      "The team plans to begin excavations at the site in the coming year, Jotheri said.",
      "The discovery comes as part of a broader project launched in 2015 to document endangered archaeological sites in the region.",
      "It also comes at the time of a resurgence of archeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \"cradle of civilization,\" but where archeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's selection of former Rep. Matt Gaetz to be attorney general is his most controversial Cabinet pick yet, and the Florida Republican is likely to face obstacles in the confirmation process.",
      "But Trump is seeking an important change to the Senate confirmation process that would allow him to install some officials and sidestep lengthy hearings and a floor vote, in which nominees need a majority vote to be confirmed.",
      "Before Senate Republicans elected their leaders for the upcoming 119th Congress, Trump demanded that the candidates agree to recess appointments, which would give him the option of bypassing the Senate's role of approving or rejecting the president's nominations. Trump argued that without the ability to temporarily install nominees he would not be able to fill the positions in a timely manner.",
      "The legal basis for recess appointments emanates from a constitutional clause that gives the president \"the power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate.\" A Supreme Court ruling in 2014 concluded that recess appointments could only be made when the Senate is not in session for 10 or more days, after President Barack Obama made controversial appointments when senators were on break.",
      "Senators often leave Washington for long stretches of time, but have utilized pro forma sessions to prevent presidents from installing nominees without their consent.",
      "\"In recent years, the Senate \u2014 regardless of which party controlled it \u2014 has used pro forma sessions to ensure that it is never in recess for more than three days,\" said Josh Chafetz, a law and politics professor at Georgetown University.",
      "For Trump to make recess appointments, the Senate would have to agree, through a simple majority vote, to go on recess for at least 10 days. The House must also agree to allow the Senate to adjourn, but Chavetz says if the House does not agree, or if it disagrees with the Senate on the length of adjournment, then the president has the constitutional power to adjourn both chambers for a timeframe of his choosing.",
      "\"That second route has never been used before in U.S. history, so no one is quite sure how it would work,\" Chafetz said.",
      "A recess appointment, however, does not have the same benefits as a nominee confirmed by the Senate. Without Senate approval, the appointee would not be paid. The appointee can serve in the role for up to two years, depending on when the appointment was made. After that, the individual could be installed again through a recess appointment or the regular confirmation process.",
      "Some senators, including Republicans who will be in the majority come January, showed little appetite for giving up their constitutional power, especially after Trump announced that he intended to nominate Gaetz to lead the Justice Department.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said Wednesday. \"If the president proceeds with that nominee, I think it shows the importance of having the Senate advice and consent process.\"",

Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told reporters Thursday. \"I say we. A lot of people will spend a lot of political capital on something that, that even if they got done, you'd have to wonder if it was worth it.\"",
      "Cramer added that Gaetz has \"got a really steep hill to climb to get lots of votes, including mine.\"",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress on Wednesday after Trump announced his selection. The timing came days before a House panel was set to vote on releasing a report on whether Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct. Gaetz was also the subject of a previous Justice Department investigation that sought to determine if he violated sex trafficking and obstruction of justice laws. No charges were filed, and Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "\"We have a process around here for considering presidential nominees,\" Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said Thursday when asked by reporters about Gaetz. \"That's a constitutional responsibility of the Senate, and I intend to play my part as a member of the Judiciary Committee in doing that vetting and advice and consent.\"",
      "\"I don't think we should be circumventing the Senate's responsibilities, but I think it's premature to be talking about recess appointments,\" Cornyn added.",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee is responsible for conducting confirmation hearings for the attorney general nominee. Several other Judiciary Committee members also weighed in Thursday.",

An average season brings 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which did predict the 2024 season would produce \"above average\" numbers.",
      "What is the projected path of Tropical Storm Sara?",
      "Sara was forecast to move closer to the northern coast of Honduras through early Saturday and then approach Belize on Sunday, the Hurricane Center said.",
      "Sara could potentially bring catastrophic rainfall to parts of Central America. Between 10 and 20 inches of heavy rainfall are possible in Honduras early next week, forecasters warned, with up to 30 inches accumulating in some places.",
      "Forecasters at the hurricane center said they expected \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic\" flash floods to hit Honduras and persist through the weekend. The hurricane center also warned of potentially disastrous mudslides caused by the storm, especially in the mountainous area along and near Sierra La Esperanza on the country's northeastern coast. They estimated those conditions would persist through the weekend.",
      "The rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala and western Nicaragua will likely receive between 5 and 10 inches of rainfall as the storm runs its course through that region, but up to 15 inches are possible.",
      "Governments across Central America have issued various watches and warnings as people brace for Sara's effects. Honduras' northern coast and its Bay Islands were under a tropical storm warning Thursday night.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara become a hurricane?",
      "It remains to be seen whether Sara will grow into a hurricane. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its sustained winds reach at least 74 mph, making it a Category 1 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.",
      "Forecasters also cautioned residents of Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to be ready for possible impacts of Sara early next week.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara hit Florida?",
      "After entering the Gulf of Mexico, some forecast models suggested the storm could make a right-hand turn and heading toward Florida by late next week, though Nolan noted that conditions can quickly change. Other models had the storm potentially heading into the central part of the Gulf and possibly dissipating.",
      "Air Force hurricane hunters that flew into the area to investigate the strength and structure of the developing weather system located Sara Thursday night along Hondruras' northeastern coast, the hurricane center said.",
      "Forecast models take in the current environmental factors along with historical data to compute \"spaghetti plots\" of where systems may track. Each model uses different computations, and the forecast track is an output of the consensus from those models.",
      "\"It is too soon to determine what impacts the system could bring to portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including Florida, the Florida Keys, and Cuba during the middle portion of next week,\" the hurricane center said Thursday. \"Residents in these areas should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.\"",

      "\"Admittedly yes, that long-term trend is gradually increasing,\" Dr. Timothy Hoyt, Deputy Director of the Office of Force Resiliency at the Defense Department told reporters on a call.",
      "The suicide rate has grown from 17 per 100,000 active duty service members in 2011 to 26 in 2023, according to data released in the annual report for 2023, although the rate decreased for one year from 2020-2021.",
      "Active duty service members who died by suicide in 2023 were largely enlisted males under the age of 30, accounting for 61% of suicides. The most common method of suicide was firearms, at 65%, followed by hanging or asphyxiation, at 28%.",
      "Defense officials said the suicide rates were similar to rates across the U.S. population between 2011 and 2022.",
      "\"We are not immune to the factors that drive suicide throughout the U.S., and our service members face, in addition to those, a number of unique military challenges,\" Hoyt said.",
      "He added recommendations from the Suicide Prevention Response and Independent Review Committee have given a \"mechanism by which we can address as many of those potential risks as possible and make investments in those spaces.\"",
      "The Pentagon set up the review committee to provide recommendations to reduce suicide deaths\u00a0in the military. Last year the committee made a series of recommendations, including broadly improving the delivery of mental health care, addressing stigma and other barriers to care and revising suicide prevention training.",
      "Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who established the review committee mandated by Congress in 2022 said in a statement that the annual report's findings \"urgently demonstrate the need for the Department to redouble its work in the complex fields of suicide prevention and postvention.\" Austin said the Defense Department completed 20 of the 83 committee's recommendations.",

      "\"I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS),\" he said in a post on X. He said Americans have been \"crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation\" about public health, and Kennedy would \"Make America Great and Healthy Again!\"",
      "Kennedy has a long record of criticizing vaccines, including spreading misleading claims about their safety.",
      "He has vowed to combat an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases and believes that large drug and food companies are to blame for a broad swath of ailments. Kennedy has claimed a number of health issues have worsened due to federal inaction, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity. He has also urged removing fluoride from drinking water.",
      "Kennedy would need to be confirmed by the Senate. His odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called\u00a0\"anti-science, fringe public health stances,\"\u00a0but with\u00a0Republicans in the majority\u00a0come January, Trump's nominees will have an easier path to confirmation.",
      "Despite the expected opposition to Kennedy's nomination \u2014 along with other controversial choices to lead national security agencies and former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz to lead the Justice Department \u2014 Trump has told associates in recent days he is standing by his pick for health chief.",
      "\"No one can talk him out of it,\" one of the sources familiar with the pick said Thursday.",

      "The sprawling HHS Department encompasses a number of agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.

      "The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a watchdog group that often clashes with the FDA and in some ways is closely aligned with Kennedy's calls to get chemicals out of foods, put out a statement condemning his nomination.",
      "\"Nominating an anti-vaxxer like Kennedy to HHS is like putting a Flat Earther at the head of NASA,\" the group's president, Dr. Peter G. Lurie, said in a statement. \"CSPI opposes this nomination and any other nominees who are a direct threat to science and evidence-based solutions.\"",
      "But one prominent Democrat, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, said in a social media post that he was \"excited by the news\" of Kennedy's nomination. He praised Kennedy for helping to defeat vaccine mandates in Colorado in 2019 but said he hoped that Kennedy would embrace personal choice on vaccines, rather than banning them. He also said he was optimistic about Kennedy's vow to take on big pharma and high drug costs for Americans. Polis also backed Kennedy's criticism of \"entire departments, like the nutrition department at the FDA\" that \"are not doing their job, they're not protecting our kids,\" in particular from pesticides used in agriculture.",
      "Polis later clarified his praise, saying, \"Science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation's health policy and the science-backed decision to get vaccinated improves public health and safety.\"",

And I think the data are essentially overwhelming, in certain areas, but we'll just have to engage in the dialogue,\" Marks said this week an event hosted by the Milken Institute in Washington, D.C., ahead of Trump's decision.",
      "Kennedy, who faced a costly and time-consuming process to appear on general election ballots as an independent candidate, ended his longshot bid for the White House in August and endorsed Trump.",
      "Kennedy said there were three issues that convinced him to endorse Trump: free speech, the war in Ukraine and what he called the \"war on our children.\" He said processed foods, chemicals and obesity were destroying the health of children in the U.S.",
      "At an August rally with Kennedy, Trump vowed to establish a panel to investigate chronic health problems and childhood diseases, as well as establish an independent presidential commission on assassination attempts that would be tasked with releasing all of the remaining documents related to President John F.

      "The Pentagon office investigating reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena, the government's term for UFOs, received 21 reports last year that contain enough data for the intelligence community to continue actively investigating.",

      "\"There are interesting cases that with my physics and engineering background and time in the [intelligence community], I do not understand, and I don't know anybody else understands them,\" Dr. Jon Kosloski, director, All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) told reporters during a briefing on the unclassified version of the annual report mandated by Congress.",
      "Kosloski said the office has found \"no evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity, or technologies,\" and he said none of the cases point to foreign adversaries or breakthrough technologies.",
      "In total, the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office received 757 reports of UAP between May 1, 2023 and June 1, 2024. Of the 757 received, 485 occurred during that time period, while 272 occurred outside of the reporting period but were not included in previous reports.",
      "The office resolved 49 of the cases by identifying the object as various types of balloons, birds or drones, and it expects to resolve 243 others by identifying them as one of those objects, as well.",
      "Another 444 didn't have enough data to keep investigating, so the office will go into the its active archive to see if other data can be found.",
      "Twenty-one merit further analysis, and these cases Kosloski found interesting because they correspond with the typical shapes the office receives reports on, like orbs, triangles, and cylinders, and at least \"one of those cases has been happening for an extended period of time.\"",

    "story": [
      "The jail in Georgia's largest county, Fulton County, leaves its inmates vulnerable to \"substantial risk of serious harm from violence\" and violates their constitutional and statutory rights, according to a new Justice Department report released Thursday.",
      "After a more than year-long civil rights probe into the Fulton County Jail \u2013 which has long been plagued by overcrowding, understaffing and violence \u2014 federal investigators concluded detainees are subjected to \"dangerous and unsanitary\" conditions, like pest infestations and malnourishment. These conditions especially endanger those with mental health conditions, the report found.",
      "\"None of these problems are new,\" the report said. \"And despite widespread awareness of these issues, the unconstitutional and illegal conditions have persisted.\"",
      "The Justice Department launched its civil investigation into Fulton County's jail in July 2023, after at least four Black inmates died in the mental health unit in a matter of weeks, including two who were killed by their cellmates. \"Within weeks of opening our investigation, six more Black men had died in the Jail,\" the Justice Department revealed. The family of one inmate, Lashawn Johnson, said he died in in the jail in 2022, after he was \"eaten alive\" by insects and bedbugs. About 91% of the jail's total population is Black, according to the report, compared to 45% of the overall Fulton County population.",
      "Justice Department investigators conducted multiple site visits, expert consultations and interviews with inmates and staff.",
      "Crumbling infrastructure, failing security, abusive staff and insufficient medical and mental health treatment contributed to the overall unconstitutional conditions described in the report.",
      "According to the county sheriff, 62% of the jail's inmates suffer from mental health or substance use disorders and the staff failed to provide proper treatment or take steps to mitigate risks of suicide.",
      "\"We found that 75% of those who died in the Jail since January 2021 had a current mental health diagnosis or reported a history of mental illness,\" the report said.",
      "Justice Department investigators noted in their findings that Fulton County and the sheriff sought to remedy some of the issues, including by surging millions in emergency funding and sending some inmates to detention facilities in other districts.",
      "Still, the problems persisted. In 2024, three men in Fulton County's main jail have died, including one person who was stabbed 20 times in April. From 2022 to the present, according to the report, \"six incarcerated people have died in violent attacks.\" All six victims were Black men, the Justice Department said.",
      "Non-lethal violent assaults are also rampant inside the jail. In 2023, the Sheriff's Office said there were 1,054 assaults and more than 300 stabbings in the jail. The investigation also uncovered a pattern or practice of sexual abuse, according to the report.",
      "Announcing the report's findings, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Department said officials in Fulton County have taken \"preliminary steps\" to address the issues outlined in the report, but such measures are \"not enough.\"",
      "The Justice Department's report outlines various remedial measures the jail must carry out to improve the conditions, like increased accountability measures for staff, overhauling how the jail secures its facilities from violence and contraband, and ensuring proper suicide prevention measures.",
      "\"At the end of the day, people do not abandon their civil and constitutional rights at the jailhouse door,\" Clarke said. \"We can fix these problems,\" she added later.",

Medical King of Brooklyn, New York, is recalling about 220,000 adult portable bed rails due to entrapment and asphyxia risks.

    "story": [
      "Tropical Storm Sara formed in the Caribbean on Thursday, becoming the 18th named storm of the 2024 Atlantic Hurricane Season. The system, previously called Tropical Depression 19, developed in the western Caribbean earlier this week and intensified while traveling westward on a path toward Central America.",
      "Sara had sustained winds of 45 mph and was located around 105 miles north-northwest of the Nicaragua-Honduras border and 105 miles east-southeast of the Honduras island of Guanaja, moving west at 10 mph, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said\u00a0in a 10 p.m. ET update. A weather system is considered a tropical storm when its sustained wind speeds reach at least 39 mph.",
      "The storm is expected to linger in the Caribbean through the weekend and slowly move into the Gulf of Mexico early next week. After that, its path is less clear. CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan said a lot of the models are now trending towards it dissipating either after it enters the Gulf of Mexico or over Mexico, but several still have it aiming towards Florida.",
      "\"Florida residents should closely monitor the forecast updates as they come in,\" Nolan advised.",
      "The Atlantic Hurricane Season\u00a0officially runs from June 1 until Nov. 30, with activity typically peaking between mid-August and mid-October. An average season brings 14 named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which did predict the 2024 season would produce \"above average\" numbers.",
      "What is the projected path of Tropical Storm Sara?",
      "Sara was forecast to move closer to the northern coast of Honduras through early Saturday and then approach Belize on Sunday, the Hurricane Center said.",
      "Sara could potentially bring catastrophic rainfall to parts of Central America. Between 10 and 20 inches of heavy rainfall are possible in Honduras early next week, forecasters warned, with up to 30 inches accumulating in some places.",
      "Forecasters at the hurricane center said they expected \"life-threatening and potentially catastrophic\" flash floods to hit Honduras and persist through the weekend. The hurricane center also warned of potentially disastrous mudslides caused by the storm, especially in the mountainous area along and near Sierra La Esperanza on the country's northeastern coast. They estimated those conditions would persist through the weekend.",
      "The rest of Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, eastern Guatemala and western Nicaragua will likely receive between 5 and 10 inches of rainfall as the storm runs its course through that region, but up to 15 inches are possible.",
      "Governments across Central America have issued various watches and warnings as people brace for Sara's effects. Honduras' northern coast and its Bay Islands were under a tropical storm warning Thursday night.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara become a hurricane?",
      "It remains to be seen whether Sara will grow into a hurricane. A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its sustained winds reach at least 74 mph, making it a Category 1 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.",
      "Forecasters also cautioned residents of Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula to be ready for possible impacts of Sara early next week.",
      "Will Tropical Storm Sara hit Florida?",
      "After entering the Gulf of Mexico, some forecast models suggested the storm could make a right-hand turn and heading toward Florida by late next week, though Nolan noted that conditions can quickly change. Other models had the storm potentially heading into the central part of the Gulf and possibly dissipating.",
      "Air Force hurricane hunters that flew into the area to investigate the strength and structure of the developing weather system located Sara Thursday night along Hondruras' northeastern coast, the hurricane center said.",
      "Forecast models take in the current environmental factors along with historical data to compute \"spaghetti plots\" of where systems may track. Each model uses different computations, and the forecast track is an output of the consensus from those models.",
      "\"It is too soon to determine what impacts the system could bring to portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, including Florida, the Florida Keys, and Cuba during the middle portion of next week,\" the hurricane center said Thursday. \"Residents in these areas should regularly monitor updates to the forecast.\"",

    "story": [
      "New Delhi \u2014\u00a0India's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that authorities demolishing illegally-constructed homes and other properties belonging to suspected criminals is unconstitutional and must cease. The practice is allegedly used widely by several state governments to punish suspects outside the court justice process, and is commonly known as \"bulldozer justice.\"",
      "\"The executive can't become a judge and decide that a person accused is guilty and, therefore, punish him by demolishing his properties. Such an act would be transgressing [the] executive's limits,\" the court said in a 95-page judgement.",
      "The court issued its ruling in response to several petitions over a spate of home demolitions targeting suspected criminals in states governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in recent years. Critics have accused the BJP state administrations of using bulldozer justice primarily to\u00a0target Muslims \u2014 an accusation the party has repeatedly denied.",
      "BJP state officials have argued that due process of law has been followed in carrying out the demolitions, but the court said authorities had adopted a \"pick and choose\" attitude toward illegally constructed homes, singling out those belonging to Muslims suspected of other crimes while sparing similar, but non-Muslim-owned illegal dwellings in the same area.",
      "\"In such cases, where the authorities indulge in arbitrary pick and choose of structures and it is established that soon before the initiation of such an action an occupant of the structure was found to be involved in a criminal case, a presumption could be drawn that the real motive for such demolition proceedings was not the illegal structure, but an action of penalizing the accused without even trying him before the court of law,\" the court said.",
      "One of the petitions to the Supreme Court was filed over the April 2022 demolition of dozens of homes belonging largely to Muslims following sectarian clashes in Delhi's Jahangirpuri neighborhood, which drew allegations of religious discrimination and extrajudicial punishment.",
      "\"The chilling sight of a bulldozer demolishing a building\u2026 reminds one of a lawless state of affairs,\" Justices B.R. Gavai and K.V. Viswanathan said in the court's Wednesday judgment. \"Our constitutional ethos and values would not permit any such abuse of power and such misadventures cannot be tolerated by the court of law.\"",
      "The court warned state authorities it would take action against officials found guilty of \"such highhanded and arbitrary\" actions and issued detailed guidelines for the demolition of homes constructed without the required permits.",
      "The new guidelines make it mandatory for authorities to give at least 15 days' advance notice to an occupant before an illegal home is demolished and to explain the reason for the building being razed.",
      "The new guidelines state that occupiers of such properties must be given sufficient time to either remove the construction or challenge the demolition order in a court.",

    "story": [
      "A mysterious diamond-laden necklace with possible links to a scandal that contributed to the downfall of Marie Antoinette, sold for $4.8 million at an auction in Geneva Wednesday.",
      "The 18th century jewel containing around 300 carats of diamonds had been estimated to sell at the Sotheby's Royal and Noble Jewels sale for $1.8-2.8 million.",
      "But after energetic bidding, the hammer price ticked in at 3.55 million Swiss francs ($4 million), and Sotheby's listed the final price after taxes and commissions at 4.26 million francs ($4.81 million).",
      "The unidentified buyer, who put in her bid over the phone, was \"ecstatic,\" Andres White Correal, chairman of the Sotheby's jewelry department, told AFP.",

      "Some of the diamonds in the piece are believed to stem from the jewel at the center of the \"Diamond Necklace Affair\" \u2014 a scandal in the 1780s that further tarnished the reputation of France's last queen, Marie Antoinette, and boosted support for the coming French Revolution.",
      "The auction house said the necklace, composed of three rows of diamonds finished with a diamond tassel at each end, had emerged \"miraculously intact\" from a private Asian collection to make its first public appearance in 50 years.",

      "Members of this aristocratic family are believed to have worn the necklace twice in public: once at the 1937 coronation of King George VI and once at his daughter Queen Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953.",
      "\"Spectacular piece of history\"",
      "Beyond that, little is known of the necklace, including who designed it and for whom it was commissioned, although the auction house believes that such an impressive antique jewel could only have been created for a royal family.",
      "Sotheby's said it was likely that some of the diamonds featured in the piece came from the famous necklace from the scandal that engulfed Marie Antoinette.",
      "That scandal involved a hard-up noblewoman named Jeanne de la Motte who pretended to be a confidante of the queen, and managed to acquire a lavish diamond-studded necklace in her name, against a promise of a later payment.",
      "On Oct. 16, 1793,\u00a0Marie Antoinette was guillotined\u00a0\u2014 but it turned she was actually innocent of the necklace fraud that she was accused of.",
      "While the queen was later found to be blameless in the affair, the scandal still deepened the perception of her careless extravagance, adding to the anger that would unleash the revolution.",
      "Sotheby's said the diamonds in the necklace sold Wednesday were likely sourced from \"the legendary Golconda mines in India\" \u2014 considered to produce the purest and most dazzling diamonds.",
      "\"The fortunate buyer has walked away with a spectacular piece of history,\" Tobias Kormind, head of Europe's largest online diamond jeweler 77 Diamonds, said in a statement.",
      "\"With exceptional quality diamonds from the legendary, now extinct Indian Golconda mines, the history of a possible link to Marie Antoinette along with the fact that it was worn to two coronations, all make this 18th Century necklace truly special.\"",

The \"Queen Marie Antoinette's Pearl,\" a diamond-and-pearl pendant, was among the highlight offerings on the block at the Sotheby's sale of jewelry from the Bourbon-Parma dynasty in Geneva.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing Thursday a major discovery \"pulsing with life and color.\" The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they'd stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.",
      "\"Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" marine ecologist Enric Sala said.",
      "The standalone structure, formed from a \"complex network\" of tiny coral polyps, has likely been growing for 300 years or more, the researchers said.",
      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa. The massive coral is not a coral reef, structures that can be far larger but are comprised of many distinct coral colonies, they explained.",

      "The pair became embroiled in an extraordinary war of words during Trump's first presidency, initially sparked by Khan speaking out against a U.S. travel ban on people from certain Muslim countries.",

Calvi, 23, was a member of the 17th Pursuit Squadron, 24th Pursuit Group when Japanese forces invaded the Philippines in December 1941, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency\u00a0said in a news release. Intense fighting ensued and continued until the surrender of Bataan peninsula and Corregidor Island in spring 1942.",
      "During that period, thousands of American and Filipino service members were captured and held at prisoner of war camps, the DPAA said. Calvi was among those reported captured when forces in Bataan surrendered. He, and thousands of others, were subjected to the 65-mile Bataan Death March and then held at a prisoner of war camp where 2,500 prisoners died during the course of the war.",
      "Calvi died on July 16, 1942, according to prison and historical records, just months after the surrender of the peninsula. He was buried in a mass grave, known as Common Grave 316.",
      "That grave and others at the camp were exhumed by the American Graves Registration Service after World War II ended. The remains from the graves were brought to a temporary U.S. military mausoleum that had been constructed in Manila, the Philippines' capital city.",
      "In 1947, the service attempted to identify the remains. Eleven sets of remains from Common Grave 316 were identified, and the remaining 17 were declared unidentifiable. Those unidentified remains were buried at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial as Unknowns. Calvi's name, along with the names of other soldiers declared dead, was carved onto the Walls of the Missing at the cemetery.",

Scientists used multiple techniques, including dental and anthropological analysis, mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA analysis, and historical evidence. On Sept. 16, they identified the set of remains as Calvi's.",
      "Before Calvi enlisted in the military, he had been a notable athlete, playing varsity baseball and football at his Massachusetts high school, according to archival news clippings shared by the DPAA. Before he was taken prisoner, Calvi was wounded at least once in action, but returned to active duty after recovering in a hospital in the Philippines. He was survived by his parents, two brothers, several aunts and uncles, and one nephew.",
      "Calvi will be buried in his hometown of North Adams, Massachusetts on Dec. 9, 2024. A rosette will be placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing to indicate that he has been accounted for.",

On January 21, he was kidnapped by multiple heavily armed men and transported him to a secluded area, where he was held captive along with two fishermen from the Seychelles. Moore was moved several times over the course of three months, then transported to a hijacked boat, the F/V Naham III. Moore and one of the fishermen were held captive there, along with 28 crew members, for several more months, according to the Department of Justice. The fisherman was tortured, and the crew members told Moore that the pirates had killed the ship's captain when they hijacked the vessel, prosecutors said.",
      "Moore remained a hostage for another two years, continuously shuffled between safehouses, kept under armed guard and chained at night to prevent escape, prosecutors said. He was repeatedly threatened, according to the Department of Justice, and forced to make proof-of-life videos requesting large ransom payments. In 2014, negotiators paid a ransom of $1.6 million to secure Moore's release. Moore has said his family funded the ransom payment, and published a book about his experience in 2018.",

That meant he was in charge of police and security forces, but he also \"served as an overall leader of the pirates,\" according to the Department of Justice. He \"headed their efforts to extort a massive ransom from Moore's aging mother,\" the department said, and directed the production of the proof-of-life videos and participated in ransom negotiations. He also used his home as a base of operations for the pirates, the Department of Justice said. He was arrested in Minneapolis in 2019.",

He also provided and repaired weapons used to keep Moore in captivity. Tahlil was jailed in New York City in 2018.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 06:59:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Germ\u00e1n Reyes was arrested on charges of homicide for the killing of Alejandro Arcos just a week after he took office as mayor, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "A former prosecutor and local police official was arrested Tuesday in connection with the grisly decapitation of a mayor on Oct. 6.",
      "Officials in the southern state of Guerrero confirmed that Germ\u00e1n Reyes was arrested on charges of homicide for the killing of Alejandro Arcos just a week after he took office as mayor of the state capital, Chilpancingo.\u00a0 The public prosecutor's office in Guerrero released a photo of the suspect, identifying him as German \"N\" in line with the usual practice of not giving full names.",
      "The arrest was shocking, because officials had previously blamed the killing on a local drug and extortion gang, and Reyes was formerly employed as special prosecutor for Guerrero state, a high-level position.",
      "The implication was that Reyes - who was also a former military officer who, according to his official resume, retired with rank of captain in the military justice system - had somehow worked in collusion with the gang.",
      "That would suggest that at least one of the two warring gangs fighting for control of Chilpancingo controls, intimidates or works with officials there.",
      "If Reyes is convicted, it would also be a stinging rebuke for a policy adopted by cities across Mexico of hiring retired military officers for top local police jobs, on the assumption that they are less prone to corruption.",
      "It was also revealing that state detectives had to rely on federal forces - soldiers and the National Guard - to make the arrest, suggesting they may not have trusted state and local police who would normally carry out such tasks.",
      "It was not clear what title Reyes held in the Chilpancingo municipal security force, or whether he served both under Arcos or the replacement mayor who took office after he was killed. Four mayors from other towns in Mexico requested protection\u00a0a day after Arcos' remains were found.",
      "Mexico's top federal security official, Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch, said earlier Tuesday that Arcos -the mayor whose body was found in a pickup truck, with his severed head placed on the roof of the vehicle - was apparently killed by the same gang responsible for killing 11 market vendors, including four boys, last week.",
      "The vendors, members of an extended family, were abducted in late October as they traveled to sell their wares. Their bodies were found dumped in the bed of a pickup truck on an avenue in Chilpancingo last week.",
      "While neither Harfuch nor state prosecutors would name the gang, a local human rights activist said the Ardillos were responsible for killing the market vendors.",
      "The activist, who did not want to be quoted for fear of reprisals, said the Ardillos gang controlled large parts of the state and had state congressmen and other officials working for them.",
      "The Ardillos have been locked in a years-long battle for control of Chilpancingo with a rival gang, the Tlacos. That turf battle has left mutilated corpses strewn around the city in recent years.",
      "Mexican cartels frequently dump bodies of their hostages \u2014 or post grisly videos of torture, interrogation and decapitations of their victims \u2014 to\u00a0intimidate their rivals\u00a0and authorities. Messages are\u00a0often left on victims' bodies\u00a0by cartels seeking to threaten their rivals or punish behavior they claim violates their rules.",
      "Chilpancingo, a city of about 300,000, is so completely dominated by gangs that in 2023, one of them staged a demonstration of hundreds of people, hijacked a government armored car, blocked a major highway and took police hostage to win the release of arrested suspects.",
      "Violence in Guerrero reached such unprecedented levels that earlier this year, Roman Catholic bishops announced they had helped arrange a truce in another part of the state between two warring drug cartels.",
      "At the time, former president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador- who refused to confront the gangs - said he approved of such talks.",
      "\"Priests and pastors and members of all the churches have participated, helped in pacifying the country. I think it is very good,\" said L\u00f3pez Obrador, who left office Sept. 30.",

    "summary": "The U.S. says there will be a \"firm response\" as Ukrainian forces holding ground in Russia's Kursk region now face North Korean troops \"engaging in combat.\"",
    "story": [
      "Kyiv, Ukraine\u00a0\u2014 Russia attacked the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Wednesday with a sophisticated combination of missiles and drones for the first time in 73 days, authorities reported, as the Pentagon said most of the North Korean troops sent to help Moscow's war effort were fighting to drive Ukraine's army off Russian soil in the Kursk border region. South Korea's spy agency also said North Korean troops were \"engaging in combat\" in the Kursk region, hours after the U.S. military shared its assessment of the growing Russian-North Korean cooperation.",
      "Air raid warnings blared for hours as Russia targeted eight regions of Ukraine, firing six ballistic and cruise missiles and 90 drones, the Ukrainian air force said. Air defenses downed four missiles and 37 drones, and another 47 drones were stopped by electronic jamming, the statement said.",
      "The damage was being assessed.",
      "The air assault came as most of the more than 10,000 North Korean troops sent by Pyongyang to help Moscow in the war were engaged in fighting in Kursk, where a Ukrainian army incursion three months ago has succeeded in holding a broad area of land, embarrassing the Kremlin.",
      "Russia's military has trained the North Korean soldiers in artillery, drone skills and basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, Pentagon deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel told a briefing Tuesday. The cooperation faces challenges, according to the Pentagon, including how to achieve military interoperability and overcoming the language barrier.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said previously that the\u00a0deployment of North Korean troops to Russia\u00a0was a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin's \"growing desperation\" as the full-scale war he launched against Ukraine nears the end of its third year, but he also said it marked \"a significant escalation\" in North Korea's involvement in the conflict, and \"a dangerous expansion of Russia's war.\"",
      "Officials in Kyiv have said Russia deployed around 50,000 troops to Kursk in a bid to dislodge the Ukrainians.",
      "Russia has in recent months been assembling forces for a counteroffensive in Kursk, according to the Institute for the Study of War think tank, though the timescale of the operation is not known.",
      "Russia's plans in Kursk and Ukraine's efforts to hold back a Russian onslaught in the eastern Donetsk region coincide with political uncertainty over how the incoming U.S. administration of President-elect Donald Trump will change Washington's policy on the war. U.S. military aid is vital for Ukraine, but Trump has signaled he doesn't want to keep giving tens of billions of dollars to Kyiv.",
      "President Biden intends to bolster U.S. military support to Ukraine in the final months of his administration, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday.",
      "The U.S. will \"continue to shore up everything we're doing for Ukraine to make sure that it can effectively defend itself against this Russian aggression,\" Blinken told reporters at NATO headquarters, before planned meetings with allied envoys and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Blinken warned that North Korea's decision to send its troops into combat operations alongside Russian forces \"demands and will get a firm response.\" He didn't elaborate.",

    "published": "Wed, 13 Nov 2024 06:31:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The babies - one born on Feb. 14 and the other on Feb. 15, 1965 - are now 59-year-old women and they are filing a lawsuit.",
    "story": [
      "In 1965, a Norwegian woman gave birth to a baby girl in a private hospital. Seven days later she returned home with a baby.",
      "When the baby developed dark curls that made her look different from herself, Karen Rafteseth Dokken assumed she just took after her husband's mother.",
      "It took nearly six decades to discover the true reason: Rafteseth Dokken's biological daughter had been mistakenly switched at birth in the maternity ward of the hospital in central Norway.",
      "The girl she ended up raising, Mona, was not the baby she gave birth to.",
      "The babies \u2014 one born on Feb. 14 and the other on Feb. 15, 1965 \u2014 are now 59-year-old women who together with Rafteseth Dokken are suing the state and the municipality.",
      "In their case, which opened in the Oslo District Court on Monday, they argue that their human rights were violated when authorities discovered the error when the girls were teenagers and covered it up. They claim Norwegian authorities had undermined their right to a family life, a principle enshrined in the European human rights convention, and demand an apology and compensation.",
      "Rafteseth Dokken, now 78, was in tears as she described learning so many years later that she got the wrong baby, according to Norwegian broadcaster NRK.",
      "\"It was never my thought that Mona was not my daughter,\" she said in court on Tuesday. \"She was named Mona after my mother.\"",
      "Mona described a sense of never belonging as she grew up. That sense of uncertainty pushed her in 2021 to do a DNA test, which showed that she was not the biological daughter of those who raised her.",
      "But the woman who raised the other baby knew long before.",
      "A routine blood test in 1981 revealed that the girl she was raising, Linda Karin Risvik Gotaas, was not biologically related. The woman raising her, however, did not pursue a maternity case. Norwegian health authorities were informed of the mix-up in 1985, but refrained from telling the others involved.",
      "Both women who were swapped at birth have said in interviews that it was a shock to learn about the mix-up, but the knowledge made pieces of their lives fall into place, explaining differences both in terms of appearance and demeanor.",
      "Kristine Aarre Haanes, representing Mona, said the state \"violated her right to her own identity for all these years. They kept it secret.\"",
      "Mona could have learned the truth when she was a young adult, but instead \"she did not find out the truth until she was 57.\"",
      "\"Her biological father has died. She has no contact with her biological mother,\" added Aarre Haanes.",
      "Circumstances surrounding the 1965 swap at Eggesboenes hospital are unclear, but media reports by NRK suggest there were several cases during the 1950s and 1960s where children were accidentally swapped at the same institution. At the time babies were kept together while their mothers rested in separate rooms.",
      "In other cases the errors were spotted before the children were permanently placed with the wrong families, according to the reports.",
      "An official from the Norwegian Ministry of Heath and Care Services said the state was unaware of similar cases and that there were no plans for a public inquiry.",
      "Asgeir Nygaard, representing the Norwegian state, is fighting the case on the grounds that the 1965 switch took place in a private institution and that the health directorate in the 1980s did not have the legal authority to inform the other families when they discovered the error.",
      "\"Documentation from that time indicates that government officials found the assessments difficult, inter alia because it was legally unclear what they could do,\" he wrote in a statement to The Associated Press ahead of the trial's opening. \"Therefore, in court, we will argue that there is no basis for compensation and that the claims being made are in any case statute-barred.\"",
      "The trial is scheduled to run through Thursday, but it was not clear when a ruling is expected.",
      "A similar situation reportedly occurred in the U.S. in 1969, when two baby girls were accidentally switched at a Texas hospital, and the mistake wasn't noticed until a DNA test was done in 2018. The women later filed a lawsuit against the corporation that later bought the hospital.",
      "According to the DNA Diagnostics Center, in the U.S., up to 500,000 babies each year are at \"potential risk of going home with the wrong parent,\" but newborns inadvertently switched at birth are generally noticed almost immediately after the incident. The center says only eight incidents of babies switched at birth were physically documented in the U.S. between 1995 and 2008, although the center says that number is likely higher.",

    "story": [
      "Port-au-Prince, Haiti\u00a0\u2014 The Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying to Haiti for 30 days after gangs shot three planes and the United Nations also Tuesday temporarily suspended flights to Port-au-Prince, limiting humanitarian aid coming into the country. Bullets hit a Spirit Airlines plane when it was about to land in the capital Monday, injuring a flight attendant and forcing the airport to shut down. Photos and videos obtained by The Associated Press show bullet holes dotting the interior of a plane.",
      "On Tuesday, JetBlue and American Airlines announced that post-flight inspections found their planes also had been shot Monday while departing Port-au-Prince. American suspended flights to the capital until Feb. 12.",
      "The shootings were part of a wave of violence that erupted as the country plagued by gang violence swore in its new prime minister after a politically tumultuous process. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the agency documented 20 armed clashes and more roadblocks affecting humanitarian operation during the violence Monday.",
      "The Port-au-Prince airport will remain closed until Nov. 18, and Dujarric said the U.N. will divert flights to the country's second airport in the northern, more peaceful, city of Cap Ha\u00eftien.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said in a security alert Monday that it was aware of \"gang-led efforts\" to block travel to and from the capital that may include \"armed violence, and disruptions to roads, ports, and airports.\"",
      "\"The security situation in Haiti is unpredictable and dangerous,\" the embassy warned. \"Travel within Haiti is conducted at your own risk. The U.S. government cannot guarantee your safety traveling to airports, borders, or during any onward travel. You should consider your personal security situation before traveling anywhere in Haiti.\"",
      "Even more limited access to the epicenter of the violence, Port-au-Prince, is likely to be devastating as\u00a0gangs choking the life out of the capital have pushed Haiti to the brink of famine. Dujarric warned that cutting off flights would mean \"limiting the flow of humanitarian aid and humanitarian personnel into the country.\"",
      "Already, a convoy of 20 trucks filled with food and medical supplies in the south had been postponed and an operation providing cash assistance to a thousand people in the Carrefour area where violence broke out had to be canceled.",
      "\"We are doing all we can to ensure the continuation of operations amidst this challenging environment,\" he said. \"We call for an end to the escalating violence, to allow for safe, sustained and unimpeded humanitarian access.\"",
      "On Tuesday, life in much of Haiti's capital was frozen after the wave of violence. Heavily armed police in armored cars outside the airport checked trucks used for public transportation passing by.",
      "Schools were closed, as were banks and government offices. Streets, where just a day before gangs and police were locked in a fierce firefight, were eerily empty, with few driving by other than a motorcycle with a man who had been shot clinging to the back.",
      "The sounds of heavy gunfire still echoed through the streets in the afternoon \u2014 a reminder that despite political maneuvering by Haiti's elites and a strong push by the international community to restore peace, the country's toxic slate of gangs kept its firm hold on much of the Caribbean nation.",
      "The United Nations estimates that gangs control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. A U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police to quell gang violence struggles with a lack of funding and personnel, prompting calls for a U.N. peacekeeping mission.",
      "President Luis Abinader in the Dominican Republic, which shares a border with Haiti, was the first leader on the island to condemn the violence, describing the shooting a \"terrorist act\".",
      "On Tuesday, a transitional council established in April to restore democratic order to Haiti also condemned the violence.",
      "\"This cowardly crime, which threatens Haiti's sovereignty and security, aims to isolate our country on the international stage. The perpetrators of these heinous acts will be hunted down and brought to justice,\" the council wrote in a statement.",
      "The council has taken sharp criticism from many in Haiti who contend that its political fights and corruption allegations against three members created the political instability, allowing gangs to make violent power grabs like the one seen Monday.",
      "That came to a head over the weekend, when it fired former interim Prime Minister Garry Conille - long at odds with the council. They replaced him with businessman Alix Didier Fils-Aim\u00e9, who was inaugurated Monday surrounded by suit-clad officials and diplomats while gangs terrorized the capital around them.",
      "Neither Fils-Aim\u00e9 or Conille have commented on the wave of violence.",
      "Conille originally called the council's move illegal, but on Tuesday acknowledged Fils-Aim\u00e9's appointment in a post on the social media platform X.",
      "\"(I) wish him success in fulfilling this mission. At this crucial moment, unity and solidarity are essential for our country. Long live Haiti!\" he wrote. Fils-Aim\u00e9 promised to work with international partners to restore peace and hold long awaited elections, a vow also made by his predecessor.",
      "But many Haitians, like 43-year-old Martha Jean-Pierre, have little taste for the political fighting, which experts say only gives gangs more freedom to continue expanding their control.",
      "Jean-Pierre was among those to brave the streets of Port-au-Prince on Tuesday to sell the plantains, carrots, cabbage and potatoes she carried in a basket on her head. She had no choice, she said - selling was the only way she could feed her children.",
      "\"What good is a new prime minister if there's no security, if I can't move freely and sell my goods?\" she said, nodding to her basket of vegetables. \"This is my bank account. This is what my family depend on.\"",
      "It was a frustration that concerned international players like the U.N. and the U.S. that have pushed for a peaceful resolution in Haiti.",
      "On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department lamented that Conille and the council \"were unable to move forward in a constructive manner\" and called on Fils-Aim\u00e9 and the council to provide a clear action plan outlining a joint vision on how to decrease violence and pave the path for elections to be held to \"prevent further gridlock.\"",

However, Trump dominated the Electoral College and won the popular vote. The voters, which is a synonym for 'fans' in this case, spoke loud and clear. Partisan celebs might have lost the election, but they cannot afford to isolate and lose their fans as well.\"",

      "1. Email validation: By opening the email or engaging with the email (clicking a link or responding to it), you can validate that the email account they messaged is active. Oftentimes, scammers randomly email people whose email address they've gotten from data breaches, the dark web or data harvesting.",
      "2. Information gathering: If you reply to the email or use any other contact information they provide to \"reinstate\" your account, it will validate that the email address they reached out to is active, and they will likely hard-sell you for financial and personal information. If you call any phone number they provide you, they will also connect your phone number with your email address so they can continue to update their information on you.",
      "3. Malware distribution: They will often have buttons, links or attachments included in the email. If you click the attachment, it can download malware or a virus to your device. If you click on a link that's provided in the email, it might take you to a website that will collect your personal and financial information or download malware or viruses to your device.",

    "story": [
      "Scammers often ask for answers to secret questions for crucial information needed to access accounts.",
      "Phishing emails are one of the most common tricks scammers use, but they\u2019re usually easy to catch if you pay attention. Awkward grammar, random details and, most importantly, an unofficial email address are dead giveaways. For example, you might get an email saying your Apple ID\u2019s been disabled, but the sender\u2019s email won\u2019t actually be from Apple. Now, though, scammers are finding ways to get around this.",
      "According to the FBI, there\u2019s been a recent rise in cybercriminal services using hacked police and government email accounts to send fake subpoenas and data requests to U.S.-based tech companies.",

      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "The\u00a0FBI has seen a spike in criminal forum posts about emergency data requests and stolen email credentials from police departments and government agencies. Cybercriminals are getting into compromised U.S. and foreign government email accounts and using them to send fake emergency data requests to U.S.-based companies, which exposes customer data for further misuse in other crimes.",
      "In August 2024, a popular cybercriminal on an online forum advertised \"high-quality .gov emails\" for sale, meant for espionage, social engineering, data extortion, emergency data requests and more. The listing even included U.S. credentials, and the seller claimed they could guide buyers on making emergency data requests and even sell real stolen subpoena documents to help them pose as law enforcement.",
      "Another cybercriminal boasted about owning government emails from over 25 countries. They claimed anyone can use these emails to send a subpoena to a tech company and get access to usernames, emails, phone numbers and other personal client info. Some con artists are even hosting a \"masterclass\" on how to create and submit their own emergency data requests to pull data on any social media account, charging $100 for the full rundown.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "How this phishing scam works",
      "When law enforcement, whether federal, state or local, wants information about someone\u2019s account at a tech company, like their email address or other account details, they typically need a warrant, subpoena or court order. When a tech company receives one of these requests from an official email address, they\u2019re required to comply. So, if a scammer gets access to a government email, they can fake a subpoena and get information on just about anyone.",
      "To bypass verification, scammers often send emergency data requests, claiming that someone\u2019s life is at risk and that the data is needed urgently. Because companies don\u2019t want to delay in case of an actual emergency, they may hand over the information, even if the request turns out to be fake. By portraying it as a life-or-death situation, scammers make it harder for companies to take time to verify the request.",
      "For example, the FBI reported that earlier this year, a known cybercriminal posted pictures on an online forum of a fake emergency data request they\u2019d sent to PayPal. The scammer tried to make it look legitimate by using a fraudulent mutual legal assistance treaty, claiming it was part of a local investigation into child trafficking, complete with a case number and legal code for verification. However, PayPal recognized that it wasn\u2019t a real law enforcement request and denied it.",

      "CYBERSCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "What can companies do to avoid falling for these phishing scams?",
      "1) Verify all data requests: Before sharing sensitive information, companies should verify every data request, even those that look legitimate. Establish a protocol for confirming requests directly with the agency or organization that supposedly sent them.",
      "2) Strengthen email security:\u00a0Use email authentication protocols like DMARC, SPF and DKIM to block emails from unauthorized sources. Implement anti-phishing filters to detect suspicious content in messages.",
      "3) Train employees on phishing awareness: Regular training sessions on phishing scams can help employees recognize red flags, such as urgent language, unusual requests or emails from unknown addresses. Employees should be encouraged to report suspicious emails.",
      "4) Limit access to sensitive data: Restrict who can view or share sensitive customer data. Fewer people with access means fewer chances for accidental or intentional data leaks.",
      "5) Implement emergency verification procedures: Have a clear verification process in place for \"emergency\" data requests, including steps for double-checking with higher management or legal teams before responding to any urgent request for customer information.",
      "Illustration of a scammer at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Is there something you need to do?",
      "This particular phishing scam mostly targets big tech companies, so there\u2019s not much you can do directly. However, it\u2019s a reminder that you shouldn\u2019t automatically trust an email, even if it comes from a .gov address. Here are some steps you can take to stay safe.",
      "1) Double-check email addresses and links: Even if an email looks official, take a moment to check the sender\u2019s email address and hover over any links to see where they actually lead. Be cautious if anything looks off. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Use\u00a02FA for all sensitive accounts. This extra layer of security helps protect you even if your login credentials are compromised.",
      "3) Stay updated on phishing scams:\u00a0Keep an eye on the latest phishing tactics, so you know what to look out for. Regular updates help you spot new types of scams before they affect you.",
      "4) Verify suspicious requests:\u00a0If you get an unexpected email asking for sensitive info, contact the sender directly through an official channel to confirm the request.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers are taking phishing emails to a whole new level. I often recommend checking the email carefully when you receive anything suspicious to see if it\u2019s legit. But now, since scammers can even access government emails, you need to be extra cautious. This phishing scam seems to target mostly big tech companies, so it\u2019s on them to strengthen their security and verify every request thoroughly before sharing any user information. It's also up to governments worldwide to protect their digital assets from being compromised.",

That\u2019s a $63 million jump from 2022, showing that the military community is a big target for scammers. The number of military members who lost money to these attacks went up by 7% to 30,948, per the FTC\u2019s latest data.",

      "Romance scams have become an increasingly painful reality for veterans, as scammers target them through fake online relationships to exploit their emotions and financial stability. Often, these scammers pose as attractive, understanding individuals on dating apps, social media platforms or even support forums specifically tailored for veterans. They\u2019ll build a relationship over weeks or months, using flattery and fabricated stories to create a strong emotional connection with their target.",
      "Once the scammer believes they\u2019ve gained enough trust, they\u2019ll ask for money, typically by inventing a sudden, urgent situation. It might be a \"medical emergency,\" a supposed travel expense to come to visit or even a claim that they need help with a legal matter. The requests start small but can quickly escalate as the scammer continues to manipulate the victim's emotions.",
      "This continues to be the most common fraud targeting veterans, costing them and their families over $40 million in 2020, according to Aura. Among all romance scam victims, those ages 50-69 were hit the hardest, losing $179.65 million in just the first three quarters of 2022. That figure has almost certainly surged in 2024.",

In these scams, fraudsters often post fake listings for apartments or houses on popular rental websites or social media platforms. The listing might look too good to be true, like a beautiful place at an unbelievably low price.",
      "The scammer will usually claim to be out of town or unavailable to meet in person, asking potential renters to send a deposit or rent payment upfront to \"secure\" the property. In some cases, they may even send fake lease agreements or claim that the property is already rented, but they can still \"help\" find a similar place.",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "Car sales and financing scams",
      "Car sales and financing scams targeting veterans are unfortunately common. Scammers know that veterans may have limited experience with certain financial deals, so they exploit that by offering unrealistic car sales or financing options. These scams can take various forms, and the result is often financial loss and stress.",

      "6 ways veterans can protect themselves from scams",
      "1) Be cautious with unsolicited offers: Whether it\u2019s a phone call, email or text, if someone claims to offer help with veterans' benefits or promises something too good to be true, don\u2019t take the bait. Verify the legitimacy of any offer directly through official channels like the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or trusted veteran organizations.",
      "2) Watch out for emotional manipulation in online relationships: Romance scammers often prey on veterans' emotions. Avoid sharing personal or financial details with people you meet online, especially if the relationship feels rushed or too perfect. If someone asks for money after just a few weeks or months, it\u2019s likely a scam.",
      "3) Verify government communications: Scammers often impersonate government agencies like the IRS or VA. If you get a message that threatens penalties or asks for personal information, don\u2019t respond. Instead, contact the agency directly using official contact details to confirm whether the message is legitimate.",
      "4) Be skeptical of rental or car sale deals that seem too good to be true: If a rental listing or car sale seems too cheap or perfect to be true, it probably is. Always visit the property or dealership in person, and never send money upfront without seeing the product or having a signed agreement.",
      "5) Protect your personal information: Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Scammers use phishing emails and fake websites to steal personal and financial information. Ensure your devices have updated security software and be extra cautious when handling sensitive data online.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6)\u00a0Invest in data removal services: Consider using data removal services to protect your personal information from being harvested by scammers. These services can help remove your data from public databases and people-search websites, reducing the risk of identity theft and unwanted solicitations.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers rely on misinformation to trick you. However, by staying informed and being extra careful when navigating the internet, you can stay safe. These bad actors are constantly finding new ways to target veterans, from romance scams to fake government offers. Being cautious, verifying offers and keeping your data secure are the best ways to avoid falling victim to these heartless fraudsters.",

      "A woman using a VPN on a tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. By routing your internet traffic through a secure server, VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for hackers and malicious entities to track your online behavior.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CAN YOU BYPASS VPN BLOCKS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY?",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms \u2014 IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from its server network, effectively preventing websites and cybercriminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",

      "Identity theft occurs when someone illegally obtains your personal information to commit fraud. This can lead to unauthorized transactions and damage to your credit status. So, how can a VPN prevent identity theft? By encrypting your internet connection, VPNs protect against data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information, especially on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi.

      "Online transactions are vulnerable to interception by cybercriminals looking to steal financial information such as credit card numbers and banking credentials. A VPN can be used as a shield for financial data. VPNs ensure that all data exchanged during online transactions is encrypted, making it nearly impossible for hackers to access sensitive financial information. When using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often targeted by cybercriminals, a VPN provides an additional layer of security by encrypting all data transmissions.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 10:00:11 -0500",
    "summary": "OpenAI recently introduced a new memory feature for ChatGPT that enables it to remember information about people, including age, gender and beliefs.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses OpenAI ending its safety task force, actress Scarlett Johansson claiming the company copied her voice and the growing popularity of the voice notes phone feature.",
      "ChatGPT is an amazing tool, and its developer, OpenAI, keeps adding new features from time to time.",
      "Recently, the company introduced a new memory feature in ChatGPT, which essentially enables it to remember things about you. For example, it can recall your age, gender, philosophical beliefs and pretty much anything else.",
      "These memories are meant to remain private, but a researcher recently demonstrated how ChatGPT's artificial intelligence memory features can be manipulated, raising questions about privacy and security.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "ChatGPT introduction screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ChatGPT's Memory feature?",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s memory feature is designed to make the chatbot more personal to you. It remembers information that might be useful for future conversations and tailors responses based on that information, even if you open a different chat. For example, if you mention that you\u2019re vegetarian, the next time you ask for recipes, it will provide only vegetarian options.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "You can also train it to remember specific details about you, such as saying, \"Remember that I like to watch classic movies.\" In future interactions, it will tailor recommendations accordingly. You have control over ChatGPT\u2019s memory. You can reset it, clear specific memories or all memories, or turn this feature off entirely in your settings.",

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The security vulnerability in ChatGPT",
      "As reported by\u00a0Arstechnica, security researcher Johann Rehberger found that it\u2019s possible to trick the AI into remembering false information through a method called indirect prompt injection. This means the AI can be manipulated into accepting instructions from unreliable sources like emails or blog posts.",
      "For instance, Rehberger demonstrated that he could trick ChatGPT into believing a certain user was 102 years old, lived in a fictional place called the Matrix and thought the Earth was flat. After the AI accepts this made-up information, it will carry it over to all future chats with that user. These false memories could be implanted by using tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store files, upload images or even browse a site like Bing \u2014 all of which could be manipulated by a hacker.",
      "Rehberger submitted a follow-up report that included a proof of concept, demonstrating how he could exploit the flaw in the ChatGPT app for macOS. He showed that by tricking the AI into opening a web link containing a malicious image, he could make it send everything a user typed and all the AI's responses to a server he controlled. This meant that if an attacker could manipulate the AI in this way, they could monitor all conversations between the user and ChatGPT.",
      "Rehberger's proof-of-concept exploit demonstrated that the vulnerability could be used to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. The attack isn't possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. However, it was still possible through the ChatGPT app for macOS.",
      "When Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May, the company took it seriously and mitigated this issue by ensuring that the model doesn\u2019t follow any links generated within its own responses, like those involving memory and similar features.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Johann\u00a0Rehberger\u2019s ChatGPT conversation. (Johann Rehberger)",
      "CYBER SCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "OpenAI\u2019s response",
      "After Rehberger shared his proof of concept, OpenAI engineers took action and released a patch to address this vulnerability. They released a new version of the ChatGPT macOS application (version 1.2024.247) that encrypts conversations and fixes the security flaw.",
      "So, while OpenAI has taken steps to address the immediate security flaw, there are still potential vulnerabilities related to memory manipulation and the need for ongoing vigilance in using AI tools with memory features. The incident underscores the evolving nature of security challenges in AI systems.",
      "The company says, \"It\u2019s important to note that prompt injection in large language models is an area of ongoing research. As new techniques emerge, we address them at the model layer via instruction hierarchy or application-layer defenses like the ones mentioned.\"",
      "How do I disable ChatGPT memory?",
      "If you're not cool with ChatGPT keeping stuff about you or the chance that it could let a bad actor access your data, you can just turn off this feature in the settings.",
      "Open the\u00a0ChatGPT app or website\u00a0on your computer or smartphone.Click on the\u00a0profile icon in the top right corner of the screen.Go to Settings and then select Personalization.Switch the Memory option off, and you\u2019re all set.",

      "As AI technologies like ChatGPT become more prevalent, it's crucial to adhere to cybersecurity best practices to protect your personal information. Here are some tips for enhancing your cybersecurity:",
      "1. Regularly review privacy settings:\u00a0Stay informed about what data is being collected. Periodically check and adjust privacy settings on AI platforms like ChatGPT and others to ensure you\u2019re only sharing information you\u2019re comfortable with.",
      "2. Be cautious about sharing sensitive information:\u00a0Less is more when it comes to personal data. Avoid disclosing sensitive details such as your full name, address, or financial information in conversations with AI.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid reusing them across different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your ChatGPT and other AI accounts.\u00a0By requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "5. Keep software and applications up to date:\u00a0Stay ahead of vulnerabilities.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered threats, so enable automatic updates whenever possible.",
      "6. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0 In an age where AI is everywhere, protecting your data from cyber threats is more important than ever. Adding strong antivirus software to your devices adds a critical layer of protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "7. Regularly monitor your accounts:\u00a0Catch issues early. Frequently check bank statements and online accounts for any unusual activity, which can help you identify potential\u00a0breaches quickly.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "As AI tools like ChatGPT get smarter and more personal, it's pretty interesting to think about how they can tailor conversations to us. But, as Johann Rehberger\u2019s findings remind us, there are some real risks involved, especially when it comes to privacy and security. While OpenAI is able to mitigate these issues as they arise, it also shows that we need to keep a close eye on how these features work. It's all about finding that sweet spot between innovation and keeping our data safe.",

      "DPS said it was first made aware on Sunday night that \"hundreds\" of posters depicting members of the university community as \"wanted\" were posted around campus and \"immediately began working to remove the posters and return the spaces to their usual state.\" The department said the removal process \"is painstaking because of the strong adhesive used to affix the posters, which in some cases caused damage to walls, floors, chalkboards, and other surfaces.\"",

However, Newell said, he was at the security office when the arrest took place.",

      "After the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel and the subsequent wars against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran-backed groups have not only levied increasing fire at Washington\u2019s top ally in the Middle East, but also its troops in Iraq and Syria as well as U.S. naval vessels targeted by Houthi terrorists in Yemen.",

      "As Israel continued to ramp up its offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon and prepare for its promised retaliatory attack against Tehran in late October, Iran-backed groups in turn increased their attacks against U.S. troops in neighboring nations.",
      "\"As it has done in the past, Iran could also further escalate its proxies\u2019 attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria to try to convince Washington to exert pressure on Israel so that it stops degrading these terrorist groups,\" Cicurel told Fox News Digital.",
      "Militia groups in Syria more than doubled the number of attacks levied at U.S. personnel in 15 separate incidents compared to the seven attacks Iran-backed groups carried out in September. Though the figure is still just half the number of attacks levied in January when some 34 strikes targeted U.S. personnel in Syria along with 19 in Iraq.",
      "Cicurel clarified for Fox News Digital that these strikes are by organizations like the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, which is an \"umbrella mechanism for Iran\u2019s proxies\" and includes terrorist groups likes Kataib Hezbollah, Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Ansar Allah al-Awfiya and Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, to claim attacks against Israel and U.S. forces.\"",

      "But according to the JINSA report, prior to the October 2023 attacks by Hamas, Iran-sanctioned militant groups opted to target U.S. troops over Israeli positions because \"Iranian-linked groups determined that the U.S. responses would be less forceful than Israel\u2019s.\"",
      "That strategy halted after the Hamas attack on Israel, and in October this year alone Iran-backed groups launched more than 110 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), missiles and rockets at Israel from Iraq.",
      "\"Leveraging its Iraqi proxies to fire at Israel was likely a means for Iran to increase fire against the Jewish state without triggering the retaliation on Iranian territory that its direct attacks have incurred,\" Cicurel said.",

      "Israel also saw at least 111 UAVs, missiles and rockets thrown at it from Iran-backed groups in Iraq last month, which is more than 2.5 times the number of attacks from Iraq than in September and likely a strong motivator for the strike that Israel carried out in Iraq and Syria during its retaliatory strike against Tehran late last month.",

      "The reactor, which procurement documents indicate will soon be operational, is housed in a new facility built at the site known as Base 909, which houses six other reactors that are operational, decommissioned or under construction, according to the analysis. The site is under the control of the Nuclear Power Institute of China, a subsidiary of the China National Nuclear Corporation, which is tasked with reactor engineering research and testing.",
      "Documents indicating that China\u2019s 701 Institute, formally known as China Ship Research and Design Center, which is responsible for aircraft carrier development, procured reactor equipment \"intended for installation on a large surface warship\" under the Nuclear Power Development Project as well as the project\u2019s \"national defense designation\" helped lead to the conclusion the sizable reactor is a prototype for a next-generation aircraft carrier.",
      "Satellite mages from 2020 to 2023 have shown the demolition of homes and the construction of water intake infrastructure connected to the reactor site. Contracts for steam generators and turbine pumps indicate the project involves a pressurized water reactor with a secondary circuit \u2014 a profile that is consistent with naval propulsion reactors, the researchers say.",
      "An environmental impact report calls the Longwei Project a \"national defense-related construction project\" that is classified \"secret.\"",
      "\"Unless China is developing nuclear-powered cruisers, which were pursued only by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War, then the Nuclear Power Development Project most certainly refers to a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier development effort,\" researchers wrote in a detailed 19-page report on their findings shared exclusively with the AP.",
      "Jamie Withorne, an analyst at the Oslo Nuclear Project who was not involved in the research and reviewed the findings, said Middlebury's team made a \"convincing argument.\"",
      "\"From the identifying reports, co-location with other naval reactor facilities, and correlating construction activity, I think it can be said that it is likely the Longwei Project is housed at Base 909, and it could potentially be located at the identified building,\" she said.",
      "The research does not, however, provide clues as to when a Chinese nuclear-powered carrier could be built and become operational, she said.",
      "Sarah Laderman, a senior analyst with Open Nuclear Network, a program of the U.S.-based NGO PAX sapiens foundation, said the findings were \"carefully conducted and thoroughly researched.\"",
      "\"Given the evidence presented here, I see a compelling case made that China seems to be working towards building a nuclear propulsion system for its naval surface ships (likely aircraft carriers) at this location,\" said Laderman, who is based in Vienna and was not involved in Middlebury\u2019s research.",
      "Pursuit of a nuclear-powered carrier",
      "China\u2019s first carrier, commissioned in 2012, was a repurposed Soviet ship, and its second was built in China but based upon the Soviet design. Both ships \u2014 named the Liaoning and the Shandong \u2014 employ a so-called \"ski-jump\" type launch method, with a ramp at the end of a short runway to help planes take off.",
      "The Type 003 Fujian, launched in 2022, was the country's third carrier and its first to be indigenously designed and built. It employs an electromagnetic-type launch system like those developed and used by the U.S. Navy. All three carriers are conventionally powered.",
      "Sea trials hadn\u2019t even started for the Fujian in March when Yuan Huazhi, political commissar for China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army Navy, confirmed the construction of a fourth carrier. Asked if it would be nuclear-powered, he said at the time that would \"soon be announced,\" but so far it has not been.",

(Pu Haiyang/Xinhua via AP)",
      "There has been speculation that China may begin producing two new carriers at once \u2014 one Type 003 like the Fujian and one nuclear-powered Type 004 \u2014 something that it has not attempted before but that its shipyards have the capacity to do.",
      "Matthew Funaiole, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 China Power Project, said he doubts China's next carrier will be nuclear-powered. Instead, he said, he would expect the People's Liberation Army Navy's fourth carrier to focus on optimizing the existing design of the Fujian carrier with \"incremental improvements.\"",
      "Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the Chinese \"have taken an incremental approach to their carrier development with a number of ambitions that will evolve over time.\"",
      "\"For now, their deployments have been relatively cautious, remaining largely within range of shore support, but projecting influence and to some extent coercion within their near waters.\"",
      "CHINA OFFICIALLY 'DOESN'T CARE' ABOUT TRUMP WIN; UNOFFICIALLY, EXPERTS SAY BEIJING IS RATTLED",
      "Eventually, however, \"larger carriers more akin to their U.S. counterparts will give them more options to project power,\" Childs said.",
      "It takes several years to build a carrier and bring it into operation, but developing nuclear propulsion for its next generation of warships would eventually give China more power to run advanced systems, such as electromagnetic launchers, radars and new technology weapons, Childs said.",
      "\"As well as obviating the need for the ship to refuel regularly and therefore giving it much greater range, nuclear power means that without the need to carry fuel oil for the ship there will be room aboard for fuel and weapons for its aircraft, extending their capabilities,\" Childs said.",
      "\"Much will depend on what overall size the next carrier is, but the addition of nuclear power will represent a significant step further in China\u2019s carrier development with a vessel more comparable to the U.S. Navy\u2019s carriers.\"",
      "Zhao, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said nuclear-powered carriers would provide the Chinese military \"with greater flexibility and endurance to operate around strategic hotspots, especially along the First Island Chain, where most territories disputed by China are located,\" said Zhao.",
      "The First Island Chain includes the self-governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own and vows to annex it by force if necessary.",
      "The U.S. is obligated by a domestic law to supply Taiwan with sufficient weapons to deter invasion, and it could provide assistance to the island from its bases in the Pacific in the event of an invasion or blockade. Tensions also have risen in the South China Sea between China and neighboring nations over territorial disputes and maritime claims.",
      "\"These carriers could also extend Chinese operations deeper into the Western Pacific, further challenging the U.S. military\u2019s ability to \u2018intervene\u2019 in regional matters that China views as best resolved by countries from the region only,\" Zhao said.",
      "U.S.-China rivalry",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has tasked defense officials with building a \"first-class\" navy and becoming a maritime power as part of his blueprint for the country\u2019s rejuvenation.",
      "The country\u2019s most recent white paper on national defense, dated 2019, said the Chinese navy was adjusting to strategic requirements by \"speeding up the transition of its tasks from defense on the near seas to protection missions on the far seas.\"",
      "The People's Liberation Army Navy is already the world\u2019s largest navy with more than 370 ships and submarines. The country also boasts powerful shipbuilding capabilities: China\u2019s shipyards are building many hundreds of vessels each year, whereas the U.S. is building five or fewer, according to a U.S. congressional report late last year.",
      "In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, China's third conventionally powered aircraft carrier, the Fujian, conducts a maiden sea trial on May 7, 2024. (Ding Ziyu/Xinhua via AP, File)",
      "However, the Chinese navy lags behind the U.S. Navy in many respects. Among other advantages, the U.S. currently has 11 carriers, all nuclear powered, allowing it to keep multiple strike groups deployed around the world at all times, including in the Indo-Pacific.",
      "But the Pentagon is growingly increasingly concerned about China\u2019s rapid modernization of its fleet, including the design and construction of new carriers.",
      "That aligns with China's \"growing emphasis on the maritime domain and increasing demands\" for its navy \"to operate at greater distances from mainland China,\" the Defense Department said in its most recent report to Congress on China's military.",

      "And China's \"growing force of aircraft carriers extend air defense coverage of deployed task groups beyond the range of land-based defenses, enabling operations farther from China\u2019s shore,\" the report said."

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 01:42:28 GMT",
    "summary": "Republican senators want details of the Ethics Committee investigation into Matt Gaetz after Trump selected him to run the Justice Department as attorney general.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Republican senators are preparing for a robust vetting of Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department, with a keen interest in details from a House Ethics Committee investigation into the former congressman from Florida.",
      "The ethics panel has been investigating Gaetz off and on since 2021, most recently focusing on alleged sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, accepting improper gifts, obstruction and other allegations. But the results of that probe may not become public because Gaetz resigned from the House at noon on Thursday. The Ethics Committee has jurisdiction only over sitting House members.",
      "Trump's choice of Gaetz was a surprise to nearly everyone, including members of his own party and officials at the Justice Department \u2014 in part because of the Ethics investigation, his past legal problems and his reputation as a rabble-rouser in Congress.",
      "A source familiar with the process told NBC News that Gaetz had been consulting Trump on who would be best to run the Justice Department. Gaetz did not ask for the role, that person said, but Trump asked him to take on the job Wednesday morning, just hours before the decision was made public.",
      "Many Republican senators, including members of the GOP-led Judiciary Committee that will oversee Gaetz\u2019s nomination for attorney general, said they'll want to see the details of the House Ethics investigation into Gaetz.",
      "\"I think it would be helpful,\" said Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa.",
      "Sen.-elect John Curtis, R-Utah, said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d like to see the findings of the House Ethics Committee investigation, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know the technicalities, or whether or not we would see that, but I think that would be very relevant.\u201d",
      "The House Ethics Committee was scheduled to meet Friday, three sources familiar with the meeting told NBC News, and one of those sources said that releasing the Gaetz report was expected to be among the topics on the agenda. Punchbowl News previously reported Wednesday that the Ethics panel had planned to release a \"highly damaging\" report about Gaetz on Friday, citing multiple sources familiar with the probe.",
      "But Gaetz's resignation complicates things, and the meeting was canceled, according to a source with direct knowledge.",
      "Although the panel lost jurisdiction over Gaetz when he resigned, there is precedent for releasing ethics reports after or on the same day that a lawmaker leaves Congress. It happened in the case of former Rep. Bill Boner, D-Tenn., two months after he resigned in 1987 to become Nashville's mayor, and with former Rep. Buz Lukens, R-Ohio, on the day he resigned in 1990.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who sits on the Judiciary panel, said he'd be open to issuing a subpoena to the House panel to collect the evidence it has gathered if the committee decides not to release the report.",
      "\u201cWe need to have a complete vetting of the nominees, not only so we know that the nominee is qualified, but also to protect the president,\u201d said Cornyn, a former member of Republican leadership.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not in his best interest,\u201d Cornyn said, referring to Trump, \u201cto have any surprises in the House Ethics Committee report.\u201d",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said he didn\u2019t think the Senate had the authority to subpoena House records, adding, \u201cI\u2019d go ape s--- if they tried to subpoena something over here.\u201d",
      "Graham also said Trump hadn\u2019t consulted him on picking Gaetz. \u201cElections have consequences. He chose Matt Gaetz. Matt will come before the committee, and he will be asked hard questions, and we\u2019ll see how he does,\u201d\u00a0Graham\u00a0said.",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is likely to take over as Judiciary chair in January, dodged questions Thursday about whether he wants to see the House ethics report.",
      "\u201cWell, we\u2019ve got a professional staff on Judiciary that will do a full job of vetting, and all those questions will be answered by the vetting process report,\u201d Grassley said.",
      "\ufeffAsked again whether he wants to see it, Grassley said: \u201cI think we have a vetting process. Let it play out.\u201d",
      "Cornyn and other Republican senators said they believe they'll get all the key evidence from the ethics investigation even if the report itself never comes to light, thanks to an FBI background check and other research conducted as part of Gaetz's confirmation process in the Senate.",
      "\u201cI am confident that whatever the information and findings are of the House Ethics Committee will eventually be brought out, either through the FBI background investigation or the committee scrutiny of the nominee or through questioning at the hearing,\u201d\u00a0said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.",
      "Collins does not sit on the Judiciary Committee but is a moderate Republican whose vote in the full Senate could make or break Gaetz's nomination.",
      "Under the typical process, once he is formally nominated, Gaetz will be grilled by members of both parties on the Senate Judiciary Committee in at least one public hearing. The panel will then vote on sending his nomination to the Senate floor, where a simple majority is needed to confirm him for attorney general.",
      "If Republicans end up winning the Senate seat in Pennsylvania, which is heading for a recount, Gaetz can lose four votes on the Senate floor and still win confirmation. Trump has also said that he wants the ability to appoint his Cabinet members without a confirmation vote, while the Senate is in recess.",
      "Although many Republican senators expressed bafflement at Trump's choice of Gaetz on Wednesday, given his lack of experience, the Ethics Committee probe, his successful coup against then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and a Justice Department sex trafficking investigation into the congressman that ended last year with no charges, not one has rejected him outright.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, another moderate, seemed to go the furthest, saying Gaetz's is not \"a serious nomination for attorney general\" and that it would be \"a significant challenge\" for him to be confirmed. And Ernst on Wednesday said of Gaetz: \"He\u2019s got his work cut out for him.\u201d",
      "In the 18 hours since he was announced as Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department, Gaetz has already started working the phones and placing calls to some Republican senators to get a read on what his chances are at getting confirmed next year, four sources with direct knowledge of the outreach told NBC News.",
      "Separately, Vice President-elect JD Vance and his team have been making their own calls to Senate Republicans about Gaetz, two additional sources familiar with the calls told NBC News.",
      "Gaetz will have to answer his questions during Senate hearings about past scandals and his qualifications for the role, senators said.",
      "\"I have concerns that he can\u2019t get across the finish line,\" said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. \"and we\u2019re gonna spend a lot of political capital \u2014\u00a0I say we, a lot of people will spend a lot of political capital \u2014 on something that even if they got it done, you\u2019d have to wonder if it was worth it.\"",
      "Cramer said he has \"concerns\" about Gaetz, particularly how \"disrupted and just really destroyed the House of Representatives for several months\" in his successful push to oust McCarthy, which, Cramer said, \"accomplished nothing except getting rid of him, and, you know, ruin the reputation of the House of Representatives to the point where they didn\u2019t, they didn\u2019t catch the wave in this most recent [election.]\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 In the hours after President-elect Donald Trump announced that vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was his pick to serve as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, mixed reactions began rolling in from the senators needed to support his confirmation.",
      "Trump's Cabinet selections will face Senate confirmation votes \u2014 and unconventional picks like Kennedy could face a bumpy process in a Republican-controlled Senate with little room for error.",
      "Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., who Republicans tapped to be their new leader in the chamber, declined to provide a reaction to Kennedy's selection, saying, \"I don\u2019t have any at this point.\"",
      "Thune ducked a question about whether he would support Kennedy's confirmation, saying that the process \"is just getting started\" and adding that there would be \"a vetting process.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m not going to make any judgments about any of these folks at this point, like I said, it\u2019s a confirmation process that we have to adhere to constitutionally,\" said Thune, when asked whether he thinks Kennedy is qualified. \"There are committees that are going to be conducting hearings, and there\u2019ll be plenty of scrutiny of these nominees records when the time comes.\"",
      "Other Republican senators immediately expressed enthusiasm with Trump's pick.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., praised Kennedy in a statement, though he did not say how he planned to vote. Cassidy is currently the ranking member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee and is considered a contender for chairing the committee in the next Congress.",
      "\"I look forward to learning more about his other policy positions and how they will support a conservative, pro-American agenda,\" Cassidy said.",
      "Several Republican senators praised Kennedy in posts to X, with Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson calling him \"a brilliant, courageous truth-teller,\" Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville describing Kennedy as \"an absolutely brilliant pick\" and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley saying the announcement marked a \"bad day for Big Pharma.\"",
      "Across the aisle, many Democrats immediately condemned Kennedy's selection, characterizing it as \"dangerous\" and \"disturbing.\"",
      "\"Mr. Kennedy\u2019s outlandish views on basic scientific facts are disturbing and should worry all parents who expect schools and other public spaces to be safe for their children,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., in a statement.",
      "Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., said in a post to X that Kennedy was \u201cDangerous.\u00a0Unqualified. Unserious.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., called two of Trump's recent decisions \"the definition of insanity,\" and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., slammed Trump's selection, saying, \"This could not be more dangerous.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s no telling how far an anti-vaxxer & fringe conspiracy theorist like RFK Jr. could set\u00a0America\u00a0back\u00a0in terms of public health, reproductive rights, research, & more,\" Murray wrote in a post to X. \"And the consequences are not theoretical \u2014 they\u2019re life or death issues.\"",
      "Kennedy has repeatedly criticized vaccines, touting widely debunked false claims that they are tied to autism.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Trump's team for comment on criticism of the president-elect's selection.",
      "But at least one Democrat expressed enthusiasm about Kennedy's selection.",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said in a post to X that he was \"excited by the news,\" adding that Kennedy \"will help make America healthy again by shaking up HHS and FDA.\" As a governor, he will not have a vote in Kennedy's confirmation.",
      "When reached for further comment, a Polis spokesperson pointed NBC News to the governor having \"clarified his tweet\" in a later post, in which Polis said that \"science must remain THE cornerstone of our nation\u2019s health policy.\"",
      "\"Lest there by any doubt, I am vaccinated as is my family. I will hold any HHS Secretary to the same high standard of protecting and improving public health,\" Polis added in the later post.",
      "In the next session of Congress, Republicans will hold at least 52 seats in the Senate, and they may pick up another seat depending on the outcome of Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate race, which is heading for a recount. NBC News has not yet projected the winner.",
      "A majority of senators must vote in support of a nominee in order for the position to be confirmed."

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. \u2014 The Tampa Bay Rays will play their 2025 home games at the New York Yankees\u2019 nearby spring training ballpark amid uncertainty about the future of\u00a0hurricane-damaged Tropicana Field, Rays executives said on Thursday.",
      "Stuart Sternberg, the Rays\u2019 principal owner, said in an interview that Steinbrenner Field in Tampa is the best fit for the team and its fanbase. At about 11,000 seats, it\u2019s also the largest of the spring training sites in Florida.",
      "\u201cIt is singularly the best opportunity for our fans to experience 81 games of major league Rays baseball,\u201d Sternberg said. \u201cAs difficult as it is to get any of these stadiums up to major league standards, it was the least difficult. You\u2019re going to see Major League Baseball in a small environment.\u201d",
      "Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said the Rays-Yankees deal is good for the sport and the Tampa Bay region.",
      "\u201cThis outcome meets Major League Baseball\u2019s goals that Rays fans will see their team play next season in their home market and that their players can remain home without disruption to their families,\u201d Manfred said in a news release.",
      "The Rays\u2019 home since 1998, the domed Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg was hit hard by\u00a0Hurricane Milton\u00a0on Oct. 9, with most of its fabric roof shredded and water damage inside. The city of St. Petersburg, which owns the Trop, released an assessment of the damage and repair needs that estimated the\u00a0cost at $55.7 million\u00a0if it is to be ready for the start of the 2026 season.",
      "The work would have to be approved by the city council, which earlier this year voted for a new $1.3 billion, 30,000-seat stadium to replace Tropicana Field beginning in 2028. The new stadium is part of a much larger urban revitalization project known as the Historic Gas Plant District\u2014named for the Black community that once occupied the 86 acres that include retail, office, and hotel space; a Black history museum; and restaurants and bars.",

A ballpark with a facade mimicking that of Yankee Stadium in the Bronx and festooned with plaques of Yankee players whose numbers have been retired.",
      "Brian Auld, the Rays co-president, said in an interview that Tampa Bay has to be ready for a regular-season MLB game March 27 against the Colorado Rockies, just three days after the Yankees break training camp.",

      "It will also come with some weather challenges in the hot, rainy Florida summer climate the Rays didn\u2019t worry about in their domed ballpark. The Rays averaged about 16,500 fans per game during the 2024 season.",
      "Once known as Legends Field, Steinbrenner Field opened in 1996 on Tampa\u2019s north side. It is named for longtime Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who ran a shipbuilding company in Tampa and died at his home there in 2010. One of his sons, Yankees executive Hal Steinbrenner, was instrumental in getting the deal done with the Rays, Sternberg said.",

    "summary": "The New York Yankees slugger is expected to sign a deal north of $600 million that will come close to the real-dollar value of Shohei Ohtani's $700 million pact.",
    "story": [
      "By Opening Day 2025, one Major League Baseball team will have superstar slugger Juan Soto in tow, threatening to fill up box scores with home runs and RBIs \u2014 all while adding a series of zeros to his checking account.",
      "Soto, 26, is hands down this winter\u2019s most highly sought-after free agent, valued as much for his elite baseball skills as for his birth date.",
      "And his workplace choice could very well tip the balance of MLB power for years.",
      "If he stays with the Yankees, the defending American League champions, or ventures to Los Angeles to join the World Series-winning Dodgers, Soto might\u00a0cement those big-market, star-laden clubs as perennial October players.",
      "He could also\u00a0land with recent playoff contenders like the New York Mets or his onetime employer the San Diego Padres and push them closer to the very top.",
      "Or he might opt for a larger club desperately seeking to regain relevance, such as the Boston Red Sox, the Toronto Blue Jays or the San Francisco Giants.",
      "Soto blasted a career-high 41 home runs this season to go along with 109 RBIs, fourth and sixth most, respectively, in those two traditional MLB categories.",
      "He is also one of the most disciplined and patient hitters in baseball, drawing walks in 18.1% of his plate appearances, compared with the overall MLB rate of 8.4%, in 2024. And in an age of swing-for-the-fences baseball, Soto struck out just 16.7% of the time, while the league whiffed at a 22.2% clip this season.",
      "The stars are aligned for a \"long, massive bid out\" among baseball's richest clubs, MLB Network analyst and former pitcher Al Leiter said.",
      "\"Can you imagine how perfect the world is when you have the Mets, Yankees, Red Sox and Blue Jays all vying for your client's services?\" Leiter said Tuesday. \"Yeah, thank you, thank you universe.\"",
      "It\u2019s expected that the Soto Sweepstakes will be won by a club shelling out at least $600 million over 10 years.",
      "Such a contract would, at first glance, fall short of the 10-year, $700 million deal that took worldwide superstar Shohei Ohtani across Southern California to the Los Angeles Dodgers. But Soto\u2019s new agreement, even if it comes in south of the $700 million mark, could be considered equal to or greater than Ohtani\u2019s.",
      "That\u2019s because Ohtani, the Dodgers DH and pitcher, is making a paltry $2 million per season over the next 10 years.\u00a0He will make $68 million annually in deferred payments in years 11 through 20, however, greatly diminishing his actual take-home pay.",
      "Soto, represented by hard-driving super agent Scott Boras, has shown no indication of offering charity to his new employer like Ohtani did.",
      "Free agency is \u201cgoing to be exciting,\u201d Soto told reporters moments after the Yankees lost Game 5 of the World Series, ending the baseball season. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a good experience. I think every player in the big league wants to experience this. So it\u2019s exciting to see how it\u2019s going to be.\u201d",
      "Soto just turned 26 late last month, putting him in prime-of-his-career position to cash in on the open market.",
      "Players have to log six years of MLB service time before they are allowed to fully test free agency. Those half-dozen years of club control, at less-than-free-market salaries, act as a slight disincentive to sign free agents who might be approaching or already past their athletic peaks at around age 30.",
      "Ohtani, 30, is the odds-on favorite to be named NL MVP, while Soto's New York teammate Aaron Judge, 32, is expected to be the AL's top honoree.",
      "Teams that do sign high-priced older free agents go into it knowing they'll be overpaying for aging, less-than-productive stars on the back end. If Soto remains healthy, though, he should have several more monster seasons that could take the sting out of any late-career slide.",

      "Harper, now 32 and entering his seventh season in South Philly, is still one of baseball's elite performers. He hit 30 home runs last year and had a Wins Above Replacement (WAR) value of 5.2, 20th best among 1,454 MLB players, according to FanGraphs.",
      "Soto, who went to the Yankees from San Diego in a trade 11 months ago, said he has enjoyed playing in New York, but he stopped well short of committing to the Big Apple.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really happy with the city, with the team, but at the end of the day we will see,\u201d he said.",
      "And this season proved what should be obvious: Large payrolls are a near-necessity for success.",
      "The AL champion Yankees had the second-highest MLB payroll, at $309.8 million for their 40-man roster, according to Baseball Prospectus.",
      "The NL runners-up Mets were No. 1 at $341.8 million, while the World Series champion Dodgers spent $288.8 million with a deceptively low No. 3 ranking because of Ohtani's sweetheart deal.",
      "The Cleveland Guardians were MLB's only low-spending final four team, with the No. 23 payroll of $106.2 million.",
      "There's no telling when Soto or other any free agents will come to terms with their 2025 teams.",
      "The Dodgers announced their signing of Ohtani on Dec. 11, while the San Francisco Giants didn't pick up Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Blake Snell until March 19, less than two weeks before Opening Day.",
      "And who makes Soto's announcement holds even more intrigue.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to look at every situation, every offer that we get,\" Soto said. \"I don\u2019t know what teams want to come after me, but definitely I\u2019ll be open to listen to every single team. I don\u2019t have any doors closed or anything like that, so we\u2019re going to be available for all 30 teams.\u201d"

      "The Justice Department on Thursday announced its findings from a civil rights investigation it opened into conditions at the jail in July 2023.",
      "It found that Georgia officials violated the rights of those incarcerated by failing to protect them from violence, failing to provide humane living conditions, neglecting adequate medical and mental health care, having a pattern of excessive force and confining detainees in \u201cdangerous restrictive housing conditions without due process.\u201d",
      "The investigation was opened after the death of Lashawn Thompson, 35, in September 2022, which sparked public outrage. His body was found malnourished in a bedbug-infested cell in the psychiatric wing, and a private autopsy found he was neglected to death.",
      "The 105-page report details the serious conditions at the jail \u2014described as long-standing, filthy and dangerous \u2014 as well as remedial measures Fulton County officials should implement.",
      "Fulton County and the Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.",
      "Fulton County Jail: Home to stabbings, assaults, pests and a lack of care",
      "The lengthy report presented a staggering portrait of violence and death at the jail.",
      "From 2022 to the present, six incarcerated people have died in violent attacks, the report said. Over 300 stabbings involving contraband and makeshift weapons were also reported last year. Four deaths by suicide have also been reported in the past four years, one of them as recently as April, according to the report.",
      "The report found that the jail failed to protect detainees from the risk of harm from violence and sexual violence. Assaults are carried out in the jail using makeshift weapons, and the jail has inadequate practices for reporting and responding to sexual violence, it said.",
      "The report said killings, stabbing and assaults are common. In less than 24 hours in August 2023, at least seven people were stabbed and one was killed in an outburst of violence that spanned five units and three floors, it noted.",
      "Furthermore, jail deputies and detention officers use force against incarcerated people without adequate justification, including deploying Tasers without reasonable cause, the document said.",
      "The facilities were found to be in a state of \u201cserious disrepair,\u201d and living conditions are \u201chazardous and unsanitary.\u201d",
      "Housing units are flooded with water from broken toilets and sinks; there are cockroaches, rodents and other pests; and the jail took \u201cinsufficient steps to control infestations,\u201d the report said. Cells were described as \u201cfilthy and unhygienic with dangerous exposed wires.\u201d",
      "The jail also failed to provide enough food, food preparation and service are not sanitary, and detainees have suffered from malnourishment and pest infestation, the report said.",
      "The report found that medical and mental health care also did not meet constitutional standards: There were gaps in medication administration, there is a lack of security staffing, and the jail fails to provide appropriate care in medical emergencies.",
      "And it fails to adequately treat serious mental health needs and prevent a risk of suicide. It is a dire situation, the report found, as people with mental health needs are \u201coverrepresented\u201d in the jail population, yet the jail environment \u201cexacerbates symptoms of mental illness.\u201d",
      "The report found that the jail placed people in isolation without adequate monitoring, saying placement in restrictive housing discriminates against people with mental health disabilities.",
      "Furthermore, there are 17-year-old boys and girls are in the jail, as the state juvenile justice system\u2019s jurisdiction ends at 16. The teens are subjected to violence and excessive force, experience sexual abuse and are uniquely harmed in restrictive housing like isolation, the report said.",
      "The jail also fails to provide special education services to those 17-year-olds who are entitled to them \u2014 in violation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, it said.",
      "Lashawn Thompson",
      "Thompson, who had a history of mental illness and was unhoused, died in the jail three months after his arrest.",
      "The report said that Thompson was accused of spitting at a Georgia Tech police officer and that he was arrested on a simple battery charge; he was held on an old warrant.",
      "The jail failed detainees like Thompson with mental health needs, the report found.",
      "It said four Black men who all had serious mental health needs, including Thompson, died in the mental health unit in under a year.\u00a0Within weeks of the investigation\u2019s opening, six more Black men died at the jail.",

      "In announcing Thursday's report, Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a news release: \u201cLashawn Thompson\u2019s horrific death was symptomatic of a pattern of dangerous and dehumanizing conditions in the Fulton County Jail.",
      "\u201cThe unconstitutional and unlawful conditions at the Fulton County Jail have persisted for far too long, and we are committed to working with Fulton County and the Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office to remedy them,\u201d he added.",
      "Jail grapples with overpopulation and mental health needs",

      "Black people are overrepresented in the jail compared with the county\u2019s population.\u00a0People with mental health needs are also overrepresented.",
      "The report said that \u201cdeaths and serious injuries remain prevalent at the jail. Thus far in 2024, three men at the Main Jail have died: one of a suspected drug overdose, one by stabbing and one by suicide.\u201d",
      "Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, said in the release: \u201cDetention in the Fulton County Jail has amounted to a death sentence for dozens of people who have been murdered or who died as a result of the atrocious conditions inside the facility. It\u2019s not just adults but also children who are subjected to conditions and treatment that violate the constitution and defy federal law.\u201d",
      "She noted that many held have not been convicted or are serving short sentences for misdemeanors.",
      "The Justice Department said the attorney general can file a federal lawsuit seeking court-ordered remedies. The department provided Fulton County and the local sheriff\u2019s office with a written notice\u00a0outlining the minimum remedial measures to address the alleged violations.",

    "story": [
      "Two former Missouri officers were charged in separate, unconnected cases in federal court this week over allegations that they illegally searched women's phones during traffic stops to obtain intimate, explicit images on the devices.",
      "Julian Alcala, 29, who was employed as a police officer with the city of Florissant, is charged with 20 counts of deprivation of rights and a count of destroying records in a federal investigation, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri announced Thursday.",
      "Deprivation of rights specifically refers to being free from unreasonable search and seizure, established in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.",
      "According to the federal indictment, Alcala would take women's phones during traffic stops to confirm their insurance coverage or vehicle registration. But he searched their phones for nude images and took photos on his own personal phone, the indictment said.",
      "In one case, authorities allege, Alcala texted himself a video and deleted evidence of the text.",
      "He is accused of doing that to 20 women from Feb. 6 to May 18.",
      "The Florissant Police Department said in a statement Wednesday that it was completely unaware of the allegations. Alcala had passed a \"meticulous and thorough background investigation\" during the hiring process, and the department had not received a complaint about him in the 11 months of his employment, it said.",
      "\"We are disgusted at this behavior, which is a complete betrayal of the values we uphold and in no way reflects the professionalism and integrity of our dedicated officers,\" the department said. \"We recognize the gravity of this breach of trust and its impact on our community.\"",
      "Alcala resigned in June after the FBI contacted the police department about an investigation into him, the police department statement said.",
      "Civil lawsuits have also been filed against Alcala and the city, including one that echoes an allegation made by federal prosecutors. A lawsuit filed in the same district court last month alleges that Alcala sent himself a private video made by a couple having sex.",
      "The Jane Doe was pulled over in February, and Alcala took her phone back to his vehicle when she presented the insurance information she stored on the device, the lawsuit claims. It says she noticed \"there was a deleted text message\" from the time of the stop.",
      "Alcala sent himself the video and deleted the message \"in an effort to hide his tracks,\" the suit said. He is also accused of obtaining a nude photo from her phone in the same stop.",
      "Attorney Bevis\u00a0Schock is representing six people in civil litigation against Alcala in the city. He told NBC affiliate KSDK of St, Louis that his clients are \"real nice, normal people who do what police officers say.\"",
      "\"The way this started was the FBI called the victims,\" Schock said. \"And each victim said, 'Well, I got pulled over, and he took my phone back.'\"",
      "Court records show a warrant was issued for Alcala on Wednesday. It is unclear whether he is in custody. He has not appeared in court and does not have an attorney listed.",
      "NBC News could not find contact information for Alcala using public records in an effort to reach him for comment. An attorney representing the city of Florissant in a civil lawsuit in the case did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The U.S. attorney\u2019s office filed a similar but unconnected case Tuesday against a former Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper.",
      "David McKnight, 39, was indicted in the same federal court on nine counts of deprivation of rights and one count of destroying records. Federal prosecutors allege he illegally searched the phones of nine women from September 2023 to August 2024 while he was working for the highway patrol.",
      "According to the U.S. attorney's office, McKnight used his own phone to take pictures of nude images on the women's phones after they gave him the devices to show their insurance or identification information. Most of the women were pulled over for traffic stops, the office said.",
      "McKnight joined the highway patrol in 2021, it said in a statement. A criminal investigation was launched in August, and the department's investigators arrested him on Aug. 21, the statement said.",
      "\"McKnight resigned from the Patrol on August 26, and is no longer a member of our agency,\" the highway patrol said.",
      "The Missouri Department of Public Safety told NBC News that records show McKnight surrendered his state peace officer license, \"which means he can never work as a Missouri law enforcement officer again.\"",
      "The federal prosecutor's office said McKnight's and Alcala's cases are not connected.",
      "A public defender assigned to McKnight's case did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Court records show that he was taken into federal custody Thursday and that a judge set a bond of $10,000. He pleaded not guilty.",
      "Ashley Johnson, special agent in charge of the FBI St. Louis Division, told people not to hesitate to report uncomfortable encounters with officers. The FBI investigated both cases, the U.S. attorney's office release said.",
      "\"If you feel your civil rights have been violated, contact the FBI,\" Johnson said. \"Investigating criminal conduct by a law enforcement officer is among our top priorities.\u201d"

      "The monkey, named Jorgie Boy, was taken from his owner, Brandi Botello, on Saturday morning after Dallas police officers responded to a single-vehicle accident. The driver was arrested on a charge of driving while intoxicated, police said in a statement.",
      "Police did not identify the driver in the statement. Botello told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth that she was charged with DWI but maintained that she was not driving. She said that at the time of the crash, she was intoxicated and had passed out in the passenger seat holding the nearly 3-year-old spider monkey.",
      "\"I didn't even know what was going on. I slept through the car accident. I didn\u2019t even know we were in an accident,\" she told the station. \"I wasn't driving.\"",
      "She said she did move into the driver's seat after the crash.",
      "\"I hopped over to the driver's seat. I didn't know we crashed in front of the police station. When I turned around there was a cop right there and he was trying to accuse me of driving, but I wasn't driving,\" she said, according to NBC Dallas-Fort Worth.",
      "Botello told the station that the driver was a male acquaintance and that he was charged with public intoxication.",
      "Neither the humans nor the monkey in the car were seriously injured, police said.",
      "Because Botello lives in Irving, a neighboring suburb, the monkey was transferred to Irving's animal control department, Dallas police said.",
      "Irving police said Thursday that Jorgie Boy was diagnosed with rickets, which they described as \"a bone disease caused by inadequate nutrition.\" The police department said he is receiving care at \"an undisclosed wildlife sanctuary in Texas.\"",
      "The Dallas Morning News reported the sanctuary, which it identified as Funky Monkey Ranch, said that Jorgie Boy weighed 6 pounds, less than half of an average spider monkey, and that he had tiny fractures in his bones and elevated liver and pancreatic levels.",
      "The sanctuary's owner said the monkey would not be returned to its previous owner, the Morning News reported.",
      "Funky Monkey Ranch did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News to confirm details reported by the Morning News.",
      "It is legal in Texas to own some exotic animals, including monkeys, with permits, but the city of Irving prohibits ownership of wild animals.",
      "Botello, who has 43,000 Instagram followers, has been reposting followers' stories with the hashtag \"#FreeJorgieBoy.\"",
      "On Instagram, Botello wrote \"this ugly depressing lonely feeling I have is the worst\" but said she is \"not going to stop trying!\"",
      "\"He means more to me then anything in this world I'm not going to let one little mistake break me I'm willing to change anything and everything for him,\" she wrote.",
      "\"Being at the wrong place at the wrong time is a real thing,\" Botello continued. \"I owned up to it ... I know I'm a good mom ... WE ALL KNOW that!\"",
      "Jorgie Boy has an online presence of his own, including an Instagram account with nearly 6,000 followers that includes pictures of him wearing pajama sets, taking baths and dressing up with Botello, who has his name tattooed on her back.",
      "Jorgie Boy's story comes on the heels of that of Peanut, an Instagram-famous squirrel that authorities seized and euthanized after officials got reports that Peanut's owner was illegally keeping wild animals in his home."

      "But, the documents say, federal agents discovered recently that he continued to use Facebook accounts and encrypted messaging applications to create and disseminate propaganda that glorified ISIS violence.",
      "Said initially refused to comply with law enforcement agents after he was arrested Friday but later detailed his support for the terrorist group, the detention memo alleges.",

      "\"If they said yes, those are the persons he would kill,\" the documents say.",
      "In an email, a lawyer for Said said he is focusing on the allegation that his client provided material support by producing videos and propaganda for ISIS.",
      "\"Despite allegations that my client made statements to government agents regarding proposed terrorist acts, the indictment does not currently allege any planning, or acts, of terrorism,\" said the lawyer, Baldemar Zuniga.\u00a0\"This appears to be a lengthy investigation and it will take some time to sift through all of the evidence.\""

      "Marla Rose, 57, said in a now-deleted Facebook post that she was about to ring Fuentes\u2019 doorbell when he opened the door, sprayed her with a liquid, took her phone, pushed her down the steps and went back inside. Rose did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Rose shared a video of the altercation Tuesday on Facebook. In the video, Fuentes opens the door and points what appears to be a spraying device toward the camera.

Afterward, many users on X began spreading Fuentes\u2019 personal information online, including his home address and pictures of his house, writing, \u201cYour house, our choice.\u201d Since then, Google Maps has blurred its picture of Fuentes\u2019 house.",

      "Where is Roshanak Molaei? The hashtag is circulating in Iran after the 25-year-old woman disappeared in Tehran after being taken into custody by police, raising concerns about her treatment as the country continues to crack down on women who defy mandatory hijab laws.",
      "The events that led to Roshanak Molaei's arrest did not start as a protest.",
      "A surveillance video shows the woman walking along a Tehran sidewalk on Nov. 1, before a man dressed in a military uniform approaches her from behind on a motorcycle.",
      "It is not clear from the angle of the footage whether the man verbally or physically accosted her, but according to the nearly 2-minute video that Molaei later posted to her X account, she reacted by grabbing the motorcyclist in a heated exchange that drew several bystanders. The man then drove off.",
      "Molaei captioned the video: \u201cA scene from being a woman in Iran.\u201d",

      "According to a statement by the organization, Molaei had previously argued on social media with a government official over mandatory hijab laws. The incident captured by the surveillance camera shows Molaei without a hijab.",
      "Iranian police confirmed in a statement that there was a \u201cconfrontation between a young woman and a motorcyclist\u201d on Nov. 1, adding that \u201cinitial investigations indicate that the motorcyclist harassed the young woman.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth parties have been referred to judicial authorities,\" the police statement said. \"The motorcyclist will face investigation for both harassment and traffic violations. The woman is being prosecuted for not observing mandatory hijab laws.\u201d",
      "According to Hengaw, on Nov. 2 Molaei was \"summoned by FATA,\" the Iranian cyberpolice, about her post, and was arrested the following day.",
      "\"It remains unclear in which prison she is currently being held,\" a representative from Hengaw told NBC News.",
      "\"Since her detention, there has been limited information regarding her health and conditions of imprisonment. The lack of transparent information about the situation of political prisoners in Iran remains a widespread concern,\" the Hengaw representative said.",
      "This is not the first time Molaei is arrested for opposing Iran\u2019s mandatory hijab laws, according to Hengaw. In 2022, she was arrested during the \u201cWoman, Life, Freedom\u201d protests, a series of peaceful demonstrations triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody.",
      "Amini had been arrested in part for not wearing a hijab correctly, with the U.N. asserting that she was killed \u201cas a result of beatings\u201d by Iranian authorities. Iran has denied the charges, saying she died of pre-existing medical conditions.",
      "Following her arrest in September 2022, Molaei was sentenced to over six years in prison but released in February 2023 after being granted amnesty, according to Hengaw.",
      "Molaei's new arrest is yet another incident fueling alarm from international human rights organizations. In a 2024 report on the situation of human rights in Iran the U.N. \"raised pressing concerns\" about the \"deteriorating human rights situation for women and girls\" across the country.",
      "\"Roshanak\u2019s case exemplifies the systematic oppression faced by women when they seek to claim their basic rights and personal freedoms,\" Hengaw said in a statement.",
      "\"Women in Iran who publicly oppose mandatory hijab and other discriminatory laws face immense risks, including imprisonment, intimidation, and mistreatment.\"",
      "A day before Molaei's arrest, a young woman was detained after stripping to her underwear in an apparent protest at the Olum Tahghighat branch of the Islamic Azad University in Tehran, state media reported. The woman was transferred to a psychiatric hospital, raising concerns for her safety. There is no specific information on the woman\u2019s condition, but Amnesty International has found evidence that people detained in psychiatric wards have been subject to torture, beatings and other mistreatment.",
      "The security agents who enforce hijab laws, informally called morality police, have recently started easing public confrontations with women over the headscarves, following the election of reformist president Masoud Pezeshkian who campaigned on opposing these police patrols.",
      "However, locals say the agents continue to be present in the streets but have been instructed to issue warnings rather than take immediate enforcement actions. Bystanders are discouraged or prevented from recording, restricting the how many of these interactions appear on social media.",
      "In addition, the government has set up new centers called \u201canti-unveiling clinics,\u201d where women who choose not to wear the hijab may be referred to for a program described as \u201ctherapy,\u201d to encourage compliance of hijab laws."

      "Demonstrators at both events said they did not want to allow the normalization of Israel's actions in Gaza, where local officials say more than 43,000 people have been killed over the past year.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:01:58 GMT",
    "summary": "A 300-carat necklace, whose diamonds have been linked to a scandal involving the last French queen Marie Antoinette, sold Wednesday for nearly $5 million at a Sotheby's auction in Geneva.",
    "story": [
      "It's a sparkling piece of scandal.",
      "A 300-carat 18th century necklace, whose diamonds may have helped fuel the overthrow of the French monarchy, sold Wednesday for nearly $5 million at an auction in Geneva.",
      "The necklace has been worn at two British coronations and may contain diamonds from the infamous necklace at the heart of a scandal that tainted the reputation of Marie Antoinette, the last queen of France.",
      "It sold for more than twice its estimate, at $4.81 million.",
      "Experts believe that some of the diamonds may be linked to the infamous \u201cAffair of the Diamond Necklace.\u201d That theory is supported by the style of the necklace as well as the quality and age of the stones, the auction house Sotheby\u2019s said in a press release.",
      "The exact origins of the necklace have not been recorded, with Sotheby\u2019s stressing it does not know for certain.",
      "Despite this, it said it believed that the necklace\u00a0\"could only have been created for royalty or a high-ranking aristocrat.\" It pointed to its nearly 500 diamonds arranged in three rows that trail on either side into a tassel.",
      "\u201cIt stands head and shoulders above all other documented Royal and Imperial jewels of the period,\u201d Andres White Correal, head of royal and noble jewels at Sotheby\u2019s said in a statement before the auction.",
      "\u201cThis rare and important diamond jewel is a sublime survivor from the opulent court life of the Georgian era, defined by its unrivalled pomp and splendor; it is arguably one of the most magnificent and intact Georgian jewels in private hands,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cIt was an electric night,\u201d White Correal told the Reuters news agency after the sale.",
      "\u201cThere is obviously a niche in the market for historical jewels with fabulous provenances. People are not only buying the object, they are buying all the history that is attached to it,\u201d he said.",
      "That history centers on Louis XV, the king of France, who commissioned a lavish diamond necklace for his mistress, Madam Du Barry, in 1722 \u2014 two years before he died of smallpox.",
      "That meant he could not pay for and receive the necklace, leaving the jewelers out of pocket.",
      "Marie Antoinette, the country's new queen consort, declined to buy the necklace despite her reputation for extravagance. Noblewoman Jeanne de La Motte then, so the story goes, posed as the queen and convinced an out-of-favor cardinal to give her the lavish necklace as a gift before absconding with the lucrative diamonds.",
      "A subsequent trial found the queen innocent, but the same could not be said of the court of public opinion. The French Revolution followed years later.",
      "It is unclear exactly how the necklace ended up in the hands of a British aristocratic family, the Pagets.",
      "The Marchioness of Anglesey, a member of the Paget family, wore the necklace at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953.",
      "According to Sotheby\u2019s, the family parted with the piece after it was acquired by an \u201cimportant Asian private collection in the 1970s.\u201d",
      "The necklace has been in private hands ever since.",
      "In 2022, bracelets that once belonged to\u00a0Marie Antoinette sold for more than $8 million at\u00a0auction,\u00a0also in Geneva."

    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \u201cThe Golden Bachelorette.\u201d",
      "It was a love story for the (golden) ages! In the emotional finale of \"The Golden Bachelorette,\" Joan Vassos chose her winner on the island of Bora Bora.",
      "Her decision came down to Chock Chapple, a 60-year-old insurance executive from Wichita, Kansas, and Guy Gansert, a 66-year-old ER doctor from Reno, Nevada. Ultimately, she chose Chock \u2014 the man who said, over and over, he was \"crazy about her.\"",
      "Joan, who lost her husband John to pancreatic cancer in 2021, was previously a contestant on \u201cThe Golden Bachelor.\u201d She departed the season voluntarily to care for her daughter, who had recently given birth.",
      "\"I feel happy about my future now that it looks a lot brighter. Chock is the reason for all of this,\" Joan said in a confessional interview.",
      "What happened in the 'Golden Bachelorette' finale?",
      "Chock emerged as a frontrunner early on, but his connection with Joan was cemented after meeting her adult children.",
      "The meeting was emotional \u2014 Joan's son Nick seemed to initially balk when Chock kissed Joan on the lips as a way of a greeting.",
      "But her kids came around. Chock promised that he was not here to \"replace\" their late father in any \"way shape or form.\"",
      "Joan and her kids also marked the difficulty of her moving on romantically. \u201cIf I loved Dad so much, would I be able to fall in love again?\u201d Joan questioned. Nick cheered her on, saying he and his sister were \"proud\" to see her \"take risks,\" and proud of the \"incredible strength\" she demonstrates.",
      "Chock, on his end, said he had a \"great time,\" calling her family \"good people.\"",
      "After the date, Chock declared his love for Joan. While Joan didn't respond, it was enough for her to decide that Chock would be her future husband. She realized was worthy of love \u2014 which came into question following her breakup with contestant Pascal Ibgui.",
      "The episode before the finale, Pascal, a salon owner from Chicago, broke up with Joan in an emotional boat cruise in Tahiti, telling her that he didn\u2019t feel a strong connection.",
      "\"It just makes me feel like I'm unlovable,\" Joan said at the time of the breakup. \"If he couldn't love me, how could anybody love me?\"",
      "And so, before Guy had the opportunity to meet Joan's family, Joan broke up with him. During the \"After the Final Rose\" special, she clarified that she was \"getting there\" with Guy, but they needed more time.",
      "\"It was really, really hard at the end to say goodbye to you because in any other situation, I would have been with you because we would have had more time,\" she said. \"It was absolutely nothing you did. I have missed you. It's been really hard to be away from you.\"",
      "Joan said she hopes she and Guy stay friends and can double date.",
      "Chock proposed on the beach",
      "Heading into the final scenes, Joan and Chock said they felt ready and excited to get engaged.",
      "Joan declared that she wants to \"spend the rest of her life\" with Chock. She had lost hope in her future \u2014 and he helped her bring it back. Chock, meanwhile, said he couldn't believe he found this \"incredible opportunity\" at this point in his life.",
      "In his proposal, Chock said he was \"so absolutely happy\" to be in her life, and have her in his. He acknowledged their late partners and said he would \"honor\" John by \"loving her every day.\"",
      "Joan, similarly, acknowledged the difficulty of having Chock step away from filming because his mother passed away. This, she said, was the moment she knew she couldn't complete the show's journey without him.",
      "\"We are living proof that no matter what life throws at you, there is still hope, even at our age,\" Joan said, proceeding to tell Chock she loved him for the first time.",
      "And with that, Chock got down on one knee and proposed with a Neil Lane ring (naturally). She gave him the final golden rose.",
      "After the proposal, the happy couple FaceTimed with Joan's mom from the beach, who expressed her shock and delight at meeting her daughter's new partner.",
      "\"I never in a million years thought I'd feel love like this again. Ever,\" Joan said.",
      "So, are Joan Vassos and Chock still together?",
      "Host Jesse Palmer revealed Joan and Chock as the franchise\u2019s \u201cnewest \u2018Golden Bachelorette\u2019 couple,\u201d indicating they are still together.",
      "The couple confirmed it in an interview.",
      "\"This feels so good. I'm looking at our family and friends who we've never gotten to be with together, so it's so nice to finally be able to share our love and our story and our future with them,\" Joan said to her loved ones, who were sitting in the audience.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier and I want the world to know it,\u201d Chock said. He then spoke up for his fianc\u00e9e for her behavior on the show. \u201cI want to tell the world, the fans, how classy Joan is and the respect she gave all the other guys,\u201d he added.",
      "Since the engagement, Joan and Chock were able to spend quality time together out of the public eye.",
      "\"We cooked, we played crosswords, I mean we did everything,\" Chock said.",
      "Jesse, in a surprise at the end of the finale, said the show was sending both of their families on a trip to Disney world, earning lots of claps from Joan's grandson."

    "story": [
      "Alex Cross, the literary world\u2019s well-known crime detective, is receiving a makeover in the latest television adaptation, \u201cCross,\u201d coming to Amazon Prime on Nov. 14. The titular star is played stoically by \u201cBlack Adam\u201d breakout Aldis Hodge.",
      "The role of Alex Cross is not new to on-screen adaptations. The first came in 1997\u2019s \u201cKiss the Girls,\u201d with Morgan Freeman playing the hardened Washington D.C. detective. The movie was a loose adaptation of the series\u2019 second book of the same name. A second installment also starring Freeman called \u201cAlong Came a Spider,\u201d released in 2001.",
      "The last major attempt to convert Alex Cross into an on-screen fixture came in 2012 with the aptly named film, \u201cAlex Cross\u201d starring Tyler Perry in the lead role.",
      "With multiple films and a longstanding book series in the rearview, Hodge had the difficult task of making the legendary character his own in an eight episode series. In an interview with TODAY.com, Hodge explained how he approached the task with showrunner Ben Watkins.",
      "\u201cThe perspective of how we shaped this character came in conversations with Ben Watkins where we didn\u2019t even talk about the character. We just talked about what was going on in our personal lives, our lives as men.\u201d",
      "For the 38-year-old actor, one of those \"personal\" life things included his newly appointed role as a father, which he says helped him curate his take on Alex Cross, a proud dad of two.",
      "\u201cI recently stepped into fatherhood,\u201d Hodge said. \u201cI was in a whirlwind of emotions because it\u2019s such a beautiful experience. And those kinds of things really shaped how they went back to write the character as we moved through so I was really stepping into something that was already familiar.\u201d",
      "Hodge is a first-time dad to his now three-year-old daughter. In an October profile of the star by Essence magazine, Hodge expanded on how his new parental role informs his life.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s what feeds me. It\u2019s what drives me. It\u2019s what wakes me up in the morning. It\u2019s really the thing that makes me say, \u2018Okay, life is worth living.\u2019 It\u2019s what redefines love,\u201d he said.",
      "Hodge says being a dad was one of the ways that helped him authentically portray his character on screen. The other? He says understanding what drove the detective\u2019s everyday life.",
      "\u201cI was stepping into honesty, and all I had to do was keep remembering what Alex Cross\u2019 \u2018why\u2019 was with whatever situation he stepped into,\u201d the actor tells TODAY.com.",
      "\"We didn't have to try for that. All we had to be aware of was making honest decisions and choices,\u201d he says.",
      "The Prime series also stars Isaiah Mustafa as John Sampson, a fellow detective and longtime friend of Alex Cross. The Sampson character has made several appearances in the James Patterson novels but has seldom been brought to the screen.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Mustafa opened up about bringing his character's close friendship with Cross to the screen.",
      "\u201cI looked at the relationship that Sampson had with Alex, and I let that inform me as to who Sampson was and how deep his character was, how much love he had for his partner,\u201d Mustafa says. \u201cSo to me, that was the through line. To show how much heart this character had and what he was willing to do to make sure his partner, his brother, lived up to his higher power.\u201d",
      "The backdrop of Washington D.C. also serves as an important component of this new retelling of the Alex Cross story. Hodge explains that in the show, \u201cD.C. stands as its own character.\u201d",
      "The star says that the show attempts to go beyond the political significance of nation\u2019s capital by tapping into the culture of the people that make up the city\u2019s heart.",
      "\u201cSomething that was really important to Ben was that we really bring out the flavor of D.C.\u2019s culture. You\u2019ve only really seen D.C. from the political side, the White House, the monuments,\u201d Hodge explains. \u201cWe owe it to the culture to highlight them in a celebratory way.\u2019"

      "From the moment he arrives home, Drew Scott says, he plays a \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo?\u201d-like game with son Parker and his 5-month-old daughter, Piper, both of whom he shares with wife Linda Phan.",
      "\u201cTheir playroom is up on the upper level, and then there\u2019s the living room \u2026 so whenever I come home, because I give Linda a heads-up when I\u2019m almost home, inevitably, they\u2019re at one of the windows,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s just, for me, is always a sweet thing.\u201d",
      "But Drew Scott says Parker is the brains behind the adorable operation.",

So if I\u2019m looking closely, I\u2019ll find him,\u201d he describes. \u201cAnd he\u2019s tapping on the window, it's this little soft tap. And then as soon as he sees me, he starts to wave the hand.\u201d",

      "\u201cBut you do kind of feel you wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing as a kid?\u201d Drew Scott asks his twin.",
      "\u201cOne hundred percent I would have done the same thing,\u201d the interior designer quickly responds.",
      "On Nov. 8, Drew Scott shared a glimpse at how his two young ones wait for him by the window on Instagram, with the caption, \u201cComing home to these cuties makes every day better.\u201d His brother cheekily responded in the comments, \u201cAre they watching for uncle Jonathan?\u201d with a heart-eyes emoji at the end of his message.",
      "It's no secret how much Jonathan Scott loves being an uncle. After Drew Scott announced Parker's birth in June 2022, his twin shared a sweet tribute to Parker on Instagram.",
      "\"Get ready\u2026 I\u2019m gonna spoil you,\" he penned, in part.",
      "The spoiling seemed to work, as Drew Scott tells TODAY.com that Parker can\u2019t get enough of his uncle when he comes over.",
      "\u201cHe knows Uncle Jonathan. Like, when they\u2019re over for dinner, every five minutes, Parker is like, \u2018Hi, Uncle Jonathan,\u2019\u201d Drew Scott explains.",

      "The upcoming film, set to hit theaters Nov. 22, is the first of a two-part release and focuses on the relationship between Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo) and Glinda (Ariana Grande) \u2014 sorry, Galinda \u2014 during their time at Shiz University.",
      "During one scene, \"there was not a dry eye\" in the audience, Hoda Kotb told Erivo and Grande in an interview that aired on TODAY Nov. 14.",
      "The party scene, set at the Ozdust Ballroom, marks a turning point for Erivo and Grande's characters' friendship, after Elphaba is the subject of ridicule. Filming the moment was just as emotional as watching it, Erivo said.",
      "\u201cIt was a really big day,\u201d Erivo said. \u201cSometimes painful. Sometimes joyous. It took a lot of heart because everything is out there for everyone to see. It\u2019s a very vulnerable space to walk into.\u201d",
      "Elphaba and Glinda perform an emotionally-charged dance sequence during the ballroom scene. Erivo told Hoda and Savannah Guthrie that the cast provided a \u201cwall of protection\u201d during that moment.",
      "\"I\u2019m so grateful to have been able to do that and walk through any of the little wounds that I have, and the little wounds that Elphaba has, and to sort of put everything on display,\u201d Erivo said.",
      "Grande explained that the scene in the movie lasts 10 minutes, and each time they filmed it, the scene was performed in full. During each take of that \"12-hour day,\" Grande said, \u201cyou could hear a pin drop.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery (supporting actor) in the room ... every dancer, everyone was holding it with us,\u201d Grande said. \u201cAnd I think all of our hearts are still in that room a little bit.\u201d",

      "\"We were just hugging her and saying, \u2018I think it\u2019s time for bed,'\" Grande said.",
      "To play Elphaba, Erivo said she had to learn to wear her vulnerabilities on her sleeve, a contrast to her typical \u201ccaretaker\u201d role in real life.",
      "\u201cAll of (Elphaba's) vulnerabilities kind of needed to be on the outside \u2014 it\u2019s what she leads with,\u201d Erivo said. \u201cEven though there\u2019s sort of a thin veneer holding it together and assurance, there\u2019s still this feeling of not really being sure, not really knowing herself.\u201d",
      "In order to be present and vulnerable, Erivo and Grande discussed \"taking care of each other\" before filming.",
      "\u201cWe had never met before this. And then when we found out we were cast, we took some time together, sat on my floor in my house, chatted. And it was easy,\u201d Erivo said of their first time meeting.",
      "\u201cAnd we did have a very real conversation at the very beginning about taking care of each other,\u201d Grande added. \u201cAnd if something\u2019s up, tell me.\u201d",

      "The \"Fuller House\" star, who famously played Uncle Joey, noticed his first symptoms a little over a month ago, when he came down with a cold. In the past, he'd noticed the lymph nodes in his neck or armpits would swell when he was sick. This time, though, he felt surprised to discover a golf-ball sized lump in his groin within a week of falling ill.",
      "\u201cIt swelled up immediately,\" Coulier, 65, tells TODAY.com in a phone interview. \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, I\u2019m either really sick, or my body\u2019s really reacting to something.\u2019\u201d",
      "Worried, he visited his doctors who ran a variety of tests, including bloodwork, EKG, and PET and CT scans. While everything appeared to be normal, the doctors biopsied the lymph node just to be safe. Coulier soon learned why his lymph node became so enlarged.",
      "\u201c(My doctors) said, \u2018Hey, we wish we had better news, but you have non-Hodgkin lymphoma, B-cell lymphoma,\u2019\u201d Coulier recalls. \u201cIt was a shock.\u201d",
      "Despite his cancer diagnosis, Coulier is still finding joy in life.",
      "\u201cMy joke is that in four short weeks I\u2019ve gone from a Virgo to a Cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to retain a sense of reality but also a sense of humor about it.\u201d",
      "Dave Coulier diagnosed with Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma",
      "When Coulier felt under the weather a little over a month ago and noticed a swollen lymph node in his groin, he felt puzzled.",
      "\"The onset of this growing lymphoma in my groin area was very quick. So I said, 'Something's not right,'\" he recalled to Hoda during his Nov. 13 appearance on TODAY.",
      "Coulier visited his doctor, who ordered a battery of tests.",
      "\u201cThey said, \u2018Yeah, we need to take a serious look at this.\u2019 And so, we did blood tests,\u201d he says. \u201cBlood tests came back great. My EKG, everything great. Heart, everything perfect.\u201d",
      "But his doctors felt worried by how quickly the lump grew and ordered more advanced imaging before eventually wanting a sample of it for testing.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019d like to either remove this or biopsy it,\u2019\u201d Coulier recalls his doctors telling him. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, why don\u2019t we just remove it and biopsy it at the same time?\u2019\u201d",
      "Three days later, Coulier received the news from his doctor that he had B-cell lymphoma, a type of cancer that develops in B-lymphocytes, according to the American Cancer Society. B-cell lymphomas account for the vast majority of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Every year, more than 80,000 Americans are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",
      "\u201cThe first thing I said to them was, \u2018Wait a minute \u2014 cancer?\u2019\u201d he Coulier. \u201c(I was) feeling like I got punched in the stomach because it never happens to you. You always hear about it happening to someone else.\u201d",
      "Hearing the news was even harder because his wife, Melissa Coulier, wasn\u2019t at home.",
      "\u201cI was just contemplating, \u2018How do I tell her?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I told her, of course, she thought I was joking.\u201d",
      "After he reassured her that he was not joking, Melissa \u201corganized (his) entire life, from nutrition to the doctor\u2019s appointments to the pills.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s got stuff color-coded,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty great.\u201d",
      "To understand what stage of cancer he had, Coulier\u2019s doctors took a bone marrow sample.",
      "\u201cThey wanted to see if (the cancer had) moved on to any major organs or my blood or bones or anything,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was pins and needles for a few days because I didn\u2019t know what stage it was or if it had progressed.\u201d",
      "Yet at some point, Coulier started feeling a sort of acceptance.",
      "\u201cI told Melissa I don\u2019t know why, but I (am) OK with whatever the news (is) going to be no matter how devastating. \u2026 I can\u2019t explain where that came from,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had an incredible life. I\u2019ve had the most amazing people in my life. This has been an extraordinary journey, and I\u2019m OK if this is the end of the journey.\u201d",
      "A few days later, he learned he had Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",
      "Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma survival rate",
      "Stage 3 non-Hodgkin lymphoma means the cancer has not spread outside the lymphatic system, according to the American Cancer Society. The five-year survival rate for B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has not spread widely is about 74%, per ACS.",
      "\u201c(Stage 3) doesn\u2019t sound great,\" Coulier says, but because it hasn't spread to his bone marrow, doctors told him his curability rate is upwards of 90%.",
      "\"It's very treatable,\" he said on TODAY.",
      "Starting chemotherapy",
      "Doctors wanted Coulier to start chemotherapy promptly, and he underwent another surgery to have his chemotherapy port, which delivers the medication, placed.",
      "Leading up to his first treatment, Coulier faced his fear of the unknowns of cancer.",
      "\u201cYou hear chemo, and it scares the daylights out of you,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first round was pretty intense because you don\u2019t know what to expect. You don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to feel. Is this going to hit me immediately? Is it going to be devastating? Am I going to walk out of here?\u201d",
      "As \u201ca preemptive strike,\u201d Coulier shaved his head, which he jokes makes him \u201clook like a baby bird.\u201d The last time he was bald was when he shaved his head during the \u201cFull House\u201d series wrap, getting rid of the mullet he sported for many years.",
      "Coulier felt better than expected after his first round of chemotherapy. In total, he\u2019ll have six rounds every 21 days and should be finished with treatment by February 2025. Following treatment, he expects a \u201ctotal remission.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a roller coaster. There (are) days where I feel unbelievable,\u201d he says. \u201cThen there\u2019s other days where \u2026 I\u2019m just going to lay down and let this be what it\u2019s going to be.\u201d",
      "Still he's been able to maintain a positive outlook as he navigates treatment.",
      "\u201cThis is a journey,\u201d Coulier told Hoda. \u201cThis is a bit of a battle and you\u2019re going to need to be on your game.\u201d",
      "When Coulier feels good, he takes advantage of it. He\u2019s been recording episodes of the podcast \u201cFull House Rewind\u201d with his new co-host Marla Sokoloff, who played Gia Mahan on \u201cFull House\u201d and \u201cFuller House.\u201d And he recently skated with the Detroit Red Wings alumni \u2014 though he can\u2019t play hockey as it could damage his chemotherapy port. At the end of this week, John Stamos will visit him following his second round of chemotherapy.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have so many laughs. We\u2019re going to have so much fun,\u201d Coulier says. \u201cI said, \u2018It could be \u2018Weekend at Bernie\u2019s\u2019 if I\u2019m just out of it.\u2019 And (Stamos) said, \u2018That\u2019s OK. I\u2019ll carry you around.\u2019\u201d",
      "Coulier feels grateful for his \u201cincredible wife\u201d and \u201cincredible friends\u201d supporting him through his cancer diagnosis and treatment.",
      "\u201cThey all rallied around this, and a couple of comments that I\u2019ve heard are, \u2018Dave, you\u2019re not letting us worry about this very much,\u2019\u201d Coulier says. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to. I want us to have happy times and we\u2019ll get through this.\u201d",
      "Since his diagnosis, Coulier has learned that \u201che\u2019s strong enough to know (his) weaknesses,\u201d and he understands when to ask for help.",
      "Raising awareness",
      "Sadly, Coulier has plenty of experience with cancer.",
      "\u201cI lost my sister Sharon at 36 years old, breast cancer. I lost my niece Shannon at 29 years old, breast cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cI lost my mom, and now my sister Karen has cancer. So, over the years I\u2019ve seen what the women in my family have gone through, and it\u2019s been not only an awakening but a learning process.\u201d",
      "While it\u2019s been tough watching cancer affect his family so dramatically, the actor has grown from it.",
      "\u201cWhen I was diagnosed, all of those memories came back of what they went through and so many hospital visits and sitting bedside and talking and having conversations and watching them leave the planet,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat they went through is 10 times harder than what I\u2019m going through. So, if I can be one-tenth as strong as they were, I\u2019m going to be fine.\u201d",
      "His family also taught him to embrace joy, and that has helped him maintain a positive outlook.",
      "\u201cMy mom, my sister and my niece were laughing until the day they died,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a real inspiration for me to just remember that there\u2019s a lot of happiness.\u201d",
      "Coulier\u2019s looking forward to the future. His son, Luc, and his wife, Alex, are expecting a baby boy in March, and Coulier\u2019s excited to become a grandfather and anticipates lots of flights from Michigan to Los Angeles to spend time with his family.",
      "Coulier felt compelled to share his story to raise awareness of cancer and encourage others to undergo screening for it.",
      "\u201cThe one thing that just kept presenting itself to me was to tell other people about it. Talk to them about getting something as simple as pre-screening or a breast exam, mammogram, a colonoscopy or a prostate exam,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a really simple thing to do and it can add years to your life.\u201d"

    "published": "Tue, 12 Nov 2024 19:00:56 GMT",
    "summary": "As part of performing on TODAY's Citi Concert Series, Grammy winner Keith Urban sits down to answer eight questions for TODAY's \"8 Before 8\" original series.",
    "story": [
      "Despite the chilly weather, Keith Urban brought a dose of Australian sunshine to the TODAY plaza.",
      "Just days after his 57th birthday, Urban visited TODAY on Oct. 30 to close out the Citi Concert Series with a high-energy set filled with guitar solos, new hits and crowd-pleasing classics.",
      "Since he moved to Nashville in 1992 to pursue his country music dreams, Urban has released hit albums like clockwork, and he isn't slowing down anytime soon.",
      "His 11th studio album, \u201cHigh,\u201d came out Sept. 20, and in December, Urban will embark on a tour that spans from Las Vegas to South Australia.",
      "The road to his latest album wasn't entirely straightforward: Urban wrote an album titled \"615\" before shelving the project and going back to the drawing board for \"High.\"",
      "When asked by TODAY.com why he chose to scrap \"615,\" his answer is simple: \"I didn't like it.\"",
      "In contrast to the more somber tone of \u201c615,\u201d Urban describes his new music on \"High\" as \u201ceuphoric.\"",
      "The album's title has a variety of interpretations, but Urban links it to the energy he feels when performing onstage.",
      "\"Playing live is such a high for me,\" Urban told the TODAY co-hosts. \"Even out on the plaza this morning \u2014 it was amazing energy.\"",
      "Onstage at the plaza, his enthusiasm was contagious.",
      "\u201cAll right, let\u2019s play a little!\u201d he said to the crowd, eliciting cheers.",
      "His four-song set on TODAY had something for every fan, including the upbeat tune \"Chuck Taylors,\" soulful ballad \"Messed Up As Me,\" and one of his greatest hits \u2014 \u201cSomewhere In My Car.\u201d",
      "Offstage, Urban is equally as known for his charm as he is for his performing prowess. Savannah Guthrie called him one of the \u201cbest, nicest, coolest guests that we have\u201d during the singer's spot on the show.",
      "Urban maintained his good humor throughout a series of early morning interview questions for TODAY\u2019s original video series \u201c8 before 8.\"",
      "Here's what Urban had to say about his latest album, his personal guitar heroes and his favorite Australian animal.",
      "What inspired you to title your new album \"High\"?",
      "I called the latest album \u201cHigh\u201d because it was a good, strong, simple, euphoric word that has a lot of interpretations, which I also liked. Everybody gets to that place differently, but it\u2019s definitely the destination, and the record has a feeling of euphoria.",
      "Do you see yourself releasing any of the scrapped songs from \u201c615\u201d in the future?",
      "So, I made an album called \u201c615,\u201d and there were four songs that I took off that record which made it onto \u201cHigh.\u201d The rest of them, right now, they\u2019re out in the front yard, up on blocks with grass growing around them. So we\u2019ll see what happens.",
      "Who would you put on your Mount Rushmore of guitarists?",
      "Well, first of all, I\u2019m going to need more than four faces, probably. (Jimi) Hendrix, No. 1 for sure. No. 2 is always hotly contested: Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Angus Young. I could go on and on. It\u2019s too many, way too many.",
      "Where is the most unusual place you've performed?",
      "The most unusual place I\u2019ve performed? On the baggage carousel at an airport on the little carpeted strip in between where the bags go around. Yeah, totally humiliating.",
      "What\u2019s your most fun song to perform onstage?",
      "All of them, because I feel really grateful that I don\u2019t have to do a song that I don\u2019t like. I feel really, really lucky that that\u2019s happened to me: to have such a long career and have certain songs like \u201cBlue Ain\u2019t Your Color,\u201d or \u201cSomebody Like You,\u201d or some of these songs, that I couldn\u2019t not do them. But I love them just as much as I did when I recorded them.",
      "When did your iconic hairstyle become part of your look?",
      "I've never decided to make hair a part of my look. God bless my mom. I got my mom\u2019s hair, and my dad really didn\u2019t have much, and I\u2019m grateful that I got her gene. Go, mom.",
      "From LL Cool J: How have you maintained your long career?",
      "That's a great question. First of all, right back at you, dude \u2014\u00a0been around a long time, high level. Same answer you\u2019d probably have: passion, hunger, curiosity.",
      "I love playing music just as much as I did when I was sitting in my bedroom at 6 years old learning to play guitar. I don\u2019t feel any different. I\u2019m just as excited to write the next song, put on the next tour, make another album \u2014 like, literally giddy with excitement to do that. That\u2019s never changed. And that could have worked or not worked, as far as staying relevant or being able to have songs that connect. I\u2019ve just been really blessed and lucky, and the harder I\u2019ve worked, the luckier I\u2019ve become.",
      "Rapid fire round:",
      "There\u2019s too many! I do love In-N-Out. I do love Chick-fil-A. ... I'm going to say In-N-Out is my favorite. Yeah, period.",
      "Oh, Sydney summer. Nashville winters are brutal. January is like Monday. February is like Tuesday. March is like a Wednesday. And slowly, as you can see, you\u2019re getting towards the weekend in Nashville, and the summer is like Friday, Saturday, Sunday \u2014 perfect.",
      "Electrifying.",
      "A wombat! I love wombats."

    "summary": "Gillian Anderson did an interview with her former \"X-Files\" co-star David Duchovny on his \"Fail Better\" podcast about the \"tension\" in their relationship.",
    "story": [
      "David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson acknowledged there was \"a lot of tension\" between them on \"The X-Files\" that resulted in the co-stars not speaking for weeks off camera while working on the hit show.",
      "Anderson, 56, spoke to Duchovny, 64, on the Nov. 12 episode of his \"Fail Better\" podcast, with the two revisiting their time together on the hit Fox show that ran from 1993-2002, spawned two movies, and revivals in 2016 and 2018. Duchovny played FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder, and Anderson played his partner, Special Agent Dana Scully, in the science fiction series about unsolved cases involving the paranormal.",
      "Anderson said she came on Duchovny's podcast to have \"a conversation that I don't feel like we ever had,\" which led to him reflecting on shooting the show together during the height of its popularity in the '90s.",
      "\"The part of this conversation that is the trickiest part for me is, I guess I would talk about like my failure of friendship, or my failure of companionship,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"There was a long time working on the show where we were just not even dealing with one another off camera,\" he added. \"And there was a lot of tension, which didn\u2019t matter, apparently, for the work, because we\u2019re both f------ crazy, I guess, that we could just go out there and do what we needed to do.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s crazy that we were able to present on camera the various feelings and emotions and attraction and all that kind of stuff, but then not speak to each other for weeks at a time or whatever,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know, but I could have handled myself better,\" Duchovny said.",
      "Duchovny also opened up about leaving the show in the early 2000s and his emotions after Anderson left \"The X-Files\" following its revival in 2018.",
      "\"I never apologized to you for that,\" he told Anderson about his original departure from the show. \"I don\u2019t know that I even talked to you about it, and then you said you weren\u2019t going to do the show anymore, like, the last time we did it (in 2018). And I know that hurt my feelings.\"",
      "\"Oh, I didn't know,\" Anderson said.",
      "\"I get it, you know, like, OK, and I support it, whatever it is you want to do, but I was like, 'Oh, she\u2019s quitting me,' you know?\" Duchovny said. \"She doesn\u2019t like working with me anymore. It was like, that little kid inside is going, 'Hey!' And then I was like, but I didn\u2019t say anything to her back in the day.\"",
      "Later in their conversation, Anderson returned to the moment Duchovny left in 2001.",
      "\"We never talked about it,\" she said. \"I don\u2019t think I ever blamed you. ... I don\u2019t think I blamed you at all. I don\u2019t think I was upset.\"",
      "\"Well, thanks a lot,\" Duchovny said.",
      "After Duchovny departed, Anderson considered following him out the door.",
      "\"There was a point, I mean, for me at that time, it was, 'Can I too?'\" she said. \"At first I thought, 'Well, then we\u2019re both going to because clearly I can\u2019t go on without him, so surely I\u2019ll be able to.' And then they started talking about, 'Well, if you stay on, you can actually make some good money.'\"",
      "Duchovny also recalled a \"dysfunctional\" moment between the two in the midst of their stardom on the show.",
      "\"It was some Emmys, and it was the day after, and I had a private plane, and I was giving you a ride,\" he said. \"And you were late, and I was so angry. And then we sat on this private plane, flying to Vancouver from LA, not talking.",
      "\"And you wrote me a letter,\" he continued. \"So you\u2019re just like 6 feet away from me, writing a letter to me, and it\u2019s a beautiful letter. I don\u2019t remember it exactly, but it was appreciative, and it was like it was all the things that I wanted to hear. But it\u2019s just amazing that we couldn\u2019t just have that conversation. The fact that it\u2019s a private plane, it\u2019s just all ridiculous.\"",
      "\"I had no memory that we were even on a private plane together, let alone, yeah, I wrote you a letter on one,\" Anderson said. \"Interesting.\"",
      "Duchovny also remembered a moment with \"The X-Files\" creator Chris Carter amid some tension in the first season.",
      "\"I think we were kind of butting heads so early on in the first season that Chris asked us if we would go into fake couples (therapy). Like, would we go into TV character couple therapy? I remember sitting in his office with you, and Chris is like, 'Yeah, do you guys want to go into therapy.' And I was like, 'You mean as Mulder and Scully?' I\u2019m confused. I remember that.\"",
      "Another source of strife came in 2016 when Anderson fought for pay equity with Duchovny for the revival of the show. She told The Daily Beast at the time that she was only offered half the salary of Duchovny for the 2016 return and had spent three years during the original run of \"The X-Files\" trying to achieve pay equity with her co-star.",
      "\"That whole pay equity thing, that\u2019s in our past as well,\" Duchovny said. \"I was part of that.",
      "\"Selfishly, back then, I thought I was like being attacked,\" he continued. \"I thought, 'Oh, I\u2019m being attacked for being offered more money.'\"",
      "\"Attacked by who?\" Anderson asked.",
      "\"The world,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"What, that they blamed you in some way?\" Anderson said.",
      "\"In a way,\" Duchovny said.",
      "\"Oh really, I didn\u2019t know that,\" Anderson said. \"I'm sorry. That's interesting that I wasn't paying attention to that side of it.\"",
      "\"Well, I didn't make you pay attention to it,\" Duchovny said.",
      "During their talk, the two also delved into Anderson's childhood and latest ventures, including her new book, \"Want,\" a collection of anonymous sexual fantasies submitted by women from around the world."

      "Where is Roshanak Molaei? The hashtag is circulating in Iran after the 25-year-old woman disappeared in Tehran after being taken into custody by police, raising concerns about her treatment as the country continues to crack down on women who defy mandatory hijab laws.",
      "The events that led to Roshanak Molaei's arrest did not start as a protest.",
      "A surveillance video shows the woman walking along a Tehran sidewalk on Nov. 1, before a man dressed in a military uniform approaches her from behind on a motorcycle.",
      "It is not clear from the angle of the footage whether the man verbally or physically accosted her, but according to the nearly 2-minute video that Molaei later posted to her X account, she reacted by grabbing the motorcyclist in a heated exchange that drew several bystanders. The man then drove off.",
      "Molaei captioned the video: \u201cA scene from being a woman in Iran.\u201d",
      "Her account was swiftly taken down.",
      "Hengaw, a Norway-based human rights organization that monitors violations in Kurdistan and Iran, also reposted a version of the video on X.",
      "According to a statement by the organization, Molaei had previously argued on social media with a government official over mandatory hijab laws. The incident captured by the surveillance camera shows Molaei without a hijab.",
      "Iranian police confirmed in a statement that there was a \u201cconfrontation between a young woman and a motorcyclist\u201d on Nov. 1, adding that \u201cinitial investigations indicate that the motorcyclist harassed the young woman.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth parties have been referred to judicial authorities,\" the police statement said. \"The motorcyclist will face investigation for both harassment and traffic violations. The woman is being prosecuted for not observing mandatory hijab laws.\u201d",
      "According to Hengaw, on Nov. 2 Molaei was \"summoned by FATA,\" the Iranian cyberpolice, about her post, and was arrested the following day.",
      "\"It remains unclear in which prison she is currently being held,\" a representative from Hengaw told NBC News.",
      "\"Since her detention, there has been limited information regarding her health and conditions of imprisonment. The lack of transparent information about the situation of political prisoners in Iran remains a widespread concern,\" the Hengaw representative said.",
      "This is not the first time Molaei is arrested for opposing Iran\u2019s mandatory hijab laws, according to Hengaw. In 2022, she was arrested during the \u201cWoman, Life, Freedom\u201d protests, a series of peaceful demonstrations triggered by the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody.",
      "Amini had been arrested in part for not wearing a hijab correctly, with the U.N. asserting that she was killed \u201cas a result of beatings\u201d by Iranian authorities. Iran has denied the charges, saying she died of pre-existing medical conditions.",
      "Following her arrest in September 2022, Molaei was sentenced to over six years in prison but released in February 2023 after being granted amnesty, according to Hengaw.",
      "Molaei's new arrest is yet another incident fueling alarm from international human rights organizations. In a 2024 report on the situation of human rights in Iran the U.N. \"raised pressing concerns\" about the \"deteriorating human rights situation for women and girls\" across the country.",
      "\"Roshanak\u2019s case exemplifies the systematic oppression faced by women when they seek to claim their basic rights and personal freedoms,\" Hengaw said in a statement.",
      "\"Women in Iran who publicly oppose mandatory hijab and other discriminatory laws face immense risks, including imprisonment, intimidation, and mistreatment.\"",
      "A day before Molaei's arrest, a young woman was detained after stripping to her underwear in an apparent protest at the Olum Tahghighat branch of the Islamic Azad University in Tehran, state media reported. The woman was transferred to a psychiatric hospital, raising concerns for her safety. There is no specific information on the woman\u2019s condition, but Amnesty International has found evidence that people detained in psychiatric wards have been subject to torture, beatings and other mistreatment.",
      "The security agents who enforce hijab laws, informally called morality police, have recently started easing public confrontations with women over the headscarves, following the election of reformist president Masoud Pezeshkian who campaigned on opposing these police patrols.",
      "However, locals say the agents continue to be present in the streets but have been instructed to issue warnings rather than take immediate enforcement actions. Bystanders are discouraged or prevented from recording, restricting the how many of these interactions appear on social media.",
      "In addition, the government has set up new centers called \u201canti-unveiling clinics,\u201d where women who choose not to wear the hijab may be referred to for a program described as \u201ctherapy,\u201d to encourage compliance of hijab laws."

      "\u201cDressing down ticks two boxes \u2014 less extravagant and more \u2018normal\u2019. But, some members of the public actively want their royals to be as glamorous\u00a0as possible, so it\u2019s a fine line,\u201d she added.",

      "The exact origins of the necklace have not been recorded, with Sotheby\u2019s stressing it does not know for certain.",
      "Despite this, it said it believed that the necklace\u00a0\"could only have been created for royalty or a high-ranking aristocrat.\" It pointed to its nearly 500 diamonds arranged in three rows that trail on either side into a tassel.",
      "\u201cIt stands head and shoulders above all other documented Royal and Imperial jewels of the period,\u201d Andres White Correal, head of royal and noble jewels at Sotheby\u2019s said in a statement before the auction.",
      "\u201cThis rare and important diamond jewel is a sublime survivor from the opulent court life of the Georgian era, defined by its unrivalled pomp and splendor; it is arguably one of the most magnificent and intact Georgian jewels in private hands,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cIt was an electric night,\u201d White Correal told the Reuters news agency after the sale.",
      "\u201cThere is obviously a niche in the market for historical jewels with fabulous provenances. People are not only buying the object, they are buying all the history that is attached to it,\u201d he said.",
      "That history centers on Louis XV, the king of France, who commissioned a lavish diamond necklace for his mistress, Madam Du Barry, in 1722 \u2014 two years before he died of smallpox.",
      "That meant he could not pay for and receive the necklace, leaving the jewelers out of pocket.",
      "Marie Antoinette, the country's new queen consort, declined to buy the necklace despite her reputation for extravagance. Noblewoman Jeanne de La Motte then, so the story goes, posed as the queen and convinced an out-of-favor cardinal to give her the lavish necklace as a gift before absconding with the lucrative diamonds.",
      "A subsequent trial found the queen innocent, but the same could not be said of the court of public opinion. The French Revolution followed years later.",
      "It is unclear exactly how the necklace ended up in the hands of a British aristocratic family, the Pagets.",
      "The Marchioness of Anglesey, a member of the Paget family, wore the necklace at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953.",
      "According to Sotheby\u2019s, the family parted with the piece after it was acquired by an \u201cimportant Asian private collection in the 1970s.\u201d",
      "The necklace has been in private hands ever since.",
      "In 2022, bracelets that once belonged to\u00a0Marie Antoinette sold for more than $8 million at\u00a0auction,\u00a0also in Geneva."

      "LONDON \u2014 Animal campaigners are calling for a ban on the public sale of fireworks after a baby red panda was thought to have died from stress related to the noise.",
      "The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, a conservation charity that runs Edinburgh Zoo, said Wednesday that it was likely that Roxie, a 3-month-old red panda kit, \"died due to stress caused by fireworks being let off across the city centre.\"",
      "Fireworks are set off across the United Kingdom on and around Nov. 5, known as Bonfire Night\u00a0or Guy Fawkes Night, in celebration of the failure of a plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament by a group of dissident Catholics in 1605.",

      "\"We support calls from animal welfare charities to ban the sale of fireworks to the public, with only light displays being permitted at organized events,\" Supple said.",
