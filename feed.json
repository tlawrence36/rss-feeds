      "Clem Burke, whose versatile drumming propelled the iconic rock group Blondie during its decades of music that spanned from new-wave punk to disco-infused tunes, has died",
      "Clem Burke, whose versatile drumming propelled the iconic rock group Blondie during its decades performing everything from new-wave punk to disco-infused tunes, has died. He was 70.",
      "The band said in a statement on its website Monday that he died from cancer but no additional details were provided.",
      "\u201cClem was not just a drummer; he was the heartbeat of Blondie,\u201d the band said in a statement. \u201cHis talent, energy, and passion for music were unmatched, and his contributions to our sound and success are immeasurable.\u201d",
      "The self-proclaimed \u201crock & roll survivalist\u201d started playing the drums when he was 14 in his school orchestra but was kicked out for playing too loud, according to Blondie\u2019s website. In the 1970\u2019s, he answered a band's ad in the Village Voice seeking a \u201cfreak energy\u201d rock drummer, kicking off his decades-long career with lead singer Debbie Harry and the rest of his Blondie bandmates.",
      "The band recorded its first album in 1976 and by the following year was touring with such icons as Iggy Pop and David Bowie. It became known as the most commercially successful band to emerge from a fertile New York rock scene that also produced Talking Heads and the Ramones.",
      "In 2006 Burke and the other original members of Blondie were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame after selling more than 42 million records, according to Blondie's website.",
      "During the late 1970s and early \u201980s, the band had eight Top 40 hits, including four No. 1s: \u201cHeart of Glass,\u201d \u201cCall Me,\u201d \u201cThe Tide Is High\u201d and \u201cRapture,\u201d which is regarded as the first No. 1 hit to feature rap. There\u2019s also a five-track 1975 album demo that includes \u201cPlatinum Blonde,\u201d a sort of band mission statement. But Burke\u2019s mark was especially solidified with his rapid, powerful drumming at the start of \u201cDreaming\u201d in 1979.",
      "In 2022, after unearthing a New Wave treasure trove of reel-to-reel tapes, cassettes and records, the band created the box set \u201cBlondie: Against the Odds, 1974-1982,\u201d with 124 tracks and 36 previously unissued recordings, demos, outtakes and remixed versions of Blondie\u2019s initial six studio albums.",
      "Burke reflected on the discovery in an Associated Press article: \u201cWe never would have thought that we would still be here today. Looking back at our archives, it\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d",
      "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame described Burke in a post Monday on the social platform X as \u201ca versatile and distinctive drummer who played exactly what each song required \u2013 and, when called for, let loose with blistering punk rock energy.\u201d",

      "The sex abuse trial of former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor Nathan Chasing Horse in Nevada has again been postponed",
      "LAS VEGAS -- The sex abuse trial of former \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d actor Nathan Chasing Horse in Nevada has again been postponed.",
      "A judge on Monday moved the start of the trial in state court in Las Vegas to Aug. 4. The 48-year-old had been scheduled to stand trial next week on charges that he sexually abused Indigenous women and girls for years in the Las Vegas area.",
      "Craig Mueller, Chasing Horse's lawyer, said in a motion filed Friday that he needs more time to prepare and interview witnesses. It's the latest in a series of delays since Chasing Horse was arrested and indicted in early 2023.",
      "Chasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 felonies, including sexual assault of a minor under 16, kidnapping and producing and possessing videos of child sexual abuse. If convicted of the sexual assault charges, he could face decades or life in prison.",
      "After starring as Smiles A Lot in the 1990 Oscar-winning film \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse began promoting himself as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies, authorities have said. He was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.",
      "Prosecutors say Chasing Horse used his position to gain access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since, but criminal proceedings were at a standstill for more than a year while Chasing Horse challenged his original indictment.",
      "It was eventually dismissed after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. The high court's order, however, left open the possibility for charges to be refiled, and prosecutors quickly took their case before another grand jury.",
      "Chasing Horse was again indicted in October. The indictment added new allegations that he filmed himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. Prosecutors have said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, was found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.",
      "His case has been unfolding at the same time lawmakers and prosecutors around the U.S. are funneling more resources into cases involving Native women, including human trafficking and killings.",

      "PEN America told The Associated Press on Monday that Ruffin will host the free expression organization's gala fundraiser on May 15. The comic had been scheduled as a featured speaker April 26 at the White House Correspondents Association' s annual dinner. But the WHCA rescinded the offer to Ruffin, a blunt critic of President Donald Trump, saying it wanted to focus on journalistic achievement.",
      "In a statement Monday, PEN co-interim CEO Clarisse Rosaz Shariyf praised Ruffin for her \u201cbrilliant social commentary, her satire and exceptional talent.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is truly emblematic of the talented creators who we need on stages and in writers\u2019 rooms during a time of unprecedented censorship in this country. We\u2019re both delighted and honored to have her with us,\" Shariyf added.",
      "PEN also announced Monday that Wesleyan University President Michael Roth will receive the PEN/Benenson Courage Award for \u201chis unwavering commitment to defending academic freedom, protecting protest rights, and resisting attempts to silence dissent in higher education.\u201d Roth has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration's threats to end research funding for Columbia University, Harvard University and other schools, with issues cited ranging from fighting antisemitism to whether transgender athletes can participate in sports.",
      "Ruffin, whose credits include writing for NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers, last year's host for the PEN gala, has said she was cut from the WCHA event after telling organizers that she had no intentions of being evenhanded. During a Daily Beast podcast last month, Ruffin said she was told \u201cyou need to be equal and be sure that you give it to both sides and I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen.'\"",
      "Taylor Budowich, a deputy chief of staff at the White House, has called Ruffin a \u201csecond-rate comedian.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- For 11 seasons, Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. has sat across from his guests on the popular PBS series \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d and led them through secrets in their family tree. On Tuesday, it's his turn.",
      "The Harvard scholar learns a long-buried puzzle about his great-great grandmother, Jane Gates, information which scrambles his ancestry and opens up a new branch that goes back to Ireland.",
      "\u201cI was moved to tears,\u201d Gates tells The Associated Press ahead of the airing. \u201cI used to pass her grave at the Gates' plot in Rose Hill Cemetery and I would say, \u2018Grandma, I\u2019m going to out you. I\u2019m going to tell the world your secret.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d is PBS\u2019s most-watched program on linear TV and the most-streamed non-drama program. Season 10 reached nearly 18 million people across linear and digital platforms and also received its first Emmy nomination.",
      "\u201cThe two subliminal messages of \u2019Finding Your Roots,' which are needed more urgently today than ever, is that what has made America great is that we\u2019re a nation of immigrants,\" says Gates. \u201cAnd secondly, at the level of the genome, despite our apparent physical differences, we\u2019re 99.99% the same.\u201d",
      "Season 11 has featured Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, Melanie Lynskey, chef Jose Andres, Sharon Stone and Amanda Seyfried, who learned why her paternal third-great-grandfather was murdered.",
      "Gates shares the last episode with Laurence Fishburne, who learns the identity of his biological father. It turns out both men adored jazz, which delighted Dyllan McGee, who helped create and produce \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt underscored how family connections can shape us, even unknowingly, and made me wonder if reconnecting with our past somehow affirms the significance of our own stories by showing us how much each individual on our tree shapes us even when we don\u2019t know it,\u201d she says.",
      "The series started in 2006 under the title \u201cAfrican American Lives,\u201d conceived by Gates in the middle of the night in his bathroom. He invited prominent Black celebrities and traced their family trees into slavery. When the paper trail ran out, they would use DNA to see which ethnic group they were from in Africa.",
      "Challenged by a viewer to open the show to non-Black celebrities, Gates agreed and the series was renamed \u201cFaces of America,\u201d which had to be changed again after the name was taken. Along the way, Gates had a crash course in DNA.",
      "\u201cFor a guy with a PhD in English literature, I think I can do pretty well on the AP genetics exam,\u201d he says, before proving it with a thorough explanation of autosomal DNA.",
      "Over the years, the show has delivered fascinating results, like when Natalie Morales discovered she\u2019s related to one of the legendary pirates of the Caribbean and when former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Andy Samberg found his biological grandmother and grandfather. It revealed that RuPaul and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker are cousins, as are Meryl Streep and Eva Longoria.",
      "Guests have included former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, designer Diane von Furstenberg and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d author George R. R. Martin.",
      "\u201cI always tell my guests that you\u2019re not responsible for the crazy things your ancestors did. I don\u2019t care what they did. Guilt is not inheritable,\u201d Gates says. \u201cYou have to understand how the people functioned in the past without judging them.\u201d",
      "He and his team \u2014 particularly genetic genealogist CeCe Moore \u2014 have found that traditional family stories passed down through the generations are often filled with a few lies, often to cover up bad behavior.",
      "\u201cI call it where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire. The stories are never accurate, but they\u2019re often close,\u201d says Gates. \u201cThere is a kernel of truth there.\u201d",
      "It took researchers four years to resolve the mystery of who was Gates' great-great grandfather, the man who impregnated Jane Gates. The story she told about her children's father turned out to be not correct.",
      "The researchers show him an 1888 obituary for her and a 1839 ad for her sale. Gates comments that he\u2019s seen a thousand bill of sales like it, but this hit differently. At the end, he looks again at a photo of Jane Gates. \u201cI see a lot of pain in those eyes and now I know why.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething changed for him that day,\" says McGee. \"I remember him calling me after the reveal saying, 'That was the best day of my life!' It was such a treat for the entire team to be able to give him the gift of a missing link in his family history that he has given hundreds of our guests.\u201d",
      "Gates is a huge advocate that everyone should have their family tree traced and pushes back against the idea that digging up the past is divisive.",
      "\u201cI believe that knowing about our ancestors is fundamental to knowing about ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only way to deal with the past is to know about the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of people who would pretend that the past is irrelevant and we need to look forward, William Faulkner wrote, \u2018The past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past,\u2019\u201d Gates adds. \u201cIt\u2019s still with us, shaping both who we are and the society and our norms under which we function.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Removing books from library shelves is no longer just a story of objections from a local community or an individual parent, the American Library Association says.",
      "In its new State of American Libraries Report released Monday, the ALA found more than 70% of attempted bans of a given title or titles come from organized groups and elected officials, and just 16% originated with a parent.",
      "The most commonly criticized books, including Maia Kobabe\u2019s \u201cGender Queer\u201d and the late Toni Morrison's \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d can be found on such websites as www.ratedbooks.org and through lists compiled by Moms for Liberty and other conservative activists.",
      "\u201cWe can trace many of the challenges to lists of books that have been distributed by Moms for Liberty and other groups,\" said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, who directs the association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.",
      "As part of its annual report, the ALA unveiled its list of the 10 most \u201cchallenged books\u201d of 2024, starting with George M. Johnson's \u201cAll Boys Aren't Blue,\u201d and also featuring \u201cGender Queer,\u201d \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d Stephen Chbosky's \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\u201d and John Green's \u201cLooking for Alaska.\u201d",

      "The ALA defines a challenge as a \u201cformal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that materials be removed because of content or appropriateness.\u201d The association, which compiles censorship data through media accounts and reports from librarians, has long believed the actual number of challenges is far higher than the numbers cited in its annual studies.",
      "The report comes at an especially perilous time for libraries. The Trump administration is implementing drastic cuts at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which already is canceling grants to state libraries.",
      "Bans have surged in recent years and several states, from Texas and Florida to Iowa and Utah, have passed laws restricting what school libraries can acquire. While the ALA is reporting a sharp drop in challenges in 2024, down to 821 attempts compared to 1,247 the year before, the number remains far higher than before 2021.",
      "And Caldwell-Stone doesn't believe censorship is declining. Libraries are now more likely to avoid stocking books that are controversial, or may be prohibited by law, she says.",
      "\u201cI spoke to a librarian from Texas who told me she was looking over a political book and wasn't sure if she could add it to the collection,\u201d Caldwell-Stone said. \u201cLibrarians don't want to get prosecuted or otherwise face legal trouble. A lot of librarians are operating under these kinds of threats.\u201d",

      "Regional Mexican music is crossing borders and going global",
      "MEXICO CITY -- At a Mexican military base, Captain Eduardo Barr\u00f3n picks up not a rifle but a microphone. Swaying boot-to-boot, he belts out a song as the sounds of trumpets and accordions roar from a band of a dozen camouflage-clad soldiers.",
      "The rhythmic style \u2014 known as a corrido \u2014 is recognizable to just about every soul in the Latin American nation of 130 million. But Barr\u00f3n\u2019s lyrics diverge sharply from those blaring on speakers across Mexico.",
      "\u201cI still remember the day I joined the military,\u201d he crooned. \u201cThis is a dream my soul longed for, and if I were to live another life, I\u2019d become a soldier again.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who performs under the name \u201cEddy Barr\u00f3n,\" began releasing music videos and songs on Spotify last year in coordination with the Mexican military. His lyrics extol the army\u2019s virtues, celebrate proud parents and honor the fallen.",
      "They stand in stark contrast to the controversial narco corridos, a subgenre that has sparked controversy as famed artists pay homage to cartel bosses, portraying them as rebels going against the system.",
      "Faced with the challenge of addressing a musical style that depicts cartel violence, local governments across Mexico have increasingly banned performances and pursued criminal investigations of bands and musicians. Mexico\u2019s president even vowed to reduce the popularity of narco corridos while promoting other, less violent musical styles.",
      "But Barr\u00f3n, 33, is taking a different approach. Instead of censorship, he wants to build upon the momentum with his own military corridos, an effort to both infuse the genre with more socially acceptable lyrics and recruit young people to the military.",
      "\u201cNarco life is in style and they make it sound really pretty \u2026 but the reality is different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing our part to invite young people to join this movement of positive music.\u201d",
      "Barron's military ballads are part of a wider government push spearheaded by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has proposed that the government promote corridos about \u201clove, falling out of love and peace.\u201d",
      "She even announced a government-sponsored Mexican music competition in the northern state of Durango showcasing music that avoids \u201cglorifying violence, drugs and discrimination against women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will completely change Mexican music,\u201d she said.",
      "But in a subculture long defined by resistance and putting words to the harsh realities facing the poor, the government's initiatives around the genre have been met with skepticism about official attempts to promote family-friendly narratives.",
      "\u201cI don't think using corridos as a way to incorporate other kinds of narratives, is a bad idea,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Valenzuela, a Tijuana sociologist who studies the genre. \u201cThere are a lot of songs that sing of peace and love. It\u2019s just that those aren\u2019t the ones that are turning out to be hits \u2026 because we\u2019re living in a moment of aggrieved youth.\u201d",
      "Corridos were born in the 19th century, their classical band instruments and the accordion rooted in German and Polish migration to Mexico. At a time of widespread illiteracy, they were used widely to pass on oral histories.",
      "The ballads took off during the Mexican revolution, when they were used to share stories of war heroes and glory from the conflict.",
      "That is why Barr\u00f3n says he didn\u2019t invent military corridos, but that he\u2019s simply bringing them back.",
      "\u201cCorridos come from the revolution, and we\u2019re doing the same thing as those soldiers and revolutionaries, albeit in a different age, but the result is the same,\u201d he said.",
      "The genre evolved over generations, from singing about smuggling tequila during the 1920\u2019s Prohibition era in corridos tequileros to grappling with the rising wave of cartel violence in Mexico with narco corridos.",
      "\u201cAll the big social issues are told through corridos,\u201d Valenzuela said. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor to speak about what we\u2019ve been living through.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n said he would play guitar with his father\u2019s Mexican regional music band as a teenager, and write his own music. He would bring his guitar to play on deployments after he joined the army at 20.",
      "In 2021, he said he began writing his own songs about his time in the military and singing with a military FX Band, named after the type of gun the military uses. But the music never went public.",
      "Around 2023, the genre exploded when artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano began to mix the classic style with trap music in what are known as corridos tumbados. That same year, Peso Pluma bested Taylor Swift as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "A year later, the Mexican army decided to post Barr\u00f3n's music under his artistic name.",
      "The music videos, which have clocked tens of thousands of views on YouTube alone, are layered with images of heavy duty weapons, the Mexican flag, barbed wire and Barr\u00f3n belting out in camouflage and infrared goggles pulled above his military helmet.",
      "Originally intended to entertain troops and boost military recruitment among young Mexicans, Barr\u00f3n's songs took on a different meaning amidst the renewed controversy that has come with the corridos boom.",
      "The musical style has long been criticized for romanticizing cartel violence, but has hit an inflection point in recent years.",
      "Mexican states have implemented performance bans, and prominent artists have received death threats, often claiming to be from rival cartels whose leaders are glorified in their music. And musicians have been forced to cancel shows due to concerns about potential violence.",
      "The controversy intensified last week, after the face of top cartel boss Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera was projected onto a large screen behind the band Los Alegres del Barranco at a music festival in the northern state of Jalisco. The incident, occurring shortly after Oseguera\u2019s cartel was linked to a ranch under investigation as a training camp and body disposal site in Jalisco, sent shockwaves across Mexico.",

      "Barr\u00f3n, who opposes a ban on corridos, believes the solution is to continue to sing cloaked in camouflage with the hopes of reclaiming the Mexican music from his childhood from the negative stereotypes that have grown to define it.",
      "He said the army is already planning to release new songs in the coming months.",
      "\"Sadly, we've been stuck with this label of corridos as negative music,\" he said. \u201cA better approach is to reclaim the genre and take a different path to shift the conversation.\u201d",

      "Hollywood megastar Tom Hardy has reunited with director Guy Ritchie 17 years after \u201cRocknRolla\u201d for a new TV series, \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tom Hardy has collected troves of knowledge and skill throughout his journey as an actor, forming a megastar career. But any education he received from director Guy Ritchie during their time on the 2008 \u201cRocknRolla\u201d film was gained from afar.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have very much to do with him ... the first time I worked with him. Gerard (Butler) was leading that film and in many elements, we were support staff,\u201d said Hardy. \"So, I got to experience being on the Guy Ritchie set, and it was a bit from a position of not being a lead, and that\u2019s a different responsibility.\u201d",
      "But time can bring people and experiences back around, especially in Hollywood. Since that film 17 years ago, Ritchie has transitioned into esteemed directorial status. And Hardy has morphed into a box office superstar with films like \u201cThe Dark Night\u201d as the imposing villain Bane, and the titular role for Marvel\u2019s \u201cVenom\u201d franchise. Now, the two have reunited for Ritchie\u2019s gritty, yet sophisticated series \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really keen to go back and work with him because he\u2019s a fellow Brit and he\u2019s done quite incredible work,\u201d explained Hardy. \u201cI wanted to go and play with him, actually, and see what that was like now I\u2019m older, and it was good fun.\u201d",
      "The Paramount+ original series follows Harry Da Souza (Hardy), an intimidating, yet calm fixer for a London-based crime family hoping to find the missing son of a rival faction to prevent a catastrophic gang war.",
      "How did Hardy prepare to play such a menacing, yet even-keeled character?",
      "\u201cNo acting required\u201d he said with a big laugh. \u201cJust turn up and, \u2018Oh, yeah, that makes sense\u2019 and say the lines. Don\u2019t bump into the furniture.\u201d",
      "The second episode of the 10-part \u201cMobLand\u201d series airs Sunday on Paramount+.",
      "The series was created by Ronan Bennett, known for popular crime shows like \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d and \u201cTop Boy,\u201d and written with playwright Jez Butterworth. Ritchie serves as executive producer and directed the first two episodes. The \u201cMobLand\u201d idea began as a spinoff from Showtime\u2019s popular \u201cRay Donovan\u201d series, before becoming a stand-alone show.",
      "Two-time Oscar-winner Helen Mirren stars as the devious Maeve, matriarch and manipulator of the crime family, while Pierce Brosnan plays her husband and mob leader, marking a reunion for the pair who worked on the 1980 film \u201cThe Long Good Friday.\u201d",
      "It may be hard to think of a role that Dame Mirren hasn\u2019t played, but she found one with \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are always characters out there that are going to take you by surprise and \u2026 I think, \u2019Oh my god, I\u2019ve never done anything like that before,\u201d said the \u201c1923\u201d star who believes the line between shooting film and TV is now nearly nonexistent. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the sort of beauties of my job, actually, is to constantly be entering into such very, very different worlds.\u201d",
      "Mirren said the opportunity to work with Hardy was intriguing.",
      "\u201cTom\u2019s involvement in it was one of the reasons I signed up because I\u2019ve admired his work over many years,\u201d Mirren said. \u201cDifferent actors, you can see, \u2019Oh, they\u2019re a great actor' \u2026 they can perform. But certain actors like Tom, it\u2019s an interior power that just communicates with the camera. And Tom\u2019s got that. You know what? It\u2019s called star power.\u201d",
      "The \u201cMobLand\u201d cast features Paddy Considine of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d fame, Joanne Froggatt, Lara Pulver, Anson Boon and Mandeep Dhillon. While this show technically reunites Mirren and Brosnan, they also shot the upcoming \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club\u201d film prior to this project.",
      "While much was unknown when Brosnan signed on, \u201cMobLand\u201d had all the right ingredients for the former James Bond to dive in, starting with Ritchie, who released his Netflix series \u201cThe Gentlemen\u201d last year.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s naughty. He\u2019s cheeky. He\u2019s bold,\u201d said Brosnan. \u201cI love his work. His movies. The way he\u2019s acquitted himself on the landscape of cinema. He\u2019s a unique talent all his own \u2026 so I said yes. I wanted to go back to London. I wanted to work.\"",
      "Next for Hardy is the crime drama film \u201cHavoc\u201d premiering later this month, and there's chatter of a potential sequel to his 2015 \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d A second season of \u201cTaboo\u201d is on the way \u2014 nearly a decade after its debut. What about a \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cVenom\u201d crossover? Hardy addressed the rumors that an alleged project fell apart, clarifying it was never in the works.",
      "\u201cPeople embellish a story. I just said I would have loved to work with \u2018Spider-Man,\u2019 but it never happened, which is a fact. It hasn\u2019t happened. And I\u2019m no longer working with \u2018Venom\u2019 \u2026 it is a shame because my kids would love to watch Venom and Spider-Man together,\u201d said Hardy. \u201cI would have liked that.\u201d",

They are part of a growing drama in the Asian entertainment world that raises questions about society\u2019s treatment of celebrities in crisis, with harsh media and online commentary amplifying their lowest moments.",
      "This week, South Korean actor Kim Soo-hyun publicly denied allegations that he dated the late actor Kim Sae-ron when she was under the age of sexual consent. His emotional press conference followed Kim Sae-ron\u2019s suicide in February, which reignited allegations that they were romantically involved.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the case.",
      "Kim Sae-ron was once one of South Korea's most promising film stars. She began acting at age 9 in the 2009 film \u201cA Brand New Life,\u201d which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. She gained further recognition with \u201cThe Man from Nowhere\u201d (2010) and \u201cA Girl at My Door\u201d (2014), also invited to Cannes.",
      "Her career halted in May 2022 after she crashed her car in Seoul while driving under the influence. Despite offering a public apology and reportedly paying compensation to shops that lost power because of the crash, she faced relentless negative attention.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: In South Korea, callers can receive 24-hour counseling through the suicide prevention hotline 1577-0199, the \u201cLife Line\u201d service at 1588-9191, the \u201cHope Phone\u201d at 129 and the \u201cYouth Phone\u201d at 1388.",
      "___",
      "Media and online commentators scrutinized her personal life. YouTube gossip channels accused her of exaggerating financial difficulties and questioned her sincerity. Critics, and her family, say it contributed to her declining mental health.",
      "She killed herself on Feb. 16, Kim Soo-hyun's birthday.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun, 37, also has been one of South Korea\u2019s most recognized actors, known for dramas such as \u201cMy Love from the Star\u201d (2013) and \u201cQueen of Tears\u201d (2024) as well as films like \u201cThe Thieves\u201d (2012) and \u201cSecretly, Greatly\u201d (2013).",
      "Speculation about a relationship with Kim Sae-ron began last year when she posted a photo of them together, quickly deleted. Gold Medalist, the agency co-founded by Kim Soo-hyun, denied the relationship, according to South Korean media.",
      "Days after Kim Sae-ron\u2019s death, a YouTube channel known for its politically charged content, HoverLab, alleged that she and Kim Soo-hyun had been in a six-year romantic relationship beginning in 2015, when she was 15 and he was in his late 20s. The channel released what it called evidence including photos, videos and letters. Kim Soo-hyun has called them fabricated.",
      "Kim Sae-ron\u2019s family had approached HoverLab to release the materials, calling it an attempt to restore Kim Sae-ron\u2019s image.",
      "On March 27, a lawyer representing Kim Sae-ron\u2019s family presented to journalists what the family claimed was a photo of an undelivered letter written in 2024 in which Kim Sae-ron described Kim Soo-hyun as her \u201cfirst and last love\u201d and referenced a five-to-six-year relationship.",
      "The letter was written after she failed to reach Kim Soo-hyun to discuss a debt she owed his agency, according to the lawyer. After Kim Sae-ron's contract ended and wasn't renewed, the agency asked her to pay back 700 million won (about $520,000) in damages related to her drunk-driving case. Her family says the demand placed severe pressure on her.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun has acknowledged that he dated Kim Sae-ron but insisted their relationship began after she became an adult. He called claims of an underage relationship false and damaging.",
      "\u201cIt is also not true that the deceased made a tragic choice because of my avoidance (of her), or because my agency pressured her about debt,\" an emotional Kim told Monday\u2019s press conference.",
      "He refused to answer a question from the AP about when he first met Kim Sae-ron.",
      "Whether any laws were broken depends largely on timing. South Korea raised its age of sexual consent from 13 to 16 in 2020. Kim Sae-ron was born in 2000, and the family alleges the relationship began in 2015, when she was 15 and Kim Soo-hyun was 27.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun maintains that their relationship lasted from summer 2019 to fall 2020, when Kim Sae-ron was a legal adult.",
      "Kim Soo-hyun's agency has taken legal action against the family of Kim Sae-ron and HoverLab, which first aired the underage relationship claims, for distributing private photos and videos of the actor, including images of Kim Soo-hyun kissing the late actor. Kim\u2019s agency said Kim Sae-ron had visited his apartment and his family was present. The agency said they were not dating at the time.",
      "On Monday, Kim Soo-hyun's lawyer announced a civil lawsuit seeking 12 billion won (approximately $8.15 million) in damages against the YouTube channel and Kim Sae-ron's family, along with criminal complaints alleging defamation and violation of privacy laws. Kim Soo-hyun and his agency also sued the YouTube channel operator for stalking.",
      "The family\u2019s legal representative and HoverLab both told the AP on Wednesday that they plan to sue Kim Soo-hyun and his agency for making false claims about his relationship with the late actor.",
      "Kim\u2019s death reignited criticism of South Korea\u2019s relentless tabloid and digital media culture. Her family has singled out videos with speculative, unverified content portraying her as emotionally unstable and morally questionable.",
      "Suing for defamation is often a lengthy, costly battle for South Korean celebrities, as many platforms, like YouTube, are based overseas. Punishments are typically light, with fines or suspended sentences.",
      "Other high-profile cases following negative online attention have included the deaths of K-pop singers Sulli and Goo Hara in 2019 and \u201cParasite\u201d actor Lee Sun-kyun in 2023.",
      "Fashion brand Prada has ended its collaboration with Kim Soo-hyun. South Korean cosmetics company Dinto terminated its one-year contract with him, citing the seriousness of the controversy. 7-Eleven Taiwan canceled a Kim Soo-hyun fan event last month, citing schedule changes.",
      "An online petition this week calling for the age of consent to be raised from 16 to 19 has gathered nearly 40,000 signatures on the National Assembly\u2019s website.",

      "But when the pair hit the same stage at the annual CinemaCon convention Wednesday to promote \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d it felt like a kind of victory lap following the first movie\u2019s critical acclaim and box office success.",
      "\u201cThis is the third year that \u2018Wicked\u2019 has closed Universal\u2019s CinemaCon presentation,\u201d Chu said. \u201cThank God it worked out.\u201d",
      "\u201cWicked: For Good\u201d hits theaters in November and completes the adaptation of the long-running Broadway musical inspired by \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d It stars Erivo as the green-skinned Elphaba Thropp, who became the Wicked Witch of the West, and Grande as Galinda, the future Good Witch of the South.",
      "\u201cWe already have our tissues packed,\u201d Grande teased, referring to the pair\u2019s sentimental viral press tour that often resulted in one or both of its stars in tears.",
      "\u201cI promise less water works this time,\u201d Erivo added, before they debuted a short montage of footage from the film.",
      "The \u201cWicked\u201d crew closed out an impressive \u2014 and aptly theatrical \u2014 presentation of the upcoming slate from Universal Pictures.",
      "Hollywood\u2019s Oscar season brings an annual chance for actors and filmmakers to swap kudos for their artistry. After it each year comes the CinemaCon convention and trade show, where studios and movie theaters take their turn to give pep talks and pats on the back.",
      "Universal demonstrated that any pep talk is made better with music \u2014 particularly anthemic or nostalgic songs from films old and new, like \u201cPsycho,\u201d \u201cJurassic Park\u201d and, of course, \u201cWicked.\u201d The studio took advantage of these and other familiar themes with a live orchestra as it made its pitch about their docket of films on the main stage at Caesars Palace.",
      "They pulled out the stops for \u201cJurassic World: Rebirth,\u201d one of Universal\u2019s other biggest films of the year hitting theaters in July, with help from its stars, Mahershala Ali and Scarlett Johansson, along with director Gareth Edwards, who walked out as the orchestra played its iconic theme.",
      "\u201cIt has been a lifelong dream to be in a \u2018Jurassic\u2019 movie. For the last 15 years, each time I heard that they were making a movie, I reached out and would say, \u2019I\u2019m available,\u201d Johansson said.",
      "The presentation followed a preview screening of \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d a live-action adaptation of the animated franchise, earlier in the day. The film, which stars Gerard Butler and Mason Thames, will be released in June.",
      "The orchestra was helmed by Emmy-winning composer Rickey Minor, the former bandleader on \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\u201d",
      "But the stunts didn\u2019t stop at live music. When teasing his myriad horror films on the horizon, producer Jason Blum walked out dressed as antagonist Freddy Fazbear to tease \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2,\u201d which will be released theatrically in December.",
      "To top off the Blumhouse Productions slate, 30 actors dressed as M3GAN, the artificially intelligent and sometimes hyper-violent subject of the film of the same name, danced to a rendition of \u201cOops!\u2026I Did It Again.\u201d \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d hits theaters in June.",

      "The U.S. State Department revoked the visas of members of a Mexican band after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a large screen during a performance at a music festival in the western state of Jalisco over the weekend",
      "MEXICO CITY -- The U.S. State Department revoked the visas of members of a Mexican band after they projected the face of a drug cartel boss onto a large screen during a performance in the western state of Jalisco over the weekend.",
      "U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration, said late Tuesday on X that the work and tourism visas of members of Los Alegres del Barranco were revoked.",
      "The visa revocations follow widespread outrage in Mexico over the concert as prosecutors in two states have launched investigations into the projected images, and a larger national reckoning over how to address the rise of a popular musical genre criticized for romanticizing drug cartels.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in freedom of expression, but that doesn\u2019t mean that expression should be free of consequences,\u201d Landau wrote on X. \u201cThe last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists.\u201d",
      "The controversy broke out over the weekend when the face of Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \"El Mencho\" Oseguera layered over flames was projected behind the band, originally hailing from Sinaloa, during the concert. Finger pointing ensued among the band, concert producers and the venue.",
      "Oseguera is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been connected to a ranch authorities say was used to train cartel recruits and possibly dispose of bodies in Jalisco, where searchers found human bone fragments, heaps of clothing and shoes.",
      "The Jalisco cartel is among other criminal groups in Mexico that have been designated as foreign terrorist organizations by the Trump administration.",
      "While the image was met by applause during the concert, Jalisco prosecutors quickly announced they were summoning the band to testify in an investigation into whether they were promoting violence, a crime which could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison. The state of Michoacan also announced an investigation into the Los Alegres del Barranco for projecting the same images during a concert in the city of Uruapan.",
      "Jalisco Gov. Pablo Lemus said that the state would ban musical performances that glorify violence, adding that violators would \u201cface monetary and criminal sanctions.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe know that outrage is not enough,\u201d Lemus said. \u201cOf course it\u2019s possible to ban (the music).\u201d",
      "Since, a number of the band's future shows have been cancelled, one town's government saying that the show \u201cdidn't have the municipal permissions needed\u201d to carry out the performance.",
      "Pavel Moreno, the band's accordion player and back-up singer, didn't respond to questions by fans asking if his visa had been revoked, simply thanking them for support and saying that \"everything is fine.\u201d",
      "The band was scheduled to play in Tulsa, Oklahoma on April 4. While the event hasn't been publicly cancelled, ticket sales websites read: \u201cNo tickets available for now on our site\" for that date.",
      "The dispute coincides with a larger cultural debate in Mexico as artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano usher in a global renaissance of Mexican regional music, by mixing classic ballads with trap music. In 2023, Peso Pluma beat Taylor Swift out as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "Many of the artists now topping the charts have come under fierce criticism because their lyrics often paint cartel leaders as Robin Hood-esque figures. Others say that the genre, known as \u201cnarco corridos\u201d, expresses the harsh realities of many youths across Mexico.",
      "A number of Mexican states have banned public performances of the music in recent years, the most recent being the state of Nayarit in February. Some of the bans have come as famed artists have received death threats from cartels, forcing a number of them to cancel their performances.",
      "Others, including Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, have sought a less aggressive approach to addressing the genre. Sheinbaum, who has come out against censoring the music, has suggested instead that the Mexican government push forward initiatives that promote Mexican regional music with more socially acceptable lyrics.",
      "The Mexican leader did harden her language on the topic following the Los Alegres del Barranco concert. In her morning news briefing this week, Sheinbaum demanded an investigation into the concert, saying: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t have an answer as to why he had to be put down other than it relates back to what happened,\u201d said Albert Whitehead, who cared not only for the 8-year-old reindeer named Star but also the decades-long tradition of having a reindeer in downtown Anchorage.",
      "Star lived in a fenced-in pen attached to Whitehead\u2019s house on a busy street at the edge of downtown. But starting in early January, someone began tampering with the friendly reindeer and his pen.",
      "A person got inside the pen in January, and Star began losing weight. In February, someone cut the locks off the pen's gates and Star wandered downtown streets. The following night, someone sprayed some type of substance into Star's pen.",
      "Earlier, Whitehead shied away from thinking that person might have poisoned Star, but now he doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Star had a persistent cough after the February incidents and then developed pneumonia. It was believed that contents from his stomach were coming up through his nose, and Star breathing that matter back into his lungs caused the pneumonia.",
      "It\u2019s possible Star ate a plastic bag when he was wandering downtown Anchorage, which could cause indigestion problems and chronic weight loss.",
      "He was cured of pneumonia but developed a second bout.",
      "\u201cHe started to recover and then all of a sudden reversed himself, and we decided it was not possible to save him,\u201d Whitehead said. Star was euthanized Tuesday, the same day the necropsy was conducted.",
      "Results won\u2019t be known for a few weeks as to the possible cause of death or contributing factors, Whitehead said.",
      "There has been a pet reindeer housed in downtown Anchorage since the 1950s. This particular Star was the seventh in the line to live with either Anchorage pioneers Oro and Ivan Stewart or Whitehead after he took over for the Stewarts in 2002.",
      "Star, which had his own Facebook page, constantly got visitors to his pen, attracting tourists and locals alike. He got daily walks in downtown Anchorage, was featured in parades, was visited by schoolchildren and even appeared on reality TV shows.",

      "West Texas is in the middle of a still-growing measles outbreak with 481 cases Friday. The state expanded the number of counties in the outbreak area this week to 10. The highly contagious virus began to spread in late January and health officials say it has spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "Three people who were unvaccinated have died from measles-related illnesses this year, including two elementary school-aged children in Texas. The second child died Thursday at a Lubbock hospital, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended the funeral in Seminole, the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "As of Friday, there were seven cases at a day care where one young child who was infectious gave it to two other children before it spread to other classrooms, Lubbock Public Health director Katherine Wells said.",
      "\u201cMeasles is so contagious I won\u2019t be surprised if it enters other facilities,\u201d Wells said.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention soon to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide. Kennedy also said he\u2019s assembling a task force to focus on the issue.",
      "Also on Monday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing \u201cnew scientific information\" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.",
      "Kennedy told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.",
      "Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by May 7.",
      "Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as \u201cthe leader in making America healthy again.\u201d He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state\u2019s fluoride law. \u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,\u201d he said.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who appeared with Kennedy at the news conference, said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards.",
      "\u201cWhen this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency\u2019s future steps,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cSecretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d and said also it\u2019s been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "About one-third of community water systems \u2014 17,000 out of 51,000 across the U.S. \u2014 serving more than 60% of the population fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.",
      "But over time, studies have documented potential problems. Too much fluoride has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. Studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program, which summarized studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico, concluded that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter \u2014 more than twice the recommended level in the U.S. \u2014 was associated with lower IQs in kids.",

      "A medical charity working in Greece says it has diagnosed six young children living in a migrant facility on the eastern Aegean island of Samos as suffering from malnutrition",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- A medical charity working in Greece says it has diagnosed six young children living in a migrant facility on the eastern Aegean island of Samos as suffering from malnutrition, the first time its doctors have made such a diagnosis since the facility opened in 2021.",
      "The Greek section of Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, said Monday its staff had diagnosed the children, who are aged between 6 months and 6 years old, with moderate to severe acute malnutrition and in need of immediate medical intervention.",
      "\u201cChildren make up about 25% of the (camp\u2019s) population, yet pediatric care remains insufficient, not only within the center but on the entire island of Samos,\u201d MSF Greece\u2019s Director General Christina Psarra said in a news release.",
      "The six children, who hailed from Afghanistan and Syria, all arrived in the camp with their families within the last two to three months, and it was not possible to determine whether they had already been suffering from malnutrition before they arrived, Psarra told The Associated Press.",
      "However, \u201cdefinitely the conditions in the camp have made things more difficult and have had an aggravating effect,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked about the MSF claims, the Ministry of Migration and Asylum said it would have a response later Monday.",
      "Psarra said that while meals were provided for the camp\u2019s residents, the diet \u201cis not nutritious for children of this age.\u201d The situation was exacerbated by the severance nine months ago of a stipend provided to asylum seekers in Greece, which had allowed them to purchase fresh food and other basic necessities, she added.",
      "Officially designated as a \u201cclosed controlled access center,\u201d the European Union-funded migrant camp in Samos, built on a hillside about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the island\u2019s main port of Vathy, was opened in 2021 to replace a massively overcrowded camp that had developed on the town\u2019s fringes.",
      "The camp, which is guarded by police and private security, has a capacity of 3,664 people and as of Monday, it was housing 3,176 people, according to the Ministry of Migration and Asylum.",
      "Psarra noted that the children had already endured grueling journeys to arrive in Samos, and conditions inside the camp exacerbated their medical situation.",
      "Rights groups have reported dire conditions in the camp in Samos, including poor sanitation and a shortage of running water.",
      "\u201cThey are children who have been through painful journeys. They have had many difficulties in arriving,\u201d Psarra said of the malnourished children on Samos. \u201cThe conditions in the camp makes it even worse.\u201d",
      "Greece lies on one of the most popular routes into the EU for people fleeing conflict and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Many make the short but treacherous boat journey from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands like Samos, often in small, unseaworthy inflatable dinghies.",
      "Last week, at least seven people, including three children, died near another Greek island, Lesbos, after the inflatable dinghy they were traveling in sank. Another 23 people survived and were taken to a migrant camp in Lesbos.",

      "A new study suggests that health care systems can reduce suicides through patient screening, safety planning and mental health counseling",
      "Health care systems can reduce suicides through patient screening, safety planning and mental health counseling, a new study suggests, an important finding as the U.S. confronts it 11th leading cause of death.",
      "The \u201cZero Suicide Model\u201d was developed in 2001 at Detroit-based Henry Ford Health, where the focus on people considering suicide included collaborating with patients to reduce their access to lethal means such as firearms and then following up with treatment.",
      "The approach made a difference, and for all of 2009, the health system saw no suicides among patients. The researchers then studied what happened when a different health system, Kaiser Permanente, adopted the program in four locations from 2012 through 2019.",
      "Suicides and suicide attempts fell in three of the locations, while the fourth maintained a low rate of suicides and attempts. Suicide attempts were tracked in electronic health records and insurance claims data. Suicides were measured using government death records.",
      "Reductions varied and reached up to 25%, said lead author Brian Ahmedani, of Henry Ford Health.",
      "\u201cOver the course of the year, that\u2019s up to 165 to 170 suicide attempts that were prevented at these participating health care systems,\u201d Ahmedani said.",
      "The study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, shows the model works, said Katherine Keyes, a Columbia University public health professor who studies suicide.",
      "Prior research has shown that nearly everyone who dies by suicide is seen by a health care provider in the year before their death, Keyes said. Many doctor's offices have started asking patients whether they've thought about harming themselves.",
      "\u201cWe are coming into contact with people who are at high risk for suicide. If we don\u2019t ask them, we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Keyes who was not involved in the new study.",
      "Grants from the National Institute of Mental Health funded the research.",
      "\u201cComplex health problems like suicide cannot be challenged effectively without federal leadership,\u201d said Mike Hogan, who led mental health systems in Connecticut, Ohio and New York, and chaired President George W. Bush\u2019s commission on mental health in 2002 and 2003.",
      "\u201cThis is a very important research report, confirming that reducing suicide among people in health systems is possible,\u201d Hogan said.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the epicenter of Texas' still-growing measles outbreak on Sunday, the same day a funeral was held for a second young child who was not vaccinated and died from a measles-related illness.",
      "Kennedy said in a social media post that he was working to \u201ccontrol the outbreak\" and went to Gaines County to comfort the families who have buried two young children. He was seen late Sunday afternoon outside of a Mennonite church where the funeral services were held, but he did not attend a nearby news conference held by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the outbreak.",
      "Seminole is the epicenter of the outbreak, which started in late January and continues to swell \u2014 with nearly 500 cases in Texas alone, plus cases from the outbreak believed to have spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "The second young child died Thursday from \"what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure,\u201d and did not have underlying health conditions, the Texas State Department of State Health Services said Sunday in a news release. Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, said that the child was \u201creceiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized.\u201d",
      "This is the third known measles-related death tied to this outbreak. One was another elementary school-aged child in Texas and the other was an adult in New Mexico; neither were vaccinated.",
      "It's Kennedy's first visit to the area as health secretary, where he said he met with families of both the 6- and 8-year-old children who died. He said he \u201cdeveloped bonds\u201d with the Mennonite community in West Texas in which the virus is mostly spreading.",
      "Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate before ascending to the role of nation\u2019s top health secretary earlier this year, has resisted urging widespread vaccinations as the measles outbreak has worsened under his watch. On Sunday, however, he said in a lengthy statement posted on X that it was \u201cthe most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.\"",
      "The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been used safely for more than 60 years and is 97% effective against measles after two doses.",
      "Dr. Manisha Patel, CDC incident manager, said in a Sunday news conference that the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles. She also told parents in Gaines County that it was important not to \u201cdelay care\u201d for a child who is sick with measles.",
      "\u201cCall your doctor and make sure you\u2019re talking to a health care professional who can guide you on those next steps,\" Patel said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s social media post said CDC employees had been \u201credeployed.\u201d CDC spokesman Jason McDonald clarified late Sunday that the first CDC team arrived in early March and left Gaines County on April 1, while a team led by Patel \u201cwas redeployed and arrived today to assess needs\" as ordered by Kennedy and requested by Texas' governor.",
      "Asked about the outbreak Sunday by reporters on Air Force One, Trump said, \u201cthey\u2019re doing reports on it,\u201d adding that if the outbreak \u201cprogresses, we\u2019ll will have to take action very strongly.\u201d",
      "Neither the CDC nor the state health department included the death in their measles reports issued Friday, but the CDC acknowledged it when asked Sunday.",
      "The number of cases in Texas shot up by 81 between March 28 and April 4, and 16 more people were hospitalized. Nationwide, the U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.",
      "Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy from Louisiana, a liver doctor whose vote helped cinch Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, called Sunday for stronger messaging from health officials in a post on X.",
      "\u201cEveryone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTop health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.\u201d",
      "Cassidy has requested Kennedy to appear before his health committee Thursday, although Kennedy has not publicly confirmed whether he will attend.",
      "A CDC spokesperson noted the efficacy of the measles vaccine Sunday but stopped short of calling on people to get it. Departing from long-standing public health messaging around vaccination, the spokesperson called the decision a \u201cpersonal one\u201d and encouraged people to talk with their doctor. People \u201cshould be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Misinformation about how to prevent and treat measles is hindering a robust public health response, including claims about vitamin A supplements that have been pushed by Kennedy and holistic medicine supporters despite doctors\u2019 warnings that it should be given under a physician's orders and that too much can be dangerous.",
      "Doctors at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, where the first measles death occurred, say they've treated fewer than 10 children for liver issues from vitamin A toxicity, which they found when running routine lab tests on children who are not fully vaccinated and have measles. Dr. Lara Johnson, chief medical officer, said the patients reported using vitamin A to treat and prevent the virus.",
      "Dr. Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s former vaccine chief, said responsibility for the death rests with Kennedy and his staff. Marks was forced out of the FDA after disagreements with Kennedy over vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cThis is the epitome of an absolute needless death,\u201d Marks told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday. \u201cThese kids should get vaccinated \u2014 that\u2019s how you prevent people from dying of measles.\u201d",
      "Marks also said he recently warned U.S. senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn\u2019t mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak.",
      "Experts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year. In West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.",
      "With several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 and declining childhood vaccination rates nationwide \u2014 some worry that measles may cost the U.S. its status as having eliminated the disease.",
      "Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.",

      "Susan Crawford\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court election victory over a conservative candidate backed by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk cements a liberal majority on the state\u2019s top court for at least three more years",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Susan Crawford\u2019s Wisconsin Supreme Court election victory over a conservative candidate backed by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk cemented a liberal majority on the state\u2019s top court for at least three more years and dealt a devastating blow to Republicans who fear it paves the way for a wide array of rulings that will overturn or block the GOP's agenda in the swing state.",
      "Trump, Musk and other Republican leaders fear that Crawford's win means the court controlled 4-3 by liberals will redraw Wisconsin's congressional lines in a way that could result in the Democrats picking up at least two seats and helping the party regain the majority.",
      "Crawford backers, including Democratic U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, told supporters that electing Crawford was important so that she and other liberal justices can order Wisconsin's congressional boundary lines to be redrawn.",
      "Last year, the court declined to take up a Democratic-backed challenge to the state's congressional lines, drawing criticism from one of Wisconsin's two House Democrats, Rep. Mark Pocan, who had urged the court to take the case then. Pocan said Wednesday that he hopes a new lawsuit will be filed soon.",
      "\u201cIf you have two seats out of eight in a purple, 50-50 state, clearly there\u2019s gerrymandering going on,\" Pocan said.",
      "Waiting in the wings are cases that could solidify the right to abortion in Wisconsin and undo former Republican Gov. Scott Walker's signature law that stripped collective bargaining rights from teachers and most other public workers.",
      "Walker said before the election that he also worried the court would go further by targeting the state's \u201cright-to-work\u201d law that he signed and looking for ways to scale back the program that allows students to attend private schools with a taxpayer-funded voucher.",
      "Jeff Mandell, general counsel of the liberal Madison law firm Law Forward, said he didn't think the strategy would be to \u201crefight every past battle.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes when I hear that rhetoric it seems to me there\u2019s a fear or belief that we have this whole file of prewritten lawsuits on every issue they\u2019ve won on the last set number of years,\u201d he said. \u201cAt least for me, that\u2019s not true.\u201d",
      "Crawford's comfortable win in a race that saw spending of around $100 million, including more than $21 million from Musk and groups he controls. Democratic billionaires got behind Crawford, with George Soros contributing $2 million and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker throwing in $1.5 million.",
      "Those supporting Schimel spent $8 million more than Crawford backers, based on a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "All of the attention resulted in record-high turnout of over 50% of the voting age population, breaking the previous record by about 10 points set in 2023.",
      "Crawford defeated Schimel by 10 points, based on unofficial results, which would be just under the 11-point victory by the liberal candidate in the 2023 race that wrested control of the court from conservatives who had held it for 15 years.",
      "Over the past two years, the court has served as a check on the Republican-controlled Legislature.",
      "The court ordered new legislative maps and Democrats picked up seats in the November election and hope to take control of at least one chamber of the Legislature in 2026.",
      "The court also overturned a decision by the former conservative court that banned absentee ballot drop boxes.",
      "Schimel's loss had Republicans worried about what that means for 2026, when Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' is up for reelection to a third term.",
      "And with a liberal court there to potentially block a Republican governor's agenda, Walker said, \"who would ever want to run for governor?\u201d",
      "Democrats say Crawford's win shows that Republicans need to moderate.",
      "\u201cThe people of Wisconsin are not really going in for some kind of large scale agenda that Trump and Musk are selling,\u201d said Patrick Guarasci, a top adviser to the Crawford campaign who has also been involved in gubernatorial races. \u201cThe Republicans need to come back to the center.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- A U.S. political science scholar accused by the Thai Army of insulting the Southeast Asian nation\u2019s monarchy, an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison, was jailed on Tuesday pending trial.",
      "Paul Chambers, a lecturer at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok, last week was summoned by police to hear the charges against him, including violating the Computer Crime Act, which covers online activity.",
      "Chambers has specialized in studying the power and influence of the military in Thailand. The army plays a major role in politics and has staged 13 successful coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently just 11 years ago.",
      "He reported himself to the police Tuesday to formally acknowledge the charges and then was taken to Phitsanulok Provincial Court for a pretrial detention hearing, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, a legal advocacy group.",
      "It said the court approved the police request for pretrial detention and denied Chambers\u2019 initial application for release on bail, as well as a second later request. The legal aid group said another request to allow bail would be filed to an appeals court on Wednesday. No trial date has been set.",
      "The officer who answered the phone at the police station handling the case said he could not comment, and referred the matter to his chief, who did not answer a call to his phone.",
      "It is not unusual for Thai courts to deny bail in cases involving the offense of insulting the monarchy, which is also called lese majeste, and popularly known as \u201c112\u201d after its article number in the criminal code.",
      "The U.S.-based academic freedom project Scholars at Risk said in a statement that Chambers in late 2024 made comments in a webinar about a restructuring of the military believed to be the cause of the complaint made against him by the 3rd Army Area, covering Thailand\u2019s northern region.",
      "\u201cState authorities should refrain from criminal investigations and other coercive legal action intended to restrict or retaliate against such conduct,\u201d said the statement.",
      "The lese majeste law calls for three to 15 years imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere and has been used to punish critics of the government and institutions such as the military.",
      "The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticism of it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.",
      "However, public debate on the topic has in the past decade grown louder, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020, began openly criticizing the institution. That led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law.",
      "Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people \u2014 many of them student activists \u2014 have been charged with violating the lese majeste law.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) \u2014 Iran 's foreign minister said Tuesday he'll meet with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff in Oman for the first negotiations under the Trump administration seeking to halt Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program as tensions remain high in the Middle East.",
      "Speaking to Iranian state television from Algeria, Abbas Araghchi maintained the talks would be indirect, likely with Omani mediators shuttling between the two parties. U.S. President Donald Trump, in announcing the negotiations on Monday, described them as being direct talks.",
      "Years of indirect talks under the Biden administration failed to reach any success, as Tehran now enriches uranium up to 60% purity \u2014 a technical step away from weapons-grade levels. Both the U.S. and Israel have threatened Iran with military attack over the program, while officials in Tehran increasingly warn they could potentially pursue a nuclear bomb.",
      "\u201cOur main goal in the talks, is naturally restoring rights of people as well as lifting sanctions and if the other side has a real will, this is achievable, and it has no relation to the method, either direct or indirect,\" Araghchi said. \u201cFor the time being, indirect is our preference. And we have no plan to alter it to direct.\u201d",
      "Araghchi\u2019s comments left space for Iran to potentially hold direct talks eventually with the Americans. Such talks aren\u2019t known to have been held since the Obama administration.",
      "There was no immediate acknowledgement from the U.S. that Witkoff would lead the American delegation.",
      "After Trump's comments on the talks went public, Iran's ailing economy suddenly showed new signs of life. Its rial currency, which hit a record low of over 1 million rials to the dollar, rebounded Tuesday to 990,000 rials. The Tehran Stock Exchange separately rose some 2% on the news.",
      "Iran\u2019s economy has been severely affected by international sanctions, particularly after Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran\u2019s nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. At the time of the 2015 deal, which saw Iran drastically limit its enrichment and stockpiling of uranium in exchange for lifting of international sanctions, the rial traded at 32,000 to the dollar.",
      "Economic upheavals have evaporated the public\u2019s savings, pushing average Iranians into holding onto hard currencies, gold, cars and other tangible wealth. Others pursue cryptocurrencies or fall into get-rich-quick schemes.",
      "The negotiations Saturday come after Trump wrote to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, trying to jumpstart direct talks between Tehran and Washington. Khamenei came down hard on Trump in February and warned talks \u201care not intelligent, wise or honorable\u201d with his administration.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump is continuing an intense airstrike campaign targeting the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, the last force in Tehran\u2019s self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d able to attack Israel after other militant groups were mauled by Israel during its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Asked about Trump\u2019s mention of planned direct talks between the U.S. and Iran, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow welcomes them, adding that \u201cwe support settling the issue of the Iranian nuclear dossier by political and diplomatic means.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are aware that certain contacts, both direct and indirect, are planned in Oman and we can only welcome them as they could lead to the de-escalation of tensions around Iran,\u201d Peskov said in a conference call with reporters.

      "Kaja Kallas, who is on a regional tour, was in the Albanian capital, Tirana, to meet with the country\u2019s leaders and assure them that the country's future is in the bloc.",
      "\u201cAlbania has an ambitious agenda to close EU negotiations in the next two years,\u201d Kallas said at a joint news conference with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama. \u201cIt\u2019s vital to sustain the high pace of reforms. And I also understand that the reforms are always quite difficult.\u201d",
      "Still, \u201cAlbania\u2019s future is in the European Union,\u201d she said.",
      "The EU decided in 2020 it would start full membership negotiations with Albania, and talks began last October on how the country aligns with the EU\u2019s stance on issues such as the rule of law, the functioning of democratic institutions and tackling corruption.",
      "The Western Balkans countries \u2014 Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia \u2014 are at different stages in their applications for EU membership. They have been frustrated by the slow pace of progress, but Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 encouraged Europe\u2019s leaders to push for the six to join the bloc.",
      "\u201cYour decision to fully implement EU sanctions against Russia alongside your political, military and humanitarian support to Ukraine demonstrates your commitment to our shared values,\u201d said Kallas.",
      "Rama has said he hopes to complete the negotiating process with the EU by 2027 and for Albania to become a bloc member by 2030.",
      "\u201cWe will not rest until we step into the door of the European Union, and sit around the same table that the European Union does,\u201d Rama said.",
      "Albania is part of the EU\u2019s growth plan and it is expected to receive more than 920 million euros ($1 billion) over the next decade.",
      "On Tuesday, Albania also signed with the European Investment Bank a 90 million-euro ($98 million) agreement to reconstruct the railway between the port of Durres and Rrogozhine, which Kallas said would \u201cserve as a critical route ... between member states in NATO, for military mobility in Southeast Europe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is extremely important in the current security environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Albania holds parliamentary elections May 11 in which Rama's governing leftist Socialist Party has put EU membership as the goal of the governing program. The conservative opposition accuses the Socialists of corruption and being unable to take the country ahead.",
      "Kallas earlier visited Montenegro and ends her tour with a visit to Bosnia later Tuesday.",

      "While Australia and its external territories were assigned the global minimum 10% tariff, including the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands in the Antarctic region, Norfolk Island was singled out for a 29% tariff.",

She is a 9th generation descendant of a crewman of the British naval ship HMS Bounty who mutinied in 1789, although her mother is Canadian. The mutineers, whose exploits have been dramatized in Hollywood movies, established a settlement on Pitcairn Islands and their descendants later settled the former British penal colony of Norfolk Island.",
      "She said the sustainable lifestyle she had learned from growing up on such an isolated island around 8 kilometers (5 miles) long and 5 kilometers (3 miles) wide had been part of the brand since they started their business in Vancouver 15 years ago.",

      "About 10 politicians from the People Power Party are expected to seek the nomination.",
      "Yoon\u2019s baffling decision to enact martial law, which brought armed troops into Seoul\u2019s streets and evoked the country\u2019s traumatic memories of past military rule, was a blow to his party\u2019s reputation even though the party wasn\u2019t directly involved.",

Two months is a short time to unify the base, moderates and a conspiracy-driven fringe around a single candidate,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul.",
      "The party\u2019s current leadership is filled with Yoon loyalists, and that will likely let the internal divide continue and undermine its electoral prospects, said Choi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership.",

The last major candidate is Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon, who has maintained an ambiguous position.",
      "Choi said Yoon will likely exert his influence to boost pro-Yoon figures who are seeking the nomination and party leadership posts so they can defend him as he faces a criminal trial. Yoon was charged with rebellion in January, and he could face other charges like abuse of power now that he has lost presidential immunity, which protected him from most criminal prosecutions.",
      "The People Power Party \u201cwill need to nominate someone who can win over the public, particularly the moderates, rather than someone who can win the party\u2019s primaries,\u201d said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. \u201cKorean moderates and the young generation in their 20s and 30s will likely be the swing voters.\u201d",

      "Lee faces five ongoing trials for corruption and other criminal charges. If he becomes president, those trials will likely stop thanks to presidential immunity.",
      "Yoon has repeatedly accused Lee\u2019s Democratic Party of abusing its parliamentary majority status to obstruct his agenda, impeach senior officials and slash the government\u2019s budget bill.

      "\u201cThe possibility of a bigger eruption is always there,\u201d Bacolcol said, urging people to remain vigilant and stay away from a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) danger zone around Kanlaon.",
      "The 2,435-meter (7,988-foot) volcano is one of the country\u2019s 24 most active volcanoes. In 1996, three hikers were killed near the peak and several others were later rescued when Kanlaon erupted without warning, officials said then.",
      "The Philippines is located in the so-called Pacific \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The archipelago is also lashed by about 20 typhoons and storms a year, making it one of the world\u2019s most disaster-prone countries.",

      "Brazil will reintroduce on Thursday visa requirements for U.S., Canadian and Australian citizens",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 Brazil will reintroduce visa requirements Thursday for U.S., Canadian and Australian citizens, a move that ends the country's open entry for people of those nationalities after six years.",
      "The United States Embassy in Brasilia said Monday that Americans will still be able to request visas electronically if they visit from April 10 onward.",
      "Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, scrapped the visa requirements in a 2019 decree as he sought to boost the country\u2019s tourism industry.",
      "That went against the South American country\u2019s tradition of requiring visas from travelers based on the principle of reciprocity and equal treatment.",
      "Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva suspended the free entry of Americans, Canadians and Australians in March of 2023, shortly after he defeated Bolsonaro. The leftist leader said then it was based on the principle of reciprocity as Brazilians still need visas for those countries.",
      "Lula's decision was postponed from coming into force three times as the government negotiated to get reciprocity for Brazilians, but no change was made.",
      "Brazil's Senate approved a bill earlier this year to keep the visa exemption for the three countries, but the mood changed in the lower house after Trump imposed a 10% tariff on Brazilian goods last week. Allies of Speaker Hugo Motta have said the bill will not come to a final vote any time soon.",
      "Last week, Brazil's Congress swiftly passed a reciprocity bill so the country's executive has leeway to impose retaliation tariffs on countries that impose barriers to Brazilian goods. The bill is yet to be sanctioned by Lula.",

      "Some 80 coffeeshops are taking part in the experiment which advocates hope this will ultimately end a long-standing legal anomaly \u2014 you can buy and sell small amounts of weed without fear of prosecution in the Netherlands, but growing it commercially remains illegal.",

      "A trailblazer in decriminalizing pot since the 1970s, the Netherlands has grown more conservative. Amsterdam, long a magnet for marijuana smokers, has been closing coffeeshops in recent years and has banned smoking weed on some of the cobbled streets that make up its historic center.",
      "Advocates have been pushing for a legal growing for years, citing the safety of the product as well as concerns about crime.",
      "Benjamin Selma, the head grower at Hollandse Hoogtes who worked in cannabis production in California for more than a decade, said the quality control for the cannabis is extremely high. \u201cWe do a full test, microbial, cannabinoid, terpene, as well as yeast and anaerobic bacteria, heavy metals as well. So it\u2019s very, very controlled,\u201d he told the AP.",

      "The drugstore chain booked pharmacy sales gains, and its struggling VillageMD clinic business delivered a smaller balance sheet hit in the recently concluded quarter.",
      "Overall, Walgreens said Tuesday that it lost $2.85 billion compared to a $5.91 billion loss in the previous year\u2019s quarter. Adjusted results not counting one-time items totaled 63 cents per share in the most recent quarter. Sales grew 4% to $38.59 billion",

      "But three months into the year, international arrivals are plummeting. Angered by Trumps\u2019 tariffs and rhetoric, and alarmed by reports of tourists being arrested at the border, some citizens of other countries are staying away from the U.S. and choosing to travel elsewhere.",
      "The federal government's National Travel and Tourism Office released preliminary figures Tuesday showing visits to the U.S. from overseas fell 11.6% in March compared to the same month last year. The figures did not include arrivals from Canada, which is scheduled to report tourism data later this week, or land crossings from Mexico. But air travel from Mexico dropped 23%.",

      "The travel forecasting company Tourism Economics, which as recently as December anticipated the U.S. would have nearly 9% more international arrivals this year, revised its annual outlook last week to predict a 9.4% decline.",
      "Tourism Economics expects some of the steepest declines will be from Canada, where Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the country should become the 51st state and tariffs on close trading partners have angered residents. Canada was the largest source of visitors to the U.S. in 2024, with more than 20.2 million, according to U.S. government data.",
      "Flight Centre Travel Group Canada, a travel booking site, said leisure bookings to U.S. destinations were down 40% in March compared to the same month a year ago. Air Canada has reduced its schedule of spring flights to Florida, Las Vegas and Arizona due to lack of demand.",

      "But Tourism Economics said the impact of the less favorable view of the U.S. from abroad could be severe enough that international visits won't surpass pre-pandemic levels until 2029.",

      "Ian Urquhart, a professor emeritus at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, was supposed to go to Las Vegas for five days in June and see Coldplay in concert. He canceled the trip to protest Trump's \u201cincredibly disparaging tone\u201d toward Canada even though it meant losing a $500 deposit on the vacation package.",

      "For Pepa Cuevas and her husband, who live in Madrid, Trump\u2019s election in November was a turning point. The couple had planned to spend a month skiing in Colorado over the winter holidays. They went to Japan instead.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s victory left us, especially me, very shocked,\u201d Cuevas said. \u201cFor the moment, we have lost the desire to return. I don\u2019t know what will happen in the future, but for the moment we are still shocked, and it doesn\u2019t look like this is going to be resolved.\u201d",
      "According to the government data released Tuesday, international arrivals from China were down nearly 1%. Leisure trips by Chinese citizens to places like Disneyland, Hawaii and New York are decreasing dramatically and likely won\u2019t pick up again until Trump has left office, said Wolfgang Georg Arlt, the CEO of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute. He dubs it the \u201cTrump Slump.\u201d",
      "That slump has financial consequences. Tourism Economics expects U.S. spending by international visitors to drop by $9 billion this year.",
      "Marco Jahn is the president and CEO of New World Travel, a California company that works with overseas tour operators on vacation packages and activity planning. It arranges the hotels and rental cars for a family that wants to take a driving tour of U.S. national parks, for example.",
      "Jahn said bookings have dropped between 20% and 50%, depending on the source market, over the last eight to 10 weeks. He notes particular declines from Scandinavia, where Trump\u2019s repeated threat to take control of Greenland, a self-governing territory of NATO ally Denmark, has antagonized citizens.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is not perceived as a welcoming destination,\u201d Jahn said.",
      "Beyond, a revenue management platform for vacation rental owners, said Canadian searches for short-term rentals in the U.S. plunged 44% after Feb. 1, when Trump first announced a since-paused 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico. Florida, Texas and New York were among the hardest-hit markets, Beyond said.",
      "American Ring Travel, a tour operator based in California, offers carbon-neutral bus tours of the U.S. that often attract eco-conscious travelers from Europe, said Richard Groesz, the company\u2019s director of contracting. But bookings from Germany flattened starting in January after Elon Musk threw his support behind a far-right political party in that country\u2019s federal election, Groesz said.",
      "There are other issues impacting foreign visits. The U.S. has been the top destination by country for Japanese tourists for years, but data compiled by JTB Tourism Research & Consulting showed South Korea topped the U.S. in January.",
      "The weak yen \u2013 not Trump \u2013 is likely the biggest factor dampening the attraction of the U.S., said Takaaki Mitamura, a spokesperson for Tokyo-based travel agent Veltra Corp. Travelers are picking destinations where the currency effect isn\u2019t as big, like South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Australia, he said.",
      "Haruka Atomiya, a Tokyo resident, visits Los Angeles at least once a year. Last year, she brought her young children for the first time and did a lot of research to find affordable places to stay. The exchange rate made some hotels double or triple the price she paid in the past.",

Vancouver-born Schiller said he and his Norfolk Island-born wife are likely the only business owners on the island that will pay elevated tariffs \u2014 and they will pay at the rates imposed on Japan and India, where the goods are manufactured.

      "Many parents need child care scholarships to work",
      "PHOENIX -- For parents who need to work but can't afford the steep cost of child care, federally funded scholarships can be a lifeline. Delivered through state child care assistance programs, the scholarships can mean the difference between a parent working full time \u2014 or not at all.",
      "But qualified families increasingly are being turned away, thanks to the rising costs of child care and the end of pandemic-era funds, and some families that had scholarships have seen them end. In at least three states \u2014 Arizona, Colorado and Texas \u2014 parents who apply face long waitlists. Other states, including Nevada and Oklahoma, have increased copayments for parents or have said they will serve fewer children. In Idaho, enrollment was paused for part of last year.",
      "Last week, the Trump administration laid off some employees who helped states implement child care assistance. It's all left advocates worried about the future of federal child care programs.",
      "\u201cWhat it means is that ultimately child care will become less safe, it\u2019s going to become more expensive, and it\u2019s going to become harder to find,\u201d said Ruth Friedman, who was the director of the Office of Child Care under former President Joe Biden.",
      "As part of Trump's sweeping cuts to the federal government, the administration eliminated jobs in the Office of Child Care, which oversees federal child care subsidies and ensure states are enforcing safety standards.",
      "All staff in five of the 10 regional offices were cut, along with more in the office\u2019s headquarters in Washington. They included staff who upheld federal safety requirements for child care providers and ensured subsidies were being used effectively. They worked with states to enforce requirements to run background checks on child care employees. They also safeguarded programs from waste and fraud.",
      "During the pandemic, Congress approved record spending to boost the child care industry, recognizing its importance to restarting the economy. States received $24 billion to help child care providers boost wages, buy masks and air purifiers and train staff, plus an extra $15 billion for child care assistance scholarships.",
      "That money expired in September. Congress declined to extend it, despite a push from Biden and child care advocates. Since then, some states have attempted to continue programs with their own taxpayers' money. But many, such as Arizona, have ended special pandemic-era programs, like those that helped teachers pay for child care. Now, Arizona parents who apply for basic child care assistance are put on waitlists \u2014 with no clear end in sight.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a much bigger need than there are funds,\u201d said Kim Kofron of the Texas-based advocacy group Children at Risk. \u201cWe know all of these families are willing to work.\u201d",
      "In Phoenix, child care worker Janeth Ibarra would have paid nothing last year for care for her twin boys, because she would have received a special scholarship for those in her field. This year, her income qualifies her for regular state child care assistance. But because the state ran low on money for the program, she was on a waitlist earlier this year.",
      "As it stands, Ibarra, 22, earns $16.50 an hour and is paying more than $1,200 a month for child care, after a steep discount from her employer.",
      "\u201cEven with overtime, it\u2019s barely survivable,\u201d Ibarra said. At the end of last year, Ibarra had to spend the last of her savings on special formula for one of her sons, a purchase not covered by her food assistance benefits. She tried to breastfeed more to save money.",
      "In Idaho, where lawmakers in 2023 rejected pandemic aid for child care, the state stopped accepting applications for its child care assistance program. When the applications resumed, the state tightened income restrictions. Now, the only families who qualify earn less than 130% of the federal poverty line, or $41,795 for a family of four. Before, a family of four could earn up to $56,000 and still receive a scholarship.",
      "In Colorado, a dozen counties stopped accepting new applications for the state's child care assistance program because they ran out of money, The Colorado Sun reported.",
      "Trump has been vague on his plans to make child care more affordable. He said during his campaign that he believed tariffs would rake in \u201ctrillions of dollars.\u201d Child care, he added, is, \u201crelatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kind of numbers we\u2019ll be taking in.\u201d",
      "Economists, though, have warned tariffs could cause prices for other household goods to skyrocket, squeezing family budgets, and it\u2019s unlikely there would be much money left over for the government to spend if Trump successfully implements steep tax cuts. Advocates are concerned child care funding could be cut as the president seeks to shrink the federal government.",
      "For states trying to maintain child care assistance scholarships, the costs of running the programs have risen. Because many child care providers operate in the margins, the Biden administration increased the amount they receive when they take scholarship students.",
      "It's all evidence the problems that vex the child care industry have not necessarily abated with the pandemic, said Karen Schulman, senior director of child care policy at the National Women\u2019s Law Center.",
      "\u201cThe crisis was going on long before COVID,\u201d Schulman said, citing the unaffordability of care for many families, along with the low pay of the child care workforce.",
      "Even as providers struggle to make a profit, child care is prohibitively expensive for many families. In a study of 2022 child care prices, the Labor Department found the median cost of care for an infant in a center was more than $15,600 in large counties \u2014 higher than the median rent in many places.",
      "When Brooklyn Newman divorced her husband, she moved with her two boys, now 2 and 4, into a trailer while she got back on her feet. The Phoenix mother was eager to send her older boy to preschool so he could have structure as the family weathered the split. But she could not afford tuition for her younger son until the preschool gave her a scholarship funded by pandemic aid.",
      "With both boys in school half-time, Newman could put in more hours at her job as a freelance business analyst. But when the scholarship ended, she had to pay out of pocket \u2014 adding $1,000 a month to her preschool tuition. She made a painful trade-off: She juggled working in the evening while watching her children at home \u2014 sacrificing quality time with them so she can earn enough money to continue to send them to preschool.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m constantly behind a computer, you know, giving everything I can,\u201d Brooklyn said earlier this year, her voice tightening with emotion. Occasionally, her sons will hide her computer mouse to keep her from working.",
      "But she can see growth from their time in preschool \u2014 in their language, in their confidence, in their relationships with teachers and classmates. \u201cYou\u2019re watching them grow. It\u2019s just the best feeling. And that\u2019s why I do everything I can to have them there.\u201d",

      "Comptroller-General Anel Flores said the audit found some payment defaults, accounting miscalculations and some \u201cshadow\u201d operation of companies that the Hong Kong company originally denied, causing Panama around $300 million in lost revenue.",
      "The release of the audit of Panama Ports Company, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate subsidiary that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal, comes as U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration alleges Chinese interference in the canal's operations, which Panamanian authorities have denied. It also happens the same day the U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth arrives to the Central American country to participate in a subregional security conference.",
      "\u201cThere are many violations that will have to be explained,\u201d the Panamanian comptroller said.",

      "Some days ago, while the audit was underway, CK Hutchison said it has agreed to sell its controlling stake in Panama Ports Company to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., effectively putting the ports under American control.",

      "Wall Street could soon be in the claws of another bear market",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street could soon be in the claws of another bear market as the Trump administration's tariff blitz fuels fears that the added taxes on imported goods from around the world will sink the global economy.",
      "The last bear market happened in 2022, but this decline feels more like the sudden, turbulent bear market of 2020, when the benchmark S&P 500 index tumbled 34% in a one-month period, the shortest bear market ever.",
      "Here are some common questions about bear markets:",
      "A bear market is a term used by Wall Street when an index such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 20% or more from a recent high for a sustained period of time.",
      "Why use a bear to refer to a market slump? Bears hibernate, so they represent a stock market that\u2019s retreating. In contrast, Wall Street\u2019s nickname for a surging market is a bull market, because bulls charge.",
      "The S&P 500, Wall Street\u2019s main barometer of health, was down 1.2% in Monday afternoon trading. It's now 18.4% below the all-time high it set on Feb. 19.",
      "The Dow industrials fell 1.8%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite, which already was in a bear market, dropped 0.9%.",
      "The most recent bear market for the S&P 500 ran from Jan. 3 to Oct. 12 in 2022.",
      "The trade war has ratcheted up fear and uncertainty on Wall Street over how businesses and consumers will respond.",
      "President Donald Trump followed through on tariff threats last week by declaring a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States.",
      "Global markets cratered the next day, and the sell-off deepened after China announced it would retaliate with tariffs equal to the ones from the U.S.",
      "Tariffs cause economic pain in part because they\u2019re a tax paid by importers that often gets passed along to consumers, adding to inflationary pressure. They also provoke trading partners into retaliating, which can hurt all economies involved.",
      "Import taxes can also cause economic damage by complicating the decisions businesses have to make, including which suppliers to use, where to locate factories and what prices to charge. And that uncertainty can cause them to delay or cancel investments that help drive economic growth.",
      "The tariffs come at a time when the U.S. economy is already showing signs of slowing. Markets are also worried that tariffs could fuel inflation, which recently ticked higher.",
      "On average, bear markets have taken 13 months to go from peak to trough and 27 months to get back to breakeven since World War II. The S&P 500 index has fallen an average of 33% during bear markets in that time. The biggest decline since 1945 occurred in the 2007-2009 bear market, when the S&P 500 fell 57%.",
      "History shows that the faster an index enters into a bear market, the shallower they tend to be. Historically, stocks have taken 251 days (8.3 months) to fall into a bear market. When the S&P 500 has fallen 20% at a faster clip, the index has averaged a loss of 28%.",
      "The longest bear market lasted 61 months and ended in March 1942. It cut the index by 60%.",
      "Generally, investors look for a 20% gain from a low point as well as sustained gains over at least a six-month period. It took less than three weeks for stocks to rise 20% from their low in March 2020.",
      "If you need the money now or want to lock in the losses, yes. Otherwise, many advisers suggest riding through the ups and downs while remembering the swings are the price of admission for the stronger returns that stocks have provided over the long term.",
      "While dumping stocks would stop the bleeding, it would also prevent any potential gains. Many of the best days for Wall Street have occurred either during a bear market or just after one ended. That includes two separate days in the middle of the 2007-2009 bear market when the S&P 500 surged roughly 11%, as well as leaps of better than 9% during and shortly after the monthlong 2020 bear market.",
      "Advisers suggest putting money into stocks only if it will not be needed for several years. The S&P 500 has come back from every one of its prior bear markets to eventually rise to another all-time high.",
      "The down decade for the stock market following the 2000 bursting of the dot-com bubble was a notoriously brutal stretch, but stocks have often been able to regain their highs within a few years.",

So it\u2019s finally time to end that crazy, unexplainable situation and make it a legal professional sector,\u201d Rick Bakker, commercial director at Hollandse Hoogtes, one of the regulated producers, told The Associated Press.",
      "Some 80 coffeeshops are taking part in the experiment which advocates hope this will ultimately end a long-standing legal anomaly \u2014 you can buy and sell small amounts of weed without fear of prosecution in the Netherlands, but growing it commercially remains illegal.",
      "Bakker's company in Bemmel, near the German border, is indistinguishable from the surrounding greenhouses producing tomatoes and peppers. But it makes 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of weed per week and is one of the largest producers in the experiment.",
      "A trailblazer in decriminalizing pot since the 1970s, the Netherlands has grown more conservative. Amsterdam, long a magnet for marijuana smokers, has been closing coffeeshops in recent years and has banned smoking weed on some of the cobbled streets that make up its historic center.",
      "Advocates have been pushing for a legal growing for years, citing the safety of the product as well as concerns about crime.",
      "Benjamin Selma, the head grower at Hollandse Hoogtes who worked in cannabis production in California for more than a decade, said the quality control for the cannabis is extremely high. \u201cWe do a full test, microbial, cannabinoid, terpene, as well as yeast and anaerobic bacteria, heavy metals as well. So it\u2019s very, very controlled,\u201d he told the AP.",
      "The company, which does not use pesticides and tightly regulates growing conditions, has an eye to the environment. The production facility gets its energy from solar panels and uses biodegradable packaging.",
      "\u201cIt is also a great opportunity to see how cooperation within the closed chain between legal growers, coffeeshop owners and all other authorities involved works,\u201d Breda Mayor Paul Depla told the AP when the first phase was launched in 2023.",
      "The experiment \"is really a political compromise,\u201d according to Derrick Bergman, chairman of the Union for the Abolition of Cannabis Prohibition. The plan dates to 2017, when Christian political parties and pro-legalization parties agreed to a test run after a bill to decriminalize production failed.",
      "The government will evaluate the experiment after four years.",
      "\u201cA research team, advised by an independent guidance and evaluation committee, is examining the effects of a controlled cannabis supply chain on crime, safety and public health,\u201d the government said in a statement.",
      "Selma said he is happy to be working without concerns about prosecution. \u201cI\u2019ve seen some bad moments,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t know if I ever believed I would be so free.\u201d",
      "The coffeeshops taking part in the initiative are located in Almere, Arnhem, Breda, Groningen, Heerlen, Hellevoetsluis, Maastricht, Nijmegen, Tilburg, and Zaanstad.",

      "At the Festichoc chocolate festival in Geneva over the weekend, Trump administration tariffs announced last week did little to sour the mood on Switzerland\u2019s most famous sweets",
      "GENEVA -- With the normally brisk Easter season around the corner, the mood in Switzerland\u2019s chocolate business is bittersweet, thanks to high cacao prices and \u2014 now \u2014 the newly added U.S. tariffs on imports.",
      "Many Swiss, from the government to chocolatiers to watchmakers and other businesses, are sensing \u201cshock\u201d over the tougher American position on trade, but many are also taking a wait-and-see stance.",
      "At the Festichoc chocolate festival in Geneva over the weekend, the Trump administration tariffs announced last week were on many minds, though they seemed to do little to sour the mood on Switzerland\u2019s most famous sweets.",
      "Julie Jammes, marketing manager for Canonica, a Geneva chocolatier with three stores in San Francisco, said her company hasn't yet made any decision on what actions might be taken. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting a little longer, but it\u2019s clearly a shock for us,\" Jammes said.",
      "That meshes with Switzerland\u2019s overall approach: Despite hefty 31% U.S. tariffs slapped on Swiss goods -- well more than the 20% faced by exports from European Union \u2013 the government in Bern is taking a cautious approach for now. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\u201cAn increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland\u2019s interests. Countermeasures against US tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\u201d the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \u201cis therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\u201d",
      "The government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10% tariff, and another another 21% beginning Wednesday.",
      "The United States is Switzerland\u2019s second-biggest trading partner after the EU \u2013 a 27-member-country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million \u2013 and U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.",
      "The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.",
      "The atmosphere remained bubbly at Festichoc, where eager shoppers nibbled chocolate squares and ogled at chocolate Easter bunny and egg sculptures at the annual gathering in the Geneva town of Versoix.",
      "Jammes, of Canonica, expressed hope that the \u201cloyal clientele\u201d in the United States would remain faithful, but she said \u201cI put myself in the consumer\u2019s shoes\u201d and realized a pocketbook pinch might dissuade many shoppers.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see why I would pay $45 tomorrow for a box (of chocolates) that I\u2019d pay $30 for today,\u201d she said Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s still a very complicated issue.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt is completely incomprehensible that Switzerland is targeted by these tariffs,\u201d Chocosuisse said, adding that it was taking the situation \u201cvery seriously\u201d and decried how the U.S measure \u201chits our businesses hard and represents a heavy burden that will weigh on exports to the United States.\u201d",
      "Philippe Pascoet, a chocolatier from Geneva, lamented a sharp increase in cocoa prices over the last six months, and said the U.S. market has always been tricky for smaller producers.",
      "\u201cTrump now has wanted to impose taxes on imported products. But it has always been complicated to send chocolate to the United States, just for sanitary reasons,\" he said. \"They want to control what is imported into their country. So even people who used to order chocolate from us online often found it blocked at customs.\u201d",

      "Mega Millions players will get slightly better odds and should start seeing more billion-dollar jackpots, but at a cost \u2014 literally \u2014 with tickets for the multistate lottery more than doubling in price from $2 to $5",
      "DES MOINES, Iowa -- Mega Millions players will get slightly better odds and should start seeing more billion-dollar jackpots, but at a cost \u2014 literally \u2014 with tickets for the multistate lottery jumping in price to $5.",
      "The price for playing Mega Millions more than doubled for drawings starting with Tuesday's, but lottery officials are betting that the swollen jackpots they're expecting will catch the public's attention and lead to an accompanying surge in sales",
      "\u201cPeople really want big jackpots,\u201d said Joshua Johnston, the Washington state lottery director who heads the Mega Millions game. \u201cWe expect to see a sales lift on this.\u201d",
      "The biggest change is the ticket price hike from $2 to $5. Lottery officials expect that jump to increase revenue from the twice-weekly game, enabling them to improve the odds of winning the jackpot from 1 in 303 million to 1 in 290 million.",
      "The higher ticket price also means the jackpot can start at $50 million, rather than the previous $20 million, and that the grand prize is expected to grow more quickly. Each time there isn\u2019t a big winner, the jackpot will jump by a larger amount. Officials expect it will more frequently top the $1 billion threshold that draws extra attention \u2014 and bigger sales.",
      "Under the new rules, prizes for tickets not matching all six numbers also will increase, with non-jackpot winners now guaranteed at least $10. Each ticket also will include a randomly assigned multiplier that can increase the prize by up to 10 times, a previous add-on feature that cost an extra $1. The multiplier doesn't apply to a jackpot.",
      "The new rules have two main goals: to address what the industry calls \u201cjackpot fatigue\" and to differentiate Mega Millions from Powerball, the other lottery draw game played across the country.",
      "Jackpot fatigue is the phenomenon under which prizes must grow to enormous amounts before most players will take note and buy a few tickets. These days, a $300 million prize that once drew lines at mini-marts barely registers.",
      "With the new rules, officials expect those average winning jackpots to climb from about $450 million to $800 million, Johnston said. And they believe that even lottery fatigue is no match for the more frequent billion-dollar prize.",
      "\u201cWhen you get to a billion people are like, \u2018Whoa, that\u2019s a whole lot of money,'\u201d Johnston said.",
      "Lottery officials said there is a clear correlation between bigger jackpots and higher sales, but not everyone who plays is swayed by the bigger pots.",
      "Sandie Yeaman, of Omaha, Nebraska, expressed puzzlement at the connection.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be satisfied with $1 million, and so would others,\" she said. \"One person winning $50 million is ridiculous.\u201d",
      "Mega Millions will be the country's most expensive lottery draw game, where random numbers are selected to determine a winner.",
      "Still, that price is far less than scratch tickets offered by some states. In Texas, for example, some scratch tickets cost $100 each.",
      "Outside the U.S., the El Gordo Christmas lottery in Spain limits the number of tickets sold and charges 20 euros (nearly $22) for a partial ticket and 200 euros (nearly $220) for a full ticket.",
      "The higher Mega Millions price left Saeedith Williams, of East Point, Georgia, unsure if he'll keep buying several tickets per week. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll buy one ticket a week now that it\u2019s $5 a ticket,\u201d he said.",
      "After the new rules are implemented, the two lottery games that once were remarkably similar now will have some key differences.",
      "The biggest contrast will be the cost, as Powerball will stick with its $2 tickets \u2014 $3 in Idaho and Montana where they require a special prize bundle.",
      "With that smaller ticket price will come smaller minimal prizes, starting at $4, or less than half the lowest Mega Millions prize. But Powerball players will still be able to pay an extra dollar for \u201cPower Play,\u201d a random multiplier that, as in Mega Millions, can increase all but the grand prize.",
      "Powerball drawings will continue to be three times a week \u2014 Monday, Wednesday and Saturday nights \u2014 while Mega Millions will hold drawings on Tuesday and Friday.",
      "The changes will bring the two games' jackpot odds a little closer, with Powerball jackpot odds of 1 in 292.2 million just a bit worse than the new Mega Millions odds.",
      "For players, it's a chance to spend a little money on a dream of incredible riches while acknowledging the reality that it almost certainly won't happen.",
      "For the 45 states plus Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Virgin Islands where Mega Millions is played, the game raises money for a variety of services, such as education scholarships. Local lottery agencies run the game in each jurisdiction and decisions about how the profits are divvied up are written into state law.",

      "President Donald Trump says he's considering additional tariffs on China",
      "WASHINGTON -- Undeterred by a panicked stock market, President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on China on Monday, raising fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war.",
      "Trump's threat came after China said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs he announced last week.",
      "\u201cIf China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cAdditionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\u201d",
      "The U.S. president has shown few signs of backing down on tariffs despite the mounting pressure in the financial markets. His commitment to tariffs could have devastating effects for the global economy, even though Trump is banking that it will ultimately pay off with manufacturing jobs.",
      "Asked Monday if he would consider a pause on his widespread tariffs, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re not looking at that.\u201d The U.S. president said he was open to negotiations \u201cif we can make a really fair deal and a good deal for the United States.\u201d Trump added that it\u2019s possible to have both negotiated settlements with other countries and permanent tariffs.",
      "Even as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would take its tariffs against U.S. goods to zero, Trump was noncommittal about removing the new import taxes placed on an ally. The White House also said Monday that Trump would veto a Senate bill that would mandate congressional approval for new tariffs, a bet that the critical mass of Republican lawmakers will loyally back him despite the economic and political risks.",
      "However, there are signs of frustration even among Trump\u2019s allies. Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said he supports the president\u2019s goals of better trade deals but worries about the economic uncertainty.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the medicine will be worse than the disease,\u201d Kennedy said, adding, \u201cThis is President Trump\u2019s economy now.\u201d",
      "If Trump implements his new taxes on imports from China, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of the 20% tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week. Not only could that increase prices for American consumers, it could also give China an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners.",
      "China responded angrily and said it would not back down.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the U.S.,\" said a statement from the Commerce Ministry in Beijing. \"China will never accept this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.\u201d",
      "After sell-offs on the prior two days of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday fell 0.9%. The S&P 500 slumped 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite was up 0.1%.",

      "Ishiba said he told Trump that he's \u201cstrongly concerned\u201d that tariffs would discourage investment from Japan, which has been the world\u2019s biggest investor in the U.S. in the past five years. He described the situation as a \u201cnational crisis\u201d and said his government would negotiate with Washington to urge Trump to reconsider the tariffs.",

      "Trump said he appreciated \u201cvery much\u201d what Netanyahu had said. But when asked if he would remove the tariffs, Trump said \u201cmaybe not\u201d because of the aid that the United States provides to Israel.

But the agency also cautions expansion of biofuel should have minimal impact on land-use, food and other environmental factors in order to be developed sustainably.",
      "That's of particular concern in Indonesia, where more than 74 million hectares (285,715 square miles) of Indonesian rainforest \u2014 an area twice the size of Germany \u2014 have been logged, burned or degraded for development of palm oil, paper and rubber plantations, nickel mining and other commodities since 1950, according to Global Forest Watch.",
      "Indonesia has vast potential for bioethanol production due to its extensive agricultural land but currently lacks sustainable feedstocks, like sugarcane and cassava. A previous attempt to introduce bioethanol-blended fuel in 2007 was discontinued a few years later due to a lack of feedstock supply.",
      "Since then, the government has accelerated work on its food and energy estate mega-project, which spans 4.3 million hectares (about 10.6 million acres) on the islands of Papua and Kalimantan.

      "An unpublished government feasibility assessment obtained and reviewed by The Associated Press estimates that carbon dioxide emissions from clearing land for the project will total 315 million tons of C02 equivalent. An independent assessment by the Indonesia-based think tank Center of Economic and Law Studies estimated double that.",

      "Startup businesses require capital, and interest rates on loans from banks in Kakuma are typically around 20%. Few refugees have the collateral and documentation needed to take out a loan.",
      "Denying them access to credit is a tremendous waste of human capital, said Julienne Oyler, who runs Inkomoko, a charity providing financial training and low-cost loans to African businesses, primarily in displacement-affected communities.",
      "\u201cWe find that refugee business owners actually have the characteristics that make world-class entrepreneurs,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cThey are resilient. They are resourceful. They have access to networks. They have adaptability. In some ways, what refugees unfortunately have had to go through actually makes a really good business owner.\u201d",
      "Other options available include microloans from other aid groups or collective financing by refugee-run groups. However, the sums involved are usually insufficient for all but the smallest startups.",
      "One of Inkomoko\u2019s clients in Kakuma, Adele Mubalama, led seven young children \u2014 six of her own and an abandoned 12-year-old she found en route \u2014 on a hazardous journey to the camp through four countries after the family was forced to leave Congo in 2018.",
      "At the camp it took six months to find her husband, who had fled two months earlier, and six more to figure out how to make a living.",
      "\u201cIt was difficult to know how to survive,\u201d Mubalama said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how to get jobs and there were no business opportunities.\u201d",
      "After signing up for a tailoring course with a Danish charity, she found herself making fabric masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Able to borrow from Inkomoko at half the rate charged by banks, she expanded, taking on 26 employees and buying new sewing machines. Last year she made a profit of $8,300 \u2014 a huge amount when many refugees live on allowances or vouchers of about $10 or less a month.",
      "Another beneficiary is Mesfin Getahun, a former soldier who fled Ethiopia for Kakuma in 2001 after helping students who had protested against the government. He has grown his \u201cJesus is Lord\u201d shops, which sell everything from groceries to motorcycles, into Kakuma\u2019s biggest retail chain. That's thanks in part to $115,000 in loans from Inkomoko.",
      "Trading with other towns is also essential. Inkomoko has linked refugee businesses with suppliers in Eldoret, a city 300 miles (482 kilometers) to the south, to cut out expensive middlemen and help embed Kakuma into Kenya's economy.",
      "Some question the vision of Kakuma becoming a thriving, self-reliant city.",
      "Rahul Oka, an associate research professor with the University of Notre Dame said it lacks the resources \u2014 particularly water \u2014 and infrastructure to sustain a viable economy that can rely on local production.",
      "\u201cYou cannot reconstruct an organic economy by socially engineering one,\u201d said Oka, who has studied economic life at Kakuma for many years.",
      "Two-way trade remains almost nonexistent. Suppliers send food and secondhand clothes to Kakuma, but trucks on the return journey are usually empty.",
      "And the vast majority of refugees lack the freedom to move elsewhere in Kenya, where jobs are easier to find, said Freddie Carver of ODI Global, a London-based think tank.",
      "Unless this is addressed, solutions offering greater opportunities to refugees cannot deliver meaningful transformation for most of them, he said.",
      "\u201cIf you go back 20 years, a lot of refugee rights discourse was about legal protections, the right to work, the right to stay in a country permanently,\u201d Carver said. \u201cNow it\u2019s all about livelihoods and self-sufficiency. The emphasis is so much on opportunities that it overshadows the question of rights. There needs to be a greater balance.\u201d",

      "Kris Jenkins, who made the winning shot for Villanova in the 2016 college basketball championship game, is suing the NCAA and six conferences to recoup income he contends he would have earned if athletes at the time were not barred from making money from their name, image and likeness.",
      "Jenkins is among some 350 current and former athletes who have opted out of a $2.8 billion antitrust settlement with the NCAA that's on the cusp of final approval. Some of the opt-outs have filed lawsuits to pursue lost income on their own.",
      "NCAA athletes weren't allowed to make NIL money until July 2021. The so-called House settlement would provide back pay for athletes dating back to 2016, with the amount for each generally determined by sport and how much the athlete played. Jenkins played at Villanova from 2013-17 and in his last two seasons started 72 of 76 games and averaged 13 points per game.",
      "Attorney Kevin T. Duffy Jr. of Greenwich, Connecticut, filed Jenkins' lawsuit Saturday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. It requests a jury trial and compensation for Jenkins to be determined at trial. The NCAA declined to comment.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Jenkins is entitled to a share of the largesse associated with Villanova winning the national title on his buzzer-beating 3-pointer.",
      "As a result of that shot, the lawsuit says, the NCAA reportedly paid the Big East $19.1 million to distribute among its member schools; the athletic department received a $22.6 million gift, largest in program history; and the athletic program generated $11.4 million in revenue and fully funded its non-revenue sports.",
      "The lawsuit notes alumni donations increased 27% in 2016, enrollment increased and that the publicity value of winning the title was about $250 million and about $1 billion if the value of the game broadcasts were factored in.",
      "The lawsuit says because of the NCAA's restraints on athlete compensation, Jenkins was denied a share of game telecast revenue and compensation he would have received for media broadcast uses of his NIL (\u201cBNIL\u201d) as well as income he would have earned for his NIL from third parties for use in video games and other opportunities, including marketing, sponsorship, social media, branding and promotional and other NIL deals.",
      "The Atlantic Coast Conference, Big East, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and Southeastern Conference were named as defendants, the lawsuit said, because each participated with the NCAA in the \u201ccollusive restraint of trade and other violations of law alleged in this Complaint.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe game plan was the most physical team is going to win,\u201d Gators guard Alijah Martin said.",
      "The Cougars had four turnovers in the final 1:21 of their 65-63 loss, the last one ending the game.",
      "\u201cJust great down the stretch, how hard we played defensively,\u201d Australian post Alex Condon said. \u201cI think we got nine stops towards the end of the game. Yeah, it was just a team effort to get this win. It was crazy.\u201d",
      "Emanuel Sharp was unable to get off a 3-pointer with Walter Clayton Jr. running toward him and leaping with his left arm extended. Since the Houston guard was in the air himself, all he could do in was to let the ball fall to the floor \u2014 or get called for a travel when his feet came down.",
      "With Sharp desperately screening Clayton in hopes that one of his teammates would be able to get the loose ball and get off a shot, Condon instead dived to the floor and reached out to get it with his hands while the clock was running out.",
      "\u201cHe had an unbelievable shot contest,\u201d Cougars guard L.J. Cryer said of Clayton. \u201cHe definitely made a winning play.\u201d",
      "Houston trailed only 63 seconds all night, and yet fell short of its first national championship.",
      "For Florida, it was a beautiful ugly. The Gators overcame a 12-point deficit after halftime for their third national championship, in their first title game since winning back-to-back in 2006 and 2007.",
      "The Gators hadn't led since 8-6 until Alijah Martin hit two free throws with 46 seconds left to go up 64-63. That came right after Cryer was stripped underneath the Houston basket and Condon came away with the ball.",
      "Sharp also had a turnover when Will Richard had a steal with 26 seconds left that led to another free throw. Houston then called timeout with 19 seconds remaining to set up a final play.",
      "Cryer got the ball to Sharp, who had no chance to complete his jumper with Clayton charging toward him.",
      "\u201cWe had a chance to win, just didn\u2019t get a shot off,\u201d said Houston big man J\u2019Wan Roberts, who part of 149 wins while playing in five seasons since getting to Houston six years ago.",
      "When the buzzer sounded, Sharp remained crouched on the court near that spot for an extended period. He was consoled by teammate Ja\u2019Vier Francis \u2014 and Clayton, like Sharp from the Tampa Bay area.",
      "The Cougars had only nine turnovers in the entire game, but four came after Cryer\u2019s putback of his own miss with 2:29 left for a 62-60 lead.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just going through those last two possessions more than anything else. Incomprehensible in that situation we couldn\u2019t get a shot, couldn\u2019t get a shot,\u201d Cougars coach Kelvin Sampson said. \u201cBut Florida was doing a good job running us off the line and forcing us to score it. We just didn\u2019t do a very good job of finishing some shots.\u201d",

      "The conversation around a joint men's and women's Final Four has resurfaced",
      "TAMPA, Fla. -- Millions tuned in to watch women's basketball powerhouses UConn and South Carolina dominate in the Final Four on Friday. Many more watched Houston and Florida stun their opponents in the men's Final Four a day later.",
      "Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman sees a world where both premier events happen in the same place.",
      "It's not a new conversation, but Ackerman believes the exponential growth of women's basketball in a landscape long dominated by the men makes now an ideal time for a joint Final Four.",
      "\u201cYou will get people to say that it shouldn\u2019t happen,\" said Ackerman, who has been commissioner of the Big East since 2013. \u201cThat the women\u2019s tournament is doing just fine. And that\u2019s not without merit. I\u2019m saying if the NCAA is looking for growth \u2014 and it is \u2014 and is looking for revenue growth \u2014 and it is. I can\u2019t think of many ways you could accomplish that in a significant way versus in an incremental way than combining the two Final Fours.\"",
      "The men and women\u2019s basketball tournaments would hold their semifinals and title games in the same city on the same weekend, with similar staggered scheduling as there currently is. Though a combined Final Four likely couldn\u2019t take place until at least 2032, with sites on both sides locked in until 2031.",
      "NCAA President Charlie Baker isn't opposed to the idea, which would have to be approved by a committee of NCAA, but he acknowledged there would be challenges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not something they don\u2019t discuss,\" Baker said. \"They do. I think there are two big issues with it. The biggest one is just finding a place that would be able to make that whole thing work. Just logistically (it) would be challenging.\u201d",
      "Combining the tournaments was also recommended several years ago after an external review of gender disparities between the men's and women's tourneys. The scathing report was released in August 2021 by a law firm hired by the NCAA, sparked by social media and player complaints about glaring differences in amenities at the men's and women's sites.",
      "Ackerman said the idea she's been pushing for over 10 years should at least be considered. She wrote a paper for the NCAA in 2013 proposing ideas for more equity in the championships, including combining both Final Fours.",
      "With different sites, many commissioners, athletic directors and school officials find themselves having to choose which tournament to attend, Ackerman said. And because more ancillary events and sponsorship activations happen at the men's site, those officials often end up at that one instead of the women's tournament.",
      "\u201cThere's a symbolism there that shouldn\u2019t be overlooked,\u201d Ackerman said, \u201cwhich is, we\u2019re trying to build women\u2019s basketball. We need everybody on board to do that. We need the athletic directors here (at the women's tournament). ... We\u2019re losing that sort of spiritual support, if you will, for women\u2019s basketball because it\u2019s head to head with the men\u2019s Final Four, which is a magnet for all the networking and business activity.\u201d",
      "Ed Desser, the sports media executive who co-authored that 2021 gender equity analysis, said it makes financial sense to combine the tournaments, as it creates a central location for everyone, including NCAA staff, to operate from.",
      "\u201cSecondly, you have the opportunity, which may have seemed like a bit of a fantasy a few years back, but nowadays, the notion of filling up a dome to see the women\u2019s finals makes a lot of sense,\u201d Desser said. \u201cAnd that creates operating efficiencies and creates substantial additional revenue opportunities.\u201d",
      "Las Vegas was one of the large metropolitan areas that Ackerman said could work for a combined tournament. The city, which has the WNBA's Aces, the NFL's Raiders and the NHL's Golden Knights, has hosted the NBA Summer League \u2014 with 30 teams \u2014 since its inaugural season in 2004.",
      "There are also concerns that the women could be overshadowed by the men if the tournaments were held in the same place.",
      "John Kosner, a digital media consultant, who co-authored the gender equity report with Desser, said women's basketball's expanding reach should quell those apprehensions.",
      "Last year's women\u2019s NCAA championship game drew a bigger television audience than the men\u2019s title game for the first time, with an average of 18.9 million viewers watching undefeated South Carolina beat Iowa and superstar Caitlin Clark.",
      "This year's tournament has seen a slight decrease in ratings so far, which shouldn't come as a surprise with Clark now in the WNBA. Still, the early rounds were the second-most watched ever, as many tuned in to see big names like Paige Bueckers and UConn gear up for their national championship run.",
      "\u201cThe Women\u2019s Final Four has been incredibly exciting,\u201d said Florida men's basketball coach Todd Golden. \u201cI think it would be pretty neat to be able to bring the fan bases, both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s side, together and have an experience like that. There is never too much great basketball that you can have going on at the same place at the same time, especially in the collegiate ranks.\u201d",
      "UConn coach Geno Auriemma and LSU's Kim Mulkey weren't happy with the current Super Regional format for the women's tournament because of what they described as travel inconveniences and an inability for much of their fanbases to get to their games in Spokane, Washington.",
      "It\u2019s the third season that the four women\u2019s regionals have been consolidated into two sites. This year, the Sweet 16 and Elite Eight were played in Spokane and Birmingham, Alabama.",
      "The Huskies traveled cross-country from Connecticut to Washington, then flew nearly 3,000 miles back to Tampa for the semifinals the day after their Elite Eight game. Auriemma criticized the format again during the Final Four.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to shortchange\" the players, he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to sell them short, you know? ... You shouldn\u2019t be trying to make more money by shortchanging their experience. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anybody on the guys\u2019 side and the committee is going, \u2018I think we can save a couple dollars if we do this.\u2019 I don\u2019t think they worry about that.\u201d",
      "Baker said the goal of the Super Regional was to increase attendance and improve the quality of the experience for the players, which seems to be in line Ackerman's proposal.",
      "\u201cIt worked,\u201d Baker said. \u201cI mean, the attendance is up dramatically over the last three years in the regional rounds as a result of that.\u201d",
      "Baker also estimated the NCAA spent at least $15 million on the women\u2019s tournament over the past few years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure when the tournament\u2019s over, people will sit down,\u201d he said, \"the committee will take all the feedback they got from everybody they heard from and make decisions for the future.\"",

      "\u201cI congratulate you on your outstanding record. You have surpassed legendary masters in the number of goals scored in National Hockey League regular-season games,\u201d Putin said in a statement released by the Kremlin on Monday.",
      "Breaking Gretzky\u2019s record \u201chas become not only your personal success, but also a real celebration for fans in Russia and abroad,\u201d Putin added. \u201cI wish you health, good fortune (and) fighting spirit to conquer new heights in life and in sports.\u201d",

      "Alex Ovechkin's pursuit of Wayne Gretzky's NHL goals record became the talk of the league a time of the season usually reserved only for playoff races",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Alex Ovechkin could not contain his happiness moments after scoring his 895th goal to break Wayne Gretzky's NHL record and etch his name into the history books.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d he told teammates in an electric visiting arena with over 17,000 fans locked in on his every move. \"It\u2019s history! Yeah!\u201d",
      "Ovechkin celebrated No. 895 with the same joy he oozed after so many of his first 894, bellyflopping onto the ice like he did into fountains in Washington when he and the Capitals won the Stanley Cup in 2018. That was the high-water mark for the franchise earning its first championship, but this stuck out in a different way.",
      "The Cup gets handed out once a year. Ovechkin broke a record that stood for more than three decades, with the chance for his reign to last even longer. At a time of the season in a team-centric sport that is usually reserved only for playoff races, Ovechkin's \u201cGR8 Chase\u201d captivated the hockey community and brought joy not only to the sport but the rest of the world eager to witness something special.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a testament to Ovi,\u201d said center Dylan Strome, who along with Tom Wilson had the assists on Ovechkin's record-breaker Sunday in a 4-1 loss to the New York Islanders. \u201cEveryone wants to see him succeed because he\u2019s such a happy guy. It doesn\u2019t matter if he scores a goal or someone else scores a goal: He\u2019s just as happy. And I think that\u2019s a credit to him and his character, and you could see why other people are so happy for him because of the way he treats other people.\u201d",
      "The charismatic Russian superstar has made a career out of scoring like no one else and commemorating the moment even better. Whether it was jumping into the glass or mimicking that his stick was on fire, Ovechkin became one of the faces of the game for how he always acted like a little kid playing a grown-up sport.",
      "\"You just smile every time you see it,\" coach Spencer Carbery said, echoing Strome about Ovechkin being just as happy to see his teammates score. \u201cIt speaks to him, but also who he is as a captain and as a leader, of the happiness and joy that he has to win and to see others have success and others to score goals, as well.\u201d",
      "No team or goaltender wanted to be the one to give up No. 895, but the Islanders \u2014 and netminder Ilya Sorokin, specifically, giving Ovechkin his stick when asked \u2014 still had full appreciation of the moment they were a part of.",
      "\u201cNo matter what team you were cheering for tonight, everyone was a hockey fan,\" Islanders captain Anders Lee said. \u201cEveryone on our side and their side can appreciate Ovi's accomplishment.\"",
      "The run-up to the accomplishment was half the fun. Goal-counters from Washington to Moscow tracked the quest. Ticket prices surged and subsided based on how close Ovechkin was to catching and passing Gretzky.",
      "If the pressure was mounting on Ovechkin at 39 in the twilight of his career, he sure didn't show it. And the Capitals made it their life's work to get him the record.",
      "It finally came midway through the 77th game out of 82, bringing relief to everyone involved.",
      "\u201cOver the last couple of weeks, it has now turned into he\u2019s right there,\u201d Carbery said. \u201cAnd for us, especially as coaches, we go to the hundreds and hundreds of hours that we\u2019ve been trying to figure out ways to get him the next goal. (When) you\u2019ve been working 80-hour weeks for the last two years to try to help get the next goal, it\u2019s a pretty special moment for us to celebrate.\u201d",
      "The NHL and the Capitals put together a video montage of greats from Simone Biles and Michael Phelps to Tom Brady, LeBron James and Derek Jeter to congratulate Ovechkin. In that moment, it was clear this accomplishment transcended hockey \u2014 and even sports.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great for the game,\u201d Ovechkin said. \"It\u2019s great for us to be involved for this moment. ... Right now, people celebrate, people are happy and I\u2019m just happy to be a part of it.\u201d",
      "Longtime teammate John Carlson, who assisted on the tying 894th goal on Friday night in the first half of a wild weekend party, said he and the Capitals \u201cwere just along for the ride.\u201d So was everyone else watching, and Ovechkin provided a ride of a lifetime.",

      "TAMPA, Fla. -- Women\u2019s college basketball has been on the rise these last few years, riding the wave of iconic players like Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, Paige Bueckers and JuJu Watkins.",
      "Now, with Clark and Reese in the WNBA, Bueckers headed to the league and Watkins sidelined for the foreseeable future with an ACL injury, it raises the question of who will pick up the torch and continue that momentum.",
      "There may be no clear candidate to become the face of the game, though there's no shortage of talented players, including UCLA\u2019s Lauren Betts, UConn freshman Sarah Strong and South Carolina freshman Joyce Edwards. And there are more looming on the horizon, like high school sensation Aaliyah Chavez will be making her collegiate debut at Oklahoma next season.",
      "The ratings for the women's NCAA Tournament leading into the title game Sunday didn\u2019t match last year\u2019s record numbers, though they were better than nearly every other year in NCAA history.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great sign that without Caitlin we\u2019re still certainly on the ascent,\u201d ESPN analyst Rebecca Lobo said. \u201cHopefully, that\u2019s the same even without the star power next year of Paige Bueckers and JuJu. The game is at place where it can still grow.\u201d",
      "The talent pool continues to get stronger, as was evident in the title game performances by Strong (24 points and 15 rebounds) and Edwards (10 points, five rebounds). As expected, both impacted the game though UConn came away with its 12th national championship, ending a nine-year drought with an 82-59 victory over South Carolina.",
      "\u201cRuns like this make you still feel relevant, you still have an impact. Kids still respond,\u201d Huskies coach Geno Auriemma said. \u201cOur coaching staff is really, really good at what they do. And I\u2019m fortunate enough to coach great kids who want to win for each other.\u201d",
      "Even though UConn was back on top at the end, more teams showed this season they could compete with the best. UCLA, which held the No. 1 spot in the AP poll for 14 weeks, had no seniors on its team and coming off its first NCAA Final Four ever, could go a step further next season.",
      "South Carolina will be back too with a young nucleus led by Edwards and MiLaysia Fulwiley.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited for what our team will look like next year,\u201d South Carolina coach Dawn Staley said. \u201cI am, because I do think they\u2019ll be talented enough to get here, especially with getting in the transfer portal and getting some experienced pieces that can help with this young group.\u201d",
      "Women's basketball, like other college sports, has changed the last few years with the transfer portal. There are over 1,200 players currently in the portal, a person with access to it shared with The Associated Press.",
      "Where some of those impact players \u2014 Olivia Miles, Cotie McMahon and Ta'Niya Latson \u2014 end up could not only shape which teams rise up to challenge UConn and South Carolina next season, but also which player separates herself from the rest.",

      "\u201cAt the Friendly Confines, we truly mean it when we say everyone\u2019s welcome, including the goose and her nest who took up residence in the bleachers,\u201d Cubs Senior Director of Communications Jennifer Martinez said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re giving her the space she needs while we\u2019ve been working closely with a wildlife organization to manage the situation safely and responsibly, in full accordance with state law. In the meantime, we have blocked off the area to fans. Protecting our fans, and our feathered guest, is our top priority.\u201d",
      "One goose appeared to be sitting on the nest a couple of hours before first pitch but took off flying with its mate.",
      "\u201cThey wanted the best view of the game,\u201d said Michael Pardun, 26, of Chicago, who attended the game with friends in the bleachers. \u201cThey\u2019re diehard fans.\"",

They saw the female goose nesting during the Cubs\u2019 home opener Friday and again Saturday. They said they thought the geese chose the bushy area when the ballpark was quiet before the Cubs played their first home game, a 3-1 victory over the Padres.",
      "\u201cShe was pretty calm for 42,000-plus people,\u201d Hultine said of the female goose.",
      "The geese became agitated when fans banged on a nearby wall during Friday\u2019s game, Hultine said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re both keeping an eye on things,\u201d Hultine said. \u201cThe male will keep sentry for a while. Opening day, he was above the press box sitting up by one of the flags. When she got a little upset when guys were banging, she honked and he did come back and he was up there for a very short time with his wings out and he was hissing.\u201d",
      "Hultine has been attending games for more than 60 years, and she and Zenor were married at Wrigley. She said this is the first time she has seen a goose nest in the ballpark.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m glad they\u2019re protecting them now,\u201d Zenor said.",

    "story": [
      "Alex Ovechkin has broken Wayne Gretzky\u2019s record for the most goals in NHL history by scoring the 895th of his career",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Alex Ovechkin has broken Wayne Gretzky\u2019s record for the most goals in NHL history by scoring the 895th of his career.",
      "The Washington Capitals\u2019 captain made history Sunday against the New York Islanders by beating fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin on a power play with 12:34 left in the second period. He took a perfect pass from longtime teammate Tom Wilson and fired an absolute laser past Sorokin with defenseman Jakob Chychrun screening.",
      "Ovechkin had never scored on Sorokin before, making his countryman the 183rd different goaltender he has beaten. He dived onto the ice to celebrate as so many Capitals fans in attendance chanted \u201cOvi! Ovi!\u201d from the stands.",
      "Just as they did after he scored No. 894, teammates mobbed the 39-year-old Ovechkin to celebrate the accomplishment, which replaced a record that had stood for 31 years. Ovechkin then hugged team equipment and training staff on the bench and went through a handshake line with the Islanders as crew members set up for the 895 ceremony.",
      "Gretzky\u2019s total of 894 goals had long seemed unapproachable. Ovechkin passed it even after missing 16 games in November and December because of a broken left leg, a testament to his durability and a knack for putting the puck in the net consistently for two decades. He surpassed 40 goals this season for a 14th time \u2014 two more than Gretzky and also the most in league history.",
      "Even before this, Ovechkin owned the NHL records for power-play goals, shots on goal and the most goalies scored against, now adding Sorokin to that list. Only Gretzky has more multi-goal games, and Ovechkin earlier this season became just the sixth player with 700 goals and 700 assists, joining Gretzky, Gordie Howe, Jaromir Jagr, Marcel Dionne and Phil Esposito.",
      "Ovechkin last moved up the all-time goal-scoring list Dec. 23, 2022, when he got Nos. 801 and 802 to tie and pass Howe.",
      "The chase by the Great 8, a nickname honoring his jersey number, captured attention from North America to Ovechkin\u2019s native Russia, where billboards and goal-counters cheered on and tracked his effort. It helped Ovechkin that his team is one of the best in the NHL this season, defying expectations.",
      "Gretzky broke Howe\u2019s record a little over 31 years ago, since he scored 802 on March 23, 1994. He added 92 more before retiring in 1999 after a total of 1,487 games over 20 seasons.",
      "Even with this one falling to Ovechkin \u2014 which he has said he is excited about \u2014 Gretzky holds 55 NHL records, and two seem truly untouchable: 2,857 total points and 1,963 assists, the latter of which is more than anyone else has in goals and assists combined.",
      "For NHL playoff goals, which do not count toward the record, Gretzky has the most (122). Ovechkin has 72. Gretzky also had another 56 in the World Hockey Association regular season and playoffs, while Ovechkin has 57 from his time in the KHL, Russia\u2019s top league.",
      "Returning to Russia to play in front of family and friends is an option at some point for Ovechkin, who has one season left after this one on the five-year, $47.5 million contract he signed in 2021, which took him through age 40 to give him enough time to chase Gretzky\u2019s record. Instead, he got it done earlier than just about anyone could have realistically expected.",

      "The Milwaukee Brewers placed left-hander Nestor Cortes on the 15-day injured list with a flexor strain in his left elbow, further depleting the team\u2019s starting pitching",
      "MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee Brewers placed left-hander Nestor Cortes on the 15-day injured list Sunday with a flexor strain in his left elbow, further depleting the team's starting pitching.",
      "The loss of Cortes leaves the Brewers with Freddy Peralta as the only healthy pitcher among those projected to be in the five-man rotation this season.",
      "Cortes' elbow problem surfaced last weekend following a rough outing that saw him give up three home runs on consecutive pitches and five overall in a 20-9 loss to the New York Yankees. Imaging tests revealed no structural damage, and Cortes threw six shutout innings against the Cincinnati Reds on Thursday night.",
      "\u201cLeading up to the game it wasn\u2019t feeling great but it felt good enough to pitch and that\u2019s what I did,\u201d Cortes said. \u201cAfter that is when I started feeling more sore than usual.\u201d",
      "Cortes said the elbow didn't feel right on Friday, and on Saturday he and the team agreed he needed to go on the injured list. Left-handed reliever Grant Wolfram was recalled from Triple-A Nashville.",
      "The Brewers said further testing would be done on Cortes' elbow.",
      "\u201cThis is not a situation that we think is going to be a long-term issue,\u201d assistant general manager Matt Kleine said. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the process of gathering information -- that\u2019ll take another few days -- but as of right now, this is looking more like a short-term issue than a long-term issue.\u201d",
      "Cortes has dealt with the injury before. He missed a month last season and, despite not being fully recovered, he returned to pitch for the Yankees in the World Series. Cortes said the reward of pitching in the World Series outweighed the risk of a potential long-term injury.",
      "\u201cIf I have a ring and then a year off of baseball, then so be it,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "Cortes didn\u2019t get the ring. He gave up a walk-off grand slam to Freddie Freeman in Game 1 and the Yankees lost in five games to the Los Angeles Dodgers. A few weeks later he was traded to Milwaukee in a deal that sent All-Star closer Devin Williams to New York.",
      "The Brewers were confident Cortes would be ready when spring training opened, and their medical staff devised a plan to build him up carefully for the regular season.",
      "\u201cBetween me and the medical staff, we\u2019ve had good communication,\u201d Cortes said. \u201cOnce I got traded, I got an MRI in the offseason and then going through the whole rehab process in the offseason gave us a better idea of where I stood with the arm.",
      "\u201cWe did a really good job in spring training so it sucks that we\u2019re here right now.\u201d",
      "Cortes is the eighth Brewers pitcher, and seventh starter, to land on the injured list.",
      "Milwaukee went into camp knowing they\u2019d be without Brandon Woodruff until at least May while he works his way back from shoulder surgery in September 2023. Robert Gasser was out, too, after undergoing Tommy John surgery last summer.",
      "DL Hall suffered a lat injury just before camp opened, and Aaron Ashby and Tobias Myers were lost to oblique injuries. Aaron Civale got in one start before he landed on the IL with a hamstring strain.",
      "To shore up depth, the Brewers signed veteran left-hander Jose Quintana in mid-March but he\u2019s yet to make a start. He has remained in Arizona to continue building up strength after his late arrival.",

It eventually provided them in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French and Samoan. The contract lapse comes as President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to slash spending in federal agencies, including cuts within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that have led to high employee vacancy rates at NWS offices.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Four space tourists who orbited the north and south poles returned to Earth on Friday, splashing down in the Pacific to end their privately funded polar tour.",
      "Bitcoin investor Chun Wang chartered a SpaceX flight for himself and three others in a Dragon capsule that was outfitted with a domed window that provided 360-degree views of the polar caps and everything in between. Wang declined to say how much he paid for the 3 1/2-day trip.",
      "The quartet, who rocketed from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center on Monday night, returned off the Southern California coast. It was the first human spaceflight to circle the globe above the poles and the first Pacific splashdown for a space crew in 50 years.",
      "The Chinese-born Wang, now a citizen of Malta, invited Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge and Australian polar guide Eric Philips, all of whom shared stunning vistas during their voyage.",
      "\u201cIt is so epic because it is another kind of desert, so it just goes on and on and on all the way,\u201d Rogge said in a video posted by Wang on X while gazing down from orbit.",
      "Mikkelsen packed the capsule with camera equipment and spent much of her time behind the lens.",
      "All four suffered from space motion sickness after reaching orbit, according to Wang. But by the time they woke up on day two, they felt fine and cranked open the window cover right above the South Pole, he said via X.",
      "Besides documenting the poles from 270 miles (430 kilometers) up, Wang and his crew took the first medical X-rays in space as part of a test and conducted two dozen other science experiments. They named their trip Fram2 after the Norwegian sailing ship that carried explorers to the poles more than a century ago. A bit of the original ship\u2019s wooden deck accompanied the crew to space.",
      "SpaceX said its decision to switch splashdown sites from Florida beginning with this flight was based on safety. The company said Pacific splashdowns will ensure that any surviving pieces of the trunk \u2014 jettisoned near flight\u2019s end \u2014 falls into the ocean.",
      "The last people to return from space to the Pacific were the three NASA astronauts assigned to the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission.",

      "Even as he grows older, Microsoft founder Bill Gates still fondly remembers the catalytic computer code he wrote 50 years ago that opened up a new frontier in technology.",
      "Although the code that Gates printed out on a teletype machine may look crude compared to what's powering today's artificial intelligence platforms, it played a critical role in creating Microsoft in April 1975 \u2014 a golden anniversary that the Redmond, Washington, company will celebrate on Friday.",
      "Gates, 69, set the stage for that jubilee with a blog post reminiscing on how he and his old high school friend \u2014 the late Paul Allen \u2014 scrambled to create the world's first \u201csoftware factory\u201d after reading an article in the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine about the Altair 8800, a minicomputer that would be powered by a tiny chip made by the then-obscure technology company, Intel.",
      "The article inspired Gates, who was just a freshman at Harvard University, and Allen to call Altair's maker, Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems, and promise the company's CEO Ed Roberts they had developed software that would enable consumers to control the hardware. There was just one hitch: Gates and Allen hadn't yet come up with the code they promised Roberts.",
      "Gates and Allen tackled the challenge by latching onto the BASIC computer language that had been developed in 1964 at Dartmouth College, but they still had to figure out a way to make the technology compatible with the forthcoming Altair computer, even though they didn't even have a prototype of the machine.",
      "After spending two months working on the program with little sleep, Gates finished the code that became the basis for the Altair's first operating system. \u201cThat code remains the coolest I\u2019ve ever written,\u201d Gates wrote in his blog post, which includes an option to download the original program.",
      "The code would go on to provide the foundation for a business that would make personal computers a household staple, with a suite of software that include the Word, Excel and PowerPoint programs, as well as the Windows operating system that still powers most PCs today.",
      "\u201cThat was the revolution,\u201d Gates said of the code in a video accompanying his post. \u201cThat was the thing that ushered in personal computing.\u201d",
      "Gates' recollection of the code is part of a nostalgic kick that he has been on this year as he prepares to turn 70 in October.",
      "The trip down memory lane included the February release of a memoir exploring his early years as an often-misunderstood child with few friends, and a hailing of the 25th anniversary of the philanthropic foundation he created after stepping down as Microsoft's CEO in 2000. The tech giant initially stumbled after Gates' departure but has been thriving under CEO Satya Nadella, and has amassed a market value of about $2.8 trillion.",
      "In his memoir, Gates also reflected on his tempestuous relationship with fellow PC pioneer, the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, whose company will be celebrating its golden anniversary next year.",
      "\u201cFifty years is a long time,\u201d said Gates, whose personal fortune is estimated at $108 billion. \u201cIt's crazy that the dream came true.\u201d",

Additional observations prompted scientists to reduce the threat to virtually zero, where it remains. But there's a slight chance it could hit the moon then. The asteroid swings our way every four years.",
      "NASA and the European Space Agency released the photos \u2014 showing the asteroid as a fuzzy dot \u2014 on Wednesday. Webb confirm the asteroid is nearly 200 feet (60 meters) across, or about the height of a 15-story building, according to the two space agencies. It\u2019s the smallest object ever observed by the observatory, the biggest and most powerful ever sent into space.",
      "Johns Hopkins University astronomer Andrew Rivkin said the observations by Webb served as \u201cinvaluable\u201d practice for other asteroids that may threaten us down the road. Ground telescopes also have tracked this particular space rock over the past few months.",

      "On Wednesday, after archaeological analysis, experts at the Vienna Museum gave a first public presentation of the grave \u2014 linked to \u201ca catastrophic event in a military context\" and evidence of the first known fighting ever in that region.",
      "The bodies of 129 people have been confirmed at the site in the Vienna neighborhood of Simmering. The excavation teams also found many dislocated bones and believe the total number of victims tops 150 \u2014 a discovery never seen before in Central Europe.",
      "\u201cWithin the context of Roman acts of war, there are no comparable finds of fighters,\" said Michaela Binder, who led the archaeological dig. \"There are huge battlefields in Germany where weapons were found. But finding the dead, that is unique for the entire Roman history.\u201d",
      "Soldiers in the Roman Empire were typically cremated until the 3rd century.",
      "The pit where the bodies were deposited suggests a hasty or disorganized dumping of corpses. Every skeleton examined showed signs of injury \u2014 to the head, torso and pelvis in particular.",

      "Carbon-14 analysis helped date the bones to between 80 and 130 A.D. That was cross-checked against known history of relics found in the grave \u2013 armor, helmet cheek protectors, the nails used in distinctive Roman military shoes known as caligae.",
      "The most indicative clue came from a rusty dagger of a type in use specifically between the middle of the 1st century and the start of the second.",

      "That amount of electricity is enough to power about 3 million homes.",
      "Construction is expected to begin this year and power could start flowing by 2027, the group said in a statement. The cost to prepare the site and build the data centers could exceed the initial $10 billion investment by billions more, the group said.",

The president has suggested he could extend the pause, but he has since said he expects a deal by Saturday, when the reprieve expires. He is meeting Wednesday with aides about possible suitors for TikTok. Oracle and the investment firm Blackstone are among the potential investors.",
      "Trump's action followed a fast-tracked free-speech challenge by TikTok and its users that ended with a unanimous Supreme Court ruling days before Trump's inauguration, in which the justices held that national security concerns overcame their usual receptivity to First Amendment claims.",
      "The court's opinions dealt at length with the potential for China to harvest vast quantities of TikTok users' data that could allow it to track the locations of federal employees and contractors.",
      "\u201cThe record before us establishes that TikTok mines data both from TikTok users and about millions of others who do not consent to share their information,\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a brief separate opinion. \u201cAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, TikTok can access \u2018any data\u2019 stored in a consenting user\u2019s \u2018contact list\u2019 \u2014 including names, photos, and other personal information about unconsenting third parties.\u201d",
      "TikTok, which has headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles, has said it prioritizes user safety, and China's Foreign Ministry has said China\u2019s government has never and will not ask companies to \u201ccollect or provide data, information or intelligence\u201d held in foreign countries.",
      "The day after the ruling, TikTok went dark for U.S. users, but it came back online after Trump vowed to stall the ban.",
      "The president's position has evolved over time. During his first term, he used an executive order to try to ban TikTok on national security grounds. But federal courts blocked it. His administration then tried to negotiate a sale of the platform, but it failed.",
      "Trump changed his tune during his 2024 campaign and said he would \u201csave TikTok,\u201d then credited the platform with helping him win more young voters. He issued the 75-day pause on the first day of his second term.",
      "The law allows for one 90-day reprieve, but only if there's a deal on the table and a formal notification to Congress.",
      "Trump's actions so far violate the law, said Alan Rozenshtein, an associate law professor at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe law does not permit the sort of \u2018extension\u2019 that Donald Trump has announced,\" Rozenshtein said.",
      "But both he and Kreps acknowledged a court challenge or other pushback is unlikely.",
      "\u201cWho\u2019s the constituency? You have 170 million Americans using the app, and they\u2019re pretty happy to see this continue to be available to them,\u201d Kreps said.",
      "It also might be hard for someone to establish the legal right, or standing, to sue, Rozenshtein said. A plaintiff would have to be able to show harm from the delay in enforcing the law, he said.",
      "More importantly, he said, the TikTok executive order was an early \"example of the Trump administration not caring about the rule of law.\u201d",
      "While Trump has directed the Justice Department not to seek fines from the tech companies, they still are taking a legal gamble, according to Democratic lawmakers who oppose the TikTok ban but also criticize Trump for his actions. A future administration might have its own reasons to pursue legal claims against Apple, Google and Oracle, they wrote Trump in a letter last week.",
      "Companies could face hundreds of billions of dollars in legal liability for facilitating TikTok's operations since the law's effective date of Jan. 19, Democratic Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Ed Markey of Massachusetts wrote.",
      "The companies themselves acknowledged their legally uncertain situation in their initial response to Trump's order. Oracle continued to provide cloud services to TikTok, the senators said, but \u201cApple and Google, however, initially came to a different decision and refused to reinstate TikTok in their app stores.\"",
      "The companies changed course only after receiving written assurance from the Justice Department.",
      "The Democrats have called for amending the law to extend the deadline for a sale to October. Other opponents of the TikTok ban support a full repeal.",
      "Among the few supporters of the ban to speak out is Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "But rather than take on Trump, Moolenaar has focused his criticism on ByteDance and its ties the Chinese Communist Party. \u201cIf ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\u201d Moolenaar said in remarks to a TikTok event on Capitol Hill last week.",
      "Several potential bidders have stepped forward.",
      "Perplexity AI presented ByteDance in January with a merger proposal that would combine Perplexity\u2019s business with TikTok\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "Another possibility is a consortium organized by billionaire businessman Frank McCourt, which recently recruited Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian as a strategic adviser. Investors in the consortium previously said they offered ByteDance $20 billion in cash for TikTok\u2019s U.S. platform. They had planned to redesign the popular app with blockchain technology they said would provide users with more control over their online data.",
      "Jesse Tinsley, the founder of the payroll firm Employer.com, had also organized a consortium, which included the CEO of the video game platform Roblox, and offered ByteDance more than $30 billion for TikTok.",

      "WASHINGTON -- As President Donald Trump's tariffs roil global markets, some of the thought leaders and influential podcasters who backed the Republican's campaign are voicing doubts.",
      "Barstool Sports owner Dave Portnoy, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and even Elon Musk are adding their voices to a number of congressional Republicans who have weighed in against the tariffs set to take effect on Wednesday.",
      "Here's a look at some of what they've said:",
      "\u201cWelcome to Orange Monday,\u201d Portnoy said on his \u201cDavey Day Trader\u201d financial livestream, just before markets opened this week, saying there\u2019s \u201cno political agenda\u201d to his commentary, other than to make money.",
      "After last week\u2019s market plunge, Portnoy said he had lost $7 million \u201cin stocks and crypto,\u201d a figure he estimated on Monday was likely closer to $20 million, or up to 15% of his net worth.",
      "But, Portnoy has said, he plans to stick with Trump, whom he has called \u201ca smart guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re smarter than me when it comes to these tariffs. I also think he\u2019s playing a high-stakes game here,\u201d Portnoy said last week on his livestream. \u201cI\u2019m gonna roll with him for a couple days, a couple weeks, see how this pans out.\u201d",
      "Founded by Portnoy in 2003 as a free sports and gambling newspaper, Barstool has grown into a digital platform covering sports, lifestyle, and entertainment, with hundreds of millions of followers. Portnoy has been a loyal Trump supporter since first endorsing him in 2016, interviewing the president at the White House in 2020.",
      "Rogan, one of the nation's most influential podcasters who endorsed Trump on the eve of last year's election, said in March that Trump's feud with Canada was \u201cstupid\u201d and bemoaned the fact that Canadians \u201cbooed us over tariffs\" during professional sporting events featuring teams from both countries.",
      "Rogan has recently broken with Trump in other areas, including over wide-ranging deportations, referring to a recent operation to detain immigrants as \u201chorrific.\u201d",
      "Just weeks before Election Day, Rogan taped a nearly three-hour podcast interview with Trump, an opportunity for the Republican nominee to highlight the hypermasculine tone that defined much of his 2024 White House bid.",
      "The pro-Trump hedge fund manager warned Sunday on X that \u201cwe are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter\u201d unless Trump took a more deliberate approach, likening the full tariff activation \u201ceconomic nuclear war.\u201d",
      "In another post later Sunday, Ackman assailed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as \u201cindifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing.\u201d The next day, Ackman apologized for his criticism claiming that Lutnick \u2014 previously the head of the financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald \u2014 could benefit from the tariffs because of its bond investments.",
      "But the hedge fund manager also reiterated his concerns about Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cI am just frustrated watching what I believe to be a major policy error occur after our country and the president have been making huge economic progress that is now at risk due to the tariffs,\u201d he wrote on X.",
      "Even the billionaire top adviser to Trump on overhauling the federal government is expressing skepticism about tariffs, which he has said would drive up costs for Tesla, his electric automaker.",
      "\u201cI hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally in my view to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,\u201d Musk said in a video conference with Italian politicians.",
      "On Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures,\u201d White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said that Musk \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand\u201d the situation.",
      "Musk fired back on Tuesday, calling Navarro \u201ctruly a moron\u201d and \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Utah became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water last month.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on Monday he plans to assemble a task force and ultimately change the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance to stop recommending adding fluoride.",
      "His comments came during a press conference in Utah, which just became the first state to ban fluoride from drinking water systems.",
      "The Associated Press was the first to report Kennedy's intended changes to the CDC guidance.",
      "The CDC currently recommends the use of fluoride to prevent cavities.",
      "If Kennedy, who has been outspoken in his support for removing fluoride from water, directs the CDC to change its guidance, it could lead to more cities and states removing fluoride from drinking water, a decision that's made on the local level.",
      "\"Fluoride should not be in the water,\" Kennedy said on Monday.",
      "But the CDC's guidance on fluoride is not enforceable, and a ban on fluoride, should it survive legal challenges, would ultimately need to come from the Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, also in Utah with Kennedy on Monday, announced that the EPA, too, is reviewing \"new science\" on fluoride. EPA sets the maximum level of fluoride in water.",
      "\"We're prepared to act based on the science,\" Zeldin said at the press conference.",
      "The review by EPA will \"inform any potential revisions to EPA's fluoride drinking water standard,\" a press release said, specifically citing a report from the National Toxicology Program, a government-run division.",
      "The August report found lower IQ in children who had higher levels of fluoride exposure -- about twice the level recommended limit for U.S. drinking water -- and said more research is needed to determine if the small doses recommended in the U.S. cause harm.",
      "\"Many substances are healthy and beneficial when taken in small doses but may cause harm at high doses. More research is needed to better understand if there are health risks associated with low fluoride exposures,\" the report said.",
      "The study was also cited in a federal judge's ruling in September that ordered the EPA to take steps to lower the potential risk of fluoride.",
      "U.S. District Judge Edward Chen said more research was needed to understand if the typical amounts of fluoride in the water in the U.S. were causing lower IQ in kids.",
      "\"I think we need to apply the cautionary principle in this country that we should do no harm,\" Kennedy said Tuesday. \"And it clearly is doing harm, and the tradeoff is IQ loss in kids, and we can't afford that in this country. We need all the brain power that we can to handle the challenges of the future.\"",
      "In November, shortly before the election, Kennedy pledged that the Trump administration would advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water on day one. That hasn't happened, but Monday's announcement marks a development toward Kennedy's goal.",
      "Fluoride is a mineral that naturally occurs in water sources like lakes and rivers, and is even naturally present in some foods and beverages, according to the American Dental Association (ADA).",
      "It is added to some dental products, such as toothpaste, to help prevent cavities. When it's added to drinking water, the CDC recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water. Fluoride is added to the drinking water systems in nearly two-thirds of the U.S., according to CDC data.",
      "High-quality studies show fluoride prevents cavities and repairs damage to teeth caused by bacteria in the mouth. Fluoride makes tooth enamel stronger and rebuilds weakened tooth enamel, the ADA says.",
      "Fluoride also replaces minerals lost from teeth due to acid breakdown, according to the CDC.",
      "Many doctors and dental associations argue that fluoride in water is still a crucial, low-risk and high-reward public health tool, especially for disadvantaged children and adults who may not be able to practice regular dental hygiene. Advocates stress that fluoride in drinking water has greatly improved Americans' oral health since it was first added in the 1950s.",
      "Responding to Kennedy and Zeldin's comments Tuesday, the ADA urged Kennedy and Zeldin to use high-quality research in their decision, saying that fluoride in water \"does not negatively impact IQ levels\" at U.S.-recommended levels.",
      "\"The growing distrust of credible, time-tested, evidence-based science is disheartening. The myths that fluoridated water is harmful and no longer necessary to prevent dental disease is troublesome and reminds me of fictional plots from old movies like Dr. Strangelove,\" said Brett Kessler, president of the ADA.",
      "\"When government officials, like Secretary Kennedy, stand behind the commentary of misinformation and distrust peer-reviewed research it is injurious to public health.\"",

It serves as the link between the political decision-makers and NATO's military structure..",

      "The accountability foundation complained in the letter to Hegseth that those responsible for DEI policies \"must be dismissed,\u201d adding that military leaders should be focused on cultivating lethality, not on fostering diversity, equity and inclusion in the ranks.",
      "The letter said Chatfield posted supportive comments on LinkedIn about a diversity summit and gave a speech in 2015 at Women's Equality Day. The group quoted her as saying that investing in empowering women can unlock human potential.",
      "And they also said she was quoted as saying, \u201cour diversity is our strength\u201d \u2014 a phrase that Hegseth has repeatedly condemned.",

      "\"So, we're going to see if we can avoid it,\" Trump continued. \"But it's getting to be very dangerous territory. And hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran's best interests if they are successful.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- Some Democratic-led states and cities are pushing back on a Trump administration threat to cut education funding over diversity, equity and inclusion programs, creating a standoff that could test how far the White House is willing to go to press its demands on the nation\u2019s schools.",
      "State leaders in Minnesota and New York said they will not comply with an Education Department order to gather signatures from local school systems certifying compliance with civil rights laws, including the rejection of what the federal government calls \u201cillegal DEI practices.\u201d Chicago\u2019s mayor promised to sue over any cuts. California and Vermont told schools they don't need to respond.",
      "It amounts to some of the most forceful opposition the Education Department has faced as it uses federal funding as leverage to enact President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda on issues from DEI to campus antisemitism and transgender athletes. The White House has targeted colleges and K-12 schools alike, but unlike universities that rely greatly on federal grants and contracts, school systems get the vast majority of their money from state and local sources.",
      "In a letter Monday to the Education Department, Minnesota\u2019s education chief said the Trump administration overstepped its authority with its latest demand, adding that there\u2019s nothing illegal about DEI.",
      "\u201cThreats to this funding without backing in law or established requirements put key programs at risk that students and schools depend on every day,\u201d said Willie Jett, Minnesota's education commissioner. The federal department \u201cdoes not have the authority to unilaterally overrule the will of Congress.\u201d",
      "Jett said his letter would \u201cserve as our response\u201d to the Trump administration\u2019s demand.",
      "It follows a Friday letter from New York\u2019s education office challenging the federal government\u2019s latest demand. It said New York already has provided assurances that it follows federal law and \u201cno further certification will be forthcoming.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Education Department told state agencies in a letter Thursday they must sign a document saying they follow federal antidiscrimination laws and get the same assurance from schools. The document threatens to cut federal money for any civil rights violation, including using DEI practices \u201cto advantage one's race over another.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, Education Secretary Linda McMahon commended Puerto Rico for being the first to submit its certification. \u201cEvery state that wants to continue receiving federal funds should follow suit,\u201d McMahon posted on X.",
      "The letter does not carry the force of law but threatens to use civil rights enforcement to rid schools of DEI practices. Schools that continue such practices \u201cin violation of federal law\u201d can face Justice Department litigation and a termination of federal grants and contracts, it said.",
      "The letter initially gave states 10 days to submit the certification. On Monday, the Education Department extended the deadline to April 24.",
      "A department spokesperson said the agency is \u201csimply asking school districts to certify they are following the law and not using race preferences or pernicious race stereotypes in schools.\u201d",
      "Even some Republican-led states believe they don\u2019t need to get the document signed by each school. Missouri\u2019s education office said schools previously provided assurances that should cover the department\u2019s demand and it will reach out to districts \u201cif additional information is necessary.\u201d",
      "Others are moving to follow the order, including Virginia and Arizona, where state education chief Tom Horne said the order \u201caligns completely with my philosophy.\u201d",
      "Vermont\u2019s education chief assured schools the state supports DEI practices and said superintendents won\u2019t need to sign the certification. Instead, the state will assure federal officials it\u2019s already following federal law, Zoie Saunders, the state\u2019s education secretary, said in a Monday letter to school districts.",
      "The Illinois board of education rebuked the federal agency, saying it\u2019s \u201cattempting to exert power over every district in the country \u2014 even as it claims it\u2019s returning education to the states.\u201d Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat, said his city is willing to go to court over the order, which he called federal overreach.",
      "The New York and Minnesota letters both cite past comments from Betsy DeVos, Trump\u2019s education secretary during his first term, extolling the virtues of diversity and inclusion. In a 2020 memo to agency staff, DeVos wrote that \u201cembracing diversity and inclusion are key elements for success.\u201d The states argue the Education Department is shifting its position without explanation.",
      "The states also accuse the Education Department of making broad declarations about the illegality of DEI without citing policies that violate federal law. Minnesota\u2019s letter said if the federal agency has identified DEI practices that violate civil rights law, \u201cwe request advisement of them.\u201d",
      "Many states said they\u2019re still reviewing the letter.",

Andy Beshear said during a news conference Monday, urging residents to find a safe place to stay.",
      "Inundated rivers are the latest threat from persistent storms that have killed at least 23 people since last week as they doused the region with heavy rain and spawned destructive tornadoes. At least 157 tornadoes struck within seven days beginning March 30, according to a preliminary report from the weather service.",
      "Though the storms have finally moved on, the flood danger remains high in several other states, including parts of Tennessee, Arkansas and Indiana.",
      "Cities ordered evacuations, and rescue crews in inflatable boats checked on residents in Kentucky and Tennessee, while utilities shut off power and gas in a region stretching from Texas to Ohio. Floodwaters forced the closure of the historic Buffalo Trace Distillery, close to the banks of the swollen Kentucky River near downtown Frankfort.",
      "Officials diverted traffic, turned off utilities to businesses and instituted a curfew in Frankfort as the river crested just short of a record Monday. More than 500 state roads across Kentucky were still closed Monday evening, Beshear said.",
      "Several miles north of Frankfort, RVs were parked at a makeshift campground Monday after fast-rising floodwaters chased a community of 90 RVs out of a park along the Kentucky River on Saturday. Everyone made it out safe, although a few RVs had to be left behind and were quickly submerged.",
      "\u201cIt was quite an ordeal to just kind of wake up, hit the ground and start running, make sure everybody was off the property, not only people but the equipment and the RVs,\u201d said Traci Yoder, manager of the RV park and a resident herself.",

      "The deaths also included a 5-year-old boy in Arkansas who police said died after a tree fell on his family\u2019s home, and a 16-year-old volunteer Missouri firefighter who died in a crash while seeking to rescue people caught in the storm.",
      "The Kentucky River crested at Frankfort Lock at 48.27 feet (14.71 meters) Monday, just shy of the record of 48.5 feet (14.8 meters) set there on Dec. 10, 1978, said CJ Padgett, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky, office.",

They say he and his alleged co-conspirators allegedly kicked and beat detainees using pipes and wires, sometimes covering the victims' heads with plastic bags, and also administering electric shocks to their bodies, including their genitals.",
      "His attorneys plan to argue that Correa was coerced to participate and acted under duress, according to court filings. Prosecutors and the defense have agreed that there is information indicating that members of the Junglers who did not carry out Jammeh's orders without question would be killed.",
      "Jammeh was a 22-year dictator of Gambia, a country surrounded by Senegal except for a small Atlantic coastline, and was accused of ordering opponents tortured, jailed and killed. He lost a presidential election and went into exile in Equatorial Guinea in 2017 after initially refusing to step down.",

Grasham to temporarily stop the state from restricting media witnesses from viewing the actual injection of lethal chemicals in any executions that may occur before the lawsuit is resolved.",

      "Former Idaho Department of Correction Director Josh Tewalt and other prison officials have told lawmakers in the past that anything threatening the confidentiality of execution team members or the source of the state\u2019s execution drugs could put Idaho\u2019s ability to carry out capital punishment at risk, in part because it would be difficult to find qualified volunteers willing to put someone to death.",
      "But the news organizations contend the public has a First Amendment right to witness the entire execution process, including when execution team members push the lethal injection medications into the IV lines connected to a condemned person.

      "MCALLEN, Texas -- Migrants who were temporarily allowed to live in the United States by using a Biden-era online appointment app have been told to leave the country \u201cimmediately,\u201d officials said Monday. It was unclear how many beneficiaries would be affected.",
      "More than 900,000 people were allowed in the country using the CBP One app since January 2023. They were generally allowed to remain in the United States for two years with authorization to work under a presidential authority called parole.",
      "\u201cCanceling these paroles is a promise kept to the American people to secure our borders and protect national security,\u201d the Department of Homeland Security media affairs unit said in response to questions.",
      "Authorities confirmed termination notices were sent to CBP One beneficiaries but did not say how many. They were urged to voluntary self-deport using the same app they entered on, which has been renamed CBP Home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time for you to abandon the United States,\" the Department of Homeland Security wrote to a Honduran family that entered the U.S. at the end of last year. The Associated Press reviewed the email received Sunday.",
      "Others shared the same email on social media platforms.",
      "Al Otro Lado, a nonprofit organization that provides legal aid to migrants, said some who received the revocation letters are from Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico.",
      "CBP One was a cornerstone of the Biden administration's strategy to create and expand legal pathways to enter the United States in an attempt to discourage illegal border crossings. By the end of December, 936,500 people had been allowed to enter with CBP One appointments at border crossings with Mexico. President Donald Trump ended CBP One for new entrants on his first day in office, stranding thousands in Mexico who had appointments into early February.",
      "Trump has ended and revoked temporary status for many who benefited under Biden\u2019s policies. Homeland Security said Monday that Biden\u2019s use of parole authority \u2014 more than any president since it was created in 1952 \u2014 \u201cfurther fueled the worst border crisis in U.S. history.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration has also announced an end to Temporary Protected Status for 600,000 Venezuelans and about 500,00 Haitians, though a federal judge temporarily put that on hold, including for about 350,000 Venezuelans who had been scheduled to lose TPS on Monday.

      "A man convicted of killing a woman who was abducted on her lunch break from her job at The Miami Herald is facing execution",
      "STARKE, Fla. -- A man convicted of killing a woman who was carjacked on her lunch break from her job at The Miami Herald is set to be executed on Tuesday evening.",
      "Barring a late reprieve, Michael Tanzi is scheduled to receive a lethal injection at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison for the April 2000 abduction and strangling of Janet Acosta.",
      "A production worker at the newspaper, the victim was beaten, robbed, driven to the Florida Keys and then strangled and her body left on an island.",
      "Tanzi, 48, would become the third inmate on Florida's death row executed this year, with another lethal injection scheduled on May 1 under death warrants signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "Court records show the victim was on a break from her job at the newspaper on April 25, 2000. She was sitting in her van reading a book when Tanzi approached her, asked for a cigarette and then began punching her in the face, the records indicate.",
      "\u201cHolding her wrist and threatening her with a razor blade,\u201d court records show, Tanzi drove to Homestead, south of Miami, where he stopped at a gas station and bound and gagged Acosta. He took $53 in cash from her, along with her bank card.",
      "They then went on to the Florida Keys town of Tavernier, where Tanzi used Acosta's bank card to steal money from her account, according to the records. They stopped at a hardware store where Tanzi bought duct tape and razor blades, and then Tanzi decided he had to kill Acosta, they added.",
      "\u201cHe drove to an isolated area in Cudjoe Key, told her he was going to kill her, and began to strangle her,\u201d according to a summary by the state Commission on Capital Cases. \u201cHe stopped to place duct tape over her mouth, nose and eyes in an attempt to quiet her and then strangled her until she expired.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Acosta's friends and co-workers reported her missing when she didn't return from her break. That led police to her van, which Tanzi had driven to Key West. Police said Tanzi confessed to the crime and showed investigators where he had left Acosta's body.",
      "\u201cIf I had let her go, I was gonna get caught quicker,\u201d Tanzi told officers, according to the record. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get caught. I was having too much fun ... I told her, I says, \u2018I can\u2019t let you go. If I let you go, then I\u2019m gonna be in a lot of trouble.\u2019 \u201d",
      "Tanzi was convicted of first-degree murder, carjacking, kidnapping and armed robbery. A Monroe County jury recommended the death sentence on a 12-0 vote for Acosta's slaying.",
      "Tanzi has filed several appeals, none successful. The Florida Supreme Court recently rejected his claim that he shouldn't be executed because he is \u201cmorbidly obese\u201d and suffers from sciatica, which could cause unconstitutional levels of pain. The court ruled that his appeal was not timely because his conditions had been known since 2009.",
      "\u201cAdditionally, this court has considered and rejected similar arguments based on obesity and IV procedures,\u201d the justices ruled.",
      "Two other convicted killers have been executed in Florida this year. Edward James, 63, was put to death on March 20 for killing an 8-year-old girl and her grandmother during a night of heavy drinking and drug use.",
      "James Dennis Ford, 64, was executed on Feb. 13 for killing a husband and wife at a remote farm in an attack witnessed by the couple\u2019s toddler, who survived the ordeal.",

      "The Philadelphia Police Department piloted its Crisis Intervention Teams on the Behavioral Health Unit a little more than two years ago, as a co-responder program that sends an officer with a mental health clinician or social worker to respond to crise...",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- On a frigid February morning, Vanity Cordero, a Philadelphia police officer, heard a call over the radio for a man threatening to jump from a bridge. The details sounded familiar.",
      "When Cordero arrived, she realized she\u2019d met him months earlier on the same bridge, where she talked him down by engaging him in conversation about his family and bringing him a hot meal.",
      "Cordero is a member of a program focused on de-escalation practices and to provide connections to services including follow-up support as an alternative to arrest and entering into the criminal justice system.",
      "The unit started as a pilot program in late 2022, nearly two years after the fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr., who was experiencing a mental health episode when police responded to his mother's call for help.",
      "Studies over the past two decades have shown a person with serious mental illness can be over 10 times more likely to experience use of force during police interactions.",
      "In the wake of Wallace's death, the police and the city both invested in programs to better respond to mental health crises \u2014 one of dozens of similar initiatives in other police departments across the country.",
      "What makes Philadelphia's unit unique is the robust follow-up resources and that most of the officers on Philadelphia's team, including Cordero, have personal experiences that made them want to join \u2014 family members with mental illness or addictions or previous work with at-risk populations.",
      "Cordero grew up living with her uncle, who her mother takes care of because of an intellectual disability that today would be diagnosed as autism, she said. She's an advocate for better practices for police interacting with autistic people.",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m on the street and I\u2019m serving in the community, I think of someone being my uncle or, you know, any family member. Everyone is a family member to someone,\u201d she said. \u201dIt just gives you a little bit more edge and patience and courteousness to the people that need your help.\"",
      "On this February morning, Cordero rushed to the bridge to help responding patrol officers.",
      "CIRT teams, who drive SUVs without police lights and department decals and wear less formal uniforms, are often requested by other officers to assist, and also choose calls to respond to citywide.",
      "She stayed back until she was needed, but the man spotted her and teased her about not being as tan as she was the last time they saw each other.",
      "They laughed about Cordero getting pale over the winter months and she reminded him it was cold outside, especially on that bridge.",
      "A few hours later, the man was on his way to a mandatory mental health hold and clinician Krystian Gardner would follow up in the coming days and offer resources to the man's family.",
      "A lot of officers on the team said many calls were about mental health when they were on regular patrol. But officers usually have just a few minutes to spend handling calls before being pulled to the next incident.",
      "The CIRT team, however, spends more than an hour on average with each person, said Lt. Victoria Casale, who oversees the unit.",
      "\u201cIn policing, there just isn't the resources or time to spend hours on calls,\u201d Casale said. \u201cBut we want our officers to spend time with people. We're not leaving you. We're trying to solve this problem with you.\u201d",
      "The team's clinicians, who work for the nonprofit Merakey, a behavioral health provider, also bring experience and resources to the table.",
      "Audrey Lundy, program director for Merakey, said one of her first calls with the unit reframed her perspective. Instead of doing a typical welfare check \u2014 on a mother who hadn't been to work in awhile \u2014 Lundy and the CIRT officer brought over groceries for the family using a flexible needs spending card. The woman had gotten sick, was unable to work and began experiencing a financial crisis.",
      "The groceries opened the door to a broader conversation about the resources that may be available to help her cover school costs, long-term expenses and ultimately, get back to her job.",
      "The officers like the idea of being problem solvers. For Officer Kenneth Harper, a Marine combat veteran, his CIRT assignment has given him the opportunity to help fellow veterans having a hard time readjusting to civilian life or dealing with mental health concerns.",
      "\u201cThere was a gentleman that served over 30 years in the Army \u2014 a very decorated, highly respected person,\u201d Harper said. \u201cBut he was very stubborn, never received any help or services.\u201d",
      "Harper and another officer with military experience built a rapport with the man, eventually getting him to the veterans hospital for treatment and help with housing.",
      "\u201cWe kept in touch for months after that, checking in,\u201d he said.",
      "Casale said Harper has gone far above and beyond, even recruiting other veterans in the department to share trainings about trauma responses and resources for vets.",
      "It's just one way the small unit has expanded its reach. The eight-officer CIRT team covers the entire city on weekdays, but crises don't stop on nights and weekends. Casale hopes the team can grow in numbers as districts across the city become familiar with and trust the work they do.",
      "They want people to call CIRT directly if they need help instead of waiting until it's an emergency and calling 911.",
      "\u201cWe want them to call us,\u201d Cordero said, of connecting with the man on the bridge. \u201cI told him, you know, you can call us. We can just go eat. We don\u2019t have to keep meeting on this bridge.\u201d",
      "___",
      "This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",

      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The growing ranks of New Mexico voters with no party affiliation will be allowed to vote in primary elections without changing their nonpartisan status, under a bill signed into law Monday by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.",
      "The change runs counter to outcomes of election reform efforts in many other states. Last year, voters in a mixture of politically red, blue and purple states rejected state ballot initiatives to ditch traditional partisan primaries or adopt ranked choice voting.",
      "New Mexico's shift to partially open primaries takes effect in time for the 2026 cycle, when parties nominate candidates for three congressional seats, one U.S. Senate seat and a long list of statewide offices, including governor as Lujan Grisham terms out of office. Seats in the Democrat-led state House also will be up for election.",
      "Statewide, about 23% of registered voters forgo partisan affiliation and previously were locked out of the primary nomination process if unwilling to join a major party. The change still prohibits crossover voting by members of opposing parties.",
      "Last year, voters in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and South Dakota all rejected either ranked choice voting, open primaries or a combination of both.",
      "Lujan Grisham voiced support for the shift toward open primaries at the close of a 60-day legislative session that left her openly frustrated with public safety initiatives and efforts to improve public education.",
      "\u201cI think the work to have open primaries is a step in the right direction for New Mexico, where we seem to not be able to govern, in a way,\" she said.",
      "The bill from Democratic sponsors, including state Senate Majority Leader Peter Wirth of Santa Fe, was opposed by the state Republican Party as a potential \u201cstepping stone\u201d to fully open primaries or ranked choice voting.",
      "The share of unaffiliated voters in New Mexico has swelled from 15% of registrations in 2004 to 23% this year.",
      "Among New Mexico\u2019s 33 counties, unaffiliated voters outnumber registered Democrats in Otero and Curry counties and outnumber Republicans in Los Alamos and Do\u00f1a Ana counties.",
      "Democrats hold majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature, control every statewide elected office and all three of New Mexico's congressional seats. Trump lost the state three times, while narrowing his margin of defeat in 2024.",

      "Although no reason was given, officials said it was apparently tied to comments she has made that supported diversity in the force.",
      "According to the officials, Chatfield got a call from Adm. Christopher Grady, the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and was told the administration wanted to go in a different direction with the job.",
      "The officials said they believe the decision was made last week by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, but it was unclear whether he received any direction from President Donald Trump. Three U.S. officials spoke about the firing on condition of anonymity to discuss personnel matters.",
      "Chatfield is the third top female officer to be fired since Trump took office. Hegseth announced in February that he was firing the chief of naval operations, Adm. Lisa Franchetti. And Trump fired Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan just a day after he was sworn in.",
      "Trump and Hegseth have been vocal in their insistence that so-called woke policies are dead. There has been a vigorous campaign to remove leaders who promoted diversity, equity and inclusion, and to erase DEI programs and online content.",
      "Chatfield was on a list of senior military officers targeted as \u201cwoke\u201d by the conservative American Accountability Foundation, which sent a letter to Hegseth saying that \u201cpurging the woke from the military is imperative.\u201d",
      "Chatfield, a Navy helicopter pilot who also commanded a joint reconstruction team in Afghanistan, had been serving as one of the 32 representatives on NATO's military committee. The panel is the primary source of military advice to the North Atlantic Council and NATO's Nuclear Planning Group, according to NATO. It serves as the link between the political decision-makers and NATO's military structure..",

      "The accountability foundation complained in the letter to Hegseth that those responsible for DEI policies \"must be dismissed,\u201d adding that military leaders should be focused on cultivating lethality, not on fostering diversity, equity and inclusion in the ranks.",

      "Officials say the Army has reenlisted more than 23 soldiers who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Army has reenlisted more than 23 soldiers who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, officials said Monday, rushing to implement President Donald Trump's order that troops be rehired and given back pay.",
      "Three people rejoined active duty Army service, and more than 20 came back either to the National Guard or the Reserve, the Army said. The soldiers have signed their contracts and were sworn in, and the active duty troops were reporting to their units, the Army said.",
      "None of the other services has completed reenlistments yet, but all are reaching out to former troops. The Marine Corps, Air Force, Army and Navy set up new websites on Monday to provide information for service members looking to reenlist. And they are sending letters and emails and making calls to those who were discharged.",
      "Trump has argued that the vaccine mandate wrongly pushed troops out and suggested that many would return. In an executive order signed a week after he took office, Trump said the vaccine mandate cost the military \u201csome of our best people\u201d and he vowed to \u201crehire every patriot who was fired from the military with \u2026 backpay.\u201d",
      "Those who may have been attracted by the offer of back pay will likely get far less money than they initially thought when Trump announced his plan. Under the details of the Pentagon offer, any wages earned during their time as civilians would be deducted from the back pay total, along with other payments they may have received.",
      "The Pentagon made the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory in August 2021 for all service members, including those in the National Guard and Reserve. Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said getting the vaccine was critical to maintaining a healthy, ready force. The Pentagon dropped the mandate in January 2023.",
      "The initial reenlistments come as the Pentagon last week formally increased the new minimum service commitment from two to four years for those discharged for refusing a lawful order to take the vaccine.",
      "A Feb. 7 memo sent to the secretaries of the military services said troops would be required to sign up for two years. But a memo signed April 1 by Jules Hurst III, who is doing the job of defense undersecretary for personnel, said \u201creinstatement will not be afforded to those who are unwilling or unable to return to active service or active status, as applicable, for four years.\u201d",
      "The Army said the bulk of the soldiers who reenlisted were those ordered out for refusing the shot, and they signed on for four years. They will be entitled to get some back pay. Several, however, left the Army voluntarily to avoid the shot, so they are allowed to reenlist for two years and will not get back pay.",
      "According to the new memo, there is an exception for anyone who would have been eligible for retirement within two years of the date they were originally discharged. Those service members also can reenlist for at least two years.",
      "Roughly 8,200 troops were discharged for refusing to obey the vaccine order. They have been allowed to rejoin since 2023, but that did not include any back pay. Just 113 reenlisted.",
      "The Army and Marine Corps have been sending out emails, texts and phone calls to service members for several weeks. The Navy and the Air Force had been waiting for the additional guidance.",
      "According to Army spokesman Christopher Surridge, about 400 soldiers have inquired so far about the reenlistment program. Of those, about 100 are in the application process. The Army did not have estimates on how much it has given the soldiers in total back pay.",
      "As of Friday, 472 Marines have indicated interest in learning more about returning. The Navy said about a half dozen sailors had so far expressed interest or sought more information, and the Air Force said it had not yet gotten any feedback from service members.",
      "The limited interest reflects what service leaders said early on, which was that many troops used the vaccine as a reason to leave and have moved on with their lives.",
      "Those eligible for back pay could get an amount that includes their basic salary, bonus payments, cost-of-living allowances and some health benefit costs. But that total will be reduced by any wages, veterans benefits, separation payments, debts and other amounts that were earned during that time.",
      "Service members will have to provide verified tax records and other paperwork as part of the process.",
      "According to the memo, the services must provide each person with an estimate of the amount of back pay they will receive. Service members will then have 60 days to decide whether to reenlist.",
      "Everyone who wants to reenlist must meet all military standards, including health, fitness and moral requirements. Service members have until Feb. 28, 2026, to seek reinstatement.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sharp tariff hikes last week have sent the stock market into a tailspin, raised alarm bells among Wall Street executives, and heightened many economists\u2019 worries that the U.S. could tip into recession",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's sharp tariff hikes last week have sent the stock market into a tailspin, raised alarm bells among Wall Street executives, and heightened many economists' worries that the U.S. could tip into recession.",
      "The tariffs, set to take effect Wednesday, include a 10% blanket duty on nearly all countries and additional import taxes on 60 nations. The increases are so large and are taking effect so rapidly that they are likely to be disruptive to the economy, economists say, even if they are partially rolled back through negotiations in the coming weeks or months.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs have raised their assessment of the odds the U.S. will experience a recession \u2014 where the economy shrinks and unemployment rises \u2014 to 45%, from 35% last week. And even that forecast assumes many of the duties are negotiated away or reduced. If not, \u201cwe expect to change our forecast to a recession,\u201d Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist, and his colleagues said in an analyst note.",
      "Other economists are raising similar alarms, with JPMorgan putting the odds of a recession at 60% and projecting inflation will reach 4.4% by the end of this year, up from 2.8% currently.",
      "Should the tariffs remain in place for an extended period, they will likely raise costs and uncertainty for businesses, which could reduce their willingness to hire, invest in new equipment or software, or expand into new markets. Americans could cut back on their spending in the face of higher prices. The economy could start to shrink, after expanding 2.8% in 2024.",
      "So far, most measures of the economy, such as job gains, remain solid. Employers added more jobs than expected in March, the government reported last week, and layoffs remain historically low.",
      "Still, surveys show consumers and businesses are increasingly worried about the economic outlook. What everyone from Wall Street investors to economists to officials at the Federal Reserve will be watching closely is whether those concerns lead to a downturn.",
      "Here are some questions and answers about recessions:",
      "Not yet. But one development that has sparked widespread fear is a real-time economy tracker maintained by the Federal Reserve's Atlanta branch. It now indicates that the economy could shrink by 0.8% at an annual rate in the first three months of this year, down from 2.4% in last year's final quarter.",
      "The Atlanta Fed's tracker is not technically a forecast but instead a running tally that is updated as economic data is released.",
      "Typically, a recession occurs when some short of shock hits the economy, such as the pandemic in 2020, or the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007. It's not yet clear that tariffs will have a large enough impact to knock the economy into reverse.",
      "But economists at Wells Fargo, in a note on Friday, calculated that the average U.S. tariff would jump tenfold to about 23% when all the duties are in place, the highest since 1908.",
      "Such a shift \u201cpractically overnight will throw sand in the gears of global supply chains in ways that we have not seen since the pandemic and perhaps since World War II,\u201d Shannon Grein, an economist at Wells Fargo, wrote.",
      "On Sunday, Trump told reporters that \u201csometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\" Yet Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on the same day said \u201cthere doesn't have to be a recession\u201d and that the administration is focused on \u201cbuilding the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.\u201d",
      "The clearest signal would be a steady rise in job losses and a surge in unemployment. The government's weekly report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits, which is released every Thursday, is being closely watched for signs of rising layoffs. So far, applications for aid remain quite low by historical standards.",
      "Torsten Slok, chief economist for Apollo, an asset management firm, is watching a range of real-time data and sees some signs the economy is weakening. The number of people filing for bankruptcy has risen, while visits to Las Vegas have declined a bit. Weekly visits to movie theaters this year are below their levels in recent years, he said.",
      "The Trump administration is plowing ahead with widespread job cuts in federal agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, and says it will cut government spending. Both could weigh on the economy, at least in the short run.",
      "And even if some of the tariffs imposed April 2 are pulled back or reduced, the uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's trade policies are likely to discourage spending by businesses or consumers. It's unclear, for example, whether companies will build more factories in the U.S. \u2014 as the tariffs are intended to encourage \u2014 if they don't know how long the tariffs will last.",
      "Another factor could be overseas boycotts of U.S. goods and travel. Slok has noted that airline bookings data point to a 70% drop in trips from Canada to the U.S. in the next six months. While the effect on the overall economy is likely to be minor, Goldman Sachs estimates such changes could shave 0.2 percentage points off growth this year.",
      "Many economists now expect the Fed will cut their key interest rate at their meeting in June and implement at least three reductions this year.",
      "But the Fed is in a difficult position: With inflation seemingly stuck above its target of 2%, even before the tariffs take effect, the central bank would typically want to keep borrowing costs high to slow spending and cool inflation.",
      "Yet if tariffs weaken the economy and lead to job losses, the Fed would normally slash its key rate to stimulate borrowing and spending. Since tariffs could worsen inflation, however, it is unlikely to do so until there are clear signs of a sharp economic slowdown.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t really be proactive here because they do have inflation to worry about,\" said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities. \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is a Fed that is going to be stuck between a rock and a hard place.\"",
      "On Friday, Chair Jerome Powell said the tariffs could worsen inflation and added that the Fed's main obligation was to keep prices in check. His comments suggested the Fed will likely stay on the sidelines at its next meeting in May.",
      "Recessions are officially declared by the obscure-sounding National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of economists whose Business Cycle Dating Committee defines a recession as \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\u201d",
      "The committee considers trends in hiring. It also assesses many other data points, including gauges of income, employment, inflation-adjusted spending, retail sales and factory output. It assigns heavy weight to a measure of inflation-adjusted income that excludes government support payments like Social Security.",
      "Yet the organization typically doesn\u2019t declare a recession until well after one has begun, sometimes as long as a year afterward.",

      "A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant claiming a news organization defamed him in public comments about its Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting on $77 million in misspent federal welfare funds",
      "JACKSON, Miss. -- A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant that claimed a local news outlet defamed him in public comments about its Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting on the misspending of $77 million in federal welfare funds.",
      "The one-page ruling Friday by Madison County Circuit Court Judge Bradley Mills sided with lawyers for Mississippi Today, who had argued that the news outlet engaged in constitutionally protected speech.",
      "\u201cFor the past 22 months, we\u2019ve vigorously defended our Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting and our characterizations of Bryant\u2019s role in the Mississippi welfare scandal,\u201d Mississippi Today said in a statement on its website. \u201cWe are grateful today that the court, after careful deliberation, dismissed the case.\u201d",
      "Bryant filed suit in 2023, weeks after Mississippi Today and one of its reporters, Anna Wolfe, won a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of how welfare funds intended for poor Mississippians \u2014 some of the most impoverished people in the U.S. \u2014 were diverted to the rich and powerful.",
      "Bryant's lawsuit didn't challenge the accuracy of Wolfe\u2019s series, \u201cThe Backchannel,\u201d that shed light on the welfare scandal. Instead, Bryant's lawyers argued that the news outlet, its CEO and other employees made slanderous comments about Bryant when discussing the series in public settings, including a radio interview and a speech at a journalism conference.",
      "Attorneys for Mississippi Today argued that the comments Bryant claimed had harmed his reputation were \u201centirely or substantially true,\u201d and that Bryant failed to show any of the statements were made with \u201cactual malice\u201d \u2014 meaning they were knowingly or recklessly false. Because of that, the lawyers said, Bryant didn't meet the legal standard for politicians and other public figures to prove defamation as set by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964.",
      "Bryant's attorney, William Quin II, said Monday he will appeal the judge's dismissal to the Mississippi Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cThis matter is far from over,\u201d Quin said in an emailed statement. \"Governor Bryant remains confident in the legal basis of this case, and the righteousness of this cause.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists praised the judge's decision to throw out the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cSuing news organizations just because you don\u2019t like their reporting is a crude intimidation tactic that can drain resources and discourage critical coverage,\u201d Katherine Jacobsen, the committee's U.S. program coordinator, said in a statement posted on X. \"We hope that this case serves as a deterrent to those who would seek to sue outlets into silence.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have said the state\u2019s human services agency gave money to nonprofit organizations that spent it on projects such as a $5 million volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi \u2014 a project for which retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre agreed to raise money.",
      "Mississippi Auditor Shad White announced in February 2020 that criminal charges were brought against six people, including John Davis, a former Mississippi Department of Human Services executive director who had been chosen by Bryant. The announcement came weeks after Bryant, a Republican, finished his second and final term as governor. Davis and others have pleaded guilty.",
      "No criminal charges have been filed against Bryant, and he has said he told the auditor in 2019 about possible misspending of money from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families antipoverty program.",
      "Favre also has not been charged with a crime. The Pro Football Hall of Famer is among more than three dozen defendants in a civil lawsuit the state filed in 2022. The suit demands repayment of money that was misspent through TANF.",
      "White, the Republican state auditor, said in 2020 that Favre had improperly received $1.1 million in speaking fees from a nonprofit organization that spent welfare money with approval from the state Department of Human Services. White said Favre did not show up for the speeches. Although Favre repaid the $1.1 million, White said last year that he still owes nearly $730,000 in interest.",

      "The historic Buffalo Trace Distillery has temporarily closed after deadly flooding ravaging Kentucky swept into its facilities, forcing the popular bourbon company to turn away the public and staff.",
      "In a statement released on Sunday, the Frankfort, Kentucky-based distillery said it would remain closed through April 10 but warned that date could change.",
      "\u201cDue to the unprecedented and ongoing rain and flooding, we are not able to advise on the impact to our total distillery footprint,\u201d Buffalo Trace said. \u201cWe will assess those realities in the coming days as the facilities become safe to navigate and will make necessary adjustments to operations as required.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Buffalo Trace declined to comment further.",
      "Days of unrelenting torrential rain in Kentucky and across the U.S. South and Midwest have caused catastrophic flooding and raised fears the damage could linger for days as rivers swell. In Frankfort, the Kentucky River curves throughout the capital city and has been known to flood.",
      "On Monday, the river was cresting at Frankfort Lock \u2014 approaching the record of 48 1/2 feet (14.78 meters) set on Dec. 10, 1978, according to CJ Padgett, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Louisville, Kentucky, office.",
      "Buffalo Trace is far from the only distillery in Kentucky, the home of bourbon country, but it is one of the closest to the banks of the Kentucky River. Notably, the distillery has markers of several high-water marks from previous floods inside its Frankfort buildings, with the most recent being the 1978 flood.",
      "Buffalo Trace Distillery is an American, family-owned company that has operated for more than 200 years. Its products include the holy grail for bourbon fanatics: Pappy Van Winkle 23-year-old, which can sell for tens of thousands of dollars on resale markets.",

      "A former top vaccine official says he was forced out of government after trying to block Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Shortly before he was forced to resign, the nation\u2019s top vaccine regulator says he refused to grant Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s team unrestricted access to a tightly held vaccine safety database, fearing that the information might be manipulated or even deleted.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, former Food and Drug Administration vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks discussed his efforts to \u201cmake nice\u201d with Kennedy and address his longstanding concerns about vaccine safety, including by developing a \u201cvaccine transparency action plan.\u201d",
      "Marks agreed to give Kennedy's associates the ability to read thousands of reports of potential vaccine-related issues sent to the government's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. But he would not allow them to directly edit the data.",
      "\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we? Because frankly we don\u2019t trust (them),\u201d he said, using a profanity. \u201cThey\u2019d write over it or erase the whole database.\u201d",
      "Marks spoke to the AP on Sunday, after officials in Texas confirmed the nation's second measles-related death this year in an unvaccinated child. Marks attributed the death to the tepid response from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which again encouraged the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine on Sunday but has also promoted claims about vitamin A supplements.",
      "During his Senate confirmation hearings, Kennedy told lawmakers he is not \u201cantivaccine.\" But since taking office, he\u2019s promised to \u201cinvestigate\u201d children\u2019s shots, and agencies under his watch have terminated vaccine-related research, canceled meetings of vaccine advisers and are poised to reinvestigate ties between vaccines and autism \u2014 a link debunked long ago.",
      "Since being sworn in, \u201cMr. Kennedy has increased the pace by which he intends to minimize the use of vaccines in this country,\u201d Marks said.",
      "An HHS spokesperson said Kennedy has advocated for vaccination multiple times since becoming health secretary and pointed to a social media post Sunday in which he called the vaccine \u201cthe most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson added that it would make \u201cperfect sense\u201d for staffers working for Kennedy to seek access to the VAERS database to do their own analysis.",
      "Marks is highly regarded by former FDA leaders and biotech industry executives, but his time at the agency has not been without controversy. During the COVID-19 pandemic he was alternately criticized for being too slow \u2014 under Trump\u2014 and too fast \u2014 under Biden\u2014 to authorize new vaccines and boosters.",
      "Marks says he \u201ctried everything\u201d to work with Kennedy. At the center of that effort was a plan to increase publicly available information about vaccine ingredients, safety and side effects.",
      "Marks and his team had hoped to kick off the monthslong initiative with a two-day public \u201clistening session,\u201d followed by an expert report written by an independent organization, such as the National Academies of Sciences.",
      "The centerpiece of the effort would be a vast overhaul of the VAERS system, maintained by the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "FDA and CDC scientists monitor the database for \u201cpossible signals\u201d of emerging problems with vaccines. But analyzing the data requires both medical and statistical expertise, because anyone can submit unverified reports of side effects, injuries and death. The public-facing website warns that the data is unverified and may be incomplete or inaccurate. Misinterpretations of VAERS have long been central to anti-vaccine groups and messaging.",
      "Marks notes that government scientists spend hours adjudicating each report of serious injury or death, often by tracking down death certificates and interviewing health providers. It\u2019s not unusual for investigators to find reports of deaths that were caused by something totally unrelated to a vaccine, like a car crash, or that a death occurred months after vaccination in someone with a serious illness.",
      "Much of that detail is redacted for legal reasons. But Marks said his office was committed to making much more information available.",
      "\u201cThis is a legitimate thing that I actually was willing to compromise on,\u201d Marks said \u201cWe need to make VAERS more transparent so that people can understand that we actually do the work on the backend.\u201d",
      "Details of Marks' plan were confirmed by a second person with direct knowledge of the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not have permission to speak publicly about internal agency matters.",
      "The proposal was sent to FDA\u2019s acting commissioner, Trump appointee Dr. Sara Brenner, in mid-February, but Marks and his team did not hear back.",
      "By mid-March, Marks' office was fielding multiple requests from Trump administration staffers seeking full access to the VAERS database. In responding to the requests, Marks and his staff emphasized the sensitive nature of the data, which includes confidential personal, medical and corporate information.",
      "Marks said he never spoke directly with Kennedy, whom he described as \u201cwalled off\u201d from FDA officials.",
      "On the day he was forced out of his post, Marks said he was summoned to a meeting at HHS headquarters.",
      "Two senior HHS officials greeted him and recalled Marks' work during the COVID-19 pandemic; he coined the name and developed the concept for \u201cOperation Warp Speed,\u201d which rapidly accelerated the development of vaccines and therapies to treat the virus.",
      "After an awkward silence, Marks said, one of the officials told him: \u201cLook, he wants you gone.\u201d According to Marks, it was an obvious reference to Kennedy.",
      "\u201cIt was pretty clear that either I was going to resign, or they were going to fire me,\u201d Marks said.",
      "He submitted his resignation later that day, citing Kennedy\u2019s support for \u201cmisinformation and lies\" about vaccines.",
      "The HHS spokesperson said Kennedy is \u201cinstalling scientists committed to reversing the chronic disease crisis,\u201d and that Marks was a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for the drug industry.",
      "This week, Kennedy is making stops across the southwestern U.S. as part of a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d tour focused on fluoridation, food dyes and other issues.",
      "Marks said Kennedy should be working to get more children vaccinated to stop the outbreak.",

      "The order relies largely on a 90-year-old Supreme Court decision known as Humphrey\u2019s Executor, which found that presidents can't fire independent board members without cause.",
      "But the ruling has long rankled conservative legal theorists who argue it wrongly curtails the president's power, and experts say the current conservative majority on the Supreme Court may be poised to overturn it.",
      "The ruling reverses, at least for now, a judgment from a three-judge panel from the same U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Former President Joe Biden nominated both of the fired board members. Cathy Harris is from the Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews disputes from federal workers and could be a stumbling block as the Trump administration seeks to carry out a dramatic downsizing.",
      "Gwynne Wilcox has served on the National Labor Relations Board, which resolves hundreds of unfair labor practice cases every year. The five-member board lacked a quorum after Wilcox\u2019s removal.",
      "Government lawyers have argued that Trump can remove both board members. In Wilcox\u2019s case, they said reinstatement \"works a grave harm to the separation of powers and undermines the President\u2019s ability to exercise his authority under the Constitution.\u201d",
      "They also argued that MSPB members like Harris are removable \u201cat will\u201d by the president.",
      "Wilcox\u2019s attorneys said Trump couldn\u2019t fire her without notice, a hearing or identifying any \u201cneglect of duty or malfeasance in office\u201d on her part. They argued that the administration\u2019s \u201conly path to victory\u201d is to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to \u201cadopt a more expansive view of presidential power.\u201d",
      "Wilcox was the first Black woman to serve on the five-member board in its 90-year history. The Senate confirmed Wilcox for a second five-year term in September 2023.",
      "Congress created the board in 1935. Its primary purpose is to resolve disputes over unfair labor practices. It adjudicated hundreds of cases in the last fiscal year.",

      "Alabama Republicans cheered President Donald Trump and his agenda at a GOP party the day he imposed tariffs and sent stock markets tumbling worldwide",
      "BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- On a day when stock markets around the world dropped precipitously, Alabama Republican Party Chairman John Wahl led a celebration of the president whose global tariffs sparked the sell-off.",
      "With no mention of the Wall Street roller coaster and global economic uncertainty, Wahl declared his state GOP\u2019s \u201cTrump Victory Dinner\u201d \u2014 and the broader national moment \u2014 a triumph. And for anyone who rejects President Donald Trump, his agenda and the \u201cAmerica First\u201d army that backs it all, Wahl had an offer: \u201cThe Alabama Republican Party will buy them a plane ticket to any country in the world they want to go to.\u201d",
      "Wahl's audience \u2014 an assembly of lobbyists and donors, state lawmakers, local party officials and grassroots activists \u2014 laughed, applauded and sometimes roared throughout last week's gala in downtown Birmingham, the rare Democratic stronghold in one of the nation\u2019s most Republican states. The president\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. elicited perhaps the most enthusiasm with an unapologetically partisan pitch, even repeating the lie that his father won the 2020 election over Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "Yet beyond the cheerleading, there were signs of a more cautious optimism and some worried whispers over Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, the particulars of his deportation policy and the aggressive slashing by his Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "That doesn\u2019t mean Trump or Republicans are in danger of losing their grip in Alabama, where the GOP holds all statewide offices, dominates the Legislature and has won every presidential electoral vote since 1980. But it\u2019s a notable wrinkle in a place where there's long been tension between relying on the federal government for funding and jobs, and an embrace of the kind of anti-Washington, anti-establishment populism that has twice propelled Trump to the Oval Office. And any cracks for Trump in Alabama \u2014 where he got 65% of the vote in 2024 \u2014 could portend trouble elsewhere, as the effects of a seismic shift in U.S. policy reach across the economy and society.",
      "\u201cThere are some concerns, some conversations,\u201d said John Merrill, a former secretary of state, over just what Trump\u2019s agenda will mean on the ground. Alabama, he acknowledged, has \u201cbeen a net recipient\u201d of the very federal government and economic model Trump is upending, meaning it receives more money back from Washington than its taxpayers send the federal government.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big risk,\u201d said Merrill, who sported a Trump 45-47 pin on his lapel, a nod to the president's two terms.",
      "Blocks to the south of the complex where Republicans convened sits the multibillion-dollar University of Alabama at Birmingham health system, a regional gem where research depends on grants from the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Republican Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, listed as a \u201cSilver Sponsor\u201d of the gala, didn't join the Democratic attorneys general suing the Trump administration to stop the cancellation of certain research funding streams Congress already has approved.",
      "Most of the medical services provided at UAB and many other hospitals throughout the state are covered by Medicare and Medicaid, two of the largest federal outlays. Alabama, because its per-capita income ranks among the lower tier among states, has one of the most generous federal match rates for Medicaid funding.",
      "A short drive west toward Tuscaloosa sits a gargantuan Mercedes-Benz complex, one of the earliest examples of foreign auto manufacturers coming to the American South, where state laws are hostile to organized labor. The plants have provided jobs at wages higher than the local norms but in some cases lower than in union shops of the Great Lakes region around Detroit. Many suppliers have followed in the South, but not so many that the assembly plants don\u2019t still import many parts that now will be subject to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Terry Martin, a county GOP committeeman in Tallapoosa County, said he supports the tariffs as leverage. Trump has \u201csomething to bargain with,\u201d Martin said. But, \u201cthe parts that are coming from overseas \u2026 it\u2019s going to pop it up\u201d in price, he said, at least in the short term.",
      "Agriculture, meanwhile, is still a dominant Alabama industry. Meat processing plants in the North and row crop farms in the South depend on migrant labor that Merrill, the former secretary of state, said involves workers who are in the U.S. both legally and illegally. Alabama, he recalled, passed its own strict immigration bill during Barack Obama's presidency only to roll it back after industry leaders complained of a depleted workforce.",
      "Wahl, in an interview after the gala, took a more nuanced approach than he did at the podium.",
      "\u201cIt is possible to secure our border and still take into account migrants who deserve to be here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be a two-pronged approach.\u201d",
      "Back in Birmingham, Interstate 65 splits the city. The aging, increasingly congested artery is a local priority for widening. The proposal has support from Alabama's two Republican senators, Tommy Tuberville and Katie Britt. U.S. interstate projects, though, are typically a 90-10 split, meaning 90% of the money comes from Washington, 10% from the state.",
      "That funding \u2014 along with money for schools, Medicaid and other areas \u2014 could be at risk with Trump adviser Elon Musk and DOGE carrying Trump\u2019s blessing to slash spending. GOP lawmakers who control Congress have supported Trump's agenda, which also includes dismantling the Education Department.",
      "Tallapoosa County GOP Chair Denise Bates said \u201cabsolutely\u201d there's a possibility DOGE could go too far. \u201cI hope there are guardrails,\u201d she said, noting she was once a local school board member.",
      "\u201cAm I 100% for getting rid of the Department of Education? I can\u2019t say that I am,\u201d she said, adding a phrase similar to Merrill\u2019s description of the state as a whole. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re a net receiver.\u201d",
      "Yet for all the caveats offered in one-on-one conversations, the GOP crowd cheered when Tuberville, the former football coach turned Trump acolyte on Capitol Hill, offered a plainspoken defense of Musk and his pop-up agency, telling the crowd, \u201cWe're dead broke.\u201d And they roared as he addressed tariffs.",
      "\u201cIt's past time we level the playing field and tell the rest of the world to get off their ass and start paying their fair share,\u201d Tuberville said.",
      "Bates argued that Alabama's embrace of Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d push is not simply loyalty to the president. She said it reflects generations of voters watching the steel industry decline in Birmingham and, after the North American Free Trade Agreement was enacted in 1994, the textile industry leaving for Mexico and, eventually, Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cWe just want jobs,\u201d she said.",
      "Still, state Sen. Jabo Waggoner, the longest-serving member of the Alabama Legislature, made clear Trump's visceral appeal, declaring him \u201cthe most popular president here since Ronald Reagan, hands down.\u201d",
      "Wahl recalled Trump\u2019s first massive outdoor rally as a presidential candidate: 30,000 people at Ladd-Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama, in August 2015.",
      "Wahl, who owns a butterfly farm outside Huntsville, said perhaps the best way to understand Trump and Alabama and this moment of uncertainty is to see a president who, at least to his supporters in the state, has earned the benefit of the doubt.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to let everybody know he\u2019s serious,\u201d the chairman said. Trump is \u201cgoing to bring people to the bargaining table. We\u2019re actually going to see the negotiator conduct business.\u201d",

      "An appellate court in Russia\u2019s far eastern city of Vladivostok has reduced the prison sentence of an American soldier convicted of stealing and making threats of murder",
      "MOSCOW -- An appellate court in Russia\u2019s far east on Monday reduced the prison sentence for an American soldier convicted of stealing and making threats of murder, Russia's state news agency RIA Novosti reported.",
      "Staff Sgt. Gordon Black, 34, flew to the Pacific port city of Vladivostok to see his girlfriend and was arrested in May 2024 after she accused him of stealing from her, according to U.S. officials and Russian authorities. A month later, a court in Vladivostok convicted him and sentenced him to three years and nine months in prison. Black was also ordered to pay 10,000 rubles ($115 at the time) in damages.",
      "Black lost one appeal in a regional court that upheld his sentence, but the judge in the 9th Court of Cassation on Monday agreed to reduce his sentence to three years and two months in prison. Black's defense had asked the court to acquit him of making threats of murder and reduce the punishment for theft, a request the judge partially sustained, according to the RIA report.",
      "Russia has jailed a number of Americans in recent years as tensions between Moscow and the West grew. Some, like corporate security executive Paul Whelan, Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and teacher Marc Fogel, were designated by the U.S. government as wrongfully detained and released in prisoner swaps.",
      "A few others remain jailed in Russia on drug or assault convictions. They include Robert Gilman, 72, who was handed a 3 1/2-year sentence after being found guilty of assaulting a police officer following a drunken disturbance on a train, and Travis Leake, a musician who was convicted on drug charges and sentenced to 13 years in prison in July 2024.",
      "Black was on leave and in the process of returning to his home base at Fort Cavazos, Texas, from South Korea, where he had been stationed at Camp Humphreys with the Eighth Army.",
      "The U.S. Army said Black signed out for his move back home and, \u201cinstead of returning to the continental United States, Black flew from Incheon, Republic of Korea, through China to Vladivostok, Russia, for personal reasons.\u201d",
      "Under Pentagon policy, service members must get clearance for any international travel from a security manager or commander.",
      "The U.S. Army said last month that Black hadn\u2019t sought such travel clearance and it wasn\u2019t authorized by the Defense Department. Given the hostilities in Ukraine and threats to the U.S. and its military, it is extremely unlikely he would have been granted approval.",
      "Black\u2019s girlfriend, Alexandra Vashchuk, told reporters last year that \u201cit was a simple domestic dispute,\u201d during which Black \u201cbecame aggressive and attacked\u201d her, stealing money from her wallet. She described Black as \u201cviolent and unable to control himself.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have said that Black, who is married, met Vashchuk in South Korea.",
      "According to U.S. officials, she had lived in South Korea, and last fall she and Black got into some type of domestic dispute or altercation. After that, she left South Korea. It isn\u2019t clear if she was forced to leave or what, if any, role South Korean authorities had in the matter.",

      "The settlement of a $2.8 billion federal class-action antitrust lawsuit filed by athletes against the NCAA and the largest conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC) was approved by the defendants and plaintiffs in May 2024 and not long afterward by U.S. Judge Claudia Wilken, who must give final approval before terms can go into effect as early as July 1. Some questions and answers about this monumental change for college athletics:",
      "Q: What is the House settlement and why does it matter?",
      "A: Grant House is an Arizona State swimmer who sued the defendants. His lawsuit and two others were combined and over several years the dispute wound up with the proposed settlement that will create a new substructure for college sports. What's groundbreaking is that it ends a decades-old prohibition on schools cutting checks directly to athletes. Now, each schools will be able to make so-called NIL payments to athletes, compensating them for use of their name, image and likeness.",
      "Q: How much will the schools pay the athletes and where will the money come from?",
      "A: In Year 1, each school can share up to about $20.5 million with their athletes, a number that represents 22% of their revenue from things like media rights, ticket sales and sponsorships. Alabama athletic director Greg Byrne famously told Congress \"those are resources and revenues that don\u2019t exist.\u201d Some of it will be raised through ever-growing TV rights packages, especially for the newly expanded College Football Playoff. But some schools are increasing costs to fans through \u201ctalent fees,\u201d concession price hikes and \u201cathletic fees\u201d added to tuition costs.",
      "Q: What about scholarships? Wasn't that like paying the athletes?",
      "A: Scholarships and \u201ccost of attendance\u201d have always been part of the deal for Division I athletes, and there's certainly value to that, especially if athletes get their degree. But they have long argued that it was hardly enough to compensate them for the millions in revenue they helped produce for the schools, which went to a lot of places, including multimillion-dollar coaches' salaries.",
      "Q: Haven't players been getting paid for a while now, though?",
      "A: Yes, since 2021. Facing losses in court and a growing number of state laws targeting its amateurism policies, the NCAA cleared the way for athletes to receive NIL money from third parties, including so-called donor-based collectives that support various schools. Under House, the school can pay that money directly to athletes and the collectives are still in the game.",
      "Q: What about players who played before NIL was allowed?",
      "A: A key component of the settlement is the $2.78 billion in backpay going to athletes who competed between 2016-24 and were either fully or partially shut out from those payments. It will come from the NCAA and conferences (but really from the schools, who will receive lower-than-normal payouts from things like March Madness).",
      "Q: Who will get most of the money?",
      "A: Since football and men's basketball are the primary revenue drivers at most schools, and that money helps fund all the other sports, it stands to reason that the football and basketball players will get most of the money. But that is one of the most difficult calculations for the schools to make.",
      "Q: Couldn't unequal divvying of the money open up issues of fairness, equity and Title IX?",
      "A: Yes, there could potentially be Title IX issues if schools deliver more resources to men than women. But the most recent guidance from the Trump administration suggests schools won't have to consider NIL payments in their Title IX calculations. Attorneys on both sides in the House case have argued that the settlement is not the arena to resolve Title IX issues.",
      "Q: Is this a done deal?",
      "A: That's an open question. Wilken could do it as soon as Monday or wait to craft a decision after weighing objections. She could scuttle the entire thing, though she granted preliminary approval in October. Currently, the terms of the deal are set to start July 1.",
      "Q: So, once this is finished, all of college sports' problems are solved, right?",
      "A: Not by a long shot. Some of the more pressing issues include establishing an enforcement entity to make sure schools are staying within the spending guidelines and what to do if they're not \u2014 an area that seems ripe for litigation. There are also the issues of collective bargaining and whether athletes should flat-out be considered employees, a notion the NCAA and schools are not interested in. NCAA President Charlie Baker has been pushing Congress for a limited antitrust exemption that would protect college sports from another series of lawsuits.",

      "A federal judge in California has scheduled testimony for Monday in what\u2019s expected to be the final hearing before approval of a landmark settlement involving the NCAA and thousands of athletes",
      "Hours before college basketball crowns its next champion, the future of college sports will be hanging in the balance in a California courtroom.",
      "U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken's scheduled hearing Monday in a courtroom in Oakland is expected to be the last one before the changes will truly begin under an industry-changing, $2.8 billion settlement of a five-year-old lawsuit against the NCAA and the nation's largest conferences. Among other things, it will clear the way for schools to pay up to $20.5 million each with their athletes.",
      "Wilken has already granted preliminary approval for the settlement. It was unknown whether she will give final approval at Monday's hearing, which is expected to include testimony from some of those objecting to details of the sprawling plan. LSU gymnast and influencer Olivia Dunne is among the 18 people scheduled to testify, though she is expected to appear via Zoom.",
      "The new structure outlined by the settlement, which represents a shift in billions of dollars from the schools into the pockets of athletes, is supposed to go into effect on July 1.",
      "Universities across the country have been busy making plans, under the assumption Wilken will put the terms into effect.",
      "\u201cWe're going to have a plan going into July 1, then we're probably going to spend the next year figuring out how good that plan is and how we need to modify it going forward,\u201d said Florida athletic director Scott Stricklin, whose department is among the biggest in the country and includes a Gators men's basketball team playing for the national title late Monday against Houston.",
      "The so-called House settlement, named after Arizona State swimmer Grant House, actually decides three similar lawsuits that were bundled into one. The defendants are the NCAA and the Southeastern, Big Ten, Atlantic Coast, Big 12 and Pac-12 conferences, all of whom have been touting the settlement as the best path forward for their industry.",
      "\u201cIt's a huge step forward for college sports, especially at the highest level,\" said NCAA President Charlie Baker, whose organization continues to seek antitrust protections from Congress. \u201cMy biggest problem with the way the whole thing works right now is the schools have been removed from the primary relationship with the student-athletes.\u201d",
      "The most ground-shifting part of the settlement calls on schools from the biggest conferences to pay some 22% of their revenue from media rights, ticket sales and sponsorships \u2014 which equals about $20.5 million in the first year \u2014 directly to athletes for use of their name, images and likeness (NIL).",
      "Still allowed would be NIL payments to athletes from outside sources, which is what triggered the seismic shift college sports has endured over the last four years. For instance, Cooper Flagg of Duke reportedly makes $4.8 million in NIL deals from groups affiliated with the school and others.",
      "The settlement calls for a \u201cclearinghouse\u201d to make sure any NIL deal worth more than $600 is pegged at \u201cfair market value.\" It's an attempt to prevent straight \u201cpay for play\u201d deals, though many critics believe the entire new structure is simply NIL masquerading as that.",
      "Another key element is the $2.8 billion in back damages to athletes who played sports between 2016 and 2024 and were not entitled to the full benefits of NIL at the time they attended schools. Those payments are being calculated by a formula that will favor football and basketball players and will be doled out by the NCAA and the conferences.",
      "The settlement also calls for replacing scholarship limits with roster limits. The effect would be to allow every athlete to be eligible for a scholarship while cutting the number of spots available.",
      "There will be winners and losers under such a formula, though some fear it could signal the end of the \u201cwalk-on\u201d athlete in college sports and also imperil smaller sports programs that train and populate the U.S. Olympic team.",

      "This time too it has announced retaliatory tariffs, but it also appears to be bracing for pain with stronger measures. It has allowed its currency, the yuan, to weaken, which makes Chinese exports more attractive. And state-linked enterprises have been buying up stocks in what appears to be a move to stabilise the market.",
      "The prospect of negotiations between the US and Japan seemed to buoy investors who were fighting to claw back some of the losses of recent days.",

      "Shaken by a prolonged property market crisis and rising unemployment, Chinese people are just not spending enough. Indebted local governments have also been struggling to increase investments or expand the social safety net.",
      "\"The tariffs exacerbate this problem,\" said Andrew Collier, Senior Fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard Kennedy School.",
      "If China's exports take a hit, that hurts a crucial revenue stream. Exports have long been a key factor in China's explosive growth. And they remain a significant driver, although the country is trying to diversify its economy with high-end tech manufacturing and greater domestic consumption.",
      "It's hard to say exactly when the tariffs \"will bite but likely soon,\" Mr Collier says, adding that \"[President Xi] faces an increasingly difficult choice due to a slowing economy and dwindling resources\".",

      "The rest of the world is watching too, to see where Chinese exports shut out of the US market will go.",
      "They will end up in other markets such as those in South East Asia, Ms Elms adds, and \"these places [are dealing] with their own tariffs and having to think about where else can we sell our products?\"",

      "Markets are reeling from US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, but the American leader is standing by his decisions, defending his policies and saying \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\".",
      "Experts answered some of the questions you sent us as the world tries to make sense of the turmoil and wonders how long it will continue.",
      "Read their answers below.",
      "How does a stock market index work?",
      "Simon Jack, the BBC's business editor, said the FTSE 100, which represents the 100 biggest companies publicly listed in the UK, were all \"put in a big bucket back in 1984\" and given a certain weighting in that bucket depending on how big those companies were.",
      "The stock market is a reflection of their total value over time. The bigger the company, the more weight it has in the index. For example, an AstraZeneca or an HSBC has more weight than others.",
      "It works the same in the US with the S&P500, which is made up of the 500 biggest companies, with an enormous concentration in some names like Apple, Nvidia and Amazon.",
      "The stock market tells you how the value of the shares in those companies has changed - with a focus on those biggest names.",
      "Generally speaking, it is an indication of what some of our biggest companies are worth, and when they go up or down, it tells you something about the sentiment of whether their profits are likely to rise or fall in the future.",
      "How does a market downturn affect pensions and daily life?",
      "Jack explains that what happens in stock markets is not necessarily the same thing that happens in the economy. They can be linked, but they are not exactly the same.",
      "Some people invest directly in shares - and this will definitely affect them. These are some big falls, some of the biggest we have seen in a couple days since pandemic panic gripped the markets back in 2020.",
      "The other way that people are exposed to these changes is through their pension funds. Pension fund investing is a long term game. Not all of your money will go into shares - some will go into government bonds, and the closer you get to retirement, the more weighting you will have in things like cash and government bonds, so the less this will affect you.",
      "There are two types of pensions: a defined benefit pension - where you get a promised percentage of your salary at retirement - and defined contribution - where your pension pots value will rise and fall with financial markets.",
      "Pensions are exposed right now, but pension investing is a long term game.",
      "The warning sign flashing here is not the value of your pension pot - it is what is going to happen to the economies in which we all live and work.",
      "A lot of people are saying the chance of recession in both the US, UK - and even globally - have gone up a notch, which has implications for things like jobs and wages.",
      "How popular are tariffs in the US?",
      "There is growing scepticism about tariffs among Americans, although views still fall along partisan lines.",
      "According to one poll released last week, slightly more than half of Republicans, 52%, think tariffs help the economy, but 58% of independents say they hurt the economy, as do 89% of Democrats.",
      "However, that survey was held before Trump's global tariffs came into effect and trillions of dollars was wiped off the value of the US stock market. We will find out in the coming days how the economic turmoil has changed public sentiment.",
      "One of the key factors in President Trump's 2024 election victory was that more voters trusted him to improve the US economy, and especially to tackle high prices.",
      "Yet most economists warn that tariffs could drive up prices for US consumers as almost all imported goods will face a tax.",
      "There could be inflation and we could also see an economic downturn, and potentially a recession.",
      "How much of this is about China?",
      "Some think that the whole exercise is about an economic proxy war with China and the entire game is about just trying to level that playing field a little bit, Jack said.",
      "But Trump is right in one regard, which is that American markets are much more open to foreign goods than a lot of foreign markets are open to US goods.",
      "The UK, for example, puts a 10% tariff on US imported cars, 14% on some kinds of beef, and 8% on other things. So there are barriers both ways.",
      "And while Trump says that other countries have been ripping off the US, it is American corporations that have reasonably pursued shareholder value by trying to put their production facilities in the strategically and economically best places.",
      "It is the head of American corporations who opened subsidiaries in Ireland, where there is a low tax rate, and put manufacturing in Vietnam or Cambodia. In a way this has been the sort of rational pursuit of maximum profit, a system which has made the US very rich indeed.",
      "China is getting very rich indeed as well, and it is certainly moving up the value chain.",
      "There is a feeling that the US was very comfortable when China was making cheap sneakers and t-shirts, but when China starts making supercomputers and missiles the US gets a little bit more concerned, and that is one of the reasons you are seeing some of these tensions come to the fore.",
      "Will the markets recover?",
      "That is really the unknown question right now, Davison said, but one thing we can expect is more volatility.",
      "We got a little bit of a sense of how markets react on Friday when Trump said he had spoken with Vietnamese officials and there was potentially a deal in the works for Vietnam.",
      "The country has been hit with a 46% tariff by the US, which is quite a significant level, and Vietnam has indicated that it could reduce to zero all its tariffs on US goods going into that country. Stocks like Nike and Lululemon actually increase on that news, because these are apparel companies that have a very big presence in Vietnam.",
      "Broadly, I believe we are going to see markets go down, but you could see particular stocks moving in a more positive direction as there are indications that there may be some exemptions allowed.",
      "We do not know what Trump will allow - he has sent some big signals at times saying that his policies will never change, but has also suggested that some deals are possible.",

      "The \"baseline\" tariffs of 10% on most countries' goods that Trump announced last week have already gone into effect, while the higher \"reciprocal\" rates he wants to impose on the \"worst offenders\" are expected later this week. Some countries are seeking to negotiate lower rates with the White House.",
      "The new tariffs, added to steep levies Trump has already put on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as all automobile imports, are worrying business and economic leaders that they will push up prices for American consumers and spark a global trade war.",

      "But what do the prime minister's words mean in practice?",
      "The BBC understands there are several options on the table.",
      "Cars",
      "In 2024, the UK's largest export of goods to the US were cars and auto parts, with a value of around \u00a39bn.",
      "That industry has been hit by a tariff of 25% which came into force on Thursday.",
      "This comes as the industry is struggling to hit the rising requirements on how many of their sales have to be electric year by year.",
      "Sir Keir will announce a relaxation of those targets at a speech in the West Midlands on Monday. Under the plans while a general 2030 ban on the sale of cars powered by petrol and diesel will not be moved, some flexibility will be granted on annual requirements until that date. There may also be extra time for makers of commercial petrol and diesel vans to comply.",
      "There will also be extra flexibility for smaller volume luxury car makers like Aston Martin and Rolls-Royce to keep making petrol cars beyond the 2030 deadline.",
      "Anti-dumping safeguards",
      "One fear is that goods that were destined for the US will now be diverted to other markets, including the UK, due to the fact that the US tariffs on some countries mostly exceed the 10% placed on UK goods.",
      "In the past the UK and the European Union (EU) have introduced so-called safeguards that allow a certain amount of foreign steel into their market - and if exceeded, tariffs were applied. These safeguards have been eased over time and are expected to be re-imposed or toughened further.",
      "The steel example is seen in government as a blueprint that could be copied by other industries to avoid a huge influx of goods which might drive down prices for consumers but undercut  domestic UK suppliers at a critical time.",

      "New investment",
      "It is expected that a series of announcements on government investment into UK industry and infrastructure planned for later this year will be brought forward in the coming days and weeks.",
      "This would be to reflect the urgency and sensitivity of the situation faced by UK industry.",

      "While the UK tries to secure a better deal with the US, government officials will press ahead with deals to secure better mutual access to countries even harder hit by the new tariffs, who may be more incentivised to strike a deal.",
      "The BBC understands that India - which was hit by a 26% tariff - is a particular target.",

Keith agreed but the consultant though not appointed as a non-exec still advised him to re-organise the finances and apply for a further \u00a32m overdraft.

      "On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.",
      "There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.",
      "Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.",
      "Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.",
      "But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.",
      "The rationale behind 'reciprocal' tariffs",
      "It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.",
      "The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.",
      "In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers\u2026 The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"",
      "This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.",
      "This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.",
      "The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.",
      "While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.",
      "There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.",
      "The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (\u00a3216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.",
      "Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.",
      "'China shock' and the ripple effect",
      "There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".",
      "That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.",
      "For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\".",
      "In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy.",
      "Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.",
      "Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.",
      "Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.",
      "The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.",
      "Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",
      "The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.",
      "So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.",
      "But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.",
      "The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.",
      "The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.",
      "The first social media trade war",
      "Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.",
      "The world's consumers have choices.",
      "It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.",
      "Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.",
      "Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.",
      "These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.",
      "The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.",
      "In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.",
      "This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.",
      "Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.",
      "For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.",

    "summary": "The Spanish government is moving to make renting more affordable and boost the supply of homes.",
    "story": [
      "Blanca Castro puts on a builder's helmet before opening the door to her kitchen. Inside it, the ceiling has a large hole that is dripping water and it looks as if it could collapse at any moment.",
      "Because the kitchen is unusable, Blanca has to wash her dishes in the bathtub, and she has improvised a cooking area with a gas camping stove in a corner of her living room.",
      "Many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid's Atocha railway station have similar problems. They say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months, since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts.",
      "\"The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,\" says Blanca. \"Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent.\"",
      "Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article.",
      "The tenancy contracts last five years, during which time rent is fixed, but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years.",
      "\"For another home like this [in this area], I'd have to pay double or more what I'm paying now,\" says Blanca. \"It's not viable.\"",
      "She and her neighbours are among millions of Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of a housing crisis caused by spiralling rental costs.",
      "While salaries have increased by around 20% over the past decade, the average rental in Spain has doubled during the same period. There has been an 11% increase over the last year alone, according to figures provided by property portal Idealista, and housing has become Spaniards' biggest worry.",
      "It's also generating anger, with Spaniards taking to the streets to demand action from the authorities to make housing more affordable. On Saturday, 5 April thousands of people protested in Madrid and dozens of other cities.",
      "A report by Spain's central bank found that nearly 40% of families who rent now spend more than 40% of their income on their accommodation.",
      "\"The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,\" says Juan Vill\u00e9n, of Idealista. \"Demand is very good, the economy is growing a lot, but supply is dwindling very fast.\"",
      "Mr Vill\u00e9n offers the example of Barcelona, where rental increases have become notorious. Whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago, that number has risen to 54. Rental costs during that time have increased by 60%, he adds.",
      "\"We need to build more properties,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market.\"",
      "How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe",
      "Spain looks to immigrants to drive economy",
      "M\u00e1laga tourism: 'People feel the city is collapsing'",
      "The central government has described the situation as \"a social emergency\" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand.",
      "This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024.",
      "The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past.",
      "But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control.",
      "At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards \"want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like\".",
      "The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint.",
      "Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028.",
      "The S\u00e1nchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called \"high-tension\" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate.",
      "The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in \"high-tension\" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%.",
      "However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market.",
      "\"On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market.\"",
      "Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers.",
      "The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently.",
      "Gonzalo \u00c1lvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer.",
      "\"There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,\" he says. \"So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked.\"",
      "His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent.",
      "\"The [central and local] governments are not setting any limits,\" says Mr \u00c1lvarez. \"So who is going to? We will have to do it.\"",

      "Nike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer?",
      "It depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.",
      "'Competitive industry'",
      "Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.",
      "But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.",
      "Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.",
      "Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production.",
      "\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.",
      "David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.",
      "\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.",
      "Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.",
      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.",
      "That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",
      "Rahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.",
      "Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.",
      "\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.",
      "Another option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.",
      "Things could change fast",
      "Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as \"still far from the final conclusion\".",
      "\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.",
      "Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"",
      "Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.",
      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",
      "And Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.",
      "Sentiment in the US is a \"significant concern\" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "How does it affect me if share prices fall?",
      "Nintendo pulls Switch 2 pre-orders in US over Trump tariffs",
      "But ultimately he says firms may be forced to pass the cost of the levies on to consumers.",

      "He adds: \"How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact.\"",
      "China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.",
      "Part of the rationale behind Trump's tariff policy is because he wants more companies to manufacture their goods in the US.",
      "However, Prof Lu does not see Nike, or other companies, significantly reshaping its supply chain any time soon \"due to the complexity involved in footwear manufacturing\".",
      "That includes the time needed to \"consider a long list of factors when deciding where to source their products - quality, costs, speed to market and various social and environmental compliance risks\".",
      "Matt Powers from the Powers Advisory Group says the lack of American textile mills will make it \"difficult and expensive [for Nike] to pivot production back to the US\".",

    "published": "Sat, 05 Apr 2025 23:59:04 GMT",
    "summary": "What made the US step back from the system that it profited handsomely from for decades?",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out.",
      "The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.",
      "What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.",
      "And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.",
      "The great free trade debate",
      "Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.",
      "Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.",
      "The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.",
      "On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.",
      "There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.",
      "Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.",
      "Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.",
      "But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.",
      "The rationale behind 'reciprocal' tariffs",
      "It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.",
      "The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.",
      "In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers\u2026 The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"",
      "This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.",
      "This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.",
      "The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.",
      "While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.",
      "There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.",
      "The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (\u00a3216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.",
      "Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.",
      "'China shock' and the ripple effect",
      "There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".",
      "That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.",
      "For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\".",
      "In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy.",
      "Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.",
      "Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.",
      "Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.",
      "The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.",
      "Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",
      "The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.",
      "So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.",
      "But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.",
      "The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.",
      "The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.",
      "The first social media trade war",
      "Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.",
      "The world's consumers have choices.",
      "It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.",
      "Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.",
      "Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.",
      "These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.",
      "The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.",
      "In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.",
      "This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.",
      "Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.",
      "For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer watched in his flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw it in her study. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, accompanied by staff and pizza, took in President Donald Trump's big tariffs reveal on Wednesday from his office in Old Admiralty Arch, from where the British Navy was directed to protect and control trade on the high seas in days gone by.",
      "Ministers can only dream of having that kind of power now, as the UK watches on in growing horror at the bust-up between the US and China.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't realise they are living through a moment of history,\" a cabinet minister notes, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping square up to each other, and stock markets plunge. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations \u2013 including the UK \u2013 for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.",
      "So what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?",
      "Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be?",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "The PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.",
      "Trump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair's chummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.",
      "Those talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (\"space to talk about it\", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (\"not happening\", says a government source).",
      "But as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the \"ball is in their court\", said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump's new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK.",
      "\"We're expecting to hear from them any moment,\" one of those involved hopes. The risk, in the visible turmoil, is that any economic agreement could become a case of: don't call us, we'll call you. We'll be asking Darren Jones, the Treasury Minister, about it when he join us in the studio tomorrow.",
      "If a deal is done, however, do not expect an all-singing all-dancing arrangement. Instead, \"it would be a basic agreement on principles \u2013 rather than a super detailed trade agreement\", says a government source, contrasting these \"quick and dirty\" moves to long-running negotiations with India (\"we're on our 15th chapter with them!\").",
      "Uncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is \"not sitting here waiting for it \u2013 it's not the basket where all our eggs are\".",
      "For weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. A secret cabinet committee was considering how the UK might react if Trump's tariffs materialised.",
      "But now they are here, the actual response is\u2026 not to respond, and to spend four weeks asking businesses if they would like the government to respond later on. That is not just Whitehall dither: at this stage, there seems to be almost zero appetite among ministers to join in with the rounds of tariffs between the US, China, and perhaps the EU in coming days.",
      "One Whitehall figure working with business says \"there has not been a single voice in business, big or small, saying this is the wrong strategy\".",
      "Ministers' approach to get businesses on board, like when Sir Keir invited dozens of big wigs to No 10 the morning after Trump's tariff announcement, is in part because of the anger when the government increased National Insurance contributions. \"The really calm reaction,\" one source says, \"is because we got people into the headspace where tariffs were going to happen \u2013 one of the businesses said they were being borderline stalked, we've been trying to persuade business to trust the process.\"",
      "The government is in no rush, and has no enthusiasm to introduce its own new tariffs, and for now at least, demands on them to do so are muted. According to a minister: \"Most people have considerable numbers of jobs in their constituencies on the line \u2013 even in cabinet there might have been some question marks but there weren't this week.\"",
      "And they joke that the Lib Dems, who are calling for tariffs in retaliation, \"keep demanding a trade war but I don't think they'll lead the nation\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who also does not want extra tariffs, will be on tomorrow's show too.",
      "But just as the government is going slow on hitting back, they are cracking heads to crack on with their existing plans faster.",
      "This isn't all about Trump. I understand the chancellor is looking at whether any of the money announced in the government's vital Spending Review can be brought forward from June. If government departments are able to finalise their deals, can that be sorted and made public as soon as possible?",
      "There are discussions too about whether it's possible to speed up the long waited-for Industrial Strategy \u2013 a plan to get investment into the UK pencilled in for June, but could it be brought forward? A decision hasn't been made but the prime minister is again, his team indicate, trying to use the jeopardy around the world as an impetus to push the government machine harder. \"We have to run quickly towards this,\" a government source says \u2013 and the chancellor is looking at it this weekend.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "You might feel, haven't I heard this before? You'd be right. Since the start of the year, the prime minister and the chancellor have both repeatedly said the government has to go faster, work harder. So why after years in opposition weren't Starmer's team ready to go with all of these changes when they got into office? For a government that promised to be radical, its plans have not always been forthcoming.",
      "You may not fancy the kind of radicalism we're seeing out of the White House, but radical it certainly is. To compete, the UK may need to be that too.",
      "It is ludicrous to imagine the PM is \"very happy\" that the UK has been hit with tariffs as Trump suggested \u2013 \"artistic licence\", a government source remarked. No British action can completely insulate our economy from disruption abroad. But the government's own actions do matter, and this could be a defining moment.",
      "While there's been no lack of trying to soften the blows for the UK, the government's hopes have been dashed already. First, ministers believed the UK could escape tariffs, then they said they were prepared in case, then disappointed when they arrived.",
      "As Sir Keir spends another weekend on the phone, and his officials wait for their phone to ring, the government doesn't know what it will be able to say next.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",

      "The notice period is used by some nurseries to deliberately mislead inspectors, some nursery workers told us. Managers ask friends or family to attend, they say, to make a nursery appear fully staffed.",
      "One former worker said 15 babies had been left sleeping in a room with only a baby monitor and no staff members to look after them. But when Ofsted announced an inspection, managers called in staff from other locations.",
      "The ex-Ofsted inspector says she witnessed workers man-handling children during inspections. \"If you can do that in front of someone, what are you planning on doing if nobody is watching?\" she adds.",
      "Misleading inspections is an \"appalling practice\", says Yvette Stanley, Ofsted's Head of Early Years and Social Care - adding that inspectors have to rely on the \"integrity of providers\".",
      "As police reviewed nursery CCTV as part of their investigation into Genevieve's death, it revealed a second staff member had also been causing harm to children.",
      "Rebecca Gregory was jailed for three years last September after being convicted of the wilful neglect and ill-treatment of children, including threatening and pushing babies younger than one.",
      "Ofsted inspectors do not routinely check CCTV footage - and the regulator says it cannot mandate CCTV use in nurseries.",
      "There is no government guidance on checking footage during inspections and it does not have the resources to do this, it adds.",
      "The former owners of Tiny Toes in Stockport say they cannot comment because of an ongoing investigation by Stockport Council.",
      "Local authorities are responsible for investigating any safeguarding concerns at nurseries.",
      "In light of our findings from Ofsted about a broad range of incidents, we asked councils across England about the specific number of times harm had been caused to children by nursery workers.",
      "Seventy-two out of more than 150 councils responded to Freedom of Information requests with figures indicating there had been 5,795 reports or allegations of children being harmed by nursery workers, over a five-year period between 2019 and 2024.",
      "There were like-for-like figures from 36 councils for both that period and the five years up to 2015, when Ofsted stopped routine no-notice inspections.",
      "Reports of harm to young children almost tripled over that time - from 1,303 between 2010-15, to 3,342 between 2019-24. These figures may include cases where the incident was either accidental or unproven.",
      "Standards of care are low and if something does not change there will be \"more accidents, more harm to babies, more unhappy parents and children,\" says early childhood professor Helen Penn.",
      "Ofsted says it is giving \"conspicuous care and monitoring\" to reports of harm to children.",
      "More frequent inspections may be a solution, says Ofsted's Yvette Stanley, but she says the regulator does not currently have the resources available to do this.",
      "\"We think we do enough no-notice inspections to reassure ourselves in the cases where the data is worrying,\" she adds.",
      "The Early Years Alliance added that children's safety should \"never be compromised\" and it welcomed any action which strengthens this.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) has said it will introduce stronger safeguarding measures in early years settings in September, including \"enhanced recruitment practices\" intended to prevent unsuitable people from working with children.",
      "A spokesperson said the department will \"continue to closely monitor whether any further changes to safeguarding requirements are needed in early years to keep children as safe as possible\"."

      "The government plans to spend the money raised on more teachers for state schools in England.",
      "But a legal challenge to the policy has been taken to the High Court, with some families and schools claiming it is discriminatory and in breach of human rights laws.",
      "What is VAT and when was it added to private school fees?",
      "Value added tax (VAT) is one of the government's main sources of income. It is payable on top of the purchase price of many goods or services and the standard rate is 20%.",
      "Previously, private schools did not have to charge VAT on their fees because of an exemption for organisations providing education.",
      "Private school fees are liable for 20% VAT from 1 January.",

      "Separate legislation will be introduced to remove this tax relief, but plans to remove private schools' charitable status have been dropped.",
      "Why was the VAT policy challenged in court?",
      "The legal challenge was brought by three groups: the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents more than 1,400 private schools, a smaller group of Christian faith schools, and the parent-led group Education not Discrimination.",
      "They argued that the policy goes against the legal right to an education.",
      "They also claim the policy is discriminatory, as those families attending low-paying faith schools, or with children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) who do not have an education, health and care plan (EHCP), say their needs \"cannot be adequately met in the state sector\".",
      "But the government said the main objective of the VAT policy is to raise additional tax revenue so they can raise standards for the 94% of children who attend state schools.",
      "Their lawyers argued that those who wish to opt out of \"the system of universally accessible, state-funded education\" are free to choose any private education for their child that they can afford, or to educate their child at home.",
      "If the legal challenge is successful, the government could consider whether it would amend the policy, but it would be under no obligation to do so.",

      "Will private school fees go up for everyone?",
      "Applying VAT does not necessarily mean fees will go up by 20%. Some private schools may decide to put up their fees more than others.",
      "On average, the government expects fees to increase by around 10%.",
      "The average cost of private school fees has risen by 55% since 2003, even without VAT, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tanks says.",
      "However, the proportion of children being privately educated over the period has not fallen.",

      "What could the tax change mean for state schools?",
      "The government does not expect a significant impact on the number of pupils attending private schools.",
      "It estimates that around 37,000 students will move to the state sector over the long term, but believes class sizes will not increase.",
      "It points to research by the IFS which says it would be possible for the state sector to \"easily accommodate extra pupils\" because overall student numbers are set to fall by 700,000 by 2030.",
      "That drop is larger than the total number of children currently attending private schools.",
      "However, pupil numbers are not falling by the same amount everywhere, so some individual state schools could face pressure on class sizes.",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Apr 2025 12:01:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The artist opens a major exhibition in Paris, but the 87-year-old feared he wouldn\u2019t make it.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't take long to make David Hockney laugh.",
      "At nearly 88 years old, he is frail but still very dapper in his beige, red and black houndstooth suit with a white silk handkerchief poking out of the pocket, and trademark round yellow glasses perched on his nose.",
      "Britain's most popular artist chuckles a lot, his throaty laugh betraying his many years of smoking.",
      "But, he tells me, as a young student from Bradford at the Royal College of Art in London in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the other students laughed at him.",
      "\"People would mock my accent,\" he says. But it didn't faze him. Hockney knew his worth even then. \"I'd look at their artworks and I'd think, well, if I drew like that, I'd keep my mouth shut.\"",
      "What would the young boy growing up in Bradford think about the life he'd go on to have and the work he'd create?",
      "\"He'd have thought it was pretty daft.\"",
      "For decades, Hockney has been among the world's greatest living artists, and he is now opening his biggest ever show.",
      "As we sit together in a vast gallery at the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a stunning museum designed in reflective glass on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, I ask him what he thinks of the exhibition.",
      "He says it's his best ever, and bursts into laughter again.",
      "It's an expression of pure delight at the 11 rooms filled across four floors with his art - and at being alive to see it. \"I'm just laughing, I mean we made it!\"",
      "Two years ago, when they started planning the exhibition, \"I just thought I probably wouldn't be here\", he says. \"I'm still a smoker, a happy smoker fed up of bossy people telling you what to do... but I didn't know.\"",
      "Hockney is sporting a badge that says \"End Bossiness Soon\" in a gallery dedicated to his love of spring. During the pandemic in 2020, Hockney, who was living in Normandy, used his iPad to paint the trees and flowers blooming as spring arrived.",
      "Those 220 iPad works adorn this gallery, floor to ceiling, the walls bursting with blossom and pure joy, made at a time when the world wasn't feeling very hopeful.",
      "Visitors to the show are greeted at the entrance by Hockney's message from that time: \"Do remember they can't cancel the spring.\"",
      "Hockney has been in poor health. He now has two full-time carers, who have accompanied him to Paris from London, where he now lives. Portraits of both, sitting in their dark blue nurses' uniforms, are the most recent works in the exhibition, made earlier this year.",
      "A self-portrait of Hockney, painting and smoking a cigarette (his two great loves) is also very new.",
      "He still paints for four to six hours every day, he tells me.",
      "He believes you can't judge a painter until their last work is done - but looking at his own work gathered together in Paris, \"I can see what I was always trying to do, really\".",
      "And he promises that \"anybody who has just a little visual sensibility will really enjoy this show\".",
      "His great-nephew Richard Hockney, who has regularly sat for him for 28 years, since he was four years old, including for this exhibition, tells me everyone was determined the artist would make it to Paris.",
      "The night before, Hockney got into a car with his dachshund Tess to be driven across the Channel. And on the morning before they left, they were playing him variations of the jazz classic April in Paris.",
      "Having arrived, \"he is glowing\", Richard says. \"I think this will keep him going for a long, long time, to be honest.\"",
      "And with spring unfolding in the French capital, it's entirely appropriate that the artist known for chronicling spring would open his exhibition, David Hockney 25, now.",
      "This is a man who would fly back from his home in Los Angeles when he heard the hawthorn had begun to blossom in his native Yorkshire, just so he could paint the dazzling spectacle.",
      "Some of his earliest works, including probably his most famous, A Bigger Splash, are also on show in Paris.",
      "That painting, capturing the moment of a swimmer diving into a Santa Monica pool, is on the wall next to Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), the south of France pool painting that broke records when it sold at auction in 2018 for \u00a370m.",
      "Next to those are Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy, another of Hockney's most recognisable works, which depicts his good friend Celia Birtwell and her husband Ossie Clark, with their white cat on his knee.  Seeing them brought together in one room is spectacular.",
      "But the show's main focus is the last 25 years because \"it's 2025\", he says. \"People think it's miserable, but in 1925 they'd had the First World War.\"",
      "It's a visual feast, full of the bright colours and optimism for which Hockney has become known.",
      "\"I've always had it. I've always thought it was an absurd world.\"",
      "A world to laugh at, to look at closely, as Hockney does, and to paint vibrantly.",
      "Some of the iPad paintings are huge. He's \"amazed they could be blown up so big\" when they were created on something so small.",
      "One room is almost pitch dark to show off paintings he did of the Moon, made possible by advances in iPad technology.",
      "There's also a floor devoted to his portraits (about 60), including a 2022 painting of singer Harry Styles in a striped cardigan with a set of pearls around his neck.",
      "But the rest are the friends and family Hockney knows well - Birtwell, her children and grandchildren, the show's curator Sir Norman Rosenthal wearing full regalia, Hockney's partner JP, sometimes with Tess the dog - and two of Richard.",
      "Even though they're related, when he's having a portrait done \"it's very surreal looking at him and then realising you're being painted by David Hockney\", he tells me. \"You know he's always going to create a masterpiece.\"",
      "His great uncle chooses to paint people he loves because \"he sees the truer representation of yourself than you do\". In one of the portraits, Richard is grinning, in a green and white striped T-shirt.",
      "Because Hockney likes Richard's cheeky grin, \"he will sit there and grin at me because he knows it's going to make me grin... after six hours, it aches a bit\".",
      "King Charles went to visit Hockney at home in London before he travelled. \"He's a very nice man, thoughtful, I thought,\" the artist says. \"He does watercolours himself.\"",
      "But he doesn't fancy painting the King. \"The problem there is the majesty, isn't it really? I would find that a bit difficult, I think.\"",
      "He does, though, have a work on the go, a new painting of his great-nephew.",
      "Richard tells me Hockney \"says he's still got a lot of work to do, which is good\", adding: \"As long as that's in his head, then he'll keep going.\"",
      "The artist says he'll finish his painting of his great nephew and then \"I will paint somebody else. And I just carry on.\"",
      "Watch Katie Razzall's full interview - David Hockney: A Life in Art - on BBC iPlayer.",

      "Lily, 20, - whose name has been changed to protect her anonymity - was one of several of Westwood's victims. In February, he was jailed for 15 and a half years for a horrifying catalogue of abuse against five victims, but the BBC is aware of two women whose charges were dropped before they could get to court.",

      "Clem Burke, the drummer for 1970s new wave band Blondie, has died aged 70 following a \"private battle with cancer\", the band's spokesperson has\u00a0confirmed to the BBC.",
      "Named one of the greatest drummers of all time by Rolling Stone magazine, his energetic fills and melodic flourishes elevated UK number one hits like Call Me, The Tide Is High, Atomic and Heart Of Glass - with Burke deftly switching between punk, reggae, disco and hip-hop grooves.",
      "In a long and varied career, he also played with Iggy Pop, Bob Dylan, The Ramones, Eurythmics and Take That's Mark Owen.",
      "\"Clem was not just a drummer; he was the heartbeat of Blondie,\" his bandmates said in a tribute posted on Facebook.",
      "\"His talent, energy, and passion for music were unmatched, and his contributions to our sound and success are immeasurable,\" wrote singer Debbie Harry and guitarist Chris Stein.",
      "\"Beyond his musicianship, Clem was a source of inspiration both on and off the stage. His vibrant spirit, infectious enthusiasm and rock solid work ethic touched everyone who had the privilege of knowing him.\"",
      "Burke was born and raised in New Jersey, and said his earliest memory was \"playing my father's kit along to the Four Seasons\".",
      "He gained experience in marching bands and cover groups, before being recruited for Blondie in 1974.",
      "From the start, he envisioned his role as something more than a mere time-keeper.",
      "\"I always appreciated drummers like Hal Blaine (Phil Spector's go-to session drummer) and Earl Palmer (Little Richard, Fats Domino) who were consummate studio musicians, and had the kind of musicality and versatility that I aspired to,\" he told Mixdown magazine last year.",
      "\"I wanted to be able to contribute to the song rather than detract.\"",
      "The band made their name in New York punk clubs such as CBGB, alongside contemporaries such as Talking Heads, Television, and Patti Smith and released their self-titled debut album in 1976.",
      "However, it was 1978's Parallel Lines that made them household names, powered by new wave hits like One Way Or Another and the disco grooves of Heart of Glass.",
      "Recording the drum track for Heart Of Glass was a torturous experience, however.",
      "Producer Mike Chapman wanted to synchronise Burke's playing to a Roland drum machine - an experimental procedure that led to the drummer playing each of his drums individually, then piecing together the rhythm track over the period of a week.",
      "By the end of the session, \"he was ready to kill me,\" Chapman later told the Wall Street Journal.",
      "When Stein became critically ill in 1982, Blondie disbanded.",
      "Burke spent the intervening years playing with US rock band The Romantics, and worked with everyone from Pete Townshend and Joan Jett, to Sex Pistol Steve Jones and The Ramones - for whom he adopted the stage name Elvis Ramone.",
      "However, he returned to Blondie when they reformed in 1999, and scored his sixth UK number one single with the anthemic Maria.",
      "Speaking to BBC News in 2021, Harry said that having Burke back in the band meant their legacy wouldn't be diluted.",
      "\"I think a lot of times when bands get back together, they don't have enough of the original musicians,\" she said.",
      "\"With Chris and Clem and myself, we had that core, and it really weighed heavily, you know?\"",
      "The band have continued to perform and record ever since, and played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage in 2023.",
      "Burke also became involved with a years-long study of the physical and psychological effects of drumming.",
      "That led to the establishment of the Clem Burke Drumming Project in 2008, whose detailed studies showed that drummers can reach the same physical exertion as professional athletes.",
      "As a result, he was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Gloucestershire in 2011.",
      "Burke made his last appearance with Blondie at Northern Ireland's Belsonic festival last summer, still wearing his CBGB t-shirt.",
      "\"His influence and contributions have spanned decades and genres, leaving an indelible mark on every project he was a part of,\" wrote Harry and Stein on Facebook.",
      "\"We extend our deepest condolences to Clem's family, friends, and fans around the world. His legacy will live on through the tremendous amount of music he created and the countless lives he touched.",

      "A DNA test later proved that Ms Hanna was indeed Mr Hornigold's mother.",
      "Ms Hanna, who was charged with five counts of fraud, appeared before a district court on Saturday via video link. She was seen lying on a hospital bed, accompanied by an investigating officer, Singapore's Channel NewsAsia reported.",
      "She is accused of deceiving three men in Singapore and France into transferring money to her accounts, claiming the funds were needed as legal fees and for the opening of new bank accounts.",
      "Ms Hanna sought their sympathy by saying she was terminally ill and vouched to reimburse them through inheritance, claiming that she is part of the Brunei royal family. Her son questions these claims in the documentary.",
      "In exchange for their money, she also made promises to donate millions of dollars to a mosque and a Muslim non-profit organisation in Singapore, the court heard.",
      "It is unclear how much money her alleged victims lost, but Singapore police said preliminary investigations show she is involved in at least five cases of cheating with losses amounting to more than S$200,000 ($149,000; \u00a3115,400).",
      "If convicted, Ms Hanna faces up to 20 years in jail and a fine.",
      "Con Mum, which was released on Netflix on 25 March, follows Mr Hornigold's reunion with Ms Hanna in the UK during the pandemic.",
      "She presented herself as a wealthy, illegitimate daughter of the sultan of Brunei, initially showering Mr Hornigold, his then-partner Heather Kaniuk and his friends with lavish gifts, from cars to homes.",
      "Though initially sceptical, Mr Hornigold, who has worked in Michelin-starred restaurants and founded Longboys Doughnuts, quickly developed a close relationship with his mother.",
      "Over time however, Ms Hanna began to leave Mr Hornigold and his friends to foot her escalating bills - Mr Hornigold said in the film that he lost \u00a3300,000 - while she disappeared.",
      "The film suggests that Ms Hanna had previously been convicted in the UK for shoplifting and fraud."

      "Now, 50 years since the record's release, the woman who delivered those words can still scarcely believe her 15 seconds of fame.",
      "It all began when receptionist and secretary Cathy Redfern answered the phone at Stockport's Strawberry Studios, which were part-owned by the critically acclaimed Mancunian band.",
      "She was blissfully unaware drummer Kevin Godley felt the \"middle eight\" section was lacking a certain something in Eric Stewart's song about his wife not being happy with him for hardly ever saying he loved her.",
      "The band had added layers of overdubbed vocals and haunting instrumentalism to the song.",
      "Godley was whispering the line \"Be quiet - big boys don't cry\" in the control room when Cathy popped in to deliver a message.",

      "At the time, she did not really think much of it, other than a brief distraction from her day job.",
      "All that changed, though, when the song hit number one and 10cc performed it on BBC One's Top Of The Pops.",
      "Looking back, she told the BBC: \"It is a fabulous song. I never get tired of hearing it even now. It just stops you in your tracks really.",
      "\"I never thought I would be hearing it 50 years later.\"",

    "summary": "The Liverpool actor on the new BBC drama that conflicts a life of crime with love and vulnerability.",
    "story": [
      "In This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.",
      "So it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the \"Scouse Sopranos\" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.",
      "Nelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.",
      "Inconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.",
      "It's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's \"most amazing\" TV experience to date.",
      "\"It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,\" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.",
      "\"Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,\" he adds. \"It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.\"",
      "He believes it is important to show on screen how \"we are allowed to change\".",
      "\"Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.",
      "\"Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.\"",
      "The rising star, who has been mentioned as potential future James Bond, previously appeared opposite Sheffield actor Bean in another Merseyside crime drama, Time.",
      "And he has featured alongside another Liverpudlian, Stephen Graham, in Time, Little Boy Blue, and the recent historical drama A Thousand Blows.",
      "He says his latest character's respect for his partner in crime, Ronnie, was a mirror of his real life working relationship with Bean, who he describes as \"a gift\" of a co-star and a \"kind human being\".",
      "Graham is \"so supportive\" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's own headline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.",
      "This City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played \"hard men\" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate \"all of the other qualities\" he possesses, until now.",
      "'Superb crime thriller'",
      "The Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a \"superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties\". Critic Anita Singh noted that it \"doesn't quite live up to\" the Sopranos \"but it comes close\".",
      "In a four-star review, the Independent said Nelson-Joyce's \"conflicted gangster\" and the show's \"moral ambivalence\" elevated it \"above the average boilerplate crime drama\".",
      "The Guardian's Lucy Mangan awarded three stars, however, suggesting \"the fantastic performances don't do enough to lift this Scouse Sopranos.\"",
      "But the Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it \"is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence\".",
      "The show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\".",
      "\"We haven't got as many cured meats,\" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.",
      "Another reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to \"explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.\"",
      "\"Once greed and secrets take hold, the fabric of any society, including a family, begins to fray,\" he adds.",
      "Former engineer Butchard was keen to capture the \"vibrancy\" of his native Liverpool, which he describes as a \"really handsome\" and \"friendly\" modern world city.",
      "Beautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).",
      "\"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.",
      "\"Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.\"",
      "He says he was was impressed with the \"wonderful\" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.",
      "As for genuine Scouser Nelson-Joyce, just when he thought he was out, the producers may have pulled him back in for a second series.",
      "\"We want to do a season two\" says the star.",
      "\"It would be mad if there wasn't\" offers Dibb.",
      "Both underline the overwhemingly positive responses they've received, particularly from viewers with purple bins.",
      "\"Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,\" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would \"not hold back\" in saying so if not.",
      "He recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had \"done they city proud\".",
      "The reaction has been \"really lovely\" and \"a bit crazy\" adds Nelson-Joyce.",
      "\"It feels like the whole city loves it,\" he says. \"I think people really bought the relationship between me and Hannah and really wanted us to work.\"",
      "His celebrity pal, ex-Liverpool footballer Jamie Carragher told him personally last week that he thought the show was \"[expletive] brilliant\".",

    "story": [
      "Five years on from Megxit, as the Duchess of Sussex builds her new lifestyle empire, her viewing figures are high but, in the UK at least, popularity levels are low. So, ahead of the release of her new podcast tomorrow, experts ask whether anything she does can win wider appeal?",
      "Listen to Daniela read this article",
      "\"The problem is that people are much more interested in the royal gossip than they are in learning how to make a jam.\" The Countess of Sandwich gets to the crux of what she sees as the Duchess of Sussex's rebrand dilemma.",
      "As an American woman who married into the British aristocracy back in 2004, the countess knows firsthand the challenge of slipping between two cultures.",
      "When I first spoke to her about this - long before \"Megxit\" - she was positive that Meghan would win over the nation. \"Having this American optimism and this go-get attitude, that is what you guys kind of like about us, right?\" she told me.",
      "Seven years on, the countess remains optimistic about Meghan's progress. \"As an American, I look at her and I think she's a hustler. She's taking these opportunities, using them as stepping stones to get to where she wants to go.\"",
      "Only not everyone appears to agree. In the UK, Meghan's popularity rating was just 19% at the start of 2025 according to a YouGov poll, down from 26% a year earlier. (In the US, the view is slightly more favourable, sitting at 43% in January 2025.)",
      "Her recent Netflix lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan, which featured her upcycling supermarket bouquets and scenting flannels with lavender water, wasn't received entirely warmly either.",
      "Despite it being the tenth most watched Netflix programme globally in its first week, audiences gave it a rating of just 33% on the film and television review website, Rotten Tomatoes (based on more than 2,500 votes).",
      "This was followed by the launch of her new brand As Ever, selling, among other things, \u00a311 ($14) edible flower petals and jars of \u00a321.50 ($28) wildflower honey. These sold out within a day, yet this too was met by criticism in some quarters \u2014 with prices being lambasted and some questioning whether Meghan had a clear vision for the brand.",
      "Now, she is set to host a new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, which launches tomorrow. In an Instagram post, she wrote with some excitement: \"I've been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities.\" But the question now is how will this be received.",
      "And, as her era of brand builder, lifestyle influencer, and businesswoman steams on, what will it really take for her to broaden her popularity and win over those who are circumspect - or downright negative?",
      "Or could it be that no matter how successful her bottom line or however pioneering her next project, a wider issue is holding back the possibility of broader appeal - and if that really is the case, how to shrug that off?",
      "Five years on: Megxit's lingering impact",
      "It has been five years since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex walked out of Westminster Abbey, after the annual Commonwealth Service, and into a life away from royal duty.",
      "As the couple's grand finale in the UK, it made the optics around the service incredibly tense. Even the question of how the royal party should enter the Abbey became a sticking point.",
      "The printed order of service did not include Prince Harry and Meghan in the official royal arrival. The plan had been for them to take their seats earlier, and for Elizabeth II to lead a small procession of senior royals into the Abbey slightly later. However this decision upset the couple, according to those planning the service.",
      "It was eventually decided, in order to diffuse the situation, that the Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales (back then, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) would not walk behind the Queen either. Instead, like Prince Harry and Meghan, they would take their seats earlier.",
      "Someone who attended the service that day described it to me as \"deeply uncomfortable\".",
      "The friction set the mood for the years ahead. And though Meghan has only made two visits to the UK since 9 March 2020, and her life is now firmly rooted in her home state of California, the impact continues, according to some experts.",
      "According to Evan Nierman, a US-based public relations guru: \"Whatever she does to distance herself, it comes back to Buckingham Palace and her relationship with the Royal Family.\"",
      "Mark Borkowski, founder of the UK-based Borkowski communications agency, also believes that whatever Meghan does next, it will always be filtered through \"the royal lens\". \"Even when Meghan is launching jam or Harry is speaking about mental health, the coverage returns to the same question: are they thriving or failing in their post-royal life?\"",
      "There have been questions around choices the couple have made since leaving the UK, too, particularly around the polarising interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, and through the publication of Prince Harry's memoir Spare in 2023.",
      "One source who has worked with them described this as \"brave and idiotic\".",
      "With that chapter behind them, it was natural that they would focus on new income streams that don't involve talking about the Royal Family. But as Mr Nierman, founder of Red Banyan Public Relations in the US, puts it: \"She's trying to stand out on her own, but she has this level of notoriety and fame that is inextricably linked to the Royal Family.\"",
      "Much of the response to Meghan, positive or negative, \"is driven by her marriage to Prince Harry and her ties to the Royal Family\", argues James Crawford, managing director of PR Agency One. \"That connection shapes how everything she does is received.\"",
      "'An unerring instinct for getting it wrong'",
      "Early indications are that though her public popularity may not be sky-high, this is not necessarily translating into lack of business success.",
      "Some critics, though, tell another story. Tina Brown, the former Vanity Fair editor, put her own review somewhat harshly, concluding that Meghan has an \"unerring instinct for getting it wrong\".",
      "On the Netflix series, which was released on 4 March, she added: \"Meghan has come out with a show about fake perfection just when the zeitgeist has turned raucously against it.\"",
      "Other criticism has also focused on a perceived lack of relatability, in a show that was designed to revolve around the duchess casually sharing hosting tips with friends.",
      "\"High on gloss, low on human connection,\" said British Vogue. \"Toe-curlingly unlovable TV,\" said The Guardian, while The Telegraph, somewhat cruelly, called the series an \"exercise in narcissism\".",
      "Royal author Sally Beddell Smith, meanwhile, feels that the approach itself was a misstep. \"What mystifies me is why not relaunch The Tig,\" she says, referring to the lifestyle website that Meghan once ran.",
      "\"It had brand loyalty and was easily identifiable. She did it well. It was snappy, it had a reason to exist. It could have really given her a leg up. Why not reignite it?\"",
      "And yet negative responses will not have surprised Prince Harry and Meghan, according to people who work with the couple. They were, I'm told, braced for criticism.",
      "And there were positive responses too, particularly outside the UK. \"Some international press praised the show's warm, feel-good tone and visual polish, seeing it as a natural return to Meghan's pre-royal lifestyle roots,\" points out Mr Crawford.",
      "\"Likewise, her brand has been well received in some quarters for its positioning and premium aesthetic.\"",
      "The benefits of the Marmite effect",
      "With Love, Meghan was far from a disaster in the ratings, with 2.6 million views in its first week. Though this was well behind the launch of a sci-fi drama, Halo: Season One, which had 4.2 million views in the same period, experts point out that such comparisons are perhaps unfair.",
      "\"I would never have predicted it to be right at the top of charts,\" argues Adam Miller, TV editor of Metro. \"A lifestyle show is never going to be at the top against a drama or a thriller... For Netflix, I reckon it's about as expected.\"",
      "What's more, With Love, Meghan was never going to change opinions of those who are already, for whatever reason, predisposed against her - just as her new podcast series is unlikely to.",
      "Existing Meghan fans will likely enjoy the programme. For those who don't like Meghan, the series is likely to irritate. And according to some experts, a Marmite effect is no bad thing.",
      "\"In today's polarised media landscape, divisiveness isn't always a disadvantage,\" argues PR guru Mr Crawford.",
      "The wider question is how to respond to it. And Meghan's recent approach has become more direct. After podcaster Amanda Hirsch posted a picture of the Netflix series trailer with the caption: \"You guys I'm scared for Meghan,\" the duchess allegedly responded with a handwritten note.",
      "\"Dear Amanda, I heard you are feeling scared,\" the note reads. \"Don't be. This is the fun part \u2014 let's enjoy it.\"",
      "Likewise, she responded with humour to rumours of a potential feud with actress and Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow.",
      "In an Instagram video, Ms Paltrow remarked: \"I genuinely do not understand this at all, whatsoever.\" She then turned her head to ask someone off screen: \"Do you understand this?\" The actress revealed Meghan sitting beside her, who shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly, while eating a piece of pie.",
      "It was a marketing triumph - a sign that, while she's taking notice, she knows what is really needed. That is, a fresh approach - and that's what Meghan the businesswoman is all about.",
      "At home with the Sussexes",
      "Away from business, life for the couple in California is largely a private one. Their multi-million dollar home in Montecito, around two hours drive up the coast from Los Angeles, is secluded and well-guarded and they have kept their circle of loyal friends tight - among them, tennis star Serena Williams, as well as actress Abigail Spencer.",
      "Meghan has talked about bonding with parents of her children's friends too, describing nights out, Pilates classes and sharing children's parties.",
      "When the couple go out for dinner, however, they are mostly left to themselves. Chef Vikram Vij has a restaurant in Vancouver where he says the couple have dined on several occasions. \"Everybody knew they were there but they weren't disturbed,\" says Mr Vij.",
      "\"They were both aware and so respectful of every person that came in contact with them,\" he adds. \"They took the time to say hello to us as a kitchen [and] paid the whole bill for themselves and their security, which I thought was very respectful.\"",
      "Yet for every positive story comes a negative one \u2013 with contradictory claims of less positive experiences from those who have worked with and known the couple.",
      "\"The atmosphere around Harry and Meghan is so febrile,\" says Vanity Fair contributing editor, Anna Peele, who spent months working on a piece about the couple.",
      "More recently, a row around the running of Sentebale, the charity that Prince Harry co-founded in honour of his late mother, has escalated into a bitter dispute, which will now be investigated by the Charity Commission.",
      "Insiders and those who have worked at Sentebale have been robust in their defence of Prince Harry and Meghan, and critical of accusations.",
      "But though this is largely a story about Prince Harry and his charity work, there is a Meghan element to it too, suggesting she is still not able to disentangle herself and her brand from interest in the Royal Family.",
      "'A spare to his wife'?",
      "The question of where Meghan and Prince Harry go from here is up for debate. \"They keep trying new things,\" argues Ms Peele. \"Harry and Meghan have the best of intentions but intentions doesn't always mean impact.\"",
      "Mr Niemar, meanwhile, believes that the best way to address this is to shake off the past and keep doing what they are already doing.",
      "\"They got what they were after - global fame exposed what they felt they needed to do,\" he says. \"But you can only ride that train for so long\u2026 She's doing the right thing trying to carve out something new.\"",
      "However their next steps require careful consideration. For royal author Sally Bedell Smith, it's no longer just about where Meghan pivots next, but how Prince Harry fits into that. \"Do they scale back and live in a more modest way? Does Harry throw himself into the cause of helping veterans and do things in a quiet way and at a lower key?\"",
      "With a pause she adds: \"He's now a spare to his wife.\"",
      "And yet many royal watchers are optimistic that, despite some negative reviews of late, their path ahead will be a success. \"It's never too late to turn things around,\" says Katie Nicholl, journalist and author of The New Royals.",
      "\"But there's a sense that these two need to listen to their advisers, focus on the next five years and really have a concrete plan... Hollywood is a hard town to crack and they've proved that royal titles alone aren't enough to guarantee success.\"",
      "What that success could look like is a bigger question still. Some have mooted a return to acting for Meghan, who previously starred in the legal drama, Suits, though no one I spoke to recently felt this was realistic. (Although a cameo on the reboot of Suits, which will be set in Los Angeles, would cause a stir.)",
      "\"She's not the same person she was on Suits. She's not the American girl at the Palace,\" argues Ms Peele. \"She has evolved.\" So far, this involves being a business mogul, lifestyle entrepreneur and content creator.",
      "But Katie Nicholl believes that much of their potential now lies away from lifestyle programming and media deals.",
      "\"While they need to be commercially successful, I think much of their success depends on their philanthropy, on really developing their Archewell Foundation and using their global spotlight for good.",
      "\"That's where they really have impact and stand out.\"",

    "summary": "The singer has won thousands of new fans on the Sabrina Carpenter tour, seven years into her career.",
    "story": [
      "When Rachel Chinouriri played London's O2 Arena last month, she cried.",
      "The new wave indie songwriter was there as the support act for Sabrina Carpenter, just a week after her first Brit Awards, where she was nominated for artist of the year.",
      "Seven years after her debut single, those milestones felt like a validation.",
      "No wonder she shed a tear.",
      "\"A lot of it was stress relief,\" says the 26-year-old, \"but I also felt strangely at home.",
      "\"I was just like, 'Wow, is this my life'.\"",
      "Chinouriri was booked for the tour after Carpenter fell in love with her song All I Ever Asked and started playing it as her walk-on music in the US.",
      "We speak on the 14th date, as she prepares to play Assago, Italy. By this point, she's having a blast \u2013 bounding across the catwalk every night, and dropping to her knees between songs to talk to the audience at eye level.",
      "But she admits the first couple of shows were \"slightly rough\".",
      "\"I filmed Graham Norton for the first time on Friday, then it was the Brit Awards on Saturday. The tour started in Dublin on Monday, and I had to film a music video on my day off.\"",
      "\"I was having a lot of first time experiences and trying to figure out what I was comfortable with on the road,\" she says.",
      "\"I'd say from show five, I was starting to enjoy myself.\"",
      "If there were nerves, they didn't show.",
      "The singer's infectious energy and knotty pop-rock songs have been picking up new fans in every city. One reviewer called her set \"the perfect sweet treat before the main feast\". At the end of March, she surpassed 4 million monthly listeners on Spotify for the first time. Adele sent her a bouquet of roses.",
      "Rachel Chinouriri is officially having a moment - but it hasn't come quickly.",
      "A former Brit School student, she released her first single, So My Darling, in 2018, and spent the next few years honing her sound.",
      "The 2019 EP Mama's Boy was a mellow blend of soulful pop, while 2021's Four\u00b0 In Winter was full of atmospheric electronic soundscapes.",
      "Underneath it all, though, Chinouriri was an indie kid. Raised in Croydon by strict Zimbabwean parents, she'd only been allowed to listen to Christian music at home. When they went out, the singer and her siblings would blast out hits by Coldplay, MIA, Lily Allen and Daughter.",
      "Once she incorporated those sounds to her music, Chinouriri's career took off. All I Ever Asked \u2013 a chirpy rock anthem that disguises a desperately sad story about being undervalued \u2013 won her support slots with Lewis Capaldi and Louis Tomlinson.",
      "Florence Pugh declared herself a fan, and ended up starring in the video for Never Need Me, a killer kiss-off to a boyfriend who left her dangling.",
      "For a musician who'd suffered crippling anxiety as a teenager (\"I was pulling my hair out, and having panic attacks\") the success was entirely unexpected.",
      "\"British culture is quite self-deprecating,\" she says, \"so when I was younger, I just didn't believe I could do these things.",
      "\"Even the fact I can say I'm a two-time Brit nominee is still quite surreal. Then I'm like, Why is it surreal?",
      "\"I do deserve it because I've been making music since I was 16, and I haven't stopped'.\"",
      "Chinouriri's debut album, the noughties-flavoured What A Devastating Turn Of Events, was finally released last May.",
      "Initially charting at number 17, it has continued to sell steadily, thanks to the continued popularity of All I Ever Asked on TiKTok, as well as Chinouriri's scene-stealing festival performances.",
      "Reflecting on her rise, she says there is a \"privilege to having a slow-paced career\".",
      "\"I've seen what happens when you skyrocket or go viral. If I'd a massive hit song when I was 21, I wouldn't have been ready in any way, shape or form \u2013 mentally or professionally. I'd be panicking.",
      "\"So now that things are skyrocketing, I just need to remember that what I'm good at is writing how I feel and turning those feelings into music.",
      "\"And even though there's more opinions about what I'm doing now, I need to trust my gut.\"",
      "Unexpected love affair",
      "What A Devastating Turn Of Events was a huge emotional purge. Among the topics she discussed: Racism, school bullying, self-harm, alcoholism, alienation and toxic relationships.",
      "A recurring theme was men who take more from a relationship than they put back in.",
      "\"I'm quite a caregiver by nature, and that attracts boys who need a lot of help, or are very insecure,\" the singer reflects.",
      "\"I tend to be the person's 'mother', which isn't fun, because I have to be the strong one and there's no room for my emotions.\"",
      "But the days of heartbreak are over. Last year, the singer unexpectedly found herself in a new kind of relationship, one where her needs are as important as her partner's.",
      "It's written all over her new EP, Little House. \"Kissing me under the indigo / I begged for the morning sun not to rise / Oh, what a beautiful starry night,\" she sings, totally besotted, on the ballad Indigo.",
      "The lead single, Can We Talk About Isaac, even uses her new partner's real name. His photo is on the artwork.",
      "\"It's quite a brave move,\" she laughs, \"but I'm a hopeless romantic, and I don't want to lose being able to document my life in song.",
      "\"It's a risk that whoever wants to date me was going to have to take!\"",
      "The title track documents their chance meeting at a pub: \"With two pints in his hands, he came over and said, 'Nice to meet you'.\"",
      "\"He's very sweet, he's got a very simple friendship group, he likes going to the pub \u2013 but he does so much for me. It's the first experience I've ever had of being taken care of.",
      "\"He's changed my life, no matter what happens between us. We're both just really in love with each other and having a having a blast.\"",
      "At the moment, though, the couple have been forced apart. The Sabrina Carpenter tour lasts five weeks, after which Chinouriri sets off for her first headline tour of North America.",
      "It comes six months after the singer had to pull out of a US support slot with alt-pop star Remi Wolf.",
      "She says the dates would have left her penniless, even with financial support from her record label.",
      "\"As much as I would have loved that tour, I wouldn't have been able to pay my rent, which was very, very scary,\" she says.",
      "\"My fans were like, 'Let's help out. Let's do a GoFundMe for 10 grand', but it was far beyond 10 grand.",
      "\"It was like, who's going to pay for visas, where's your band going to sleep, what are people going to eat?",
      "\"It was a big wake up call. It made me reassess; do I need to be styled all the time? Do I need to travel this way all the time?",
      "\"So now, I'm able to go back now in full force and upgrade my venues and sell out almost the entire tour, which is mental.\"",
      "The cancellation taught her to slow down instead of grabbing every opportunity she's offered.",
      "It's a sign that Chinouriri is finally shedding the self-doubt that clouded her early career.",
      "The success of the Sabrina Carpenter tour is a prime example.",
      "\"There's always a risk as an opener, that people might be completely uninterested, but this has been the complete opposite,\" she says.",
      "\"Having the entire arena sing songs with you is such a blessed feeling to have.\"",
      "It won't be long before she's selling out those arenas on her own."

    "summary": "Grace Davidson gave birth to a baby girl two years after her sister's womb was transplanted into her body.",
    "story": [
      "A \"miracle\" baby girl has become the first child in the UK to be born to a mother using a donated womb.",
      "The baby's mum, Grace Davidson, 36, was born without a functioning uterus, and received her sister's womb in 2023 \u2013 in what was then the UK's only successful womb transplant.",
      "Two years after that pioneering operation, Grace gave birth to her first child in February. She and her husband, Angus, 37, have named their daughter Amy after Grace's sister, who donated her womb.",
      "Holding baby Amy - who weighed just over two kilos (four and a half pounds) - for the first time was \"incredible\" and \"surreal\", new mum Grace says.",
      "\"It was quite overwhelming because we'd never really let ourselves imagine what it would be like for her to be here,\" she says. \"It was really wonderful.\"",
      "Grace and Angus, who live in north London but are originally from Scotland, hope to have a second child using the transplanted womb.",
      "The couple initially wished to remain anonymous, but following the safe arrival of baby Amy are now speaking to the BBC about their \"little miracle\".",
      "The surgical team told the BBC they have carried out three further womb transplants using deceased donors since Grace's transplant. They aim to carry out a total of 15 as part of a clinical trial.",
      "Grace was born with a rare condition, Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, where the womb is missing or underdeveloped, but with functioning ovaries. When the BBC first spoke to her in 2018, she was hoping her mother could donate her uterus to allow her to have children - but it proved to be unsuitable.",
      "The BBC met Grace and husband Angus again in 2019 when one of Grace's two sisters, Amy Purdie, was being assessed to find out if she could donate her womb to Grace. Amy and her husband already had two children and did not want any more.",
      "Prior to surgery both sisters had counselling. Grace and Angus also had fertility treatment and still have several embryos in storage. Grace says she was given the option of surrogacy or adoption, but carrying her own baby felt \"really important\".",
      "\"I have always had a mothering instinct,\" she says, \"but for years I had been suppressing it because it was too painful to go there.\"",
      "Womb transplants: how do they work?",
      "The first baby born as a result of a womb transplant was in Sweden in 2014. Since then around 135 such transplants have been carried out in more than a dozen countries, including the US, China, France, Germany, India and Turkey. Around 65 babies have been born.",
      "Originally scheduled to take place in late 2019, the sisters' transplant operation fell through and then looked in doubt for several years during the Covid pandemic.",
      "When it eventually took place, in February 2023, it took a team of more than 30 medics around 17 hours to remove Amy's womb and transplant it to Grace.",
      "Isabel Quiroga, the surgeon who led the transplant team at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, says although the procedure carried risks for both sisters, it was \"life-enhancing and life-creating - and you can't have better than that.\"",
      "Amy says she did not feel the sense of loss some women experience after a hysterectomy, because of the \"dramatic\" and immediate benefits to her sister. Grace had her first ever period within two weeks of the transplant and became pregnant on the first attempt at IVF.",
      "It was \"incredible\" to feel her baby's first kick, she says, adding the entire pregnancy had been \"really special\".",
      "Baby Amy was born by Caesarean section at Queen Charlotte's hospital in west London on 27 February.",
      "\"It was an incredible moment, full of joy,\" says surgeon Isabel Quiroga.",
      "Grace and Angus say they hope to have a second child - as soon as the medical team say the time is right.",
      "The donated womb will be removed after the birth of a second child. This will allow Grace to stop taking the daily immunosuppressants she is currently on to ensure her body does not reject her sister's womb. Taking these drugs can increase the risks of developing some cancers, especially if taken over many years - but surgeon Isabel Quiroga says these risks should return to baseline once the womb is removed.",
      "Prof Richard Smith, a gynaecological surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare, who led the organ retrieval team, has been researching womb transplantation for more than two decades.",
      "He says his team is thrilled about the birth of baby Amy.",
      "\"I'm not often short of words but when the baby came out I was speechless - there were a lot of tears in the theatre that day.",
      "\"The whole thing is astonishing and incredibly moving,\" Prof Smith adds.",
      "He says Amy's birth will give hope to many of the 15,000 women in the UK of childbearing age who do not have a functioning uterus, of whom around 5,000 were born without a womb.",
      "Mr Smith heads a charity called Womb Transplant UK, which paid the NHS costs for Grace's transplant operation. All the medical staff gave their time for free.",
      "He told the BBC around 10 women have embryos in storage or are undergoing fertility treatment, a requirement for being considered for womb transplantation. Each transplant costs around \u00a330,000, he says, and the charity has sufficient funds to do two more.",
      "The surgical team has permission to perform 15 womb transplants as part of a clinical trial, five with living and 10 with deceased donors. No details have been made public about the three women who have so far received wombs from deceased donor organs. NHS Blood and Transplant told the BBC extra consent is sought from families for such rare donations.",
      "Baby Amy's father, Angus, says he and Grace will never be able to thank his wife's sister enough for enabling them to become parents. It was an \"absolute no brainer\" that they would name Amy after her aunt, Angus says.",
      "The baby's middle name is Isabel, after the surgeon who led the womb transplantation team.",
      "For Grace, having baby Amy has brought her even closer to her sister.",
      "\"It was incredibly difficult to let her do that for me,\" she says, \"it's a huge act of sisterly love.\"",

    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "Ministers, health staff and the public gathered in London last week for a summit to discuss the 10-year NHS plan in England. It was the final roadshow in a nationwide tour to help set out the strategy the government says will rescue the \"broken\" NHS, which has a waiting list of nearly 7.5 million patients and public satisfaction of just 21% - a record low.",
      "Not for the first time, moving healthcare away from hospitals and into the community is being touted as a way of treating people better and for less. Research suggests that every \u00a3100 spent on community care would otherwise cost \u00a3131 for hospital care.",
      "This helps explain why Health Secretary Wes Streeting has promised to turn the NHS into a neighbourhood health service.",
      "Washwood Heath, a community health clinic that was set up in a deprived part of east Birmingham two years ago when the Conservative government was in power, is a living, working example of what this could look like. Here, hospital doctors, GPs, nurses, occupational therapists, council social care teams, mental health professionals and charity staff work under one roof.",
      "The three-storey building combines an urgent treatment centre offering some of the services usually provided by hospitals, as well as a diagnostic service (for MRI scans, X rays and ultrasounds), alongside mental health care and wider social support.",
      "In practice, this allows for addressing social problems such as housing issues, alongside treating physical health conditions, plus arranging support for daily tasks such as washing and dressing.",
      "The target is the most frequent users of health services - and the aim is to keep them well and out of hospital.",
      "\"We want to work with the 10% of the population that is responsible for 70 to 80% of its use,\" explains Richard Kirby, head of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, one of the key partners at Washwood Heath. \"The NHS cannot meet their needs on its own \u2013 it requires partnership working.\"",
      "Streeting himself is on board. Speaking to the BBC this week, he said that Washwood was a \"pioneering service\" and he is firm that the model could \"be the future of the NHS\".",
      "However not everyone is convinced. And while few argue against the principle of more care within the community, there are wider questions around just how feasible it is on a bigger scale.",
      "A model system to unblock beds?",
      "In the middle of the clinic, staff gather around five touchscreens, each containing up-to-date information about patients from east Birmingham who are in hospital or making calls to the ambulance service. Their goal is to get these patients discharged from hospital as swiftly as they can - and keep them out.",
      "One way of doing this is by arranging remote monitoring from the 'virtual wards team' (which allows doctors to keep an eye on patients who would otherwise have to stay on the wards), as well as ordering equipment such as mobility aids and medicine dispensers to be delivered to their homes.",
      "The team is also automatically alerted if a patient registered at the clinic calls for an ambulance or is admitted to hospital. There is a live link to the local Heartlands Hospital, where the clinic's own team of therapists and paramedics see patients face-to-face on the wards and liaise with hospital staff to try to get them home.",
      "\"Our job is to identify which patients will benefit from our help,\" says nurse Dani Fullerton. \"It's so different from anything I have done before.\"",
      "Tackling loneliness to save money",
      "One issue the neighbourhood teams are homing in on is loneliness - they have identified this as a way to keep down hospital numbers.",
      "Government commissioned research published in 2020 suggests the cost of severe loneliness to be more than \u00a39,500 for each person in that category, due to the combined impact on wellbeing, health, and work productivity.",
      "So, at the centre, local neighbourhood teams plan intense support for the most vulnerable residents, knitting together not just what the NHS and council provide, but what charities can offer too.",
      "\"We have patients going to GPs and A&E basically because they are lonely,\" says Christine Francis, who is employed as a 'social prescriber'. Her job is to help find new activities and groups for the lonely and then accompany them until they are settled.",
      "\"The NHS cannot solve [loneliness]. But I can link patients in with befriending services or, if they can get out and about, local groups such as knitting groups or organised walks.\"",
      "Ms Francis also works with groups who can help with house cleaning and tackle other issues associated with poor mental health, such as hoarding.",
      "At present some doubt there is enough robust evidence from the research to show the effectiveness of social prescribing. The neighbourhood team is adamant their approach is making a difference, however, based on what they've seen first-hand.",
      "Hamzisah Aslam, an occupational therapist at Birmingham Council, recalls visiting one patient with health and alcohol problems, whose home was littered with cardboard boxes and rubbish. The visit, also attended by a GP, mental health professional and social prescriber, lasted more than an hour.",
      "\"Afterwards, we had a five-minute debrief and drew up a plan and it was actioned the next day - you would never be able to do that if we were all working individually.\"",
      "Some GPs I spoke to have also observed a positive impact. Dr Subeena Suleman says the neighbourhood team worked with two patients from her practice who were frequent visitors because of their range of health and social issues. An estimated 100 appointments at the GP surgery were freed up over six months.",
      "\"It meant we had more time for other patients,\" says Dr Suleman. \"We even started offering longer appointments of up to 30 minutes for those that need it.\"",
      "In the first 12 months since Washwood Heath began operating, GP visits among the local population supported by the centre fell by 31%, A&E attendances by 20% and admissions to hospital by 21%.",
      "However, there is not yet robust evidence to quantify how much more efficient the new model would be if expanded across the city.",
      "The knock-on effect for hospitals",
      "The most recent addition to the centre is an emergency service for patients with respiratory illness that opened in December to address the fact that around 40% of admissions to the nearby Heartlands Hospital related to lung and breathing conditions.",
      "So far the service, which is staffed by UHB respiratory specialist nurses and doctors, has taken in 670 patients. Christopher Thomas is one of them. He used to be a builder and worked with asbestos. Now 77, he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which he believes has links to his job.",
      "Recently, he went to hospital after coughing up blood, and was told he had pneumonia - but rather than being kept in hospital, he was discharged into the care of Washwood clinic's respiratory service.",
      "This, he says, worked far better for him. \"I was able to stay at home to rest and take my medications and I can just ring the team at Washwood if I have any concerns.\"",
      "Respiratory medicine consultant Dr Rifat Rashid is also positive. \"Here we can see and test patients quickly \u2013 there are not the delays we have in hospital waiting for results.\"",
      "But there are broader benefits for the hospital too in her view - she says GPs are starting to refer their patients directly to Washwood Heath and ambulances are also now bringing patients to the centre rather than the hospital.",
      "Despite the benefits of fewer admissions, ultimately hospitals are no less full - while fewer people in the Washwood area are being admitted, patients from elsewhere have filled the beds.",
      "The model is being expanded across the city - the aim is to have a network of six community hubs and 25 to 30 integrated neighbourhood teams, covering Birmingham's population of 1.4 million people.",
      "Not every centre will be identical. For example, in the north of the city, there might be a focus on helping with frailty to support the older, more affluent population demographic.",
      "There are of course costs - these are estimated at less than \u00a3100,000 as the six hubs as the centres will use existing buildings and redeployed staff.",
      "Richard Kirby thinks the model could easily be replicated nationwide. \"We believe this is the right model,\" he insists.",
      "But there is a catch. As he puts it, \"It only works when the whole system buys into it.\"",
      "Tight budgets and a 'cynical' sector",
      "Part of the problem with making the whole system buy into it is money. Ruth Rankine, an NHS Confederation primary care director, believes that during times, such as now, when money is tight, collaboration generally becomes harder.",
      "\"People are too focused on their budgets and making sure it goes on where they immediately need it,\" she says.",
      "But clinics like Washwood Heath require collaboration and pooling resources.",
      "The other issue, she argues, is that the hospital sector has, in places, \"been a bit cynical\". \"The problem is that it takes time to get results \u2013 you need to invest in front and then it can be years before it has an impact.\"",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "'It's unforgivable': The problem at the heart of the NHS's maternity care failures",
      "Another concern is around finding suitable premises. In Birmingham, officials I spoke to acknowledged they were lucky to have a network of large health centres (as they were beneficiaries of a short-lived finance programme launched in the 2000s to improve community NHS buildings) but many other places around the country do not.",
      "This is a concern for Dr Richard Vautrey, a GP from Leeds who has been involved in national NHS politics since the early 2000s in his role as a British Medical Association negotiator and, more recently, as president of the Royal College of GPs.",
      "\"There just isn't enough of the right premises,\" he argues. \"In many places, GPs and community colleagues cannot work side-by-side because the buildings are too outdated and cramped.",
      "\"We've had all the talk over 40 new hospitals, but where are the 1,000 new neighbourhood clinics?\"",
      "Political pressure and short-term thinking",
      "There are deeper rooted political pressures too that make a nationwide rollout of centres like those in Birmingham a challenge.",
      "Even though the work in east Birmingham ticks a lot of the boxes set out by independent peer and NHS surgeon Lord Darzi in his report for the government last autumn, after being commissioned by Wes Streeting, this is not the first time such calls have been made. Lord Darzi himself set out similar goals in a report for the Blair government in 2007.",
      "Ms Rankine has had a front-row view of this. She worked for the Department of Health and NHS executive for more than a decade from the mid-1990s. \"We've been talking about this for 20, 30 years, but failed to achieve it on any sort of scale.\"",
      "And today, there are a series of contradictory priorities facing the NHS. Often it is those considered the most pressing that are addressed first.",
      "Hugh Alderwick, Director of Policy at the Health Foundation think-tank, who advised Labour in opposition, points out that the big focus is on hitting the 18-week hospital waiting time targets.",
      "\"It's pulling in the opposite direction of this ambition to move care out into the community,\" he observes.",
      "So can the government really reshape the NHS into a neighbourhood health service? Dr Vautrey, for one is optimistic.",
      "\"It can,\" he says. \"But it will take determination, effort \u2013 and money.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Apr 2025 05:10:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Jonathan Peter Brooks tried to manipulate the forensic process, prison staff and the courts, a judge says.",
    "story": [
      "More than four years after he stabbed his colleague, plastic surgeon Jonathan Peter Brooks has been found guilty of attempted murder.",
      "On Monday, the 61-year-old was convicted over the 14 January 2021 attack on Graeme Perks in Halam, Nottinghamshire, which a court in Loughborough heard could easily have been fatal.",
      "It can now be reported that Brooks was never seen by the jury, repeatedly refusing to engage with the trial.",
      "In a legal saga stretching from his arrest, during a coronavirus lockdown, to his conviction, a judge outlined the \"extraordinary\" case, labelling Brooks a \"highly intelligent\" man who used hunger strikes and sacking his lawyers as tactics to try to manipulate the system to avoid justice.",
      "Why did the trial take so long?",
      "Brooks was arrested on the day of the attack, and appeared in court four days later.",
      "He dressed in camouflage gear and went to Mr Perks's home equipped with petrol, matches, a lighter, knife and a crowbar, but insisted all the items had been \"stored in his garage and had been acquired for innocent purposes\".",
      "His trial was told he smashed conservatory doors to spread petrol around the ground floor of Mr Perks's house, and then stabbed him in the abdomen.",
      "Brooks was facing an online NHS disciplinary hearing, which started on 11 January 2021.",
      "The court heard the burns specialist \"hated\" Mr Perks, who was a witness against him in those disciplinary proceedings.",
      "A trial originally began in July 2022, but the jury was discharged the following month after Brooks was admitted to hospital, suffering osteoradionecrosis - a medical complication of radiotherapy, which required surgery.",
      "This set in train a long chain of legal delays, with numerous occasions when hearings were listed but Brooks refused to turn up, forcing his case to be relisted and impacting on other court hearings - as barristers and judges had to move around their workloads.",
      "The trial has been listed on \"no fewer than nine occasions\", and the latest got under way despite Brooks sacking his then legal team with one day to go - the fifth time Brooks had dismissed one or more of his lawyers.",
      "Brooks had also embarked on a hunger strike 11 days before his trial was scheduled to start.",
      "Judge Edward Pepperall said this was not new.",
      "\"I identified no fewer than eight occasions since his arrest in 2021 when Dr Brooks had used hunger strikes or the threat of some other self-harm to achieve some advantage whether within the prison estate or in hospital,\" he said.",
      "Why was Brooks not co-operating?",
      "Brooks claimed he was not medically fit to stand trial, that accommodations were not being made in order for him to attend trial, and that the trial was unfair.",
      "By the time another trial was due to take place, he was left in the unusual position of acting as his own legal counsel.",
      "The dangers of defendants representing themselves without legal support are well-documented, and with Brooks also indicating a refusal to engage - while repeatedly claiming he would rather die than be wrongfully convicted - the court was faced with trying to arrange a trial in which an unrepresented defendant was not likely to turn up.",
      "Combined with Brooks's hunger strike, it presented the possibility that even if he was fit at the start of the trial, his condition could deteriorate during the weeks it was scheduled to run, and could mean a second trial would not reach a conclusion.",
      "Were allowances made for Brooks?",
      "In short, yes.",
      "The hunger strike meant the defendant had become increasingly weak, which led to the case being moved to Loughborough due to the defendant's new requirement for a wheelchair, something the original court could not accommodate.",
      "On 3 March this year, he did not appear for the slated start date, and the prosecution asked to continue the trial in the defendant's absence.",
      "Judge Pepperall came to a decision about whether it was fair for the trial to go ahead, with his ruling made on 6 March, a copy of which was sent to the defendant.",
      "In the 30-page document, he addressed the concerns prompted by Brooks going on hunger strike, and set out how he would ensure any trial would be fair.",
      "\"It is not too late for [Brooks] to change course and let the court know that he wishes to attend his trial... that he has already stopped his hunger strike, and that he is accepting all reasonable treatment so that he can in time recover sufficient health to put his case to the jury,\" he said.",
      "What happened during the trial?",
      "Tracy Ayling KC led the prosecution case against Brooks, who remained absent while also acting as his own legal representation.",
      "The situation was explained by Judge Pepperall to the jury, when he warned them not to take the defendant's absence as any sign of guilt.",
      "Evidence was then heard in the usual way, but on 11 March the judge said he had received a letter from Brooks, who was being held at HMP Bedford, in which he further objected to the trial continuing without him.",
      "A three-page response gave short shrift to Brooks's latest protests.",
      "\"Dr Brooks cannot refuse to engage with both the court and his lawyers, and then complain that he was not properly kept updated as to his case,\" he said.",
      "The trial continued, and on 24 March Stephen Leslie KC was brought in to cross-examine Mr Perks - a measure made to provide balance to the prosecution case.",
      "On 25 March, a new five-page ruling was made to allow Brooks to appear via video-link from prison should he so wish, rather than go in person.",
      "In the ruling, the judge spoke of Brooks's \"sporadic\" engagement.",
      "\"On no fewer than 13 occasions, he has declined to attend court, sometimes even when only required to appear by prison link, without good reason,\" he said.",
      "Addressing the behaviour of the defendant, the judge added: \"Dr Brooks has deliberately made himself ill in order to seek to manipulate the court process and prevent his trial from proceeding. Such conduct was the voluntary decision of a well-informed medical man with capacity.\"",
      "Following the ruling, the defendant continued to complain about his condition and the trial, and after assessment from doctors confirmed he was fit to attend but remained absent through his own choice, the prosecution case concluded.",
      "During a debate on Brooks's fitness during the trial, Ms Ayling said her prosecution team \"has anticipated\" such requests being made by the defendant.",
      "\"Yet again he's attempting to put off the trial,\" she said. \"He is deliberately manipulating the court and voluntarily absenting himself.\"",
      "Brooks did not turn up for his own defence, which was scheduled for 27 March, but on 1 April he finally made an appearance, addressing the trial in the absence of the jury via video-link from HMP Norwich, where he had recently been transferred.",
      "He requested a four-week adjournment so he could prepare his case, but he refused the offer of a 48-hour extension, ending up in tears as he said he felt he could not accept the judge's offers to accommodate a late speech from him.",
      "By the time the jury was brought in that day, Brooks had gone back to his cell, and so he was once again absent when the judge summed up the evidence.",
      "What can the courts do with defendants who will not engage?",
      "The criminal justice system stresses the importance of not only there being a fair trial, but there being seen to be a fair trial, so even though Brooks refused to co-operate, measures were taken to ensure due process was followed.",
      "For Brooks, a lawyer was brought in to challenge witness evidence, and while legal rulings were not discussed in front of the jury in order to avoid prejudicing their views, they were discussed before the press, so the legal discussions could be reported after trial.",
      "Ultimately, courts have to give the opportunity for defendants to appear, and if they refuse they must ensure the process is still fair, even if that leads to long delays.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service said the trial \"was extremely unusual\".",
      "\"The lack of participation meant that straightforward and non-controversial evidence could not be agreed as would usually happen when a defendant is present and represented,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "\"This meant that some witnesses had to give evidence to the jury and have statements read out in full that would otherwise have been treated as agreed facts.\"",
      "A number of recent sentencings - including Kyle Clifford and Axel Rudakubana - saw defendants refuse to appear, and as a result the prime minister has promised to give judges the power to make criminals appear in the dock.",
      "Judge Pepperall said that he would write to the governor of HMP Norwich, where Brooks is currently held, to request that he attend in person for his sentencing hearing, which is due to be held on 3 June.",

    "summary": "Men are more likely to die prematurely than women - and worse at seeking care when they need it.",
    "story": [
      "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health \u2013 and what can be done about it?",
      "Andrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms.",
      "\"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\"",
      "The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health \u2013 a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.",
      "Early deaths",
      "In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.",
      "These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.",
      "Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.",
      "He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\"",
      "He says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\"",
      "He says there are biological reasons \u2013 the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.",
      "Prof White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally \u2013 many go years without seeing a health professional.",
      "\"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\"",
      "Stark differences",
      "Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.",
      "\"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\"",
      "But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest \u2013 a larger gap than is seen for women \u2013 and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.",
      "\"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\"",
      "NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.",
      "\"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\"",
      "Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates.",
      "But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work.",
      "He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men.",
      "Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs.",
      "\"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them \u2013 they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White.",
      "Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes.",
      "Wake-up call",
      "But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\"",
      "He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players.",
      "Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities.",
      "\"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\"",
      "Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes.",
      "The Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects.",
      "Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations \u2013 something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 \u2013 that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government.",
      "But he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider.",
      "\"Look at your waist size \u2013 if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people.",
      "\"Take every opportunity to get a health check or screened. And, if you notice changes to body or the way you are managing problems, seek help.\"",

    "summary": "Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr is reportedly headed to the state, which has recorded 480 cases.",
    "story": [
      "A second child has died from measles as an outbreak of the highly contagious virus continues to grow in western Texas.",
      "The school-aged child was not vaccinated, had no underlying health conditions and was in hospital suffering complications from measles, Aaron Davis, the vice-president of UMC Health System, told the BBC.",
      "US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has faced a backlash over his handling of the outbreak, visited Texas on Sunday in the wake of the death, which is the third overall in recent weeks.",
      "The southern US state has reported more than 480 cases of measles so far this year as of Friday, a jump from 420 earlier in the week. The outbreak has extended to neighbouring states.",
      "Across the whole of the US, more than 600 cases of measles have been recorded so far this year, more than double the 285 cases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded last year.",
      "In 2019, there were a total of 1,274 measles cases recorded across the US, but prior to that there had not been a larger outbreak than this year's since the early 1990s, according to the CDC.",
      "Many of this year's cases - nearly all in unvaccinated people - are related to the outbreak that began in western Texas.",
      "\"This unfortunate event underscores the importance of vaccination,\" Mr Davis said in a statement. \"Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to serious complications, particularly for those who are unvaccinated.\"",
      "The child - an eight-year-old girl - died early on Thursday.",
      "The BBC contacted the state health department and the US Department of Health and Human Services for comment. Neither agency listed the death in their case counts on Friday.",
      "In a statement posted on social media, Kennedy confirmed the girl's death.",
      "\"My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,\" he said in the statement.",
      "He also said he was engaging with officials there to \"support Texas health officials and to learn how our HHS agencies can better partner with them to control the measles outbreak\". Kennedy said he was deploying a team - as he did in March - to help distribute vaccines, medications and other supplies, among other support services.",
      "\"The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,\" Kennedy wrote, referring to the measles, mumps and rubella jab.",
      "In February, an unvaccinated six-year-old girl in the local Mennonite community was the first child to die of measles in the US in a decade. In March, an unvaccinated man died in New Mexico after contracting the virus, though his cause of death is still under investigation.",
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday told reporters aboard Air Force One that he believes the outbreak is largely contained.",
      "\"It's so far a fairly small number of people, relative to what we're talking about,\" he said. \"It's something that people have known about for many years. This is not something new.\"",
      "\"We'll see what happens. If it progresses, we'll have to take action. Very strong action,\" he said in response to a question from the BBC.",
      "The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.",
      "The US declared measles eliminated from the country in 2000. But outbreaks have grown since then with a rise in anti-vaccine sentiment.",
      "Two shots of the immunisation - proven safe - are 97% effective at preventing the virus and reduce severe infections. To achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, experts say.",
      "The recent outbreak originated in a religious community that strongly rejects vaccines. Local health officials in western Texas have told the BBC they have seen limited progress in attempts to improve vaccination rates.",
      "Kennedy's early response to the worsening outbreaks was muted, drawing criticism from health experts.",
      "Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic, initially described the situation as \"not unusual\".",

      "Susan's first reaction was that she may have been secretly adopted. Both her parents had died some years before, so she plucked up the courage and asked her older brother.",
      "He was sure the whole thing was a scam. His sister had always been part of his life, and he was \"absolutely certain\" that one of his first memories was of his mother being pregnant.",
      "Susan though still had her suspicions. She was slightly taller than her brother and, with her striking blonde hair, had never looked like the rest of family.",
      "Her eldest daughter did some digging and found a copy of all the births registered in the local area on the day her mother was born.",
      "The next baby girl on the list, registered at the same NHS hospital, had the exact same surname as the man who had contacted her through the genealogy website.",
      "It couldn't be a coincidence. The only possible explanation was a mistake or mix-up in that maternity ward more than seven decades ago.",
      "Until recently cases like this were unheard of in the UK, although there have been a handful of examples in other countries.",
      "The standard practice in the NHS today is to place two bands around babies' ankles immediately after birth and keep mother and child together through their hospital stay.",
      "In the 1950s maternity care was very different. Babies were often separated, placed in large nursery rooms and cared for by midwives.",
      "\"The whole system was far less sophisticated back then,\" says Jason Tang, from the London law firm Russell Cooke, which is representing Susan.",
      "\"It may be that staff didn't attach a card or tag immediately, or that it simply fell off and was put back on the wrong baby or on the wrong crib.\"",
      "From the late 1940s the UK also saw a post-war baby boom putting more pressure on busy maternity services in the newly formed NHS.",

      "\"But I really don't think that for me, anything has changed about them, they are still mum and dad,\" she says.",
      "On the other hand, her relationship with the man she has always known as her older brother has, she thinks, been strengthened by what she's gone through.",
      "\"It's actually brought us closer together. Now we meet up more often and I get cards sent to 'my dear sister',\" she says.",

      "She has also seen photographs of the other woman who she was swapped with at birth, and her sons.",

      "April Hubbard sits on the theatre stage where she plans to die later this year.",
      "She is not terminally ill, but the 39-year-old performance and burlesque artist has been approved for assisted dying under Canada's increasingly liberal laws.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "She is speaking to BBC News from the Bus Stop Theatre, an intimate auditorium with a little under 100 seats, in the eastern city of Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "Illuminated by a single spotlight on a stage she has performed on many times before, she tells me she plans to die here \"within months\" of her imminent 40th birthday. She'll be joined by a small group of her family and friends.",
      "April plans to be in a \"big comfy bed\" for what she calls a \"celebratory\" moment when a medical professional will inject a lethal dose into her bloodstream.",
      "\"I want to be surrounded by the people I love and just have everybody hold me in a giant cuddle puddle and get to take my last breath, surrounded by love and support,\" she says.",
      "April was born with spina bifida and was later diagnosed with tumours at the base of her spine which she says have left her in constant, debilitating pain.",
      "She's been taking strong opioid painkillers for more than 20 years and applied for Medical Assistance in Dying (Maid) in March 2023. While she could yet live for decades with her condition, she qualified to end her life early seven months after applying. For those who are terminally ill it is possible to get approval within 24 hours.",
      "\"My suffering and pain are increasing and I don't have the quality of life anymore that makes me happy and fulfilled,\" April says. Every time she moves or breathes, she says it feels like the tissues from the base of her spine \"are being pulled like a rubber band that stretches too far\", and that her lower limbs leave her in agony.",
      "We meet April as, almost 3,000 miles away, MPs are scrutinising proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. They voted in principle in support of those plans in November 2024, but months of detailed scrutiny have followed - and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could possibly become law.",
      "This week, the BBC witnessed a man's death in California, where assisted dying laws are far more similar to those being considered in Westminster.",
      "Critics say Canada is an example of the \"slippery slope\", meaning that once you pass an assisted dying law it will inevitably widen its scope and have fewer safeguards.",
      "Canada now has one of the most liberal systems of assisted dying in the world, similar to that operating in the Netherlands and Belgium. It introduced Maid in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with a serious and incurable physical illness, which causes intolerable suffering. In 2021, the need to be terminally ill was removed, and in two years' time, the Canadian government plans to open Maid to adults solely with a mental illness and no physical ailment.",
      "Opponents of Maid tell us that death is coming to be seen as a standard treatment option for those with disabilities and complex medical problems.",
      "\"It is easier in Canada to get medical assistance in dying than it is to get government support to live,\" says Andrew Gurza, a disability awareness consultant and friend of April's.",
      "Andrew, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, says he respects April's decision, but tells us: \"If my disability declines and my care needs got higher, I'd still want to be here. To know there's a law that's saying you could easily end your life - it's just really scary.\"",
      "Before she was approved for Maid, April was assessed by two independent physicians who were required to inform her of ways to alleviate her suffering and offer alternative treatments.",
      "\"The safeguards are there,\" she says, when we press her about disabled people who feel threatened by assisted dying, or whether Maid is being used as a shortcut to better quality care. \"If it's not right for you and you're not leading the charge and choosing Maid, you're not going to be able to access it unless it's for the right reasons,\" she adds.",
      "There were 15,343 Maid deaths in 2023, representing around one in 20 of all deaths in Canada - a proportion that has increased dramatically since 2016 and is one of the highest in the world. The average age of recipients was 77.",
      "In all but a handful of cases, the lethal dose was delivered by a doctor or nurse, which is also known as voluntary euthanasia. One doctor we spoke to, Eric Thomas, said he had helped 577 patients to die.",
      "Dr Konia Trouton, president of the Canadian Association of Maid Assessors and Providers, has also helped hundreds of patients to die since the law was introduced.",
      "The procedure is the same each time - she arrives at the home of the person who has been given approval for Maid and asks if they wish to go ahead with it that day. She says the patients always direct the process and then give her the \"heads up and ready to go\".",
      "\"That gives me an honour and a duty and a privilege to be able to help them in those last moments with their family around them, with those who love them around them and to know that they've made that decision thoughtfully, carefully and thoroughly,\" she adds.  If the answer is yes, she opens her medical bag.",
      "Demonstrating to the BBC what happens next, Dr Trouton briefly puts a tourniquet on my arm. She shows me where the needle would be inserted into a vein in the back of my hand to allow an intravenous infusion of lethal drugs.",
      "In her medical bag she also has a stethoscope. \"Strangely, these days I use it more to determine if someone has no heartbeat rather than if they do,\" she tells me.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "Some 96% of Maid provisions are under \"track one\" where death is \"reasonably foreseeable\". Dr Trouton says that means patients are on a \"trajectory toward death\", which might range from someone who has rapidly spreading cancer and only weeks to live or another with Alzheimer's \"who might have five to seven years\".",
      "The other 4% of Maid deaths come under \"track two\". These are adults, like April, who are not dying but have suffering which is intolerable to them from a \"grievous and irremediable medical condition\".",
      "That is in stark contrast to Labour MP Kim Leadbeater's bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, which says patients must be expected to die within six months. The Westminster bill would not allow doctors to give a lethal dose \u2013 rather patients would have to self-administer the drugs, usually by swallowing them.",
      "Death via intravenous infusion normally takes just a few minutes, as the lethal drugs go straight into the bloodstream, whereas swallowing the drugs means patients usually take around an hour or two to die, but can take considerably longer, although they are usually unconscious after a few minutes.",
      "Dr Trouton told me she regarded the Canadian system as quicker and more effective, as do other Maid providers. \"I'm concerned that if some people can't swallow because of their disease process, and if they're not able to take the entire quantity of medication because of breathing difficulties or swallowing difficulties, what will happen?\"",
      "'Canada has fallen off a cliff'",
      "But opponents argue it's being used as a cheaper alternative to providing adequate social or medical support.",
      "One of them is Dr Ramona Coelho, a GP in London, Ontario, whose practice serves many marginalised groups and those struggling to get medical and social support. She's part of a Maid Death Review Committee, alongside Dr Trouton, which examines cases in the province.",
      "Dr Coelho told me that Maid was \"out of control\". \"I wouldn't even call it a slippery slope,\" she says \"Canada has fallen off a cliff.\"",
      "\"When people have suicidal ideations, we used to meet them with counselling and care, and for people with terminal illness and other diseases we could mitigate that suffering and help them have a better life,\" she says. \"Yet now we are seeing that as an appropriate request to die and ending their lives very quickly.\"",
      "While at Dr Coelho's surgery I was introduced to Vicki Whelan, a retired nurse whose mum Sharon Scribner died in April 2023 of lung cancer, aged 81. Vicki told me that in her mum's final days in hospital she was repeatedly offered the option of Maid by medical staff, describing it as like a \"sales pitch\".",
      "The family, who are Catholic, discharged their mother so she could die at home, where Vicki says her mum had a \"beautiful, peaceful death\". \"It makes us think that we can't endure, and we can't suffer a little bit, and that somehow now they've decided that dying needs to be assisted, where we've been dying for years.",
      "\"All of a sudden now we're telling people that this is a better option. This is an easy way out and I think it's just robbing people of hope.\"",
      "'Not a way I want to live'",
      "So is Canada an example of the so-called slippery slope? It's certainly true that the eligibility criteria has broadened dramatically since the law was introduced nine years ago, so for critics the answer would be an emphatic yes and serve as a warning to Britain.",
      "Canada's assisted dying laws were driven by court rulings. Its Supreme Court instructed Parliament that a prohibition on assisted dying breached the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The extension of eligibility for those who were not terminally ill was in part a response to another court decision.",

    "story": [
      "It's 10am, and in a little over two hours, Wayne Hawkins will be dead.",
      "The sun is shining on the bungalow where the 80-year-old lives in San Diego, California with his wife of more than five decades, Stella.",
      "I knock on the door and meet his children - Emily, 48, and Ashley, 44 - who have spent the last two weeks at their father's side.",
      "Wayne sits in a reclining chair where he spends most of his days. Terminally ill, he is too weak to leave the house.",
      "He has invited BBC News to witness his death under California's assisted dying laws - if MPs in London vote to legalise the practice in England and Wales, it will allow some terminally ill people here to die in a similar way.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "Half an hour after arriving at Wayne's house, I watch him swallow three anti-nausea tablets, designed to minimise the risk of him vomiting the lethal medication he plans to take shortly.",
      "Are you sure this day is your last, I ask him? \"I'm all in,\" he replies. \"I was determined and decided weeks ago - I've had no trepidation since then.\"",
      "His family ask for one last photo, which I take, and you can see at the top of this page. As usual, Stella and Wayne are holding hands.",
      "Shortly after, Dr Donnie Moore arrives. He has got to know the family over the past few weeks, visiting them on several occasions alongside running his own end-of-life clinic. Under California law, he is what is known as the attending physician who must confirm, in addition to a second doctor, that Wayne is eligible for aid in dying.",
      "Dr Moore's role is part physician, part counsellor in this situation, one he has been in for 150 assisted deaths before.",
      "On a top shelf in Wayne's bedroom sits a brown glass bottle containing a fine white powder - a mixture of five drugs, sedatives and painkillers, delivered to the house four weeks before. The dosage of drugs inside is hundreds of times higher than those used in regular healthcare and is \"guaranteed\" to be fatal, Dr Moore explains. Unlike California, the proposed law at Westminster would require a doctor to bring any such medication with them.",
      "When Wayne signals he is ready, the doctor mixes the meds with cherry and pineapple juice to soften the bitter taste - and he hands this pink liquid to Wayne.",
      "No one, not even the doctor, knows how long it will take him to die after taking the lethal drugs. Dr Moore explains to me that, in his experience, death usually occurs between 30 minutes and two hours of ingestion, but on one occasion it took 17 hours.",
      "This is the story of how and why Wayne chose to die. And why others have decided not to follow the same course.",
      "We first met the couple a few weeks earlier, when Wayne explained why he was going ahead with the decision to have an assisted death - a controversial measure in other parts of the world.",
      "\"Some days the pain is almost more than I can handle,\" he said. \"I just don't see any merit to dying slow and painfully, hooked up with stuff - intubation, feeding tubes,\" he told me. \"I want none of it.\"",
      "Wayne said he had watched two relatives die \"miserable\", \"heinous\" deaths from heart failure.",
      "\"I hate hospitals, they are miserable. I will die in the street first.\"",
      "Wayne met Stella in 1969; the couple married four years later. He told us it was something of an arranged marriage, as his mother kept inviting Stella for dinner until eventually the penny dropped that he should take her out.",
      "They lived for many years in Arcata, northern California, surrounded by sweeping forests of redwood trees, where Wayne worked as a landscape architect, while Stella was a primary school teacher. They spent their holidays hiking and camping with their children.",
      "Now Wayne is terminally ill with heart failure, which has already brought him close to death. He has myriad other health issues including prostate cancer, liver failure and sepsis which brings him serious spinal pain.",
      "He is expected to live less than six months, qualifying him for an assisted death in California. His request to die has been approved by two doctors and the lethal medication is self-administered.",
      "It was during our first meeting that he asked the BBC to return to observe his final day, saying he wanted terminally ill adults in the UK to have the same right to an assisted death as him.",
      "\"Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one,\" he said. \"People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less.\"",
      "Stella, 78, supports his decision. \"I've known him for over 50 years. He's a very independent man. He's always known what he wants to do and he's always fixed things. That's how he's operating now. If this is his choice, I definitely agree, and I've seen him really suffer with the illness he's got. I don't want that for him.\"",
      "Wayne would also qualify under the proposed new assisted dying law in England and Wales. The measures return to the House of Commons later this month, when all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on changes to the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill.",
      "The proposed legislation, tabled by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says that anyone who wants to end their life must have the mental capacity to make the choice, that they must be expected to die within six months, and must make two separate declarations - witnessed and signed - about their wish to die. They must satisfy two independent doctors that they are eligible.",
      "MPs in Westminster voted in favour of assisted dying in principle last November but remain bitterly divided on the issue. If they ultimately decide to approve the bill, it could become law within the next year and come into practice within the next four years.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "There are also divisions here in California, where assisted dying was introduced in 2016. Michelle and Mike Carter, both 72 and married for 43 years, are each being treated for cancer - Mike has prostate cancer that has spread to his lymph nodes, and Michelle's advanced terminal ovarian cancer has spread throughout much of her body.",
      "\"I held my mother's hand when she passed; I held my father's hand when he passed,\" Michelle told me. \"I believe there's freedom of choice however for me, I choose palliative care\u2026 I have God and I have good medicine.\"",
      "Michelle's physician, palliative care specialist Dr Vincent Nguyen, argued that assisted dying laws in the US state lead to \"silent coercion\" whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die. \"Instead of ending people's lives, let's put programmes together to care for people,\" he said. \"Let them know that they're loved, they're wanted and they're worthy.\"",
      "He said the law meant that doctors have gone from being seen as healers to killers, while the message from the healthcare system was that \"you are better off dead, because you're expensive and your death is cheaper for us\".",
      "Some disability campaigners say assisted dying makes them feel unsafe. Ingrid Tischer, who has muscular dystrophy and chronic respiratory failure, told me: \"The message that it sends to people with disabilities in California is that you deserve suicide assistance rather than suicide prevention when you voice a desire to end your life.",
      "\"What does that say about who we are as a culture?\"",
      "Critics often say that once assisted dying is legalised, over time the safeguards around such laws get eroded as part of a \"slippery slope\" towards more relaxed criteria. In California, there was initially a mandatory 15-day cooling off period between patients making a first and second request for aid in dying. That has been reduced to 48 hours because many patients were dying during the waiting period. It's thought the approval process envisaged in Westminster would take around a month.",
      "'Goodbye,' Wayne tells his family",
      "Outside Wayne's house on the morning of his death, a solitary bird begins its loud and elaborate song. \"There's that mockingbird out there,\" Wayne tells Stella, as smiles flicker across their faces.",
      "Wayne hates the bird because it keeps him awake at night, Stella jokes, hand in hand with him to one side of his chair. Emily and Ashley are next to Stella.",
      "Dr Moore, seated on Wayne's other side, hands him the pink liquid which he swallows without hesitation. \"Goodnight,\" he says to his family - a typical touch of humour from a man who told us he was determined to die on his terms. It's 11.47am.",
      "After two minutes, Wayne says he is getting sleepy. Dr Moore asks him to imagine he is walking in a vast sea of flowers with a soft breeze on his skin, which seems appropriate for a patient who has spent much of his life among nature.",
      "After three minutes Wayne enters a deep sleep from which he will never wake. On a few occasions he lifts his head to take a deep breath without opening his eyes, at one point beginning to snore softly.",
      "Dr Moore tells the family this is \"the deepest sleep imaginable\" and reassures Emily there is no chance her dad will wake up and ask, \"did it work?\"",
      "\"Oh that would be just like him,\" Stella says with a laugh.",
      "The family start to reminisce about hiking holidays and driving around in a large van they converted to become a camper. \"Me and dad insulated it and put a bed in the back,\" says Ashley.",
      "On the walls are photos of Emily and Ashley as small children next to huge carved Halloween pumpkins.",
      "Dr Moore is still stroking Wayne's hand and occasionally checking his pulse. For a man who Emily says was \"always walking, always outdoors, always active\", these are the final moments of life's journey, spent surrounded by those who mean most to him.",
      "At 12.22pm Dr Moore says, \"I think he's passed\u2026 He's at peace now.\"",
      "Outside, the mockingbird has fallen silent. \"No more pain,\" says Stella, embracing her children in her arms.",
      "I step outside to give the family some space, and reflect on what we have just seen and filmed.",
      "I have been covering medical ethics for the BBC for more than 20 years. In 2006, I was present just outside an apartment in Zurich where Dr Anne Turner, a retired doctor, died with the help of the group Dignitas - but California was the first time I had been an eyewitness to an assisted death.",
      "This isn't just a story about one man's death in California - it's about what could become a reality here in England and Wales for those who qualify for an assisted death and choose to die this way.",
      "Whether you're for or against the proposed new Westminster law, the death of a loved one is a deeply personal and emotional time for a family. Each death leaves an imprint, as will Wayne's.",

      "\"The OBR has scored nothing against any change here - the assumption is that not a single person changes their behaviour.\"",
      "Last month, the OBR published its assessment of the government's spending plans and performance.",

      "Parliamentary privilege gives MPs and peers absolute free speech and their comments can be reported without the threat of legal action.",

      "The ex-employees agreed to keep the details of their complaints confidential under non-disclosure agreements.",
      "But the allegations were eventually reported after Labour peer Lord Hain revealed Sir Philip was behind the injunction in October 2018, using parliamentary privilege.",

      "Sir Philip has previously accused the Telegraph of \"pursuing a vendetta\" against him and his staff.",

      "Lawyers for the businessman challenged the absence of controls on the power of parliamentary privilege to reveal information covered by an injunction.",
      "On Tuesday, a panel of eight judges ruled against Sir Philip, finding his right to privacy under Article 8 of the convention had not been violated.",
      "A majority of the judges also found that his complaints brought under Article 6, the right to a fair hearing, and Article 13, the right to an effective remedy, were \"inadmissible\".",
      "The justices said national parliaments \"are better placed than the international judge to assess the need to restrict conduct by a member\".",
      "They added \"the court would require strong reasons to substitute its view for that of Parliament\".",
      "Following the ruling, Lord Hain said: \"I'm really pleased that the Strasbourg Court defended parliamentary privilege and my right to have named Sir Philip.\"",

      "Downing Street defended the principle of parliamentary privilege following the court's ruling.",

      "Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden has written to government departments asking them to justify the existence of every taxpayer-funded organisation not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "Some of these organisations, known as quangos, could be closed, merged, or have their responsibilities handed over to departments.",
      "The BBC has been told ministers are considering passing a new law that would make it easier to scrap multiple quangos at once.",

      "There will be a presumption that all quangos could be scrapped unless there is a compelling reason to keep them, the Cabinet Office said.",

      "McFadden said the government wants to \"ensure decisions of national importance that affect everyone in this country are made by those who have been elected to do so\".",
      "He added: \"The review will aim to drive out waste and inefficiency across Whitehall, reducing duplication and bureaucracy - saving the taxpayer money and cutting the cost of 'doing government'.\"",
      "'Handle it properly'",
      "Since Labour won the general election last year, government has set up a number of new quangos, including Great British Energy, which invests in clean power sources.",
      "Previous governments have taken an axe to these organisations, with the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition getting rid of hundreds in a so-called bonfire of quangos from 2010.",
      "But trade unions are wary of further cuts, and fear they could mean jobs losses in the Civil Service.",

      "Suspended Labour MP, John McDonnell, who represents Hayes and Harlington in Parliament and previously held the position of shadow chancellor, also told Access All of his \"shock and anger\" at the plans, and said he was \"praying\" for a government U-turn.",
      "Initially, the government's reforms to benefits were intended to make savings of \u00a35bn a year by 2030, but the Office for Budget Responsibility has revised government figures, projecting a lower net saving of \u00a33.4bn.",
      "The government says that without radical reforms to the benefit system it could cost the tax payer as much as \u00a370bn annually by the end of the decade.",
      "To make savings, other planned changes include freezing extra payments for existing claimants of Universal Credit and almost halving them for new applicants.",
      "The government says some of the money saved will be reinvested into work programmes targeting youth unemployment.",
      "Alongside the 12-week consultation, which ends on 30 June, the government has announced the formation of \"collaboration committees\" which will involve civil servants working with disability experts and those with lived experience to  \"provide discussion, challenge, and recommendations\" to inform government proposals.",

      "\"Globalisation as we've known it for the last couple of decades has come to an end.\"",

    "story": [
      "A judge has sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations - including the BBC - and ruled a legal row between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret.",
      "The Home Office wants the right to be able access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, citing powers given to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "At the moment Apple has no such capability - such data can only be accessed by the user - and says it does not want to create what it calls a \"backdoor\" into ADP because of concerns it would eventually be exploited by hackers and criminals.",
      "The government's request prompted fierce criticism from privacy campaigners and some US politicians.",
      "In February, Apple pulled ADP from the UK and in March it launched legal proceedings against the government, in a case which is being heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.",
      "The government argued it would damage national security if the nature of the legal action and the parties to it were made public - what are known as the \"bare details of the case\".",
      "In a ruling published on Monday morning, the tribunal rejected that request - pointing to the extensive media reporting of the row and highlighting the legal principle of open justice.",
      "\"It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,\" it states.",
      "\"For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,\" it later adds.",
      "In a statement the Home Office said it would not comment on legal proceedings or individual notices but said its \"first priority is to keep people safe.\"",
      "\"There are longstanding and targeted investigatory powers that allow the authorities to investigate terrorists, paedophiles and the most serious criminals and they are subject to robust safeguards including judicial authorisations and oversight to protect people's privacy,\" it added.",
      "It stressed it was not seeking blanket data access - and any requests to view individual accounts protected by ADP would need a court approved warrant.",
      "Wider implications",
      "Civil and digital rights organisations in the UK, which criticised the Home Office request, have welcomed Monday's ruling.",
      "They, along with news organisations  - including the BBC - made legal representations for the case to be heard in public.",
      "\"This is bigger than the UK and Apple,\" said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group.",
      "\"The Court's judgment will have implications for the privacy and security of millions of people around the world.\"",
      "The Open Rights Group campaigned alongside Big Brother Watch and Index on Censorship against the proposal to hold the hearing in secret.",
      "Big Brother Watch interim director Rebecca Vincent says the judgement is \"effectively chipping away at the pervasive climate of secrecy surrounding the Investigatory Powers Tribunal's consideration of the Apple case\".",
      "\"The Home Office's order to break encryption represents a massive attack on the privacy rights of millions of British Apple users, which is a matter of significant public interest and must not be considered behind closed doors,\" she adds.",
      "Apple declined to comment.",
      "In a previous statement it told the BBC:  \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom.",
      "\"As we have said many times before we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\"",
      "How does ADP work?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data such as photos and notes stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "It uses what is known as end-to-end encryption (E2EE), meaning only the user has the \"key\" necessary to unscramble and access the data.",
      "E2EE is also used to protect data on messaging services including WhatsApp and Signal.",
      "It makes the data very secure - but poses a problem for law enforcement agencies.",
      "They can request to view information stored with lower levels of protection - but companies such as Apple have no way of allowing them to view files secured with E2EE because they do not possess such a capability.",
      "Campaign group Privacy International said the right of individuals also needed to be protected - and welcomed today's ruling.",

      "Tagging a video of the Conservative leader's comments on X, Lammy posted: \"It's disgraceful you are cheerleading another country for detaining and deporting two British MPs.",
      "\"Do you say the same about Tory MPs banned from China?",
      "\"This government will continue to stand up for the rights of our MPs to speak their mind, whatever their party.\"",
      "Reposting the criticism, Badenoch said: \"Unlike China, Israel is our ally and a democracy. A good Foreign Sec would be able to make that distinction.",
      "\"Perhaps Labour MPs could put UK national interest first and do their jobs instead of campaigning for airports in Kashmir or promoting Hamas propaganda in parliament.\"",
      "Further criticism came from Davey on X, who posted: \"Kemi Badenoch has once again shown unbelievably poor judgement by failing to back two British MPs denied entry to Israel.",
      "\"Yet another complete shocker.\"",
      "Foreign Affairs Committee chairwoman Dame Emily Thornberry told Sky News she was \"completely gobsmacked\" by Badenoch's comments.",
      "\"This is nonsense,\" the Labour MP said. \"You have to stand up for what's right, Kemi Badenoch, and you should stand in solidarity with other parliamentarians who were just going to Israel and the West Bank to find out what was going on.\"",
      "Badenoch was also contradicted by Tory MP Fuller, who told LBC that Conservative MPs had experienced similar issues in China and he wanted to support the right to travel to other countries.",
      "\"I want to support my colleagues,\" said Fuller. \"This isn't a partisan thing, as a parliamentarian, we live in a difficult world at the moment.",
      "\"Democracies are under threat, we should support them in those circumstances, whether China, Israel, or anywhere...",
      "\"On this, my personal view is, parliamentarians should be allowed free passage to other countries, to our allies. We should look at that in a poor light. We should be supporting them.\"",

      "The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.",
      "And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.",
      "\"Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,\" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst.",

      "The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots.",
      "More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the \"digital twin\", which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.",
      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",
      "The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.",
      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",
      "Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.",
      "This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.",
      "All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.",

      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",

      "Paleogeneticist Dr Nic Rawlence, also from Otago University, explained how ancient dire wolf DNA - extracted from fossilised remains - is too degraded and damaged to biologically copy or clone.",
      "\"Ancient DNA is like if you put fresh DNA in a 500 degree oven overnight,\" Dr Rawlence told BBC News. \"It comes out fragmented - like shards and dust.",
      "\"You can reconstruct [it], but it's not good enough to do anything else with.\"",
      "Instead, he added, the de-extinction team used new synthetic biology technology - using the ancient DNA to identify key segments of code that they could edit into the biological blueprint of a living animal, in this case a grey wolf.",
      "\"So what Colossal has produced is a grey wolf, but it has some dire wolf-like characteristics, like a larger skull and white fur,\" said Dr Rawlence. \"It's a hybrid.\"",
      "Dr Beth Shapiro, a biologist from Colossal Biosciences, said that this feat does represent de-extinction, which she described as recreating animals with the same characteristics.",
      "\"A grey wolf is the closest living relative of a dire wolf - they're genetically really similar - so we targeted DNA sequences that lead to dire wolf traits and then edited grey wolf cells... then we cloned those cells and created our dire wolves.\"",
      "According to Dr Rawlence though, dire wolves diverged from grey wolves anywhere between 2.5 to six million years ago.",
      "\"It's in a completely different genus to grey wolves,\" he said. \"Colossal compared the genomes of the dire wolf and the grey wolf, and from about 19,000 genes, they determined that 20 changes in 14 genes gave them a dire wolf.\"",
      "The edited embryos were implanted in surrogate domestic dog mothers. According to the article in Time, all three wolves were born by planned caesarean section to minimise the risk of complications.",
      "Colossal, which was valued at $10bn (\u00a37.8bn) in January, is keeping the wolves on a private 2,000-acre facility at an undisclosed location in the northern US.",
      "The pups certainly look like many people's vision of a dire wolf and the story has gathered global attention. So why is this scientific distinction important?",
      "\"Because extinction is still forever,\" Dr Rawlence told BBC News. \"If we don't have extinction, how are we going to learn from our mistakes?",

      "Adding alcohol to males' food increases their release of chemicals that attract females and leads to higher mating success.",
      "Fruit flies, or Drosophila melanogaster, are often found around our food waste bins as they feed on rotting fruit which gradually produces alcohol.",
      "Scientists have been trying to study why they are attracted to alcohol and how it affects them.",

      "The fly's attraction both to the carbohydrates and yeast in rotting fruit, as well as to the alcohol, cannot be separated, he added.",
      "In the study, alcohol, and particularly methanol, increased the males' production and release of chemical sex signals, called pheromones, which made them more attractive to females.",
      "Pheromones are released into the air from one individual to influence the behaviour of another animal of the same species.",
      "Males were therefore strongly attracted to alcohol, especially those males which  had never mated.",

      "While two are responsible for attracting male flies to small amounts of alcohol, a third ensures that excessive amounts have a deterrent effect.",
      "Because alcohol is toxic, the fly's brain must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of drinking it, and it does this by balancing signals of attraction with aversion.",

      "The report says that clean energy sources contributed more than 40% of global electricity generation for the first time since the 1940s. Back then demand was much lower, and hydroelectric power stations contributed a significant share.",
      "The big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy.",
      "That means that though the percentage generated by clean power has risen to 40.9% the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted has yet to start falling.",
      "According to the Ember report global demand for electricity rose by 4% in 2024.",
      "This was partly due to an increased use of air conditioning in what was a particularly hot year. That meant that fossil fuel generation, mostly coal (34%) and gas (22%), increased by 1.4% and global emissions of the climate warming gas CO2 rose to an all time high of 14.6bn tonnes.",

      "\"In the coming days, we will see wind speeds slowing down with clear skies. This naturally leads to a rise in temperature,\" Mr Palawat added.",
      "Last year, India recorded its hottest day ever at 50.5C in Rajasthan state. More than 40,000 suspected cases of heatstroke were also reported.",
      "One weather station in Delhi in May recorded a maximum temperature of 52.9C, although the government later said it was due to a sensor error and revised it down by 3C.",

      "The exact 3D replica shows the violence of how the ship ripped in two as it sank after hitting an iceberg in 1912 - 1,500 people lost their lives in the disaster.",
      "The scan provides a new view of a boiler room, confirming eye-witness accounts that engineers worked right to the end to keep the ship's lights on.",
      "And a computer simulation also suggests that punctures in the hull the size of A4 pieces of paper led to the ship's demise.",
      "\"Titanic is the last surviving eyewitness to the disaster, and she still has stories to tell,\" said Parks Stephenson, a Titanic analyst.",
      "The scan has been studied for a new documentary by National Geographic and Atlantic Productions called Titanic: The Digital Resurrection.",

      "Scans of Titanic reveal wreck as never seen before",
      "The wreck, which lies 3,800m down in the icy waters of the Atlantic, was mapped using underwater robots.",
      "More than 700,000 images, taken from every angle, were used to create the \"digital twin\", which was revealed exclusively to the world by BBC News in 2023.",
      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",
      "The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.",
      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",
      "Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.",
      "This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.",
      "All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"",
      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",

      "It's not expected that all of the Switch 2's titles will be so expensive - but charging so much for its best-known game still represents a big change in Nintendo's pricing strategy.",
      "It also risks confusing customers, as the same games can be purchased for different amounts depending on whether they are buying the physical game or the digital-only version.",

      "\"I bought N64 games for \u00a350 in the turn of the century and that's \u00a380 today,\" he pointed out.",
      "For some time developers have got round that by monetising transactions in games and relying more on cheaper digital downloads.",

      "He said that could be a real blow for the people who sell the physical games.",
      "\"When a Nintendo Switch game releases, around 80% of its sales are in a box - if you compare that to Xbox, around 80% of new game sales are digital.",
      "\"By charging more for the physical copy it's going to encourage people to download more, which will be good for Nintendo's bottom line.\"",

      "But the price tag of over \u00a3200 - more than double that of the original handheld - sparked consternation amongst fans who weren't willing to shell out so much for it.",
      "Within six months, Nintendo had slashed the price by almost half, and over time it picked up traction.",
      "It is fair to say the 3DS faced other problems such as a lacklustre list of launch games, whereas the Switch 2 is launching with the first Mario Kart game in a decade.",
      "Nonetheless Nintendo has form with price decisions backfiring.",
      "The N64 launched at \u00a3250 back in 1997, and within a year it had tumbled down to \u00a399.",

      "The optical mouse controls pop up elsewhere too, with PC strategy game Civilization VII a game that massively benefits.",

      "I had great experiences with these games in the 20 minutes I had with them.",
      "But for fans to get value for those high prices they will want something that holds up over weeks and months of gameplay.",
      "Will the Switch 2's slick nostalgia hit provide that? We'll start to find out in June."

      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies shows no signs of slowing down - Beijing has vowed to \"fight to the end\" hours after US President Donald Trump threatened to nearly double the tariffs on China.",
      "That could leave most Chinese imports facing a staggering 104% tax - a sharp escalation between the two sides.",
      "Smartphones, computers, lithium-ion batteries, toys and video game consoles make up the bulk of Chinese exports to the US. But there are so many other things, from screws to boilers.",
      "With a deadline looming in Washington as Trump threatens to introduce the additional tariffs from Wednesday, who will blink first?",
      "\"It would be a mistake to think that China will back off and remove tariffs unilaterally,\" says Alfredo Montufar-Helu, a senior advisor to the China Center at The Conference Board think tank.",
      "\"Not only would it make China look weak, but it would also give leverage to the US to ask for more. We've now reached an impasse that will likely lead to long-term economic pain.\"",

      "Live updates on this story",
      "Global markets have slumped since last week when Trump's tariffs, which target almost every country, began coming into effect. Asian stocks, which saw their worst drop in decades on Monday after the Trump administration didn't waver, recovered slightly on Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, China has hit back with tit-for-tat levies - 34% - and Trump warned that he would retaliate with an additional 50% tariff if Beijing doesn't back down.",
      "Uncertainty is high, with more tariffs, some more than 40%, set to kick in on Wednesday. Many of these would hit Asian economies: tariffs on China would rise to 54%, and those on Vietnam and Cambodia, would soar to 46% and 49% respectively.",

      "How is China responding to the tariffs?",
      "China had responded to the first round of Trump tariffs with tit-for-tat levies on certain US imports, export controls on rare metals and an anti-monopoly investigation into US firms, including Google.",
      "This time too it has announced retaliatory tariffs, but it also appears to be bracing for pain with stronger measures. It has allowed its currency, the yuan, to weaken, which makes Chinese exports more attractive. And state-linked enterprises have been buying up stocks in what appears to be a move to stabilise the market.",
      "The prospect of negotiations between the US and Japan seemed to buoy investors who were fighting to claw back some of the losses of recent days.",
      "But the face-off between China and the US - the world's biggest exporter and its most important market - remains a major concern.",
      "\"What we are seeing is a game of who can bear more pain. We've stopped talking about any sense of gain,\" Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told the BBC's Newshour programme.",
      "Despite its slowing economy, China may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", she added.",
      "Shaken by a prolonged property market crisis and rising unemployment, Chinese people are just not spending enough. Indebted local governments have also been struggling to increase investments or expand the social safety net.",
      "\"The tariffs exacerbate this problem,\" said Andrew Collier, Senior Fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard Kennedy School.",
      "If China's exports take a hit, that hurts a crucial revenue stream. Exports have long been a key factor in China's explosive growth. And they remain a significant driver, although the country is trying to diversify its economy with high-end tech manufacturing and greater domestic consumption.",
      "It's hard to say exactly when the tariffs \"will bite but likely soon,\" Mr Collier says, adding that \"[President Xi] faces an increasingly difficult choice due to a slowing economy and dwindling resources\".",
      "It goes both ways",
      "But it's not just China that will be feeling the impact.",
      "According to the US Trade Representative office, the US imported $438bn (\u00a3342bn) worth of goods from China in 2024, with US exports to China valued at $143bn,  leaving a trade deficit of $295bn.",
      "And it's not clear how the US is going to find alternative supply for Chinese goods on such short notice.",
      "Taxes on physical goods aside, both countries are \"economically intertwined in a lot of ways - there's a massive amount of investment both ways, a lot of digital trade and data flows\", says Deborah Elms, Head of Trade Policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore.",
      "\"You can only tariff so much for so long. But there are other ways both countries can hit each other. So you might say it can't possibly get worse, but there are many ways in which it can.\"",
      "The rest of the world is watching too, to see where Chinese exports shut out of the US market will go.",
      "They will end up in other markets such as those in South East Asia, Ms Elms adds, and \"these places [are dealing] with their own tariffs and having to think about where else can we sell our products?\"",
      "\"So we are in a very different universe, one that is really murky.\"",
      "How does this end?",
      "Unlike the trade war with China during Trump's first term, which was about negotiating with Beijing, \"it's unclear what is motivating these tariffs and it's very hard to predict where things might go from here,\" says Roland Rajah, lead economist at the Lowy Institute.",
      "China has a \"wide toolkit\" for retaliation, he adds, such as depreciating their currency further or clamping down on US firms.",
      "\"I think the question is how restrained will they be? There's retaliation to save face and there's pulling out the whole arsenal. It's not clear if China wants to go down that path. It just might.\"",
      "Some experts believe the US and China may engage in private talks. Trump is yet to speak to Xi since returning to the White House, although Beijing has repeatedly signalled its willingness to talk.",
      "But others are less hopeful.",
      "\"I think the US is overplaying its hand,\" Ms Elms says. She is sceptical of Trump's belief that the US market is so lucrative that China, or any country, will eventually bend.",

      "Prince Laurent - the younger brother of King Philippe - received \u20ac388,000 (\u00a3295,850; $376,000) from state funds last year but said that his work entitles him and his family to social security.",

      "Laurent, 61, said he was acting out of \"principle\" rather than for money. The court disagreed.",

      "This means Laurent is left with about \u20ac5000 (\u00a34300; $5500) a month but no social security benefits, such as the right to claim back some medical expenses.",
      "The prince \u2013 who has three adult children with British-born wife Claire Coombs \u2013 has also expressed his concerns over his family's wellbeing since the royal allowance will be cut when he dies.",
      "Laurent took legal action against the Belgian state after his application for social security was refused. A first hearing was held in November 2024.",
      "According to RTBF, the prince and his legal counsel have not yet decided whether to appeal the court's decision.",
      "Laurentm who is the 15th in the Belgian line of succession, is no stranger to controversy and is sometimes termed the prince maudit - the \"cursed prince\" - in Belgium.",
      "In 2018, the Belgian federal parliament voted to dock his monthly allowance for a year after he attended a Chinese embassy reception without government permission, in full naval uniform.",
      "He has also racked up several speeding fines and has been criticised for attending meetings in Libya when the late Muammar Gaddafi was still in power."

      "It's the heaviest barrage for several months and comes weeks after Israel resumed its military campaign in Gaza.",
      "About half of the rockets landed inside Israel with the remainder being shot down, the Israeli military said. One person was wounded by falling debris, Israeli medics said.",
      "In Gaza, a Palestinian journalist was killed and nine others wounded when an air strike hit a tent used by local media in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, the Hamas Government Media Office and the Palestinian Journalists Syndicate (PJS) said.",
      "Reuters news agency said footage showed people trying to put out a blaze in the tent which it said was inside the compound of Nasser hospital.",
      "The dead journalist was identified by the PJS as Helmi al-Faqaawi of Palestine Today TV.",

      "Israel resumed its military campaign in Gaza last month, blaming Hamas for rejecting a US proposal to extend a ceasefire which had begun in January. Hamas, in turn, accused Israel of abandoning the original deal which both sides had agreed to.",

    "story": [
      "A second child has died from measles as an outbreak of the highly contagious virus continues to grow in western Texas.",
      "The school-aged child was not vaccinated, had no underlying health conditions and was in hospital suffering complications from measles, Aaron Davis, the vice-president of UMC Health System, told the BBC.",
      "US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has faced a backlash over his handling of the outbreak, visited Texas on Sunday in the wake of the death, which is the third overall in recent weeks.",
      "The southern US state has reported more than 480 cases of measles so far this year as of Friday, a jump from 420 earlier in the week. The outbreak has extended to neighbouring states.",
      "Across the whole of the US, more than 600 cases of measles have been recorded so far this year, more than double the 285 cases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recorded last year.",
      "In 2019, there were a total of 1,274 measles cases recorded across the US, but prior to that there had not been a larger outbreak than this year's since the early 1990s, according to the CDC.",
      "Many of this year's cases - nearly all in unvaccinated people - are related to the outbreak that began in western Texas.",
      "\"This unfortunate event underscores the importance of vaccination,\" Mr Davis said in a statement. \"Measles is a highly contagious disease that can lead to serious complications, particularly for those who are unvaccinated.\"",
      "The child - an eight-year-old girl - died early on Thursday.",
      "The BBC contacted the state health department and the US Department of Health and Human Services for comment. Neither agency listed the death in their case counts on Friday.",
      "In a statement posted on social media, Kennedy confirmed the girl's death.",
      "\"My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,\" he said in the statement.",
      "He also said he was engaging with officials there to \"support Texas health officials and to learn how our HHS agencies can better partner with them to control the measles outbreak\". Kennedy said he was deploying a team - as he did in March - to help distribute vaccines, medications and other supplies, among other support services.",
      "\"The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,\" Kennedy wrote, referring to the measles, mumps and rubella jab.",
      "In February, an unvaccinated six-year-old girl in the local Mennonite community was the first child to die of measles in the US in a decade. In March, an unvaccinated man died in New Mexico after contracting the virus, though his cause of death is still under investigation.",
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday told reporters aboard Air Force One that he believes the outbreak is largely contained.",
      "\"It's so far a fairly small number of people, relative to what we're talking about,\" he said. \"It's something that people have known about for many years. This is not something new.\"",
      "\"We'll see what happens. If it progresses, we'll have to take action. Very strong action,\" he said in response to a question from the BBC.",
      "The virus - which can cause a fever, red rash, cough and other symptoms - is associated with a host of complications, including pneumonia, brain swelling and death.",
      "The US declared measles eliminated from the country in 2000. But outbreaks have grown since then with a rise in anti-vaccine sentiment.",
      "Two shots of the immunisation - proven safe - are 97% effective at preventing the virus and reduce severe infections. To achieve herd immunity - when enough of a group is immune to a disease, limiting its spread and protecting the unvaccinated - around 95% of the population must have the shots, experts say.",
      "The recent outbreak originated in a religious community that strongly rejects vaccines. Local health officials in western Texas have told the BBC they have seen limited progress in attempts to improve vaccination rates.",
      "Kennedy's early response to the worsening outbreaks was muted, drawing criticism from health experts.",
      "Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic, initially described the situation as \"not unusual\".",
      "He changed his approach after a child's died from measles in February - the first in the US in a decade - but stopped short of recommending that parents vaccinate their children. He instead encouraged them to talk to their doctors about the shot.",
      "On Sunday, Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican who represents Louisiana, called for stronger messaging. Cassidy is also a doctor and has previously criticised Kennedy for his sceptical attitude towards vaccination.",
      "\"Everyone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,\" Cassidy wrote on social media platform X. \"Top health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.\"",
      "Kennedy has also at times promoted Vitamin A as a treatment for measles, which doctors say should only be provided in certain cases under the guidance of a physician.",

      "This will not apply until the appeals process is exhausted, which could take several years.",
      "RN spokesperson Laurent Jacobelli said that although the party would fight to have Le Pen as candidate, its 29-year-old president, Bardella, was \"the most naturally legitimate\" alternative.",
      "Bardella has steered clear of being drawn into the discussion at this stage, refusing to say whether he was National Rally's \"plan B\" and saying after the ruling that the French should be \"outraged\" by the sentence.",
      "However, a poll published a day before Le Pen was sentenced showed that around 60% of RN voters would back Bardella over Le Pen at the presidential election if he were to run.",

      "\"What it is that I want to do in terms of my day-to-day life is much of what I'm doing in here. I want to be an advocate for people that are suffering in silence,\" 54-year-old Erik Menendez told TMZ.",
      "\"Lyle and I aren't talking about leaving prison - should we be able to get out - and not looking back. Our lives will be spent working with the prison and doing the work that we're doing in here, out there,\" he added.",
      "Part of the bid for parole hinges on a risk assessment that evaluates whether the brothers are still seen as threats to society.",
      "The brothers say they have changed in prison.",
      "\"I'm striving to be a better person every day, and I want to be a person that my family can be proud of,\" said Erik Menendez. \"Who I've evolved into, who I've seen Lyle evolve into. I'm beginning to like myself, be proud of myself, and find it's okay to like myself.\"",
      "During their time in prison, both Erik and Lyle have started rehabilitation programs for disabled and elderly inmates and taught classes on trauma healing and meditation.",
      "\"Our best moments are the ones that are not spoken about, and we just help somebody, or we help an animal, or we make somebody smile that's feeling down that might have gone and harmed themselves if we weren't there,\" Erik said, speaking of their volunteer work in prison.",
      "Despite the upcoming parole hearing, the brothers' future - and the other possible paths to freedom - remain uncertain.",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman recently withdrew a motion for resentencing that had been filed under his predecessor, George Gasc\u00f3n, signalling a harder stance on the case.",
      "Hochman has publicly said he will not support the brothers' release, though the final decision rests with a judge.",
      "The move has stirred controversy with the DA's office as two former prosecutors who worked under Gasc\u00f3n and advocated for the brothers' resentencing, have filed a legal case against Hochman - accusing him of harassment, retaliation, and defamation.",
      "The pair claim they were demoted because of their stance on the case - and have faced intense public scrutiny as a result. Mr Hochman's office is yet to comment.",
      "Some members of the Menendez family have also criticized Mr Hochman, suggesting he is letting personal bias influence his actions. Mr Hochman denies this.",
      "\"Hochman doesn't seem to want to listen or engage with us,\" the brothers' cousin Tamara Goodell told US media. Ms Goodell accused the prosecutor of dismissing and ignoring the family, and \"not acting like a neutral party\".",
      "Los Angeles DA Hochman opposes move to resentence Menendez brothers",
      "Los Angeles DA Hochman opposes move to resentence Menendez brothers",
      "But public opinion remains divided.",
      "In the same TMZ special, Alan Abrahamson, a former Los Angeles Times reporter who covered the Menendez trials in the 1990s, said the brothers are \"two of the most skilled and accomplished liars\".",
      "\"The Menendezes are very capable of shapeshifting, and being who people who want them to be,\" Mr Abrahamson said. \"And I think this is one of the grave dangers of this discussion that people don't seem to pick up on.\"",
      "That is a thought shared by a former Beverly Hills detective who was assigned to investigate the murders at the time.",
      "\"This is the most heinous murder case I've had,\" Tom Linehan told TMZ. He believes the Menendez brothers were money-motivated killers who grew up getting exactly they wanted.",
      "\"If somebody is challenging what they want to do, they'd take them out if they had to,\" Linehan added.",
      "As for the brothers, they have to hope the parole board sees things differently, so they will continue to fight their legal case.",
      "\"You never know how long you'll be blessed to be on the Earth, so we don't sit around waiting for something,\" Lyle said."

      "Warning: This article contains distressing content",
      "Palestinian detainees released back to Gaza have told the BBC they were subjected to mistreatment and torture at the hands of Israeli military and prison staff, adding to reports of misconduct within Israel's barracks and jails.",
      "One man said he was attacked with chemicals and set alight. \"I thrashed around like an animal in an attempt to put the fire out [on my body],\" said Mohammad Abu Tawileh, a 36-year-old mechanic.",
      "We have conducted in-depth interviews with five released detainees, all of whom were arrested in Gaza in the months after Hamas and other groups killed about 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostage. The men were held under Israel's Unlawful Combatants Law, a measure by which people suspected of posing a security risk can be detained for an unspecified period without charge, as Israel set out to recover the hostages and dismantle the proscribed terror group.",
      "The men say they were accused of having links with Hamas and questioned over the location of hostages and tunnels, but were not found to be involved in the 7 October 2023 attacks - a condition Israel had set for anyone released under the recent ceasefire deal.",
      "Some of those freed under the deal were serving sentences for other serious crimes, including the killing of Israelis, but that was not the case for our interviewees. We also asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Prison Service (IPS) if there were any convictions or accusations against the men but they did not respond to that question.",
      "In the men's testimony:",
      "They each describe being stripped, blindfolded, cuffed and beatenSome also say they were given electric shocks, menaced by dogs, and denied access to medical careSome say they witnessed the deaths of other detaineesOne says he witnessed sexual abuseAnother says he had his head dunked in chemicals and his back set on fire",

      "Some say they witnessed the deaths of other detainees",
      "One says he witnessed sexual abuse",
      "Another says he had his head dunked in chemicals and his back set on fire",
      "We have seen reports by a lawyer who visited two of the men in prison, and have spoken to medical staff who treated some of them on their return.",
      "The BBC sent a lengthy right of reply letter to the IDF which laid out in detail the men's allegations and their identities.",
      "In its statement, the IDF did not respond to any of the specific allegations, but said it \"completely rejects accusations of systematic abuse of detainees\".",
      "It said some of the cases raised by the BBC would be \"examined by the relevant authorities\". It added that others \"were brought without sufficient detail, without any detail regarding the identity of the detainees, making them impossible to examine\".",
      "It continued: \"The IDF takes any\u2026 actions which contradict its values very seriously\u2026 Specific complaints about inappropriate behaviour by detention facility staff or insufficient conditions are forwarded for examination by the relevant authorities and are dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, disciplinary actions are taken against the staff members of the facility, and criminal investigations are opened.\"",
      "The IPS said it was not aware of any of the claims of abuse described in our investigation, in its prisons. \"[A]s far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility,\" it added.",
      "Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne, co-director of the Centre for International Law at the University of Bristol, said the treatment the men described was \"entirely inconsistent with both international law and Israeli law\", and in some cases would \"meet the threshold of torture\".",
      "\"Under international law, the law of armed conflict requires you to treat all detainees humanely,\" he said. \"The obligations relating to the basic needs of detainees are unaffected by any alleged wrongdoing.\"",
      "The five Palestinians interviewed in depth were returned earlier this year under the ceasefire deal with Hamas - the group that led the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel.",
      "They were among about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees exchanged for 33 Israeli hostages, eight dead and 25 living, some of whom have described being abused, starved and threatened by their Hamas captors.",
      "Female hostages previously released have detailed physical and sexual assaults in captivity.",
      "Israel says forensic tests show some of the dead hostages returned in the ceasefire, including children, were killed by Hamas, though the group denies this.",
      "The five released Palestinian detainees all described the same pattern - being arrested in Gaza, taken into Israel to be detained first in military barracks before being moved on to prison, and finally released back to Gaza months later.",
      "They said they had been abused at every stage of the process.",
      "More than a dozen other released detainees, whom the BBC spoke to more briefly as they arrived home in Gaza, also gave accounts of beatings, hunger and disease.",
      "These, in turn, align with testimony given by others to Israeli human rights group B'Tselem and the United Nations, which in July detailed reports from returning detainees that they had been stripped naked, deprived of food, sleep and water, subjected to electric shocks and burned with cigarettes, and had dogs set on them.",
      "A further report by UN experts last month documented cases of rape and sexual assault, and said using this as a threat was \"standard operating procedure\" for the IDF. Israel responded to say it \"categorically rejects the unfounded allegations\".",
      "As Israel does not currently allow international journalists free access to Gaza, our interviews were conducted by phone call and text message, and also in person by our contracted freelancers in the territory.",
      "All five men told us their abuse had begun at the moment of their arrest - when they said they had been stripped, blindfolded and beaten.",
      "Mechanic Mohammad Abu Tawileh told us he had been tortured for days.",
      "He was taken by soldiers to a building not far from the location of his arrest in March 2024, he said, and held in a room - the sole detainee there - for three days of interrogation by troops.",
      "Warning: Graphic image below",
      "Soldiers mixed chemicals used for cleaning into a pot, he told us, and dunked his head in them. The interrogators then punched him, he said, and he fell to the rubble-strewn floor, injuring his eye. He said they then covered his eye with a cloth, which he said \"worsened his injury\".",
      "They also set him alight, he told us.",
      "\"They used an air freshener with a lighter to set my back on fire. I thrashed around like an animal in an attempt to put the fire out. It spread from my neck down to my legs. Then, they repeatedly hit me with the bottoms of their rifles, and had sticks with them, which they used to hit and poke me on my sides,\" he said.",
      "They then \"continued pouring acid on me. I spent around a day and a half being washed with [it],\" he told us.",
      "\"They poured it on my head, and it dripped down my body while I was sitting on the chair.\"",
      "Eventually, he said, soldiers poured water on his body, and drove him into Israel where he received medical treatment in hospital, including skin grafts.",
      "Most of his treatment, he said, took place at a field hospital at Sde Teiman barracks, an IDF base near Beersheba in southern Israel. He said he was cuffed naked to a bed and given a nappy instead of access to a toilet. Israeli doctors at this hospital have previously told the BBC shackling patients and forcing them to wear nappies is routine.",
      "When the BBC interviewed Mr Abu Tawileh shortly after his release, his back was covered in red welts. The residual pain from his burns still woke him up, he said, and his vision had been affected.",
      "The BBC was not able to speak to anyone who witnessed an attack on Mr Abu Tawileh, but a specialist eye doctor who treated him on his return to Gaza confirmed that he had suffered a chemical burn to the eye, damaging the skin around it. He also said Mr Abu Tawileh's vision was weakening, due to either the chemicals or other trauma.",
      "We showed images of his injuries and gave details of his testimony to several UK doctors, who said they appeared consistent with his account, though they noted there were limitations to what they could assess by looking at photos.",
      "The BBC gave extensive details of this account to the IDF, giving it five days to investigate. It did not respond directly to Mr Abu Tawileh's allegations but said it took any actions \"which contradict its values very seriously\".",
      "It said it would \"examine\" some of the cases, but did not respond to follow-up questions about whether this included Mr Abu Tawileh.",
      "Others we interviewed also described abuse at the point of arrest.",
      "\"They cuffed us and hit us. No-one would give me a drop of water,\" said Abdul Karim Mushtaha, a 33-year-old poultry slaughterhouse worker, who told us he was arrested in November 2023 at an Israeli checkpoint while following evacuation orders with his family. A report filed by a lawyer who later visited Mr Mushtaha noted he had been \"subjected to severe beatings, humiliation, degradation and stripping during his arrest until he was transferred to prison\".",
      "Two said they had then been left outside in the cold for hours, and two said Israeli soldiers stole their belongings and money.",
      "The BBC gave details of the allegations of theft to the IDF, which described it as \"contrary to the law and IDF values\". It said it would \"thoroughly\" examine the cases if more details were provided.",
      "All our interviewees, including Mr Mushtaha, said they were transferred to the Israeli barracks of Sde Teiman, where Mr Abu Tawileh also said he received treatment in its field hospital.",
      "One interviewee told us he was mistreated on the way there. He asked for his name not to be published for fear of reprisals, so we are calling him \"Omar\".",
      "He said Israeli soldiers stood and spat on him, and others with him, calling them \"sons of pigs\" and \"sons of Sinwar\" - referring to the Hamas leader and architect of the 7 October attacks, killed by Israel five months ago.",
      "\"They made us listen to a voice recording that said: 'What you did to our children, we will do to your children',\" said the 33-year-old, who worked for an electrical cable company.",
      "Sde Teiman has been the focus of previous serious complaints in the wake of the October 2023 attacks. Several soldiers stationed there were charged in February after they were filmed assaulting a detainee, resulting in his hospitalisation for a torn rectum and a punctured lung. In a separate case, a soldier at the base was sentenced after he admitted to the aggravated abuse of Palestinian detainees from Gaza.",
      "Three of the men we spoke to alleged that dogs were used to intimidate detainees at Sde Teiman and other facilities.",
      "\"We would get beaten up when they took us from the barracks to the medical clinic or the interrogation room - they'd set [muzzled] dogs on us, tighten our cuffs,\" said Mr Abu Tawileh who was held in general detention in the barracks, as well as being treated there.",
      "The BBC asked the IDF to respond to allegations it frequently used dogs to intimidate and attack detainees. It said: \"The use of dogs to harm detainees is prohibited.\"",
      "It also said there were \"experienced terrorists considered to be very dangerous among the detainees held in IDF detention facilities\" and that \"in exceptional cases there is extended shackling during their detention\".",
      "Several detainees said they had been forced to assume stress positions, including having their arms lifted above their heads for hours.",
      "\"We would be sitting on our knees from 5am until 10pm, when it was time to sleep,\" said Mr Abu Tawileh.",
      "Hamad al-Dahdouh, another interviewee, said beatings at the barracks \"targeted our heads and sensitive areas like the eyes [and] ears\".",
      "The 44-year-old, who worked as a farmer before the war, said he had suffered temporary back and ear damage as a result, and his rib cage had been fractured.",
      "The IDF did not respond to this allegation.",
      "Mr Dahdouh and some of the other released detainees said electric shocks were also used during interrogations or as punishment.",
      "\"The oppression units would bring dogs, sticks and stun guns, they would electrocute and beat us,\" he said.",
      "They would be subjected to beatings and intimidation every time they were moved, Mr Abu Tawileh added.",
      "During these interrogations they had been accused of links with Hamas, the men added.",
      "\"Anyone who was imprisoned\u2026 they said: 'You are a terrorist',\" said Mr Mushtaha. \"They always tried to tell us that we had taken part in 7 October. They all had a grudge.",
      "\"I told them: 'If I am Hamas or anyone else, would I be moving through the safe passage? Would I have listened to your calls to leave?'\"",
      "He said interrogations would go through the night.",
      "\"For three nights, I couldn't sleep because they were torturing me. Our hands were tied and put above our heads for hours, and we weren't wearing anything. Any time you would say 'I'm cold'\u2026 they would fill a bucket with cold water, pour it on you and switch on the fan.\"",
      "Mr Dahdouh said their interrogators told them that whoever is from Gaza \"is affiliated with terrorist groups\", and when detainees asked if they could challenge this in court they were told there was no time for that.",
      "He said he was not given access to a lawyer. The IDF told the BBC: \"Israeli law grants the right to judicial review in a civil district court, legal representation by an attorney, and the right of appeal to the Supreme Court.\"",
      "\"Omar\" said he was taken for three days of interrogation when he first arrived at Sde Teiman.",
      "He said the detainees were dressed in thin overalls and held in a freezing room, with loud speakers playing Israeli music.",
      "When the questioning was over, the men said they were led back to the barracks blindfolded.",
      "\"We didn't know if night had come or morning had come. You don't see the sun. You don't see anything,\" said Omar.",
      "The IDF said it had \"oversight mechanisms\", including closed-circuit cameras, \"to ensure that detention facilities are managed in accordance with IDF orders and the law\".",
      "Omar and Mr Mushtaha said they were then transferred to Ketziot prison, where they described a \"welcoming ceremony\" of beatings and other abuse.",
      "Omar said he witnessed sexual assault at Ketziot.",
      "\"They took the clothes off some of the guys and would do shameful acts\u2026 They forced guys to perform sex acts on each other. I saw it with my own eyes. It wasn't penetrative sex. He would tell one guy to suck another guy. It was obligatory.\"",
      "The BBC did not receive any other reports of this nature, but the Palestinian Prisoners Society, which tracks conditions of Palestinians in Israeli jails, described sexual abuse of detainees held in Ketziot as a \"common occurrence\". This ranged from rape and sexual harassment to the beatings of genitals, it said.",
      "The group said that while it had not received testimony of forced sexual acts between detainees, it had been told some had been made to look at each other naked and had been thrown on top of each other naked.",
      "A report by B'Tselem has also gathered allegations of sexual violence, including from one prisoner who said guards attempted to rape him with a carrot.",
      "The BBC put the allegation that prisoners were forced to perform sexual acts on each other to the Israel Prison Service (IPS). It replied that it was \"not aware\" of the sexual abuse claim or any of the other claims made about treatment and conditions at Ketziot and other prisons that the BBC had gathered.",
      "It said: \"IPS is a law enforcement organisation that operates according to the provisions of the law and under the supervision of the state comptroller and many other official critiques.",
      "\"All prisoners are detained according to the law. All basic rights required are fully applied by professionally trained prison guards. We are not aware of the claims you described and, as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility.",
      "\"Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined and addressed by official authorities.\"",
      "Omar said they were also hit with batons at Ketziot prison.",
      "\"After we got tortured, I was in pain all night - from my back to my legs. The guys would carry me from my mattress to the toilet. My body, my back, my legs - my whole body was blue from beatings. For nearly two months I couldn't move.\"",
      "Mr Mushtaha described having his head slammed into a door, and his genitals hit.",
      "\"They would strip us naked. They would Taser us. They would hit us in a sensitive place. They would tell us 'We will castrate you',\" he said.",
      "He said beatings were \"meant to break your bones\", and that detainees would sometimes be grouped together and have hot water poured over them.",
      "\"The amount of torture was enormous,\" he added.",
      "Both he and Omar also described incidents of what they said amounted to medical negligence.",
      "\"My hands were all blisters and swollen,\" said Mr Mushtaha.",
      "\"If people could have seen my legs they would have said they needed to be amputated from the inflammation\u2026 [Guards] would just tell me to wash my hands and legs with water and soap.",
      "\"But how was I meant to do this, when there was only water for one hour a day [between us], and as for soap, every week they would bring [only] a spoon of shampoo,\" he added.",
      "Mr Mushtaha said he was told by guards that: \"As long as you have a pulse you are in good shape. As long as you are standing, you're in good shape. When your pulse is gone, we will come to treat you.\"",
      "A report by a lawyer who visited both Mr Mushtaha and Omar in Ketziot last September said of Mr Mushtaha: \"The prisoner, like the rest of the prisoners, suffers from pain due to boils on his hands, feet and buttocks, and there is no cleanliness and he is not provided with any kind of treatment.\"",
      "Mr Mushtaha also provided the BBC with a report compiled by a doctor in Gaza, which confirmed he was still infected with scabies on the day of his release.",
      "Omar said detainees were beaten for requesting medical care.",
      "The lawyer noted that Omar needed attention for \"pimples spreading on the skin - in the groin and buttocks due to the harsh prison conditions\" including lack of toiletries and polluted water. \"The prisoner says that even when it is his turn to shower he tries to avoid it because the water\u2026 causes itching and inflammation.\"",
      "All the detainees added they had been given limited access to food and water while in detention at various facilities - several reported losing significant amounts of weight.",
      "Omar said he lost 30kg (4st 10lb). The lawyer said Omar told him food was \"almost non-existent\" in the first few months, though conditions later \"improved a little\".",
      "Mr Mushtaha described food there being left outside their caged compounds for cats and birds to eat from first.",
      "Another of our interviewees, Ahmed Abu Seif, said he was taken to a different prison - Megiddo, near the occupied West Bank, after being arrested on his 17th birthday.",
      "He said Israeli authorities would regularly storm their cells there and spray them with tear gas.",
      "\"We would feel suffocated and unable to breathe well for four days after each tear gas attack,\" according to Ahmed, who said he had been held in the prison's youth wing.",
      "\"There was no consideration of us being children, they treated us like the militants of 7 October.\"",
      "During interrogations he had his nails pulled out, he told us. When the BBC filmed him the day after his release, he showed us how several of his toenails were still affected, as well as scars on his hands he said had been caused by handcuffs and dog scratches.",
      "The IPS did not respond to this allegation.",
      "Two of the men said they had witnessed the deaths of fellow detainees in Sde Teiman and Ketziot - one through beatings, including the use of dogs, and one through medical negligence.",
      "The names and dates they gave of the incidents match media reports and accounts from human rights groups.",
      "At least 63 Palestinian prisoners - 40 of them from Gaza - have died in Israeli custody since 7 October 2023, the Palestinian Prisoners Society told the BBC.",
      "The IPS did not respond to questions about deaths of Palestinians in custody, while the IDF said it was \"aware of cases of detainee deaths, including those who were detained with pre-existing illness or injury resulting from combat\".",
      "\"According to procedures, an investigation is opened by the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division (MPCID) into every detainee death,\" it added.",
      "The abuse continued right up to the moment they were freed in February, some of the men said.",
      "\"On the release day, they treated us brutally. They tightened the handcuffs and when they wanted to make us move they put our hands above our heads and pulled us,\" Mr Mushtaha said.",
      "\"They said: 'If you interact with Hamas or work with Hamas, you will be targeted.' They said: 'We will send a missile directly to you.'\"",
      "Ahmed, 17, also said conditions worsened after the ceasefire deal was signed in January. \"The soldiers intensified the aggression against us knowing we were getting released soon.\"",
      "It was only once the detainees were transferred to the Red Cross bus for transportation back to Gaza that they felt \"safe\", Omar said.",
      "Footage showed some being returned in sweatshirts with the Star of David on them and the words: \"We do not forget and we do not forgive\" written in Arabic.",
      "An official at Gaza's European Hospital, which assessed the conditions of returned detainees, said skin conditions, including scabies, were common, and medics had observed many cases of \"extreme emaciation and malnutrition\" and \"the physical effects of torture\".",
      "Legal expert Dr Lawrence Hill-Cawthorne told us: \"Certainly the use of chemicals to burn the detainee and submerge their head would meet the threshold of torture, as would the use of electric shocks, removal of toenails, and severe beatings. These, or comparable acts, have all been recognised to constitute torture by international bodies,\" as have the use of stress positions and loud music.",
      "The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which conducts interviews with returning detainees, said it could not comment on individuals' conditions due to privacy concerns.",
      "It added that it was eager to be granted access to those still detained - something which has not been allowed since the 7 October attacks.",
      "\"The ICRC remains deeply concerned about the wellbeing of detainees and emphasises the urgent need for it to resume visits to all places of detention. We continue to request access in bilateral and confidential dialogue with the parties,\" it told the BBC.",
      "Fifty-nine hostages are still being held in Gaza, 24 of whom are believed to be alive. The ICRC has never been granted access to them in their 18 months in captivity, and their loved ones have grave concerns over their wellbeing.",
      "For many of the released Palestinian detainees, returning to Gaza was both a moment of celebration and of despair.",
      "Mr Abu Tawileh said his family was shocked by his appearance when he was released, and added he was still affected by his experience.",
      "\"I am unable to do anything because of my injury, because my eye hurts, and it tears and feels itchy, and all of the burns on my body feels itchy as well. This is bothering me a lot,\" he said.",
      "Teenager Ahmed said he now wants to leave Gaza.",
      "\"I want to emigrate because of the things we saw in detention, and because of the mental torture of fearing the bombs falling on our heads. We wished for death but couldn't find it.\"",

      "It was last invoked in World War II, when people of Japanese descent - reportedly numbering about 120,000 - were imprisoned without trial. Thousands were sent to internment camps.",
      "People of German and Italian ancestry were also interned during that time.",
      "Before that, the act was used during the War of 1812 and World War One.",
      "What's Trump said - and what's been the reaction?",
      "Though this is the first time the act has been used by Trump, it is not the first time he has mentioned it.",
      "At his inaugural address in January, he said he would invoke the act to \"eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to US soil\".",
      "In his proclamation on Saturday, Trump invoked the wording of the act by accusing TdA of threatening an \"invasion\" against the US. He declared its members \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies\".",
      "Trump's decision has been criticised by rights groups. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued to stop the removals on the grounds that the US was not at war.",
      "Speaking to BBC News on Sunday, Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU, said: \"There's no question in our mind that the law is being violated.\"",
      "Federal judge James Boasberg attempted to stop the use of the law to carry out the deportations, but the White House said this had \"no lawful basis\", and that the removals had already taken place.",
      "This led to a back-and-forth between the federal judge, located in Washington DC, and the government. Boasberg dismissed the government's response to his order as \"woefully insufficient\", and warned of consequences if the Trump administration had violated his ruling.",
      "Donald Trump hit back on social media, saying Boasberg should be impeached and calling him a  \"grandstander\".",
      "Reacting to a news article covering the judge's original order, El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele wrote on social media: \"Oopsie... Too late.\"",
      "Venezuela criticised Trump's use of the act, saying it \"unjustly criminalises Venezuelan migration\" and \"evokes the darkest episodes in the history of humanity, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps\".",
      "Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice, said in a statement that Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act was illegal.",
      "\"The only reason to invoke such a power is to try to enable sweeping detentions and deportations of Venezuelans based on their ancestry, not on any gang activity that could be proved in immigration proceedings\", she added."

      "The two neighbouring Caucasus countries have agreed the text of a historic peace deal to end decades long conflict over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, but Vardanyan and 15 other former ethnic Armenian leaders are not part of the agreement.",
      "They are on trial in a military court in Baku, accused of war crimes dating back decades.",
      "Vardanyan, a 56-year-old Russian-Armenian entrepreneur, is facing 42 charges including planning and waging war, mercenary activities and terrorism.",
      "A picture of him in court appeared to show bruises on his forehead and there have been allegations of torture, denied by Azerbaijan which insists his rights have been respected in custody.",
      "It marks a dramatic downfall for a man who made his fortune in Russia and once rubbed shoulders with celebrities such as George and Amal Clooney.",
      "He set up Russia's first investment bank back in the early 1990s, and as founder of the country's prestigious business management school \"Skolkovo\" he enjoyed the reputation of a progressive visionary, a Western-friendly voice in Russia's business community in the 2000's.",
      "But a 2019 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project said that employees of his investment bank built a financial system laundering billions of dollars in the mid-2000s.",
      "Vardanyan denied being aware of any criminal activities, and was never legally charged.",
      "He spent hundreds of millions of dollars on philanthropic projects in Armenia, and transformed a quiet town in the snow-capped mountains in the north of the country, setting up a school with the aim of attracting students from all over the world.",
      "\"This school was imagined as an institution that would bring Armenia to the world and the world to Armenia,\" says Adam Armanski, the principal of the United World Colleges (UWC) of Dilijan.",
      "Everything changed for Ruben Vardanyan in September 2022 when he decided to move to Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous region that was historically populated by ethnic Armenians but part of Soviet Azerbaijan.",
      "Armenia and Azerbaijan had already fought two full scale wars over the region, which was internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan.",
      "The first Karabakh war in the 1990s resulted in the expulsion of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Azeris.",
      "Then, in 2020, Azerbaijan - backed by Turkey - regained control of big swathes of the lost territory, while the Karabakh enclave remained in the hands of ethnic Armenian separatists.",
      "Within months of Vardanyan's arrival Azerbaijani authorities blocked the only road connecting Nagorno-Karabakh with the Republic of Armenia, subjecting the region's population to severe food shortages.",
      "Vardanyan renounced his Russian citizenship and became the de facto prime-minister of Nagorno-Karabakh, which Armenians call Artsakh. He used his name, contacts and the ability to speak fluent English to raise the awareness of the plight of Karabakh Armenians.",
      "\"My father did more interviews with international media in three months than all the other Nagorno-Karabakh presidents in 30 years. The amount of attention this was receiving from the Western media clearly irritated Azerbaijan,\" his son David Vardanyan told the BBC.",
      "There had been speculation that Vardanyan had moved there to avoid international sanctions imposed on Russia's billionaires with links to the Kremlin.",
      "The government in Baku considered his decision to take up the position as illegal.",
      "His son insists he was driven by the desire to help local Armenians.",
      "\"We had an argument on our last family holiday, I was completely against his decision, which was putting the entire family at risk. He said he would not be able to live with himself knowing he did nothing for the Armenians of Karabakh.\"",
      "His father's long-term friend Arman Jilavian said even the remotest of chances of helping ethnic Armenians remain in their ancestral land was enough for him.",
      "\"Some would say this was irrational, some say this was super calculated political move. I think none is true,\" he says.",
      "In September 2023 Azerbaijan launched a military operation and took control of the entire territory in 24 hours.",
      "Nagorno-Karabakh's leaders capitulated and more than 100,000 ethnic Armenians were forced to leave their homes.",

      "Azerbaijan arrests former Nagorno-Karabakh leader",
      "Armenians fear another war despite talk of peace",
      "Much of his time since has been spent in solitary confinement, his family says.",
      "He has already been on hunger strike twice, protesting at what he has called a lack of proper judicial process, amid allegations of torture.",
      "Fifteen other former Karabakh leaders are also being tried in Baku's military court for alleged war crimes committed since the late 1980s.",
      "Vardanyan has been dealt with separately, but many in Armenia see all the cases as show trials.",
      "Only the main Azerbaijani state TV channel has been allowed to film the trials.",
      "Azerbaijan insists it is complying with international legal standards, and that it has a responsibility to hold to account those suspected of having committed war crimes.",
      "But last month, the government in Baku ordered the closure of the local offices of the International Red Cross, the only international organisation with access to Armenian prisoners.",
      "The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on the \"unlawful detention and sham trials of Armenian hostages\", calling for their immediate release.",
      "Vardanyan returns to court on Tuesday, but supporters fear his case will be overshadowed by a historic peace deal taking shape between Armenia and Azerbaijan.",
      "The details are yet to be made public but officials say the draft text does not include the issue of the prisoners on trial or the right of ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to return to their homes.",
      "The failure to mention the prisoners has prompted criticism of Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's government at home and abroad.",

    "story": [
      "The sharp fall in stock markets across the world shows no sign of letting up after the US imposition of sweeping and swingeing tariffs and many are asking does this qualify as a stock market \"crash\" and what that could mean for them?",
      "The word crash has been used sparingly over the decades and is usually reserved for a fall of over 20% from a recent peak in a day, or over the course of a couple of days.",
      "On 19 October, 1987 - also known as Black Monday - the US stock market lost 23% of its value in a single day, and other stock markets had similar falls.",
      "That was most definitely a crash.",
      "In 1929, the US stock market lost over 20% of its value in two days - and 50% within three weeks. That was the famous Wall Street Crash that ushered in the great depression of the 1930s.",
      "By comparison, the US stock market has lost around 17% of its value from its peak in February and is now down 2% from where it was this time last year.",
      "The UK FTSE index has fallen sharply though not by as much.",
      "This is partly because it closes earlier than New York, and so it often plays catch up with whatever happens in the US the next morning.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "Nevertheless, these are the biggest and quickest declines we have seen in world markets since they were gripped by the panic of Covid-19 in early 2020.",
      "A decline of 20% from a peak is considered a \"bear market\" - a description of a market that appears to be more likely to go down than go up. We are very close to that description right now.",
      "How does it affect you?",
      "While many people own stocks and shares directly, most people's exposure to stock markets come through their pension plans. There are two types \u2013 defined benefit schemes which guarantee a fixed pension income, and defined contribution where your pension pot rises and falls with financial markets.",
      "That may sound like defined contribution plans are very vulnerable to this sell off \u2013 but not all of your contributions go into shares. Much of the money goes into safer investments such as government bonds. These tend to increase in value when stock markets fall as they are seen as a \"safe haven\" along with other assets such as gold.",
      "That is exactly what has happened here.",
      "Government bonds have risen in value and that can offset some or all of the fall in shares depending on how your pension savings are allocated.",
      "The closer to retirement you are, the higher percentage of your pension pot is likely to be invested in bonds - so the less affected you will be.",

    "summary": "Wigs and beauty contests are big business in Ivory Coast, but the industry is facing change.",
    "story": [
      "Long, flowing wigs and weave extensions have dominated the catwalks of Ivory Coast's massively popular beauty pageants for years.",
      "Contestants in the West African nation often spend a huge amount of money on their appearance, from outfits to hairdos - with very few choosing the natural look.",
      "In more than six decades, there have only been two notable exceptions, the most recent was Marl\u00e8ne-Kany Kouassi, who took the Miss Ivory Coast title in 2022 - looking resplendent with her short natural hair, the crown becoming her only adornment.",
      "Her victory was not only unusual in Ivory Coast but across the world, where Western beauty standards are often the desired look both for those entering contests and for the judges.",
      "Changes are slowly creeping in - last December Ang\u00e9lique Angarni-Filopon, from the French Caribbean island of Martinique, made headlines when she was crowned Miss France, mainly because of her age - she is 34 - and she also sported short Afro hair.",
      "But this year the organisers of the Ivorian competition are shaking things up right from the start.",
      "Wigs, weaves and hair extensions have been banned from the preliminary stages of the competition, which are held in 13 cities across the country (as well as two abroad for those in the diaspora).",
      "\"We want the candidates to be natural - whether with braids or straightened hair, it should be their own. Beauty must be raw,\" Victor Yapobi, president of the Miss C\u00f4te d'Ivoire organising committee, told the BBC.",
      "Ivory Coast is the only African country enforcing the ban for a national competition.",
      "Mr Yapobi said the organisers in Ivory Coast had long been trying to promote a more natural look - for example cosmetic surgery is a no-no and skin lightening is frowned upon.",
      "\"We decided this year to truly showcase the natural beauty of these young women,\" he said.",
      "Other changes have also been implemented, like allowing slightly shorter women to compete - the minimum is now 1.67m (5.4ft), increasing the age by three years to 28 and - crucially - lowering the entrance fee by more than $30 (\u00a325) to $50.",
      "\"This change in criteria is because we observed these young women were putting up a lot of money to participate, and it was becoming a bit of a budget drain.\"",
      "When the BBC joined the first preliminary pageant in Daloa, the main city in the western region of Haut-Sassandra, one contestant was overjoyed by the new rules - feeling it gave her a better chance of success as she prefers not to wear wigs.",
      "\"I would see other girls with long, artificial hair, and they looked so beautiful,\" 21-year-old Emmanuella Dali, a real estate agent, told the BBC.",
      "\"This rule gives me more pride as a woman - as an African woman.\"",
      "The move aimed at celebrating natural African beauty has sparked a lively debate across the country, where wigs and extensions are popular.",
      "As a fashion choice, many women love the creativity that wigs and weaves allow them. They also serve as what is called \"protective style\", which means minimising the daily pulling and tugging on hair that can cause breakages.",
      "This was reflected by some contestants in Daloa who felt the rule removed an element of personal expression.",
      "\"I'm a wigs fan. I love wigs,\" said contestant and make-up artist Astrid Menekou. The 24-year-old told the BBC she was initially shocked by the no-wig, no-extensions stipulation.",
      "\"I didn't expect this rule! But now? I like my hair, and that's OK.\"",
      "The new rule has made the competitors think more about concepts of beauty - and changed some opinions, like those of Laetitia Mouroufie.",
      "\"Last year, I had extensions because I thought that's what beauty meant,\" the 25-year-old student told the BBC.",
      "\"This year, I feel more confident being myself.\"",
      "Should the competition influence attitudes beyond the pageant world, it could have huge economic implications.",
      "Wigs from human hair, which can last for years if cared for properly, can range in price from an estimated $200 to $4,000, while synthetic ones cost around $10 to $300.",
      "Ivory Coast's hair industry is worth more than $300m a year, with wigs and weaves making up a significant share of that market.",
      "\"This rule is not good for us,\" Ange Sea, a 30-year-old hairdresser in Daloa, told the BBC.",
      "\"Many women love wigs. This will hurt our business and we make more money when working with wigs and weaves.\"",
      "At her salon, glue will be used to carefully attach wigs to make them look more natural and women will spend hours having weaves and extensions put in.",
      "It shows how deeply engrained wig culture is in West Africa, despite a natural hair movement that has been gaining momentum among black women around the world over the last decade.",
      "Natural hair products have become much more readily available and natural hair influencers proliferate on social media worldwide with advice on how to manage and style natural hair, which can be time-consuming.",
      "It used to be considered unprofessional to wear one's hair naturally and it would have been extraordinary to see black female TV stars on screen or CEOs in the boardroom with natural hair.",
      "According to Florence Edwige Nanga, a hair and scalp specialist in the main Ivorian city of Abidjan, this is often still the case in Ivory Coast.",
      "\"Turn on the TV [here], and you'll see almost every journalist wearing a wig,\" the trichologist told the BBC.",
      "\"These beauty enhancements are fashionable, but they can also cause problems - like alopecia or scalp infections,\" she warned.",
      "With the preliminary rounds under way, arguments over whether pageants should be setting beauty rules or women should decide such things for themselves continues.",
      "The outcome may be that there is more of an acceptance of both in Ivory Coast, allowing women to switch styles up - between natural hair and wigs and weaves.",
      "Mr Yapobi said the feedback he had received over the new rules was \"extraordinary\" and clearly showed it was having an impact.",
      "\"Everyone congratulates us. Everyone, even from abroad. I receive emails and WhatsApp messages from everywhere congratulating us for wanting to return to our roots.\"",
      "He said no decision had been taken about whether the wig ban would apply to the 15 contestants who make it to the final of Miss C\u00f4te d'Ivoire 2025.",
      "This extravaganza will take place at a hotel in Abidjan at the end of June and will be broadcast on national TV.",
      "\"If it works, we'll continue and carry on this initiative in the years to come,\" Mr Yapobi said.",
      "For Doria Kor\u00e9, who went on to be named Miss Haut-Sassandra, her crown holds even more significance: \"Winning with natural hair shows the true beauty of African women.\"",
      "Ms Dali said she was walking away with something even more valuable - self-confidence: \"I didn't win, but I feel proud. This is who I am.\"",

    "summary": "Gangetic and Indus river dolphins are found in over two-dozen rivers in India.",
    "story": [
      "India's longest and most holy river, the Ganges, is home to thousands of dolphins. But their survival is under threat.",
      "But these aren't like the ones found in oceans. They don't leap out of the water in spectacular arcs; surface for long intervals or swim in an upright position. Instead, they swim sideways, spend much of their time underwater, have long snouts and are almost completely blind.",
      "These are Gangetic dolphins, a species of river dolphin - and India's national aquatic animal - that's found largely in the Ganges-Brahmaputra river system in the northern part of the country.",
      "A new survey finds India's rivers host around 6,327 river dolphins - 6,324 Gangetic and just three Indus dolphins. A majority of the Indus dolphins are found in Pakistan as the river flows through both the South Asian countries.",
      "Both these dolphin species are classified as \"endangered\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).",
      "Researchers from the Wildlife Institute of India surveyed 58 rivers across 10 states between 2021 and 2023 to produce the first comprehensive count of India's river dolphins.",
      "The origins of river dolphins are as fascinating as the creatures themselves. Often called \"living fossils\", they evolved from marine ancestors millions of years ago, say scientists.",
      "When the sea once flooded low-lying areas of South Asia, these dolphins moved inland - and when the waters receded, they stayed. Over time, they adapted to murky, shallow rivers, developing traits that set them apart from their ocean-dwelling cousins.",
      "Experts say the new survey is crucial for tracking river dolphin populations. Since 1980, at least 500 dolphins have died - many accidentally caught in fishing nets or killed deliberately - highlighting the ongoing threat to the species.",
      "Conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha says that up until the early 2000s, there was very little awareness about river dolphins.",
      "In 2009, the Gangetic river dolphin was declared India's national aquatic animal to boost conservation. Steps like a 2020 action plan and a dedicated research centre in 2024 have since helped revive its numbers.",
      "However, conservationists say there's still a long way to go.",
      "Dolphins continue to be poached for their flesh and blubber, from which oil is extracted to use as fishing bait. Other times, they collide with boats or get caught in fishing lines and die.",
      "Nachiket Kelkar of the Wildlife Conservation Trust told Sanctuary Asia magazine that many fishermen often didn't report accidental deaths of dolphins fearing legal trouble.",
      "Under Indian wildlife laws, accidental or targeted dolphin killings are treated as \"hunting\" and carry strict penalties. As a result, many poor fishermen quietly dispose of the carcasses to avoid fines.",
      "River cruise tourism, which has picked up in India in the past decade, has further threatened their habitat. Dozens of cruise trips operate on both the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers.",
      "\"There's no doubt that disturbances from cruises will gravely impact the dolphins, which are sensitive to noise,\" conservationist Ravindra Kumar Sinha told The Guardian newspaper.",
      "Mr Sinha believes that increased vessel traffic could push Gangetic dolphins towards extinction, much like it did to Baiji dolphins in China's Yangtze river.",
      "River dolphins face threats partly due to their own evolution. Nearly blind, they rely on echolocation - high-pitched sound pulses that bounce off objects and return as echoes - to navigate murky waters. While this trait suits their habitat, it also makes them vulnerable to modern threats.",
      "Their poor eyesight and slow swimming speed make river dolphins especially prone to collisions with boats and other obstacles. Adding to their vulnerability is their slow reproductive cycle - they mature between six and 10 years of age and females typically give birth to just one calf every two to three years.",
      "But Mr Sinha is hopeful about the future of river dolphins in India. \"Government initiatives have played a big role in saving the dolphins. A lot has been done but a lot more remains to be done too,\" he says."

      "But if the current economic shock becomes a long-term hardship, and if government programme cuts translate into tangible disruptions in popular services or if Trump's standing in opinion polls continues to sag, members of his own party may begin eyeing the exit signs for the first time in years.",
      "And that would bring an unceremonious end to some of Trump's most ambitious efforts.",
      "Trump, no longer worried about standing before voters, may feel liberated from the immediate political consequences of his actions - but reality has a way of asserting itself in the end."

    "summary": "The Spanish government is moving to make renting more affordable and boost the supply of homes.",
    "story": [
      "Blanca Castro puts on a builder's helmet before opening the door to her kitchen. Inside it, the ceiling has a large hole that is dripping water and it looks as if it could collapse at any moment.",
      "Because the kitchen is unusable, Blanca has to wash her dishes in the bathtub, and she has improvised a cooking area with a gas camping stove in a corner of her living room.",
      "Many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid's Atocha railway station have similar problems. They say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months, since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts.",
      "\"The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,\" says Blanca. \"Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent.\"",
      "Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article.",
      "The tenancy contracts last five years, during which time rent is fixed, but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years.",
      "\"For another home like this [in this area], I'd have to pay double or more what I'm paying now,\" says Blanca. \"It's not viable.\"",
      "She and her neighbours are among millions of Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of a housing crisis caused by spiralling rental costs.",
      "While salaries have increased by around 20% over the past decade, the average rental in Spain has doubled during the same period. There has been an 11% increase over the last year alone, according to figures provided by property portal Idealista, and housing has become Spaniards' biggest worry.",
      "It's also generating anger, with Spaniards taking to the streets to demand action from the authorities to make housing more affordable. On Saturday, 5 April thousands of people protested in Madrid and dozens of other cities.",
      "A report by Spain's central bank found that nearly 40% of families who rent now spend more than 40% of their income on their accommodation.",
      "\"The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,\" says Juan Vill\u00e9n, of Idealista. \"Demand is very good, the economy is growing a lot, but supply is dwindling very fast.\"",
      "Mr Vill\u00e9n offers the example of Barcelona, where rental increases have become notorious. Whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago, that number has risen to 54. Rental costs during that time have increased by 60%, he adds.",
      "\"We need to build more properties,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market.\"",
      "How Spain's economy became the envy of Europe",
      "Spain looks to immigrants to drive economy",
      "M\u00e1laga tourism: 'People feel the city is collapsing'",
      "The central government has described the situation as \"a social emergency\" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand.",
      "This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024.",
      "The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past.",
      "But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control.",
      "At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards \"want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like\".",
      "The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint.",
      "Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028.",
      "The S\u00e1nchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called \"high-tension\" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate.",
      "The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in \"high-tension\" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%.",
      "However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market.",
      "\"On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market.\"",
      "Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers.",
      "The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently.",
      "Gonzalo \u00c1lvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer.",
      "\"There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,\" he says. \"So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked.\"",
      "His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent.",
      "\"The [central and local] governments are not setting any limits,\" says Mr \u00c1lvarez. \"So who is going to? We will have to do it.\"",

    "story": [
      "It was early morning on 23 March when the police came to Yasin Akgul's door in Istanbul \u2013 while his children were still in bed. Just hours before, the Turkish photojournalist had returned home from covering mass anti-government protests. Now he was a wanted man.",
      "\"I went to the door and saw there was a lot of police,\" he says. \"They said they had an arrest order for me but gave me no details. My son was awake, and I couldn't even tell him what was happening as I didn't get it myself.\"",
      "Akgul, 35, has seen \"plenty of action\" in more than a decade as a photojournalist with the AFP news agency \u2013 from war-torn Syria to IS-controlled Iraq. On home soil in Turkey, he has been beaten by the police several times while taking pictures, he says - including on World Peace Day \u2013 and has been detained \"so many times\".",
      "But being arrested at home was a first.",
      "\"A chill fell over the house,\" he tells us. \"In my work, at the protests, I have seen a lot of violence, and tear gas, but having the police in my home, I felt more afraid.\"",
      "Akgul was one of seven journalists arrested in dawn raids. All had been covering the protests sparked by the arrest of the city's opposition mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu \u2013 the main political rival of Turkey's long-time leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "The protesters say the mayor's arrest over corruption charges, which he denies, is politically motivated \u2013 an attempt to end his hopes of becoming the country's next president.",
      "The authorities had banned the protests but had been unable to stop them.",
      "Akgul is facing charges of \"taking part in illegal rallies and marches\". He says the aim is clear \u2013 to stop others taking pictures of the biggest unrest in Turkey in more than a decade.",
      "He was in the thick of it \u2013 gas mask on \u2013 when he took some of the most iconic images of the night.",
      "His photos show a man dressed as a whirling dervish (a dancing mystic) being pepper-sprayed by a line of riot police \u2013 striking images of a battle for the soul of Turkey that went around the world, before landing him behind bars.",
      "\"This message is to all the journalists,\" he says. \"Don't shoot (take pictures), don't speak, don't film. They are making other journalists afraid that if they go back into the field, they could face the same thing.\"  The fact that he works for an international news agency, AFP, makes that message even louder, he believes.",
      "It has been received and understood.",
      "\"After we were arrested, many freelance journalists could not shoot the next day. Everyone was afraid,\" he told us, sitting on his couch at home with his wife Hazal by his side.",
      "Their three-year-old daughter, Ipek, lay on the couch, holding her father's hand. Their son, Umut, eight, listened on, wearing a Harry Potter-style hat and glasses.",
      "Akgul believes those arrested were carefully chosen \u2013 among them seasoned photojournalists. \"They are trying to remove us from the front lines,\" he says.",
      "Plenty of his friends \u2013 fellow journalists - have already removed themselves, leaving Turkey because they faced charges or feared they would.",
      "For now, his family is among many here worrying that they could be torn apart by the courts. The government says the judiciary is independent. Human rights groups say judges are under political control, and Turkish democracy is being eroded, year on year.",
      "President Erdogan \u2013 who has many loyal supporters - retains a tight grip on the levers of power. He says the protests are \"street terrorism\" and accuses the opposition of leading \"a movement of violence\". He has predicted that the demonstrations will wane.",

      "\"The right to a defence, I think, is sacred. It's part of a fair trial that your lawyers should feel comfortable and safe,\" says Ece Guner, who is both a lawyer, and an adviser to the mayor.",
      "\"It would be a lie to say that no-one is worried, to be honest,\" she tells us, \"but we still feel we have a duty to our country to say the truth, to preserve democracy, and the rule of law.\"",
      "Where does Turkish democracy stand now? Some here fear it's on its last gasp.",

      "She expects that the coming months will see continuing attempts to limit the protests, and \"render them invisible\".",
      "That won't be hard given the government's extensive control of the media here.  The huge demonstrations held so far didn't lead the bulletins on state TV and pro-government outlets, and when they were shown the protesters were referred to as terrorists.",
      "The most recent rally - last weekend - attracted several hundred thousand people, at the least. The opposition claims more than two million people attended.",

      "It's unclear if Yasin Akgul's case will go to trial, but the charges against him remain. Despite the danger he hopes to keep telling the story here.",

    "story": [
      "The Nike Air Jordan 1 is, in some ways, the iconic US trainer. It's a popular line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan.",
      "But although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its trainers are made in Asia \u2013 a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of \"ripping off\" Americans.",
      "Nike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer?",
      "It depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.",
      "'Competitive industry'",
      "Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.",
      "But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.",
      "Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.",
      "Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production.",
      "\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.",
      "David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.",
      "\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.",
      "Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.",
      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.",
      "That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",
      "Rahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.",
      "Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.",
      "\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.",

      "Things could change fast",

      "\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.",

      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",

      "A snap election to vote for Yoon's replacement must be held by 3 June.",
      "What next for South Korea?",
      "After months of anxiously waiting, South Koreans have some badly needed closure. The country can now start to repair and move forward, the first step being to elect a new leader.",
      "But the crisis Yoon has unleashed is far from over. Although his military takeover only lasted six hours, the political fallout has only intensified with each month that has passed.",
      "The night of 3 December, when Yoon ordered troops to storm parliament, changed something in South Korea's psyche. It reawakened the ghosts of the country's violent, dictatorial past, showing people that martial law was not, as most had assumed, consigned to history.",
      "Many are still upset by what happened that night, and afraid that the threat of martial law could be brandished again by future zealous politicians.",
      "Today's verdict therefore came as a relief to most, who cheered on the streets of Seoul as the verdict was read out. It is a victory for South Korea's democracy, that for a while looked as if it was on dangerous ground.",
      "The Constitutional Court was damning in its criticism of Yoon's authoritarian power grab, as all eight judges voted to remove him from office.",
      "Moon Hyung-bae, acting president of the bench, said Yoon's short-lived military takeover was not justified, and that he had \"[gone] against the people he was supposed to protect\".",
      "He added that the implementation of martial law \"damaged people's basic political rights\" and \"violated the principles of the rule of law and democracy\".",
      "Already, there are serious calls to change South Korea's constitution \u2013 to strengthen its institutions and limit the powers of the president - to guard against this happening again. However, it will take a particularly patriotic future president to sign off on reducing their own authority.",
      "South Korea more polarised than ever",
      "As Yoon leaves office, he leaves behind not just a shaken country, but a divided one. In the aftermath of that shocking December night, South Koreans were mostly united in their disgust for the president and what he had attempted to do.",
      "But Yoon showed no remorse. He dug in, fought his trial at every step, and continued to dangle the same unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that he used to justify his military takeover.",
      "He claimed that the country and his political opposition had been infiltrated by North Korean and Chinese spies, and that these \"anti-state forces\" had rigged past elections.",
      "Gradually more and more people believed him. To them Yoon is now a political martyr \u2013 the victim of an establishment that had been overrun by \"communists\".",
      "His conspiracy theories have firmly taken root, and far-right extremism is flourishing. Thousands protest every week in the centre of Seoul. They were on the streets on Friday, and will be there again Saturday, claiming the country's politicians and judges are corrupt and elections are rigged.",
      "And these are not fringe views.",
      "More than a third of people now say they do not trust the Constitutional Court which delivered Yoon's verdict; more than a quarter do not trust the voting system.",
      "Within this climate of distrust, South Korea must head to the polls. Yoon's successor needs to be chosen in the next 60 days. These days are sure to be fraught and even more divisive. Many may not accept the result that comes.",
      "Yet South Korea urgently needs a new leader who can advocate for the country as a whole, having been without one for months.",
      "It quickly needs to figure out how to deal with President Trump, having started on the backfoot. His 25% tariffs on cars and steel have dealt Seoul, and its ailing economy, an early a blow, but many believe worse is coming; that it is only time until Trump turns his gaze to the Korean peninsula, and when he does he will try to force South Korea to pay more for its defence and cut a deal with Seoul's arch enemy, Kim Jong Un.",
      "Yoon's legal team has accused the court of politicising the ruling.",
      "\"The whole process of this trial itself was not lawful and unfair,\" said one of his lawyers, Yoon Gap-geun.",
      "\"I feel regrettable that this completely is a political decision,\" he said.",
      "But politicians are calling for unity, asking everyone to accept the verdict, so South Korea can start to move on.",
      "Yoon's political party, the PPP, has conceded, but Yoon himself has not. In a statement he apologised to his supporters for his \"shortcomings\" without mentioning the ruling.",
      "\"I am truly sorry and regretful that I could not live up to your expectations,\" he said.",
      "\"It has been a great honor to serve the Republic of Korea. I am deeply grateful to all of you who supported and encouraged me, despite my many shortcomings,\" he said.",
      "He cannot appeal, as the decision was made by South Korea's top court. But, having repeatedly vowed to fight to the end, he could still refuse to go quietly.",

      "Who is Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's impeached president?",
      "How did we get here?",
      "In an unprecedented televised announcement on 3 December, Yoon said he was invoking martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea.",
      "At the time, the embattled leader was in a deadlock over a budget bill, dogged by corruption scandals and several of his cabinet ministers were under investigation.",
      "Less than two hours after Yoon's declaration, 190 lawmakers who gathered, including some from Yoon's party, voted to overturn it.",
      "Yoon was impeached by parliament and suspended from his duties on 14 December.",
      "He is also facing separate charges for insurrection - making him South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested and charged with a crime - which he will be trialed for at a later date. He is now on bail.",
      "Yoon is not the only South Korean politician to have faced impeachment in recent months.",

      "This is Trump country - the Republican ticket easily won here in November's presidential election by a margin of almost two-to-one. And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans.",
      "Those plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue.",
      "For some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates.",
      "\"I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,\" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. \"But we need to have an even playing field.\"",
      "Miller, a three-time Trump voter, believes other countries haven't played fair on trade. And like many here, she prefers to buy American-made goods.",
      "As she watches over her stock of multi-coloured confectioneries, many of them made in the US, and weighs up how they might be impacted by fresh import taxes, she recalls how decades ago she heard that one of her favourite brands was moving its factories abroad. She hasn't bought another pair of Levi's jeans since.",
      "Miller is unfazed by the possibility of price increases, which many economists say these new tariffs will bring.",
      "\"Sometimes you have to walk through fire to get to the other side,\" she said.",

      "The automotive industry, with its complicated global supply chains, seems particularly vulnerable to the impact of major new tariffs, with companies in Michigan to the north and Indiana to the west already announcing factory shutdowns and job cuts.",
      "But on the outskirts of Delta, there is a cluster of steel businesses that have been here since the 1990s and which may be better placed in a new era of American protectionism.",
      "One of these businesses, North Star BlueScope, has urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium. At the same time, however, it has asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.",
      "North Star BlueScope did not respond to interview requests, but in a back room at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a few local steelworkers who had just finished the night shift were drinking beers together early on Friday morning.",
      "The workers, who asked not to be named, mostly laughed and shrugged when asked about the sweeping new tariffs that were announced by Trump at the White House on Wednesday.",
      "It was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend.",
      "Outside the restaurant, some Delta locals considered the possible upsides of these import taxes.",
      "\"Nobody's frantic. We're not going to lose any sleep over it,\" said Gene Burkholder, who has a decades-long career in the agriculture industry.",

      "Teboho Kobeli, who founded Afri-Expo Textiles and employs 2,000 people in the country, could barely disguise his distress as he told the BBC about the impact of potentially losing a huge chunk of the US market because the prices of his goods will have to increase.",

      "It was based on a philosophy of replacing aid with trade.",

      "Like so much that has come out of the White House in the whirlwind first few weeks of his presidency, Wednesday's announcement has sown confusion - especially, in this case, in Africa.",
      "On the one hand there is Agoa, with its tariff-free arrangement, and on the other there is Trump outlining tariffs ranging from 10% (including Kenya, Ethiopia and Ghana) to 31% (South Africa) and 50% (Lesotho).",
      "Which takes precedence?",
      "South Africa, which exports metals and cars to the US, believes this spells the end of Agoa.",
      "\"The reciprocal tariffs effectively nullify the preferences that sub-Saharan Africa countries enjoy under Agoa,\" South Africa's foreign and trade ministers said in a joint statement on Friday.",
      "But Kenya's Principal Secretary for Foreign Affairs Korir Sing'oei had a different take.",
      "\"It is our considered view that until the law lapses end of September 2025 or unless repealed earlier by Congress, the new tariffs imposed by President Trump will, in any event, still not be immediately applicable,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Kenya, which exports clothes to the US, has tried to put a brave face on the issue, saying that as it was not hit as hard as other textile exporters, such as Vietnam and Sri Lanka, it would still have a competitive advantage.",
      "Whatever happens to Agoa in the immediate term, it seems that Trump's sweeping tariffs have scuppered hopes of the legislation being renewed.",
      "The Clinton-era law, which in the current climate is beginning to feel like a relic of a bygone time, was up for renewal later this year.",
      "Since 2000, certain African countries had duty-free access to the US market for a raft of goods including clothing and textiles, cocoa products and wine, as well as crude oil.",
      "The access was tied to a number of conditions including free market policies, labour and human rights and political pluralism. Thirty-two countries from sub-Saharan Africa were eligible as of last year.",
      "In 2023, two-way trade under Agoa totalled $47.5bn (\u00a336.4bn), with the US exporting $18.2bn billion worth of goods and imports amounting to $29.3bn.",
      "By virtue of being among the continent's largest economies, South Africa and Nigeria have dominated trade under the act, but Lesotho has taken full advantage and has become a significant exporters of garments to the US, supplying brands such as Walmart, GAP and Old Navy.",
      "But a future without Agoa - for Lesotho and others - presents big challenges.",
      "If nothing changes, \"a tariff of 50% sounds like a death knell to the Agoa manufacturing in Lesotho\", says Mukhisa Kituyi, a former secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development and a former Kenyan trade minister.",
      "In 2018, the World Bank modelled a scenario where Lesotho experienced the sudden loss of Agoa privileges and found that the impact would \"reach 1% of GDP\" within two years. The report concluded that impact on welfare would be \"dramatic\".",
      "But, as witnessed with the aid cuts, arguing about the human impact or fairness will not fly in the current set-up, in the face of \"disruptive populism and post-fact, post-truth society\", Dr Kituyi argues.",
      "He thinks countries, like Kenya, that have the new tariffs set at 10%, could still try to hold ground in the US market, with the exporters and their American importers negotiating how to absorb the new taxes without raising prices for the consumer too much.",
      "As Dr Kituyi was involved in trade negotiations, including Agoa, he has seen first-hand the effort that goes into \"fine-tuning these processes\" to create a \"shared benefit from stable, predictable rules-based trading\".",
      "But now, he reckons, such agreements are \"hostage to the wishes of the dominant political group in America\".",
      "Michelle Gavin, a senior fellow for Africa policy studies at the Washington-based Council for Foreign Relations, said the way the new tariffs had been calculated \"makes no sense at all\" to economists.",
      "It is difficult to sort of see \"any kind of clear strategy or intention\", from the Trump administration so far, she tells the BBC.",
      "But the decisions will only exacerbate the loss of American influence in Africa, she warns. China, already the continent's biggest trading partner, could take further advantage.",
      "\"It looks like a withdrawal, an ignoring of an entire huge region of the world,\" Ms Gavin says.",
      "Coming shortly after the Trump administration severely pared back the US Agency for International Development (USAID), leading to the cancellation of both humanitarian and life-saving health assistance, the analyst says America appears to be \"destroying its own instruments of influence with abandon now\".",
      "How were Donald Trump's tariffs calculated?",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Tariffs are yet another example of colossal, upending change",
      "Agoa has long been viewed as an important tool of US soft power, especially in countering the growing influence of China and Russia in Africa.",
      "There has in the past been bipartisan support for it among American legislators, and Dr Kituyi sees this as \"a glimmer of hope\".",
      "A bill seeking a renewal of Agoa until 2041 was released by Democrat Senator Chris Coons over a year ago, but it may not make any progress in the current Congress.",
      "Ms Gavin does not believe that Agoa is now a priority given the global upheaval Trump's drastic and unpredictable policy shifts have created.",
      "\"I think a non-reciprocal trade agreement is a very tough sell for this Congress, which is dominated by the Republican Party that has thus far been quite accommodating of the administration's agenda.\"",
      "She believes that while it \"makes good sense as a matter of policy\", it is unlikely to be front and centre of legislators' agenda \"as a matter of politics\" even if Congress starts to assert itself more.",
      "As Trump's tariffs throw the world into turmoil, the specific needs of the continent are unlikely to be uppermost for others around the world.",
      "If Agoa does become defunct, Africa will have to look within itself and make good on the promises of creating a continental free-trade area. It will also have to work harder to find new trading partners or expand existing markets.",

      "He has even left the door open to normalising diplomatic relations with Israel in the future, telling the Economist last month that Syria wanted peace with all parties, but that it was too early to discuss such a sensitive issue.",
      "His top priority since taking power has been to unite a bitterly divided Syria, and pacify external relations with its neighbours, while he cements his power and control.",
      "But Israel has not made that easy. Its military interventions in Syria are fuelling conflict with both external powers like Turkey, and with internal groups like jihadists in the country's south.",
      "Once an implacable enemy of Syria's former president and his Iranian ally, Israel is also suspicious of Sharaa, a man who once led the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda and whose new government is backed by Turkey.",
      "Since he took power, Israel's military has repeatedly pounded Syrian weapons stores, airfields and other military sites left by the former regime, to avoid them falling into enemy hands, it says.",
      "It has also occupied a demilitarised buffer zone, set up after the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, and has sent forces onto the Syrian side of a nearby mountain, setting up nine bases across the area.",
      "Israeli troops are also making regular incursions into Syria's south-western provinces, vowing to prevent the presence of any armed groups or government forces there.",
      "Earlier this week, the local government in the southern city of Deraa said nine civilians were killed in an Israeli bombardment, during the deepest incursion there yet by Israeli forces.",
      "Another four people were killed in Israeli shelling near the village of Koya late last month, after local gunmen tried to stop the advance of Israeli forces there.",
      "Since then, mosques in both Deraa and Damascus have reportedly called for jihad against Israeli forces.",
      "Charles Lister, head of the Syria Programme at the US-based Middle East Institute, which studies the region, has counted more than 70 ground incursions into south-west Syria since February, describing this as \"an extraordinarily dangerous moment \u2013 and an unnecessary one\".",
      "Since the fall of Assad four months ago, he says, not one attack has targeted Israel from Syria and the country's security forces have intercepted \"at least 18 weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon, and dismantled at least eight formerly Iranian-linked rocket launch sites\".",
      "Many Syrians are disappointed by Israel's response to their new government. They watched for years as Israel targeted the Assad regime, and believed that Assad's fall would bring the chance for a less confrontational relationship with Israel.",
      "Some say that view is now changing.",
      "\"We used to believe that the Israeli army was only targeting Assad's regime forces,\" said Ismail, a restaurant owner in the west of the country.  \"But its continued, incomprehensible bombings are sadly making us think that Israel is an enemy of the Syrian people.\"",
      "Syria is vulnerable because its internal divisions are easily inflamed by regional and global interventions. The roots of sectarian conflict run deep here, nourished by decades of repressive rule by the Assad family, members of Syria's Alawite minority.",
      "Ahmed al-Sharaa's attempts to reassure the country's minorities were interrupted in early March by an explosion of violence in Syria's coastal region \u2013 a stronghold of the former regime.",
      "At least 1,000 Alawite civilians or disarmed fighters were massacred by pro-government forces, after government units were ambushed in a co-ordinated attack led by remnants of Syria's former armed forces.",
      "Those former armed forces were once backed by Iran.  Some analysts believe their remnants may still be receiving some support from Tehran.",
      "Syrians celebrated the fall of Bashar al-Assad as an end to their civil war, and a chance to unite.",
      "But outside powers helped fuel that civil war for more than a decade, and its neighbours are now eyeing the vacuum left by Assad. The risk is growing that Syria will again fall victim to the conflicts of outside powers, played out on Syrian soil."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27lg8vp41o",
    "published": "Wed, 02 Apr 2025 23:06:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Could the National Rally retaliate in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Andrew read this article",
      "Outrage is a precious political currency and France's far right has spent this week attempting, furiously and predictably, to capitalise on the perceived injustice of a court's decision to block its totemic leader, Marine Le Pen, from standing in the 2027 presidential election.",
      "The airwaves have been throbbing with indignation.",
      "\"Be outraged,\" said one of Le Pen's key deputies, on French television, in case anyone was in doubt as to what their reaction should be.",
      "But it remains unclear whether Le Pen's tough sentence will broaden support for her party, the National Rally (RN), or lead to greater fragmentation of the French far right. Either way, it has created a feverish mood among the nation's politicians.",
      "Le Pen and her allies have boldly declared that France's institutions, and democracy itself, have been \"executed\", are \"dead\", or \"violated\". The country's justice system has been turned into a \"political\" hit squad, shamelessly intervening in a nation's right to choose its own leaders. And Marine Le Pen has been widely portrayed, with something close to certainty, as France's president-in-waiting, as the nation's most popular politician, cruelly robbed of her near-inevitable procession towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace.",
      "\"The system has released a nuclear bomb, and if it is using such a powerful weapon against us, it is obviously because we are about to win the elections,\" Le Pen fumed at a news conference, comparing herself to the poisoned, imprisoned, and now dead Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny.",
      "As France assesses its latest political tremors, an uneven pushback has begun.",
      "No clear frontrunner for president",
      "Nervous about the impact the judgement may have for the country's frail coalition government, the Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has admitted to feeling \"troubled\" by Le Pen's sentence and worried about a \"shock\" to public opinion.",
      "But other centrist politicians have taken a firmer line, stressing the need for a clear gap between the justice system and politics.",
      "An early opinion poll appears to show the French public taking a calm line, bursting \u2013 or at least deflating \u2013 the RN's bubble of outrage. The poll, produced within hours of the court's ruling, showed less than a third of the country \u2013 31% - felt the decision to block Le Pen, immediately, from running for public office, was unjust.",
      "Tellingly, that figure was less than the 37% of French people who recently expressed an interest in voting for her as president.",
      "In other words, plenty of people who like her as a politician also think it reasonable that her crimes should disqualify her from running for office.",
      "And remember, French presidential elections are still two years away \u2013 an eternity in the current political climate.",
      "Emmanuel Macron is not entitled to stand for another term and no clear alternative to Le Pen, from the left or centre of French politics, has yet emerged. Le Pen's share of the vote has consistently risen during her previous three failed bids for the top job but it is premature, at best, to consider her a shoo-in for 2027.",
      "Le Pen's crime and punishment",
      "Anyone who followed the court case against her and her party colleagues in an impartial fashion would struggle to conclude that the verdicts in Le Pen's case were unreasonable.",
      "The evidence of a massive and coordinated project to defraud the European Parliament and its associated taxpayers included jaw-droppingly incriminating emails suggesting officials knew exactly what they were doing, and the illegality of their actions.",
      "That the corruption was for the party, not for personal gain, surely changes nothing. Corruption is corruption. Besides, other parties have also been found guilty of similar offences.",
      "Regarding the punishments handed out by the court, here it seems fair to argue that Le Pen and her party made a strategic blunder in their approach to the case.",
      "Had they acknowledged the facts, and their errors, and cooperated in facilitating a swift trial rather than helping to drag the process out for almost a decade, the judges \u2013 as they've now made clear \u2013 might have taken their attitude towards the case into consideration when considering punishments.",
      "\"Neither during the investigation nor at the trial did [Le Pen] show any awareness of the need for probity as an elected official, nor of the ensuing responsibilities,\" wrote the judges in a document explaining, often indignantly, why they'd delivered such a tough sentence.",
      "They berated Le Pen for seeking to delay or avoid justice with \"a defence system that disregards the uncovering of the truth\".",
      "Hypocrisy among the elite",
      "It is worth noting, here, the wider hypocrisy demonstrated by elites across France's political spectrum who have recently been muttering their sympathy for Le Pen. It is nine years since MPs voted to toughen up the laws on corruption, introducing the very sanctions - on immediately banning criminals from public office - that were used by the judges in this case.",
      "That toughening was welcomed by the public as an antidote to a judicial system stymied by an indulgent culture of successive appeals that enabled \u2013 and sometimes still enables - politicians to dodge accountability for decades.",
      "Le Pen is now being gleefully taunted by her critics online with the many past instances in which she has called for stricter laws on corruption.",
      "\"When are we going to learn the lessons and effectively introduce lifelong ineligibility for those who have been convicted of acts committed while in office or during their term of office?\" she asked in 2013.",
      "Reasonable people can reasonably disagree about the court's sentencing decisions in Le Pen's case. But the notion \u2013 enthusiastically endorsed by populist and hard-right politicians across Europe and the US \u2013 that she is a victim of a conspiratorial political plot has clearly not convinced most French people.",
      "At least not yet.",
      "Future of France's far right",
      "So where does this verdict \u2013 clearly a seismic moment in French politics \u2013 leave the National Rally and the wider far-right movement?",
      "The short answer is that no one knows. There are so many variables involved \u2013 from the fate of Le Pen's fast-tracked appeal, to the RN's succession strategy, to the state of France's precarious finances, to the broader political climate and the see-sawing appetite for populism both within France and globally \u2013 that predictions are an even more dubious game than usual.",
      "The most immediate question \u2013 given the slow pace of the legal appeal that Le Pen has vowed to initiate \u2013 is whether the RN will seek prompt revenge in parliament by attempting to bring down the fragile coalition government of Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou.",
      "That could lead to new parliamentary elections this summer and the possibility that the RN could capitalise on its victim status to increase its lead in parliament and perhaps, even, to push the country towards a deadlock in which President Macron might \u2013 yet another \"might\" \u2013 feel obliged to step down.",
      "One person who will now be facing extra scrutiny is Le Pen's almost but not quite anointed successor, 29-year-old Jordan Bardella, who could be drafted in as a replacement presidential candidate if Le Pen's own \"narrow path\" towards the \u00c9lys\u00e9e remains blocked on appeal.",
      "If social-media-savvy Bardella's popularity among French youth is any indication of his prospects, he could well sweep to victory in 2027. He has found a way to tap into the frustrations of people angry about falling living standards and concerns about immigration.",
      "But turning youthful support into actual votes is not always straightforward, and other, more experienced and mainstream figures on the right may well be sensing an opportunity too.",
      "The Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, is widely seen to be emerging as a potential contender. Some even wonder if the provocative television personality, Cyril Hanouna, might become a serious political force on the right of French politics.",
      "Meanwhile, Bardella, like the RN in general, has been on a highly disciplined mission to detoxify the party's once overtly racist and antisemitic brand. In February, for instance, he abandoned plans to speak at America's far-right CPAC event after Donald Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon made a Nazi salute.",
      "But this week's events have revealed that the RN is enthusiastically committed to the distinctly Trump-ian and populist strategy of blaming its misfortunes on a \"swamp\" of unelected officials. Bardella, meanwhile, complained about the recent closure of two right-wing media channels alongside his party's own legal struggles.",
      "\"There is an extremely serious drift today that does not reflect the idea we have of French democracy,\" he said.",
      "It's the sort of language that goes down well with the RN's core constituency, but its broader appeal may be limited in a country that remains, in many ways, deeply attached to its institutions.",
      "To frame it another way, will French voters be more motivated by the belief that Le Pen was unfairly punished, or by concern that the judges involved have since been the victims of death threats and other insults?",
      "As for Marine Le Pen, she has vowed that she will not be sidelined. But her destiny is not entirely in her own hands now. At the age of 56 she has become a familiar figure, fiery at times, but personally approachable, warm and, in political terms, profoundly influential and disciplined. So what next for her?",
      "France has had one Le Pen or other (Marine's father, Jean-Marie ran four times) on their presidential ballot paper since 1988. Always unsuccessfully.",
      "History may well look back on this week as the moment Marine Le Pen's fate was sealed, in one of three ways: as France's first female and first far-right president, swept to power on a tide of outrage. As the four-time loser of a French presidential election, finally denied power by the taint of corruption. Or as someone whose soaring political career was brought to an early and shuddering halt by her own miscalculations over a serious embezzlement scandal.",

    "summary": "Big in Asia, live shopping involves brands putting on live shows to sell direct to shoppers.",
    "story": [
      "After graduating college Kelsey Krakora worked full time in a steakhouse, bartending and serving meals.",
      "She had dabbled with selling clothes online, but only part-time.",
      "But in 2021 that all changed for Cleveland-based Ms Krakora.",
      "She switched to selling clothes on Whatnot and then Poshmark - online marketplaces where people can also use live video to sell items.",
      "\"My first live show with Poshmark was 27th November 2022. I sold zero things on my first show... but that didn't last long!\"",
      "Now she sells around 100 items per show, worth about $1,000 in sales (\u00a3773).",
      "Her shows are on average three hours long and she does between two and three a week.",
      "\"These events are inclusive, welcoming, you can shop in your PJs, and there's no need to head to the shopping mall,\" says Ms Krakora.",
      "Live shopping has been popular in the Asia-Pacific region for some time, where social networks such as China's Douyin regularly host live shopping streams, but now European and US brands are experimenting with this new way of selling their products.",
      "Live shopping is a close relative to shopping channels like QVC, where viewers are urged to call in and buy the products demonstrated by presenters.",
      "But live shopping acts as a quicker shortcut from buyer to product, especially in the era of one-click purchases, made popular by online retailers such as Amazon.",
      "Also, as younger generations increasingly cut the cord and can't access cable TV, shopping channels don't hold the same relevance as they once did.",
      "It's estimated the live shopping market has reached $32bn, with the most active sectors being fashion, cosmetics and collectibles.",
      "A 2024 survey from digital commerce platform VTEX found that 45% of US consumers have browsed or purchased from live shopping events in the past 12 months.",
      "Guillaume Faure, chief executive of LiveMeUp, which provides live shopping video software, remembers when interest in live shopping surged.",
      "\"When Instagram introduced Reels, and when YouTube launched Shorts, we saw live shopping really take off.\"",
      "He's noticed the popularity of tutorials and how-to videos in live shopping events, such as how hosts can teach shoppers how to apply a certain type of make-up, or arrange a variety of flowers to deliver the most evocative bouquet.",
      "However, some analysts think that live shopping is likely to have a limited appeal.",
      "\"Many companies have tried live shopping but it simply doesn't scale,\" says Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research.",
      "\"Maybe it works in China where they don't have the same kind of store density we have in the US, where it's better for consumers to go and try something on rather than watch a host try on a piece of clothing,\" she adds.",
      "Jonathan Reynolds,  academic director of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, University of Oxford, also highlights that the Chinese market is different.",
      "\"In China, so-called key opinion leaders (KOLs) like Li Jiaqi, the so-called 'Lipstick King, are well established,\" he says.",
      "\"Li has carefully built his personal brand to demonstrate his expertise and build consumer trust. KOLs are also working within much more sophisticated platform ecosystems,\" Mr Reynolds explains.",
      "Even Ms Krakora admits that not all products work on a live shopping stream.",
      "For example, she prefers to shop for jeans in-person. \"I'm tall, and I have specific cuts of jeans that I wear,\" she says, \"and there are tried-and-true styles and brands I like.\"",
      "Bruce Winder, a retail analyst in Toronto, also says that for some shoppers, the convenience of live shopping might be too attractive.",
      "\"Consumers may get addicted to the show or channel... and some consumers may not be able to stop watching and spending as they get caught up in the moment,\" he adds.",
      "Despite those potential pitfalls, major brands and platforms have jumped on the live shopping bandwagon.",
      "Nordstrom, Kit Kat, Samsung and L'Oreal have sold products during these streams as hosts showcased new or discounted products, and joining Poshmark as the host for these events are Amazon, eBay, TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.",
      "\"Live shopping lets shoppers have a conversation with someone who knows the products being sold, and that generates a lot of excitement,\" says Manish Chandra, the chief executive and founder of Poshmark.",
      "\"It also creates a community where other shoppers are in the same show, and it's really a different experience than a traditional shopping trip.\"",
      "For some brands live shopping has been a game-changer.",
      "High-end fragrance brand The House of Amouage partnered with Nordstrom in late 2024 to bring their live shopping events to the US.",
      "Oman-based Amouage was following up on the success they enjoyed in China. In the 140 live streams they hosted with Chinese influencers on the social platforms Douyin and Taobao in 2023, they sold more than 3,000 units.",
      "The firm's chief creative officer Renaud Salmon says it's helping the company learn about what its customers want.",
      "\"In the past, we would have used customer satisfaction surveys,\" says Mr Salmon, \"but with live shopping, we get feedback right away and I bring that back to my team to help refine our products.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 03 Apr 2025 23:55:33 GMT",
    "summary": "The EU has enormous economic clout as the biggest single market in the world, but does not want to risk a backlash.",
    "story": [
      "Fundamentally wrong, was how Germany's outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, described the new Trump tariffs.",
      "A unilateral attack - that was the view of Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron called them brutal, unfounded and certain to have a \"massive impact\" on the European economy.",
      "He convened an emergency meeting with representatives of French businesses most affected by the newly announced 20% tariffs on EU goods sold to the US and issued a call to arms to European business \"not to invest in America for some time until we have clarified things\".",
      "\"What message would we send by having major European players investing billions of euros in the American economy at a time when [the US] is hitting us?\" he said.",
      "For France it's wine, champagne and the aeronautical industry, for Germany it's cars, and for Italy it's luxury goods. It's well known these sectors sell well abroad and now risk being clobbered by US import taxes.",
      "Overall, the chemicals, machinery and equipment industries in the EU are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariffs.",
      "But dig a little deeper and there are other EU sectors, reliant on the US market, that could come as a bit of a surprise.",
      "French cognac, generally dismissed as an old person's tipple in Europe, is the booze of choice for many American rappers, playing a prominent role in the music and lifestyle of stars like Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. More than 40% of French brandy is exported to the US.",
      "Spain exports a lot of gas turbines to the US, alongside tonnes of olive oil.",
      "Which EU countries are most exposed?",
      "When we look at which EU countries are most exposed to the US in terms of GDP, the picture is also not quite what you might imagine.",
      "Ireland is highly dependent on the US in terms of goods and services. Those exports - a lot linked to the pharmaceutical industry (which is currently exempt from the 20% tariffs, until the US boosts its own production) and also tech - make up a fifth of Ireland's GDP.",
      "Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are more exposed than the EU average in terms of services exports.",
      "Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia are in a similar position when it comes to goods.",
      "Germany has a greater exposure to the US than the other major EU economies, at over 5% of GDP, followed by Italy (about 4%), France (3%) and Spain (just over 2%). These figures were collated in 2024 by CaixaBank research based on Eurostat figures for the previous year.",
      "Will the EU retaliate?",
      "The response to the new US tariffs is being coordinated at EU HQ in Brussels. The European Commission deals with all overarching trade matters for the bloc's members.",
      "Commission President Ursula von der Leyen claims they hold \"a lot of cards\", including the strength to negotiate and the power to push back.",
      "The US economy is mighty. It makes up 25% of global GDP.",
      "But the EU single market of 450 million people (the biggest single market in the world) stands very close in size at 22% of global GDP.",
      "So, yes, the EU can bite - hard - as well as bark when it comes to retaliating against Donald Trump's tariffs. Especially if, as EU figures have suggested, the bloc targets US services like Big Tech, possibly including Apple, Meta, Amazon and even Elon Musk's platform X.",
      "But that risks a new backlash by the Trump administration. And the EU wants to avoid upping the ante.",
      "If you take politics into account, not just economics, the EU has less room for manoeuvre than you might think.",
      "Take energy supplies, the EU has been buying US liquified natural gas (LNG) after it weaned itself off Russian gas following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Tricky to reduce or heavily tax those imports. That would badly impact EU consumers, not only US industry, and it would worsen already dismal relations with the US.",
      "Think of all the recent rows over defence spending and Ukraine. Aside from the economic hell the EU sees and hopes to avoid in the new Trump tariffs, the bloc also really wants to sidestep a trade war with the country that used to be Europe's best friend.",
      "So, the Brussels plan is: threaten heavy retaliation, hope Donald Trump is persuaded to negotiate, then pray he'll stage a U-turn on tariffs.",
      "The EU's trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, says he's speaking to his US counterparts on Friday. It's an opening gambit. The EU is in no rush to retaliate.",
      "What could the EU offer the US in a negotiation?",
      "The Trump administration has ruled out any country negotiating its way out of the new tariffs before they become live this weekend. But after that, what could the EU offer the US president to persuade him to back down?",
      "Trump is incandescent about the EU's massive trade surplus. It sells far more goods than it buys from the US. The surplus for 2024 was around $200bn (\u20ac180bn; $153bn).",
      "It's the other way round when it comes to services - the US sells far more to the EU than the other way round. That is why the EU thinks its main retaliatory leverage against the US would lie in services, like banks and big tech.",
      "To redress the goods imbalance, the EU could offer to buy more LNG from the US, or more military equipment, following its pledge to Washington to do more for its own security.",
      "But that would break a different EU promise - to boost withering European arms industries by trying to buy EU when re-arming EU countries. It is something the US has already objected to, so that's tricky.",
      "Brussels could also cut direct and indirect tariffs on US goods. It could lose quotas on US agricultural produce.",
      "It would be hugely reluctant to comply with another US ask: to water down its much-trumpeted digital regulations, aimed at limiting monopolies and placing restrictions on speech and content in the EU.",
      "How bad can this all get?",
      "How do you price in the possible collapse of the international trading system, EU officials ask.",
      "European firms fret about their markets being flooded by cheap goods from non-EU countries that are also hit by Trump tariffs and seeking to sell elsewhere.",
      "The risk is very real when it comes to China. Trump is slapping more that 50% tariffs on Beijing when you add it all up.",
      "Would the EU have to ratchet up its import duties on Chinese goods to protect itself and could that lead to an unintended trade war with China?",
      "These are anxious and hugely uncertain economic times.",
      "Which is why the European Commission says it also wants to focus on matters it can control - if EU capitals agree - and that is reducing internal barriers within the EU single market.",
      "Those barriers, such as tax regimes, vary from country to country and impact the EU's overall economic growth and competitiveness.",
      "The IMF calculates they're equivalent to a 45% tariff on EU manufacturing; 110% when it comes to services.",
      "That is far higher than the tariffs now imposed on the EU by Donald Trump.",
      "EU countries say they're united in combating those. So far they've been divided over completing their own internal market."

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "\"Hey, Mr. Wilson!\"\u00a0\u00a0Jay North (Aug. 3, 1951-April 6, 2025), who began appearing on kids' TV shows when he was 5, had already played small roles on \"77 Sunset Strip\" and \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\" when he was cast, at age 6, as the bright-eyed troublemaker in the TV adaptation of Hank Ketcham's comic strip \"Dennis the Menace.\" The series ran on CBS for four years beginning in 1959, but Dennis continued to strike terror in the heart of his elderly neighbor, George Wilson, for years after in syndication.",
      "The stardom came at a cost to the child. He told the Los Angeles Daily News in 1993 that he had been abused by his aunt and uncle, who would be with him on set while North's single mom was at work. \"If it took me more than one or two takes, I would be threatened and then whacked,\" North said.",
      "His other TV and film credits in the 1960s and early '70s included \"Wagon Train,\" \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,\" \"Maya,\" and voice work for \"The Banana Splits Adventure Hour\" and \"The Pebbles and Bamm-Bamm Show.\"",
      "After appearing on stage in \"Butterflies Are Free,\" North had a brief stint in the Navy in the 1970s, and tried to return to show business with more mature, darker roles. Aside from a 1985 Yugoslavian World War II film, \"Wild Wind,\" North's appearances were mostly playing off his child actor past. He satirized his Dennis the Menace role on HBO's \"Not Necessarily the News,\" and played himself in a 1999 episode of \"The Simpsons\" and the David Spade comedy \"Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.\"",
      "He also helped counsel other child and former child actors through the nonprofit organization A Minor Consideration."

      "Commit to What Matters",
      "I had come from a world of higher-end restaurants, of finesse and creativity. So a tapas restaurant was not exactly what I was looking for. But my new partners in Washington, DC, had a clear idea: they wanted to open a Spanish restaurant that was fun. They called it Jaleo, which means \"merrymaking, a joyful celebration,\" inspired by the John Singer Sargent painting of a Spanish woman dancing to guitars. It lives in Boston, but it had traveled on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and they had seen it there. They even painted a reproduction of it on a wall of the new restaurant.",
      "I understood that sense of joy. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like tables. I prefer standing up at bars. If I can, I like to hop around to five different bars and eat good food at each one. Jaleo was a chance to show how I like to enjoy life. These little plates of tapas were also a chance to give people more access to different bites of Spanish food, different tastes of the various regions of Spain. Maybe people didn't know what they wanted to eat, and the small plates would be a way to move a little bit further out of their comfort zones. Of course, it was an opportunity to make a mark for myself. And I could do that while being a kind of ambassador for my country, in the capital of the United States, not too far from the White House and the US Capitol. It felt like an extension of my military service, going from port to port on a historic tall-mast ship, showing the best of Spain to the world.",
      "I knew there were immigrants before me who had brought Spanish food to every corner of America. They opened restaurants, maybe some of them played guitar or danced flamenco. They were mythical places. Tio Pepe in Baltimore. Caf\u00e9 San Martin in New York. Montse Guill\u00e9n's El Internacional in Tribeca, which was short-lived but put Spanish food and drink on the map. There was already a high-end Spanish restaurant in Washington called Taberna del Alabardero, and the more informal Churreria Madrid in Adams Morgan.",
      "Washington at that time was not seen as a culinary mecca, even by the people of DC, and Jaleo opened in a downtown neighborhood, known as Penn Quarter, that was empty at night. But it would not stay that way. It would become a very important part of the city, not too far away from where all the big decisions were made that affected the country and the world. It was a part of the city where senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and business executives would gather. It was the home of new businesses like America Online, and so many other amazing new companies. Slowly but surely, Jaleo became a huge success.",
      "That's not to say it was easy. I was young, just twenty-three years old, and I was still learning how to run a kitchen. The movie in my head cast me as the creative guy, but now I needed to learn how to run the place. Fortunately, I had a wonderful, patient teacher: Ann Cashion, who was the first executive chef of Jaleo, showed me how to do the job properly, even though I preferred the creative side of things.",
      "We didn't really know whether American diners would accept these little plates, or the idea of sharing plates at all. What happened if people didn't want to share? Our waiters were concerned and would often tell me how some people said they weren't comfortable with sharing. I had a simple answer. If they didn't want to share, they could move the plate ten inches closer to them and use their knife and fork to protect the dish for themselves. I wasn't going to Americanize tapas for them. It's what we did in the south of Spain and in Catalonia. They would adapt because it was a fun way to be with friends. Who doesn't want to dig a fork into the plate of the person across the table?",
      "My heart was full of the joy that comes from introducing Spanish food to new people. That joy translated into happy guests eating the dishes I knew. Jaleo was a place where I could share what I knew about Spanish food: croquetas, gazpacho, gambas al ajillo, sangria. But it was also a way to learn more about what I didn't know about Spanish food. I had not traveled all across Spain at the age of twenty-three, nor did I know about all of Spanish gastronomy. Far from it. The reality is that you need to keep learning in any line of work. People say I'm one of the biggest experts in Spanish cooking, but I still feel clueless sometimes. Every time I go back to Spain and discover a new ingredient or a new dish, it feels to me the same as looking at the stars. You can see a few, but how many more are out there that you cannot see? You can read books, and you can travel, but learning is a lifetime of curiosity and discovery.",
      "Sometimes that work can feel less joyful and more of struggle. In particular, in those early days, it was a struggle to buy the right ingredients. Believe it or not, I'm a pragmatic guy. You can support the local economy, buying local fruit and vegetables for instance. But there are some ingredients that cannot be replaced. I observed the success of Italy, where they have been amazingly successful in supporting the small towns where their unique food products are made. I believed we could do the same for the small towns and food producers of Spain. Manchego cheese is like no other. Sweet roasted piquillo peppers are unique. Our olive oil is the envy of Europe, and even gets repackaged under Italian names. Our sherry vinegar is unmatched. And nothing compares to our pure-bred Ib\u00e9rico ham, the very best ham in the world. You can't have Spanish cooking without some of the staples. It was a symbiotic relationship.",
      "Still, importing food is not always easy. There are regulations and policies, rules to protect consumers and businesses. The US Department of Agriculture insists that slaughterhouses operate according to American standards, not European ones, if they want to sell their meat in the United States. They need to be inspected, even though Europeans have been eating these foods for centuries without any problems. It was crazy but also fascinating. Of course, it wasn't just a question of safety; there were concerns that ham from Spain would hurt ham in America. So one day I met a bearded man visiting Washington, and he happened to be a great Ib\u00e9rico ham producer who was investing to comply with US regulations at his slaughterhouse: Santiago Mart\u00edn, the owner of Embutidos Ferm\u00edn. I helped producers like Santiago navigate these challenges with Congress and the administration, finding a lawyer who assisted the Italians in bringing Parma ham to America. Because in reality these European hams were much more expensive than the American hams, and they helped elevate the perception of all pork products in America. It was a win-win for America and Spain.",
      "That's the world of work. Your commitment to your values, to what's important, can turn a seemingly small decision\u2014like buying a type of roasted pepper or a slice of ham\u2014into something as big as international relations.",
      "Your sense of responsibility is what matters. How was I going to be a Spanish chef without all these ingredients? I had to do the work, just like other chefs and importers who made Spanish food available in the United States. People like Tim Harris, who created the incredible Spanish food store La Tienda, and Juana Gimeno Faraone, who started La Espa\u00f1ola Meats. Or Almudena de Llaguno and Steve Metzler bringing Spanish wines to America; and Jorge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, who would walk the streets of Manhattan with a big bag filled with wine bottles, trying to get his wines into a few restaurants. The whole ecosystem of Spanish food people kept me going, and I needed to play my part, too.",
      "So Jaleo became much more than a restaurant; it was a way to build bridges between these two countries, to inspire American chefs to buy and cook with Spanish ingredients, to spread the culture that made me who I am. Something like 80 percent of all restaurants close before they reach their five-year anniversary. Jaleo has now been open for thirty years, and we have new Jaleos in Orlando, Las Vegas, and even Dubai. Because we committed from the first year to what we value\u2014to what matters\u2014even when we didn't yet have all the expertise to make it happen.",
      "I feel a sense of joy when I see Ib\u00e9rico ham, or Spanish anchovies, or wines from the Bierzo region in restaurants and shops. I know that nothing would have happened without the persistence and vision of so many people who may now be forgotten. They built the bridges that will last forever\u2014because they cared so deeply.",
      "Follow what you feel is your purpose\u2014not what others tell you to do. Otherwise you lose your soul and become a commodity. Don't be a commodity. Be true to yourself.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 11:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2.",
    "story": [
      "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2, which will introduce interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers. Pre-orders in the U.S., however, will not start April 9 as expected \"in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,\" Nintendo said, promising to update timing soon.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

    "summary": "A unique talent, Val Kilmer was praised as an acting chameleon who took on varied and challenging roles, and the results were often memorable.",
    "story": [
      "Val Kilmer, the acclaimed, brooding actor who starred in a string of blockbuster hits in the 1980s and 1990s, has died at the age of 65.",
      "Kilmer died Tuesday night in Los Angeles, surrounded by family and friends, his daughter, Mercedes Kilmer, said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Val Kilmer died from pneumonia. He had recovered after a 2014 throat cancer diagnosis that required two tracheotomies.",
      "The New York Times was first to report on Kilmer's death.",
      "A unique talent, Kilmer was praised as an acting chameleon who took on varied and challenging roles, and the results were often memorable. Beginning with \"Top Gun\" alongside Tom Cruise in 1986, he turned in one iconic performance after another \u2014 able to transition effortlessly between leading man and supporting roles.",
      "There was his turn as Jim Morrison in the 1991 Oliver Stone classic \"The Doors,\" and as the quick-witted Doc Holliday in the 1993 Western \"Tombstone.\" He followed that up in 1995 as Batman in \"Batman Forever\" and played a bank robber in Michael Mann's 1995 crime thriller \"Heat.\"",
      "His last major film credit was in 2022's \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" in which he reprised his role as Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky.",
      "Toward the end of \"Val,\" the 2021 documentary on his career, Kilmer said, \"I have behaved poorly. I have behaved bravely. I have behaved bizarrely to some. I deny none of this and have no regrets because I have lost and found parts of myself that I never knew existed. And I am blessed.\"",
      "Kilmer, who attended the prestigious Juilliard School, experienced the ups and downs of fame more dramatically than most. His break came in 1984's spy spoof \"Top Secret!\" followed by the comedy \"Real Genius\" in 1985. Kilmer would later show his comedy chops again in films including \"MacGruber\" and \"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.\"",
      "His movie career hit its zenith in the early 1990s as he made a name for himself as a dashing leading man, starring alongside Kurt Russell and Bill Paxton in \"Tombstone,\" as Elvis' ghost in \"True Romance\" and as a bank-robbing demolition expert in Mann's film \"Heat\" with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.",
      "The actor - who took part in the Method branch of Suzuki arts training - threw himself into parts. For his role in \"Tombstone,\" he filled his bed with ice for the final scene to mimic the feeling of dying from tuberculosis. To play Morrison, he wore leather pants all the time, asked castmates and crew to only refer to him as Jim Morrison and blasted The Doors for a year.",
      "That intensity also gave Kilmer a reputation that he was difficult to work with, something he grudgingly agreed with later in life, but always defending himself by emphasizing art over commerce.",
      "\"In an unflinching attempt to empower directors, actors and other collaborators to honor the truth and essence of each project, an attempt to breathe Suzukian life into a myriad of Hollywood moments, I had been deemed difficult and alienated the head of every major studio,\" he wrote in his memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry.\"",
      "One of his more iconic roles - as hotshot pilot Kazansky opposite Cruise - almost didn't happen. Kilmer was courted by director Tony Scott for \"Top Gun\" but initially balked. \"I didn't want the part. I didn't care about the film. The story didn't interest me,\" he wrote in his memoir. He agreed after being promised that his role would improve from the initial script.",
      "Kilmer vs. the Batman costume",
      "One career nadir when he played Batman in Joel Schumacher's goofy, garish \"Batman Forever\" with Nicole Kidman and opposite Chris O'Donnell's Robin - before George Clooney took up the mantle for 1997's \"Batman & Robin\" and after Michael Keaton played the Dark Knight in 1989's \"Batman\" and 1992's \"Batman Returns.\"",
      "Janet Maslin in The New York Times said Kilmer was \"hamstrung by the straight-man aspects of the role,\" while Roger Ebert deadpanned that he was a \"completely acceptable\" substitute for Keaton. Kilmer, who was one and done as Batman, blamed much of his performance on the suit.",
      "\"When you're in it, you can barely move and people have to help you stand up and sit down,\" Kilmer said in \"Val.\" \"You also can't hear anything and after a while people stop talking to you, it's very isolating. It was a struggle for me to get a performance past the suit, and it was frustrating until I realized that my role in the film was just to show up and stand where I was told to.\"",
      "His next projects were the film version of the 1960s TV series \"The Saint\" - fussily putting on wigs, accents and glasses - and \"The Island of Dr. Moreau\" with Marlon Brando, which became one of the decade's most infamously cursed productions.",
      "David Gregory's 2014 documentary \"Lost Soul: The Doomed Journey of Richard Stanley's Island of Dr. Moreau,\" described a cursed set that included a hurricane, Kilmer bullying director Richard Stanley, the firing of Stanley via fax (who sneaked back on set as an extra with a mask on) and extensive rewrites by Kilmer and Brando. The older actor told the younger at one point: \"'It's a job now, Val. A lark. We'll get through it.' I was as sad as I've ever been on a set,\" Kilmer wrote in his memoir.",
      "In 1996, Entertainment Weekly ran a cover story about Kilmer titled \u2033The Man Hollywood Loves to Hate.\u2033 The directors Schumacher and John Frankenheimer, who finished \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" said he was difficult. Frankenheimer said there were two things he would never do: \u2033Climb Mount Everest and work with Val Kilmer again.\u2033",
      "Other artists came to his defense, like D. J. Caruso, who directed Kilmer in \u2033The Salton Sea\u2033 and said the actor simply liked to talk out scenes and enjoyed having a director's attention.",
      "\u2033Val needs to immerse himself in a character. I think what happened with directors like Frankenheimer and Schumacher is that Val would ask a lot of questions, and a guy like Schumacher would say, 'You're Batman! Just go do it,'\u2033 Caruso told The New York Times in 2002.",
      "After \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" the movies were smaller, like David Mamet human-trafficking thriller \"Spartan\"; \u2033Joe the King\u2033 in 1999, in which he played a paunchy, abusive alcoholic; and playing the doomed '70s porn star John Holmes in 2003's \"Wonderland.\" He also threw himself into his one-man stage show \"Citizen Twain,\" in which he played Mark Twain.",
      "\"I enjoy the depth and soul the piece has that Twain had for his fellow man and America,\" he told Variety in 2018. \"And the comedy that's always so close to the surface, and how valuable his genius is for us today. Still, we battle racism and greed. The same country, it's greatness and it's tragedy.\"",
      "Kilmer's early years",
      "Kilmer spent his formative years in the Chatsworth neighborhood of Los Angeles. He attended Chatsworth High School alongside future Oscar winner Kevin Spacey and future Emmy winner Mare Winningham. At 17, he was the youngest drama student ever admitted at the Juilliard School in 1981.",
      "Shortly after he left for Juilliard, his younger brother, 15-year-old Wesley, suffered an epileptic seizure in the family's Jacuzzi and died on the way to the hospital. Wesley was an aspiring filmmaker when he died.",
      "\u2033I miss him and miss his things. I have his art up. I like to think about what he would have created. I'm still inspired by him,\u2033 Kilmer told the Times.",
      "While still at Juilliard, Kilmer co-wrote and appeared in the play \"How It All Began\" and later turned down a role in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Outsiders\" for the Broadway play, \"Slab Boys,\" alongside Kevin Bacon and Sean Penn.",
      "Kilmer published two books of poetry (including \"My Edens After Burns\") and was nominated for a Grammy in 2012 for spoken word album for \"The Mark of Zorro.\" He was also a visual artist and a lifelong Christian Scientist.",
      "He dated Cher and married and divorced actor Joanne Whalley.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun redeploying staff to respond to the deadly outbreak of measles in Texas, a spokesperson said Monday, a week after steep layoffs at the agency impacted its response to the spread of the virus.",
      "\"A team of three deployed yesterday to meet with county and state officials to assess the immediate needs to respond to this outbreak. The team is meeting with officials again today,\" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said in an email.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first said Sunday that the CDC would be redeploying to Texas at its governor's request, after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak. An 8-year-old girl was the second fatality there this year.",
      "\"Once the assessment is complete, more CDC staff will be sent to Texas per Sec. Kennedy's order and the governor's request. The first teams deployed to Texas arrived on March and returned to CDC on April 1,\" McDonald said.",
      "Multiple agency staff working on the CDC's measles response were among the thousands cut from the agency last week, officials have told CBS News.",
      "A handful of employees at agencies within the department have been brought back to work so far, multiple officials said, at least through the end of the 60 day period before their layoff notices formally take effect.",
      "McDonald did not comment on whether laid-off staff who had been working on the agency's measles response would be among those Kennedy might reinstate.",
      "The ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states has driven this year's tally of U.S. measles cases to the highest levels seen since a large wave of cases in 2019, which was the worst in the U.S. in decades.",
      "While dozens of measles cases are reported every year, usually linked to undervaccinated travelers returning from trips outside the country, health authorities have warned that ongoing community spread of the virus this year is now threatening America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.",
      "There have been six measles outbreaks so far this year, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states makes up the majority of cases. Smaller outbreaks are also ongoing in New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",
      "Details of the sixth outbreak have not yet been released, the spokesperson said, citing patient privacy.",
      "Kennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread",
      "While in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.",
      "Kennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.",
      "In a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"",
      "Budesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.",
      "Campbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.",
      "Clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.",
      "\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"",
      "\"Vaccination will prevent measles, but for those who do get measles, rigorous studies, and not anecdotal reports, will help us to better treat them,\" said Campbell.",
      "Kennedy's embrace of alternative therapies has been contradicted by other health experts, including former Trump administration officials.",
      "\"My children and grandchildren will not die of measles, because they are vaccinated.\u00a0 And there is no substitute, nor any effective treatment, for measles,\" Dr. Brett Giroir, an adviser to the department this year, wrote in an opinion piece published by RealClearHealth last week.",
      "The editorial from Giroir, who previously worked as assistant secretary of health during President Trump's first term, was published before news of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak. In the U.S., a child last died from measles in 2015.",
      "\"One child's death from measles is a tragedy not only for the family and their community but also for our nation.\u00a0 If we can't stop measles, really what can we do?\u00a0 Let's not wait for another tragedy,\" Giroir said.",

There have been cases in at least 21 states, including Texas, California, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico and New York. The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as state health departments and the CDC continue to release data. This map is updated with new data from the CDC on Fridays.",

      "\"Unvaccinated adults can receive the vaccine with doses at least 28 days apart,\" Garcia Carreno said.",

Kennedy Jr.'s cuts to the nation's federal health agencies.",
      "In one example, a planned FDA exercise with a network of veterinary testing labs around the country to ensure they are able to detect the virus in milk has been suspended, due to the elimination of the agency's food safety lab in Illinois, two federal health officials said.",
      "Officials had planned the exercise for 40 laboratories across the FDA-backed Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network, as well as additional government-backed and private labs, which are using different methods to test for the virus.",

      "The department has laid off some 10,000 workers under a plan drawn up by Kennedy and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting task force. The FDA lost around 3,500 full-time employees due to the layoffs, including staff supporting the agency's food and drug safety inspectors.",
      "\"This overhaul is about realigning HHS with its core mission: to stop the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again. Despite spending $1.9 trillion in annual costs, Americans are getting sicker every year, and we must shift course,\" an HHS official said in a statement.",

      "\"HHS also reduced its regional footprint by moving out of the highest cost cities, shuttering offices in Boston, Chicago, NYC, San Francisco, and Seattle,\" the statement said.",
      "Other federal labs have been gutted due to Kennedy's cuts, including U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention labs investigating STD and hepatitis outbreaks.",
      "Another disrupted bird flu effort was at the FDA's San Francisco-area food safety testing lab, two officials said.",

      "The inspections and investigations office will now need to work with FDA's drug, device and food centers to reprioritize their workload for the rest of the year, one official said. That will mean trimming routine \"surveillance inspections\" for more urgent tasks, the official said, like inspections of firms where the agency has been alerted to a safety risk or follow-up visits to ensure that drugmakers or food producers have fixed previous violations.",

The team's work ranged from booking flights to coordinating with the State Department to secure translators needed for inspections of drugmakers and food producers abroad.",

      "The FDA has long struggled to meet its own inspection goals, which was worsened by a backlog created during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to a January report by the Government Accountability Office, the FDA was facing a swelling list of food safety inspections that were on track to miss deadlines mandated by Congress, as they struggled to hire and retain qualified inspectors.",

      "The sell-off began on April 3, the day after Mr. Trump unveiled tariffs on imports from almost every nation, on top of a number of previously announced import duties targeting the auto, steel and aluminum industries, among others. Wall Street economists say the tariffs are likely to drive up inflation because they'll largely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices, which could stall U.S. economic growth and increase the risk of a recession.",

      "The rebound earlier in the day was partly due to investors seeking to buy stocks after they'd been knocked down, seizing the opportunity to buy shares at lower costs, some analysts noted.

      "But the tax cuts were originally passed using \"current law\" scoring, which treats the renewal of expiring policies as new legislation. The House budget resolution relied on the current law baseline and acknowledges that continuing the tax cuts will cost $3.8 trillion. The 2017 Trump tax cuts are set to expire this year, and if they are not extended, taxes will go up for many filers.",
      "House Republican leaders are still barreling forward with the Senate-adopted plan, meeting with skeptical Republicans, while the White House seeks to apply pressure of its own.",
      "Johnson told reporters he was meeting with the House Freedom Caucus Monday night, after the conservative group's chairman, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, advocated for the chamber to move forward on the president's agenda without the budget resolution.",
      "\"It needs to at some point in the future. It doesn't need to be right now,\" Harris said of the resolution's adoption.",
      "Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas also advised against holding a vote this week.",
      "\"They literally produced a budget that will have deficits going up,\" Roy said Tuesday. \"That's what they did. I didn't come here to make deficits go up. The Senate apparently did.\"",

      "\"There are members that have questions \u2014 that's not a surprise,\" Scalise said. \"Our job is to continue answering those questions while moving the ball forward. But it's critical that we advance this agenda, that we don't delay, because passing the budget doesn't end the process, it starts the reconciliation process.\"",
      "Johnson stressed that \"the budget resolution is not the law,\" noting that \"all this does is it allows us to continue the process, begin drafting the actual legislation that actually counts \u2014 and that's the one big beautiful bill.\"",

    "summary": "Small business owner Emily Ley says new U.S. tariffs on China will devastate her stationery store, calling the added costs \"catastrophic.\"",
    "story": [
      "Many U.S. small businesses could face a financial crunch as President Trump's reciprocal tariffs take effect on Wednesday, slapping new import duties on products from almost every nation across the globe.",
      "Some small businesses told CBS News they're worried about the impact from the sharp increase in tariffs that they'll soon be required to pay to the federal government. After paying the levies, they said they'll be left with two choices: raise the prices they charge customers or swallow the costs and take a financial hit.",
      "Small businesses, generally defined as enterprises with fewer than 500 employees and revenue of less than $7.5 million, account for almost half of all private-sector employment in the U.S. But they're also more vulnerable to tariff costs because they don't have the deep pockets or financial flexibility of large businesses, noted Aaron Terrazas, an economist at Gusto, which provides payroll and HR services to small and midsize businesses.",
      "\"For many small businesses, this is a one-two punch,\" Terrazas said. \"They are getting higher prices from suppliers, and their customers are more skittish\" just as they're grappling with heavier tariffs.",
      "Among those businesses reckoning with the added costs is Simplified, an online stationery business that has manufactured its colorful planners in China since 2013. Its owner, Emily Ley, told CBS News that the new reciprocal tariffs \"will have a devastating impact\" on her business, costing her an additional $630,000 in fees over the next year.",
      "On April 3, Ley filed a lawsuit\u00a0alleging Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority in dictating the import duties. Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to impose tariffs and regulate foreign commerce.",
      "\"This additional tax burden is catastrophic to our business,\" Ley added. \"We've already raised our prices as much as possible to absorb previous tariff increases. There's a limit to how much we can increase prices before we price ourselves out of the market.\"",
      "To cope with the costs, she said the company is reducing salaries and scaling back expansion plans.",
      "Recipe for a revival?",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs will revive American manufacturing by incentivizing both domestic and foreign companies to build factories in the U.S. But small businesses, which typically operate on thin margins, generally don't have the capacity to quickly shift their supply chains or build local production facilities given the higher cost of labor in the U.S.",
      "Even large businesses that have the financial heft to move its plants back to the U.S., such as Apple, would require years to build a factory in the U.S., noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 8 research note.",
      "\"Maybe over time, we will build a supplier base, but that takes time,\" Terrazas said. \"But in the interim there is this transition period that is very perilous for small businesses.\"",
      "Not all small businesses can wait that long. Alyssa Chambers, the founder of NOVA Essence Inside Out, which makes candles and other wellness products, said she plans to absorb the cost of tariffs applied to the Chinese-made candle jars and waxes she relies on \u2014 for now.",
      "Chambers said she would reassess her business' pricing toward the end of summer and depending on the state of the economy.",
      "For small businesses, buying from American manufacturers isn't really an option, Chambers added, noting that a U.S.-made candle jar costs about $12 each. By contrast, she can buy a 15-pack of jars made in China for about $20. Although she expects that price to rise to about $40 after the tariffs hit home, it's still cheaper than buying domestically.",
      "Other small businesses simply don't have the option of buying from domestic manufacturers, said Matt Weyandt, co-founder of chocolate maker Xocolatl. Because cocoa is grown near the equator, very little of it can be grown in the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"Despite that, we'll now be paying an additional 10% or more for all of our cocoa beans on top of their already elevated prices,\" Weyandt said. \"This is not going to bring cocoa farming jobs to the U.S. or increase American manufacturing \u2014 it's just going to hurt American chocolate manufacturers.\"",
      "To be sure, there are some small businesses that could continue to thrive even with higher tariffs Terrazas said. That includes domestic food manufacturers or health care businesses that don't rely on imports, such as elder or child care companies.",
      "Skittish consumers",
      "Small businesses are coping with the tariffs just as Americans are growing more pessimistic about the economy, with consumer confidence slumping to a 12-year low last month.",
      "\"In the long term, American consumers are really remarkable. But in the short term, it's hard,\" said Kevin Klowden, an economist with the Milken Institute, a think tank. \"It is definitely different because this is an intent to force a structural shift.\"",
      "But, Klowden added, Mr. Trump is doing so \"by significantly putting pressure on the cost structure of the entire system.\"",
      "Whether inflation-weary consumers will accept price hikes from businesses remains to be seen. If the tariffs aren't reduced, inflation could pick up this year, reaching as high as 4% by year end, up from about 2.8% currently, according to Wall Street economists.",
      "\"This is a moment of elevated risk for the economy,\" Terrazas said.",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Apr 2025 12:18:39 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries go into effect Wednesday. Here's what to know about the import taxes.",
    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump\u00a0announced last week\u00a0\u2014 an import tax blitz on long-standing global trade partners he referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs.",
      "The additive tariffs were unveiled alongside an across-the-board levy of 10% on\u00a0dozens of nations and territories, from major exporters to the U.S. such as China to the British-controlled Falkland Islands, which has fewer than 4,000 residents.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in the April 2 news conference, touting the tariffs as a way to boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with countries he said impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.",
      "But economists note that that in addition to roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses, the tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners are hard to structure.",
      "While the 10% baseline tariffs on all U.S. trading partners went into effect on April 5, the reciprocal levies are\u00a0 set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product-by-product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges for German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But applying tariffs that match other countries' exactly would be an administratively complex task given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products, noted Jacquez.",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app\u00a0on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" he said.",
      "Other experts have suggested that Trump's goal behind the levies is less about driving companies to shift their production to the U.S., or generating federal revenue, than about pressuring other nations to strike trade deals with the Trump administration.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-specific tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs across the board, the White House announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to their trade imbalances with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump on April said his administration would impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations. In calculating the percentage of taxes charged by each nation on U.S. exports, the White House said it included not just levies, but all trade practices on a country-by-country basis that it deemed unfair, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers. Mr. Trump characterized the discounted tariff rates as \"kind.\"",
      "For example, the U.S. said it would match China's 67% rate with a 34% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S. China retaliated last week, saying it would impose its own\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, to which Mr. Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. If Mr. Trump carries through with the threat, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%.",
      "At 50%, Lesotho, an African nation, and French territories Saint Pierre and Miquelon face the highest country-specific tariff rates. Vietnam, where Apple produces some of its iPhones, is subject to a 46% tariff under Mr. Trump's plan.",
      "Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration, anticipated that the White House would \"come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods.\"",
      "As a result, the U.S. would tax some other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours, in a scenario Jacquez predicted would lead to retaliation against the U.S.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\" a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",
      "Simon MacAdam, deputy chief global economist with Capital Economics, anticipated that likely targets would include leading U.S. trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam. In 2024, the largest U.S. trade deficits around the globe \u2014 meaning countries from which the U.S. imports more than it exports \u2014 were with the following nations, according to federal data:",

      "Sweden ($9.8 billion)",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs likely to drive up consumer prices?",
      "While the levies have not yet gone into effect, experts say any reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices\u00a0as companies look to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "Consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply for products for which there are no comparable substitutes.",
      "\"The more price-insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",
      "Prices could also fall later on, if Mr. Trump lowers or removes reciprocal tariffs following trade negotiations, he noted.",

      "What are the new Mega Millions odds?",
      "In exchange for the higher price, the game boasts better odds for winning. While the odds for winning any prize have improved from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23, the chances of winning the big prize are still astronomical: going from 1 in 302,575,350 to 1 in 290,472,336.

      "The size of the prizes are also changing. The jackpot will be a minimum of $50 million, up from $20 million.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",

      "As markets fall, and with his\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0set to take effect on Wednesday, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "No pause in tariffs",
      "During a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Trump confirmed on Monday that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs. When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",

      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",

We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on Sunday on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",

      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday. Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street Monday, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",

      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday to raise duties imposed on China to 50% beginning Wednesday, after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase by Tuesday or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",

    "story": [
      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his\u00a0Wednesday remarks.",
      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "China retaliated last week by saying it planned to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products. On April 7, Mr. Trump shot back at China by saying he plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on its imports if the Asian nation doesn't withdraw its plan to add retaliatory import duties.",
      "If Mr. Trump carries through with that threat, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When will these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries likely to retaliate against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "For now, other countries are taking a more measured approach in their response. European Union trade chief Maros Sefcovic is scheduled to meet with U.S. officials on Friday after Mr. Trump hit the 27-nation bloc with a 20% tariff.",

Other Wall Street leaders are also starting to express tariff-related concerns, including billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.",
      "While many corporate leaders have been notably silent around Mr. Trump's trade policies, Wall Street executives this week spoke critically of the Trump administration's range of tariffs, some of which went into effect over the weekend, following the loss of trillions of value in last week's stock market rout.",
      "In his annual\u00a0letter to shareholders Monday, Dimon warned that Mr. Trump's \"tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession.\" Dimon's remarks come after he said in January that Americans should \"get over\" concerns about the effects of tariffs.",
      "Dimon, who heads the largest U.S. bank, added in his shareholder letter that while the economy is weakening, stock market \"prices remain relatively high.\" While Dimon did not criticize Mr. Trump directly, he noted that the tariffs would have \"short-term effects\" including anticipated higher prices on both domestic and imported goods.",
      "Such conditions could lead to what's known as stagflation \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" \u2014 which describes economic periods when growth slows even as prices remain painfully high. Inflation typically eases when the economy contracts.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" Dimon said.",
      "He said potential retaliatory actions by other nations are weighing on confidence, and said unequivocally that the \"quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse.\"",
      "\"Economic nuclear war\"",
      "A chorus of other high-profile Wall Street executives echoed Dimon's remarks, with some sharply criticizing the White House's recent tariff actions. Many corporate leaders have thus far been reluctant to openly criticize the Trump Administration's agenda.",
      "Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, said on X Sunday that \"by placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.\"",
      "Ackman said that the\u00a0reciprocal tariffs slated to go into effect on dozens of countries April 9 would be tantamount launching \"economic nuclear war on every country in the world.\"",
      "As a result, \"business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Some of the new tariffs announced by President Trump earlier this week went into effect Saturday, triggering customs agents' collections at ports of entry across the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump, in a post on Truth Social on Saturday, urged Americans to \"hang tough,\" calling the implementation of tariffs an \"economic revolution.\"",
      "\"We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,\" he said, adding, \"It won't be easy but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump unveiled two new tariffs \u2013 a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and so-called reciprocal tariffs applied to imports from about 90 nations. He said they would revitalize American manufacturing, create jobs and generate federal revenue.",
      "Countries targeted by Mr. Trump for higher tariffs are due to go into effect on Wednesday. Those include assessments as high as 50% for Lesotho, 49% for Cambodia and 47% for Madagascar.",

    "story": [
      "Financial markets landed with a thud Friday as stocks tumbled for a second straight day on concerns about the economic fallout from new U.S. tariffs and the prospects of a global trade war.",
      "President Trump's announcement of steep tariffs on Wednesday shocked investors and sent economists scurrying to revise downward their forecasts for U.S. economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell also warned that the levies \u2014 which include a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and \"reciprocal\" tariffs on nearly 90 countries \u2014 are likely to dent the economy.",
      "\"While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,\" Powell\u00a0said in a speech Friday in Arlington, Virginia. \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\"",
      "The S&P 500 fell 322 points, or nearly 6%, to close at 5,074 \u2014 the largest one-day slump in the broad-based index since March 16, 2020, when it lost 12%. Today's plunge erased $2.7 trillion in market value from the index. The decline wipes out more than a year of stock market gains, taking the S&P 500 back to its levels in February 2024.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2,231 points, or 5.5%, and is down 14% since peaking in February. The Nasdaq Composite slid 963 points, or 5.8%. That means the the tech-heavy index is now in a bear market, or when stocks drop at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "Tech stocks have flailed this week because of concerns that American tariffs on China \u2014 along with countermeasures from Beijing \u2014 will hurt the high-tech sector, which has been key to driving corporate profits.",
      "\"The economic pain that will be brought by these tariffs [is] hard to describe and can essentially take the U.S. tech industry back a decade in the process while China steamrolls ahead,\" Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said in a report.",
      "Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, told clients that the U.S. could tip into a recession later this year unless the U.S. moves to ease tariffs.",
      "\"In the near term, we believe the effective tariff rates could be higher still, and without President Trump taking active steps to reduce tariffs over the next three to six months, we are likely to enter a downside scenario, including a meaningful U.S. recession and lower equity markets,\" he said in a research note.",
      "The free-fall amounts to the biggest two-day drop for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq since March 2020, when the pandemic began, and has wiped out trillions of dollars in investor wealth.",
      "Drops of this magnitude aren't unheard of on Wall Street, but they're rare. Over the last 25 years, the S&P 500 has fallen 4% in a single day 38 times, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist for brokerage firm LPL Financial.",
      "Overseas markets also slid Friday. In overnight trading in Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 dropped 2.8%, while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%. In European trading, Germany's DAX lost 2%, France's CAC 40 in Paris dipped 1.6% and Britain's FTSE 100 shed 1.7%.",
      "U.S. growth downgraded",
      "Economists have downgraded their outlook for U.S. economic growth this year as Mr. Trump piles tariffs on a growing list of countries, warning that the levies are likely to boost inflation. That could reduce consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, as well as crimp business investment.",
      "Import taxes are largely borne by businesses, which typically pass on part or much of those added costs to consumers. As a result, Americans could face higher prices for electronics, household appliances, cars, clothing, furniture, and food such as coffee and chocolate, according to economists.",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said\u00a0Friday.",
      "According to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research firm, the Trump administration's tariffs could cost U.S. households more than $1,900 this year.",
      "David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, thinks U.S. trade officials will eventually lower tariff rates as they negotiate with their counterparts abroad. But that process is likely to take time, and the investment bank doesn't expect a speedy reversal in U.S. tariffs. As a result, UBS economists have lowered their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to less than 1%.",
      "China strikes back",
      "Investors are also nervously watching as the barrage of U.S. tariffs prompts retaliation from key trading partners. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014 materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose trade sanctions on 27 additional U.S. companies.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "In more upbeat news for financial markets, U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in March, far exceeding analyst forecasts. The nation's unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, versus 4.1% in February.",
      "Yet while job growth was robust last month, experts say the government's latest hiring numbers don't reflect the impact of the Trump administration's trade policies on the economy.",

    "summary": "As world leaders wrung their hands over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff announcements, Argentine president Javier Milei was feted at Mar-a-Lago.",
    "story": [
      "Europe vowed retaliation. China plotted tariffs of its own. Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "As part of his enthusiastic outreach to Mr. Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Mr. Trump, who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \"American Patriot\" gala.",
      "\"Make Argentina Great Again!\" Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.",
      "It would have been the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders since Mr. Trump's election victory last November as President Milei, who has imposed a sweeping austerity program to fix Argentina's long troubled economy, offers himself as one of Mr. Trump's strongest allies in the global culture war against the \"woke\" left.",
      "Whether Milei's staunch alliance with Mr. Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.",
      "\"He has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\" said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \"He hasn't managed to do that yet.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit.",
      "He threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Mr. Trump did. He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Mr. Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. He even promoted a cryptocurrency token echoing the $Trump memecoin \u2014 at great political cost. In Milei's case, the cryptocoin Libra collapsed and left investors holding the bag, to the tune of $250 million. He later admitted that he posted about the coin without properly vetting the details.",
      "Milei has also slashed government spending, similarly to what Mr. Trump and Elon Musk have done with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has reduced government spending in Argentina by over 30% since taking office in 2023 by eliminating about a dozen government agencies, laying off 10% of the federal workforce and freezing state wages and pensions. While the cuts have lowered the country's hyperinflation, they have pushed up unemployment and poverty rates. Weekly protests have been held criticizing the cuts.",
      "The cuts were something Milei promised while running for office, even wielding a chainsaw during his campaign. He then gifted Musk\u00a0a giant chainsaw modeled\u00a0after the power tool. Musk waved the chainsaw during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "Railing against socialism and feminism at speaking events all over the world \u2014 including at CPAC \u2014 Milei has fashioned himself into something of a MAGA celebrity.",
      "Argentinian government reacts to Trump tariffs",
      "While U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Mr. Trump's tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Mr. Trump's pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.",
      "\"As you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\" Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president's name as he spoke in Spanish.",
      "In Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Mr. Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.",
      "\"We do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\" Milei's spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Mr. Trump's announcement. \"I don't see why there should be so much concern about this.\"",
      "For all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina's largest-circulation daily, Clar\u00edn, declared: \"Trump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\"",
      "In Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \"highly productive\" meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.",
      "Milei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves.",
      "Milei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front.",
      "It was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund's biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \"an informal meeting\" with Mr. Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018.",
      "But on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Mr. Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet.",
      "The president's office said nothing about his meeting \u2014 or, non-meeting \u2014 with Mr. Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn't say whether he and Milei met.",
      "Major Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.",
      "\"When I woke up, I thought I'd find on TV the photo-op with your 'friend' Trump that you went looking for,\" left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner wrote on social media. \"What a way to mess around and spend money on nothing.\"",

      "When announcing his latest round of tariffs on April 2, President Trump veered into the subject of eggs, noting that prices \"dropped now 59%, and they're going down more, and the availability is fantastic.\"",
      "Wholesale egg prices \u2014 or the price paid by large buyers like grocery stores \u2014 have declined 43% since year start, with much of the decline occurring since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. While retail data for March isn't yet available, grocery stores tell CBS MoneyWatch that lower prices are now starting to trickle down to consumers, and that there should be plenty of eggs available for Easter and Passover later this month.",
      "Lower egg prices may represent a bright point for consumers at a time when inflation remains sticky, and\u00a0may reignite\u00a0this year due Mr. Trump's tariffs, economists say. The new levies are set to hit all imports from food products to automobiles. Egg prices have declined partly due to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's five-point plan to tackle the issue, which includes battling the bird flu and importing eggs\u00a0from nations including Turkey and South Korea.",
      "Egg prices at Northeast grocery chain Stew Leonard's have declined recently, with conventional eggs now down to to about $5.99 a dozen from $10 a dozen at their peak in December, said Andrew Hollis, director of sales.",
      "\"We're definitely back to low price eggs again \u2014 there's lot of relief and plenty of supply,\" Hollis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our demand will go up 40% for Easter, so we're not worried at all and feel like we'll have plenty of eggs on the shelf.\"",
      "Demand for eggs also fell due to the high retail prices at the end of 2024, which caused some households to cut back on buying them, Hollis added. That's allowed farmers to rebuild their supply, he said.",
      "Walmart, one of the nation's biggest grocers, also said that its egg prices have declined in recent weeks, although it didn't specify the decline. A dozen eggs are retailing for about $5 a dozen, according to Walmart's website.",

The nations will face tariffs of 10% and 25%, respectively. Those taxes are likely to be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday said he would sign another executive order to delay enforcement of a law that effectively bans TikTok, amid talks about a possible deal to sell the widely popular platform.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0signed an executive order on his first day directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days. The order instructed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against \"any entity for any noncompliance.\" The executive order expires Saturday, April 5.",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday he wouldn't enforce the law for at least another 75 days.",
      "\"My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed,\" the president wrote. \"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark.' We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\"",
      "A deal had been reached Wednesday between investors, TikTok's Beijing-based parent company ByteDance and the U.S. government that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, according to a source familiar with the plans. The deal allowed ByteDance to keep a minority stake, and Mr. Trump planned to sign an order approving the deal and allowing for a 120-day closing period.",
      "But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House on Thursday that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, ByteDance, originally had until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services.",
      "TikTok\u00a0briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action.",
      "Apple and Google did not\u00a0restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores for nearly a month after Mr. Trump issued the first directive.",
      "Even though Mr. Trump has declined to enforce the ban, the law is still on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. But the law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok in the event of a sale.",
      "When TikTok challenged the law last year, it argued that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government previously vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user.",
      "In a statement after Mr. Trump's announcement Friday, a ByteDance spokesperson acknowledged the company has been in discussions with the U.S. government about \"a potential solution.\"",
      "\"An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested last month he could ease tariffs on the Chinese if they approved the deal.",
      "\"Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,\" the president said on March 27. \"Every point in tariffs is worth more than TikTok.\"",
      "But on Wednesday he announced he would impose a 34% additional tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S.",
      "Lawmakers, however, are likely to be dissatisfied if any deal does not fully sever ties between ByteDance and TikTok.",
      "\"If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\" Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China Committee, said last month.",
      "He said a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm runs afoul of the law because ByteDance would still have access to user data.",
      "\"This setup reeks of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 in 2023, through the failed Project Texas, ByteDance tried to create the illusion of better data privacy by storing Americans' data on U.S. servers, all while ByteDance kept its grip on the platform. On the surface, shifting data storage to the United States might have seemed like a reasonable fix, but it ignored the real issue: ByteDance's control over TikTok,\" Moolenaar\u00a0wrote in an opinion piece in the National Review last month.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. But the Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Moolenaar and Republican members of the China committee said in a statement Friday that they \"stand firm\" in their position.",
      "\"Any resolution must ensure that U.S. law is followed, and that the Chinese Communist Party does not have access to American user data or the ability to manipulate the content consumed by Americans,\" they said. \"We remain committed to enforcing the framework established by Congress to safeguard the American people.\"",
      "During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last year, then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who's now secretary of state, explained that U.S. officials viewed TikTok as a national security threat because the algorithm that powers the platform is controlled by a China-based company. The Chinese government, he said, could force TikTok to give it access to the data it collects on tens of millions of Americans or use it to push propaganda to them.",
      "\"TikTok does not work without that algorithm, and that algorithm is controlled by a company that's controlled by the Chinese Communist Party under the law of China,\" Rubio said.",
      "Three Democratic senators\u00a0wrote to Mr. Trump in March asking him to work with Congress to find a long-term solution to TikTok's survival.

    "summary": "U.S. Fed Chair Jerome Powell says the Trump administration's expansive new tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation and slower growth.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's expansive new tariffs will likely lead to higher inflation and slower growth, and the Federal Reserve will focus on keeping price increases temporary, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Friday.",
      "The Fed chair's remarks come two days after Trump unveiled\u00a0sweeping tariffs that have upended the global economy and sent stock prices in the U.S. and overseas plunging, with investors nervously watching as key trading partners retaliate. China on Friday said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, the day after Mr. Trump's new tariffs go into effect.",
      "In written remarks delivered in Arlington, Virginia, Powell said that the tariffs and their impacts on the economy and inflation are \"significantly larger than expected.\" He also said that the import taxes are \"highly likely\" to lead to \"at least a temporary rise in inflation,\" but added that \"it is also possible that the effects could be more persistent.\"",
      "\"Looking ahead, higher tariffs will be working their way through our economy and are likely to raise inflation in coming quarters,\" Powell said. \"Our obligation is to ... make certain that a one-time increase in the price level does not become an ongoing inflation problem,\" he added.",
      "Powell's focus on inflation suggests that the Fed will likely keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged at about 4.3% in the coming months. That is likely to disappoint Wall Street investors, who now expect five interest rate cuts this year, a number that has increased since President Donald Trump announced the tariffs Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Friday, in a post on his social media platform Truth Social, urged Powell to cut rates, writing that now would be the \"PERFECT time\" to do it. The president went on to criticize the Fed chair as \"always 'late,'\" adding that \"he could now change his image, and quickly.\"",
      "Economists forecast that the tariffs will weaken the economy, possibly threaten hiring, and push up prices. In that scenario, the Fed could cut rates to bolster the economy, or it could keep rates unchanged \u2014 or even hike them \u2014 to combat inflation. Powell's comments suggest the Fed will mostly focus on inflation.",
      "\"At the Fed, we are squarely focused on achieving the dual-mandate goals Congress has given us of maximum employment and stable prices,\" said Powell. \"While uncertainty is high and downside risks have risen, the economy is still in a good place. The incoming data show solid growth, a labor market in balance, and inflation running much closer to, but still above, our 2% objective.\"",
      "Tricky combination",
      "Weaker growth and higher prices are a tricky combination for the Fed. Typically the central bank would reduce its key interest rate to lower borrowing costs and spur the economy in the event of slower growth, while it would raise rates \u2014 or keep them elevated \u2014 to slow spending and combat inflation.",
      "\"We are closely watching this tension between the hard and soft data,\" said Powell. \"As the new policies and their likely economic effects become clearer, we will have a better sense of their implications for the economy and for monetary policy.\"",
      "Some positive news arrived Friday when the government reported that hiring accelerated in March, with\u00a0228,000 jobs added, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, from 4.1%.",
      "Yet those figures measure hiring in mid-March, before the scope of the duties became clear. The tariffs have also raised uncertainty about how the economy will fare in the coming months, which could limit businesses' willingess to invest and hire.",
      "\"The Fed is in a tough spot with inflation set to accelerate and the economy poised to slow,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide.",

    "summary": "Economists say that President Trump's wide-ranging new tariffs raise the risk of a recession or stagflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is promising that his April 2 \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0volley of tariffs will \"make America wealthy again\" by repatriating manufacturing jobs and reviving demand for American-made products. But many economists are taking a different view, warning that the tariffs could lead to more dire economic scenarios, including a recession or stagflation.",
      "Mr. Trump has said the two new tariffs he unveiled Wednesday \u2014 a 10% universal duty on all U.S. imports and so-called\u00a0reciprocal tariffs\u00a0applied to imports from about 90 nations \u2014 will revitalize American manufacturing, create jobs and generate federal revenue.",
      "But economists are ringing alarm bells as they digest the impact of the wide-ranging tariffs, which they forecast will accelerate inflation and dampen U.S. economic growth. That's because Mr. Trump's tariffs will be paid by U.S. businesses that import goods and materials from other countries, and they are likely to pass on some or all of those costs to consumers through higher prices.",
      "As a result, experts say, inflation is likely to reignite, which could cause some U.S. households to back on spending. Because consumer spending accounts for about 70 cents of every $1 in GDP, economic growth could slow.",
      "Together, those outcomes could create \"stagflation,\" a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" that describes periods when economic growth falters even as prices remain painfully high.",
      "The risks of recession\u00a0\u2014 a downturn that includes at least two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the nation's gross domestic product \u2014 are also rising due to Mr. Trump's latest tariffs, according to new estimates from several Wall Street economists.",
      "If the fresh U.S. tariffs spur retaliatory measures from other nations, \"serious recessions\" could emerge both in the U.S. and globally, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. A U.S. recession would likely reduce GDP by 2% and boost unemployment next year to 7.5%, up from its current rate of 4.1%, he estimated.",
      "On Friday, China announced it would implement a 34% retaliatory tariff on U.S. imports beginning April 10, a day after Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs are slated to go into effect.",
      "Still, for now that scenario remains unlikely, with Zandi assigning it a 15% probability. If the Trump administration drops some tariffs and offers exemptions for some products or nations, a recession would be more mild, with unemployment topping out at 5.5%, he added. Zandi said he is giving a 35% probability to this outcome.",
      "To be sure, while many economists are raising the likelihood of a recession, they also say the economy remains relatively strong, with low unemployment and steady growth. Much depends on whether the Trump administration sticks with its tariffs or eases up on some policies.",
      "Brace for higher inflation",
      "More certain is that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation, noted Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY. Consumer prices could accelerate by 1 percentage point by year-end, he added, which would boost the inflation rate close to 4% from its current level.",
      "That could prove painful for many Americans, including for supporters of Mr. Trump who backed his candidacy because of his promises to \"end the inflation nightmare\" of the post-pandemic years. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll,\u00a0 most Americans said the president has focused too much on\u00a0tariffs, which they fear could end up raising prices, and not enough on lowering consumer costs.",
      "A hike in inflation from Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs could add $1,000 in annual costs for low-income households, Daco estimated. Products ranging from Apple's iPhones, which are largely manufactured in China, to clothing made in Vietnam could spike in price due to the reciprocal tariffs, with those nations facing rates of 34% and 46%, respectively.",
      "However, other estimates predict a bigger hit to Americans' budgets, with the Yale Budget Lab forecasting that the April 2 tariffs will cost a typical household about $2,148.",
      "\"With the most significant tariff increases targeting countries central to the U.S. supply chain for consumer goods \u2014 China, Vietnam, Taiwan and Cambodia \u2014 households should expect higher prices across a wide range of everyday items,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.",
      "Here's what other top economists are predicting",
      "Oxford Economics: \"[T]he announced tariffs will significantly raise the effective U.S. tariff rate to slightly less than 30%, matching levels not seen since the 1930s .... Oxford Economics' Global Economic Model [forecasts] U.S. GDP growth at 1.4% and core inflation rising to 3.9% this year.\" \u2014Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist",
      "PNC Financial Services: \"The U.S. economy is in good shape at the start of the second quarter, but the ongoing trade war has increased the risk of near-term recession dramatically.\" \u2014Economist Ershang Liang",
      "Nationwide: \"[W]e revise down our real GDP growth estimate to a range of zero \u20130.5% Q4/Q4 2025 (previously we forecast 1% \u2013 1.5% growth, while significant retaliation by our trading partners could tip GDP growth negative and result in a recession.\" \u2014Chief economist Kathy Bostjancic",
      "Capital Economics: \"[W]e see U.S. GDP growth slowing to around 1.5% annualized, but the risks are to the downside and we would put the odds of a recession at about 30%. U.S. CPI inflation now looks set to jump to around 4.5% later this year.\" \u2014Its global economics team",
      "Deutsche Bank: \"[T]hese actions could potentially shave 1 - 1.5 [percentage points] from growth this year and add a broadly similar amount to core PCE inflation .... Recession risks will likely rise materially if these tariffs are sustained.\" \u2014Economics team",

That hemorrhaging of stock values continued in Asian and European markets Friday as China announced its retaliation \u2014 becoming the first country to do so since Mr. Trump made his announcement at the White House on Wednesday.",
      "China and other nations have voiced hope that new trade agreements with Washington can be struck, and they stress they will pursue negotiations that Mr. Trump has indicated an openness to, but even close allies such as the United Kingdom, which was hit with the minimum 10% base rate tariff on Wednesday, have also made clear that retaliatory measures remain under consideration.",

      "The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%, versus 4.1% in February.",
      "What it means",
      "While the March numbers beat forecasts, economists are also cautioning that Mr. Trump's new tariffs, announced on April 2, could crimp economic growth, raising the risk of a recession. Economic downturns like recessions are typically accompanied by a sharp increase in unemployment.",
      "\"Today's better-than-expected jobs report will help ease fears of an immediate softening in the U.S. labor market.

      "Asian stocks fell further Friday, though markets in Shanghai, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Indonesia were closed for holidays, limiting the extent of the day's declines, The Associated Press reported. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 2.8% while South Korea's Kospi sank 0.9%.",
      "European markets lost more ground, the AP said. Germany's DAX fell 2%. The CAC 40 in Paris was off 1.6%. And Britain's FTSE 100 declined 1.7%.",
      "Shares of Apple, which has diversified its international supply chains in recent years but which still makes most of its iPhones in China, dropped nearly 10% Thursday. The new duties raise the nominal U.S. tariff rate on China to 54%.",

      "\"Market uncertainty is likely to remain elevated in the weeks ahead, as investors consider likely downgrades to consensus U.S. economic and earnings growth forecasts, the risk of a tit-for-tat escalation in tariffs and the potential scope for tariffs announced to be negotiated down,\" Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to investors.",

      "Souring sentiment",
      "Financial markets surged after Mr. Trump was re-elected in November, with Wall Street counting on lower taxes and deregulation to fuel corporate profits. Other investors bet on the Trump administration threatening tariffs mostly as a way to pressure other countries into making concessions on trade, rather than a full-fledged push to change the terms of global commerce.",
      "But after hitting all-time highs in February, stocks have turned tail as the White House makes clear it wasn't bluffing. Indeed, investors have been left stunned by the speed and scale of Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "In contrast to his first term, when he implemented levies on roughly $380 billion worth of goods over four years, Mr. Trump has imposed more than $3 trillion in tariffs in the less than three months since his return to power, according to the Economic Policy institute, a left-leaning think tank.",

      "Despite the angst on Wall Street, economists note that the U.S. continues to grow, and most still put relatively low odds on a recession. Hiring around the U.S. also remains healthy, with the nation's unemployment rate hovering around 4%.",
      "For borrowers, meanwhile, further signs the economy is at risk of stalling could encourage the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark interest rate. The central bank last cut rates in December of 2024, but has kept them steady since then as policy makers seek to douse inflation.",

      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",
      "Ahead of the initial divestiture deadline, ByteDance earlier this year briefly shut down TikTok in the U.S. Mr. Trump quickly paused the ban and the service was restored.",
      "The ban does not target TikTok's U.S. users. But the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law in 2024 under former President Biden, would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores and web-hosting services to distribute or service TikTok.",

      "The House must adopt the Senate-passed resolution to move forward on the president's agenda, and GOP leaders hoped to take that vote this week. But nearly a dozen House Republicans say they oppose the resolution or have serious concerns about the $1.5 trillion gap between the House and Senate versions. Speaker Mike Johnson's\u00a0slim\u00a0GOP majority means he can afford to lose the support of just three Republicans.",
      "The president is meeting with Republican holdouts on Tuesday as Johnson tries to coax them to back the 70-page resolution, the blueprint for\u00a0implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. Although Johnson has in the past been able to overcome pockets of opposition, this time, he faces objections from multiple corners of the GOP conference.",
      "House leaders aren't ruling out working through the weekend if they're unable to push the resolution through the lower chamber this week. Congress is scheduled to be in recess the next two weeks.",
      "The president endorsed the Senate-adopted budget resolution Monday night, saying in a post on Truth Social that it includes all of \"the elements we need to secure the Border, enact Historic Spending Cuts, and make Tax Cuts PERMANENT.\"",
      "\"There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE!\" Mr. Trump continued, adding that \"THE HOUSE MUST PASS THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION, AND QUICKLY.\"",
      "The budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate.",
      "The Senate adopted the compromise resolution Saturday after Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year. But both chambers must adopt identical budget resolutions to kickstart the broader reconciliation process, prompting GOP leaders to come together on the path forward in recent weeks.",
      "Still, the resolution doesn't address disagreements over where and how to make substantial spending cuts, pushing a confrontation further down the road.",
      "In the resolution, the Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. Some House Republicans argue the spending cuts aren't deep enough.",
      "The Senate's plan relies on a budget scoring method known as \"current policy,\" which assumes that continuing current policies incurs no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.",
      "But the tax cuts were originally passed using \"current law\" scoring, which treats the renewal of expiring policies as new legislation. The House budget resolution relied on the current law baseline and acknowledges that continuing the tax cuts will cost $3.8 trillion. The 2017 Trump tax cuts are set to expire this year, and if they are not extended, taxes will go up for many filers.",
      "House Republican leaders are still barreling forward with the Senate-adopted plan, meeting with skeptical Republicans, while the White House seeks to apply pressure of its own.",
      "Johnson told reporters he was meeting with the House Freedom Caucus Monday night, after the conservative group's chairman, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, advocated for the chamber to move forward on the president's agenda without the budget resolution.",
      "\"It needs to at some point in the future. It doesn't need to be right now,\" Harris said of the resolution's adoption.",
      "Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas also advised against holding a vote this week.",
      "\"They literally produced a budget that will have deficits going up,\" Roy said Tuesday. \"That's what they did. I didn't come here to make deficits go up. The Senate apparently did.\"",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise acknowledged the hurdles ahead at the GOP leadership's news conference Tuesday morning, saying \"nobody said it would be easy.\" But the Louisiana Republican added that \"our commitment is firm in getting this done.\"",
      "\"There are members that have questions \u2014 that's not a surprise,\" Scalise said. \"Our job is to continue answering those questions while moving the ball forward. But it's critical that we advance this agenda, that we don't delay, because passing the budget doesn't end the process, it starts the reconciliation process.\"",
      "Johnson stressed that \"the budget resolution is not the law,\" noting that \"all this does is it allows us to continue the process, begin drafting the actual legislation that actually counts \u2014 and that's the one big beautiful bill.\"",
      "The speaker said adopting the resolution simply \"allows us to get off the sidelines and get on the field and start this game.\"",
      "\"It's the kickoff,\" he added.",

      "\"China's position on China-US economic and trade relations has been made very clear,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, adding, \"It is surprising and sad to hear such ignorant and impolite words from this vice president.\"",
      "President Trump has upended the world economy with sweeping tariffs and has ruled out any pause in his aggressive trade policy despite a dramatic market sell-off.",
      "In addition to a universal baseline tariff of 10% on goods imported into the U.S., Mr. Trump also announced \"reciprocal\" duties for imports coming from certain countries, which are set to take effect Wednesday. China was hit with the highest of those additional taxes, initially 34%, although Mr. Trump then upped it to 104% after Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, Vance defended U.S. tariffs as an antidote to a \"globalist economy\" he said had not worked for ordinary Americans.",
      "\"We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture,\" Vance said. \"That is not a recipe for economic prosperity. It's not a recipe for low prices, and it's not a recipe for good jobs in the United States of America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump believes the tariffs will revive America's lost manufacturing base by forcing foreign companies to relocate to the U.S., rather than making goods abroad. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik told \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday that the policy will help protect American factories and \"reset the power\" of the country.",
      "However, economists have questioned the approach, with some saying the tariffs are arbitrary and others raising concerns about the ways in which Mr. Trump's levies will drive up the price of everyday goods. On Monday, Goldman Sachs economists cited the tariffs in a report that raised the odds of a U.S. recession to 45%, while JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned the taxes could slow economic growth and \"will likely increase inflation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tattoos of crowns, a clock and other symbols have been used by the Trump administration to allege Venezuelan men deported from the U.S. are members of the Tren de Aragua gang. But experts and police in a Colorado city who have investigated the gang say tattoos aren't reliable markers of affiliation.",
      "The administration alleges the deportees it sent to El Salvador's notorious maximum security prison are gang members, mostly with Tren de Aragua, and some with MS-13. It has also acknowledged that \"many\" of them have no criminal records.",
      "President Trump invoked the 1798 wartime Alien Enemies Act, claiming Tren de Aragua is invading the United States, to deport many of the men. The administration also declared Tren de Aragua a terrorist organization.",
      "Court documents, lawyers and family members of some of the migrants have said their tattoos were reasons they were determined to be alleged Tren de Aragua members.",
      "The wife of Franco Jose Caraballo, a barber from Venezuela with no criminal record, said officers kept asking questions about his tattoo of a pocket watch that marks the time of their daughter's birth.",
      "A lawyer for Caraballo says he's not a gang member and his wife said he is innocent when asked what worries her about his detention in the Salvadoran prison.",
      "Another man, Andry Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez Romero, has crown tattoos over the words \"Mom\" and \"Dad.\" Hern\u00e1ndez Romero is a makeup artist who identifies as gay. He faced discrimination and threats in Venezuela because of his sexual orientation and political views and was seeking asylum in the U.S., his attorney said in a court filing.",
      "A questionnaire, used in correctional facilities to assess potential gang affiliation, appears to show that Hern\u00e1ndez Romero's tattoos were the only basis to allegedly connect him to Tren de Aragua.",
      "\"The crown has been found to be an identifier for a Tren de Aragua gang member,\" an officer wrote in the filing.",
      "Many experts disagree that tattoos can identify members of the gang.",
      "\"Expert after expert tells us tattoos are not a reliable indicator of whether you're part of this particular gang,\" Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who is leading the legal challenge against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, told 60 Minutes.",
      "Rebecca Hanson, an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Florida, wrote in a court filing for the case that there are no tattoos, symbols or hand gestures associated with the group.",
      "\"The TdA, and gangs more generally in Venezuela, do not have a history of using tattoos to indicate membership,\" she said. \"TdA members may, of course, have tattoos, but this is not part of a collective identity.\"",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, which Mr. Trump has claimed is a \"war zone\" overrun by the Tren de Aragua, Police Chief Todd Chamberlain said it's very difficult to identify Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Chamberlain said he would not describe the city as a \"war zone,\" but said Aurora has been \"ground zero\" for the gang's activities. The city saw organized violent crime concentrated in three apartment complexes, one of which is now shuttered.",
      "The Aurora Police Department likely has the best understanding of the Tren de Aragua gang of any U.S. law enforcement agency, he said.",
      "\"It's unlike MS-13, it's unlike a Crip or a Blood,\" he said. \"If you go back to gangs in the early '80s or the '90s again, the way they walked, the way they talked, what they wore, they had very obvious signs.\"",
      "But Tren de Aragua does not, he said.",
      "Rather than focusing on trying to identify gang members, Chamberlain said his department has focused on criminal activity.",
      "\"For us, it wasn't about what gang they were involved in. It's about what criminal activity they were involved in, and we knew that there was criminal activity,\" he said. \"If we could connect it to TdA as we were evolving this process, that's great.\"",
      "Chamberlain said his department counted a total of nine confirmed Tren de Aragua members who passed through Aurora in the last two years.",
      "Jeanette Rodriguez, who serves as a liaison between local law enforcement and the Venezuelan migrant community in Aurora, said Tren de Aragua members don't flaunt obvious signs of gang membership.",
      "\"If you compare it to like MS-13, they're very proud of who they are, and they would tattoo them on their faces, and are very proud of who they are. Tren de Aragua, they know the value of laying low,\" she said.",
      "Hanson noted that the Trump administration's partial reliance on tattoos to conclude migrants are members of Tren de Aragua \"appears to result from an incorrect conflation of gang practices in Central America and Venezuela.\"",
      "It's different than in El Salvador and Honduras, where \"gangs have long used tattoos to indicate membership and identity,\" she said.",
      "At CECOT, the El Salvador prison, many of the inmates have prominent tattoos. One, Marvin Vazquez, who is an MS-13 member, said \"you gotta kill\" to get a tattoo like the \"MS\" ones he showed on his chest and abdomen.",
      "Vazquez was arrested in El Salvador after the government declared war on the gangs in 2022.",
      "Gustavo Villatoro, El Salvador's minister of justice and public security, said tattoos are one way the government identifies gang members. He said not all the prisoners in CECOT have been convicted of crimes.",
      "Top White House officials have argued the Trump administration does not need to follow due process to remove individuals from the U.S. under the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act. However, on Monday, April 7, the Supreme Court said detainees must receive notice that they are subject to removal under the law and must be allowed to challenge their detention.",
      "Asked if he was worried some migrants were incorrectly identified as gang members, Mr. Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan said he's not.",

    "summary": "More than 16,000 probationary workers at six different agencies were fired in mid-February.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to halt a lower court order that required six federal agencies to rehire more than 16,000 probationary workers who had been fired.",
      "The high court granted a request for emergency relief from the Trump administration, which sought to move forward with its efforts to drastically scale back the size of the federal government as legal proceedings continue. In an unsigned order, the Supreme Court said the injunction issued by the district court in mid-March \"was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-organization plaintiffs in this case. But under established law, those allegations are presently insufficient to support the organizations'\" legal right to sue, a concept known as standing.",
      "Its stay will remain in place will litigation plays out. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson said they would have denied the Justice Department's request for relief.",
      "Probationary workers, generally those who were still in one or two-year trial periods, were the early targets of mass firings that are part of President Trump's government-cutting initiative. Many have been left in limbo since mid-February, when they were fired and then had their employment restored weeks later as a result of court orders.",
      "Labor unions and nonprofit groups that brought the lawsuit challenging the firings vowed to continue fighting for probationary workers.",
      "\"There is no doubt that thousands of public service employees were unlawfully fired in an effort to cripple federal agencies and their crucial programs that serve millions of Americans every day,\" the coalition said in a statement. \"Today's order by the U.S. Supreme Court is deeply disappointing but is only a momentary pause in our efforts to enforce the trial court's orders and hold the federal government accountable.\"",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court arose after thousands of probationary workers received notices that they had been terminated. The letters, many of which used similar language, based the firings on individual performance, though federal workers argued in court filings that they had received positive performance reviews.",
      "In response to the firings, a group of labor unions and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit in federal district court in California. The lawsuit claimed that the Office of Personnel Management directed the mass terminations of probationary workers, acting outside of its authority.",
      "In late February, U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued a temporary restraining order deeming earlier guidance from OPM to federal agencies about the firing of probationary workers \"illegal\" and invalid. The judge also concluded that the mass firings were likely unlawful.",
      "On the heels of that decision, OPM acting director Charles Ezell issued revised guidance clarifying that it is \"not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees.\"",
      "Following a hearing last month, the judge ordered six agencies \u2014 the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior, Treasury and Veterans Affair \u2014 to immediately offer reinstatement to all probationary workers who were fired the previous month.",
      "Human resources officials at the half-a-dozen agencies told the court that they had rehired the fired employees and placed them on administrative leave before returning them to full-duty status.",
      "The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to pause that decision while it appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined the request.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the district judge did not have the power to grant reinstatement to thousands of probationary workers, and refuted that OPM had directed the firings in the first place.",
      "\"An order directing reinstatement of thousands of employees across six agencies is intolerable,\" she wrote in a filing. \"The injunction appears to prevent the agencies from terminating the employees based on an exercise of the agencies' independent judgment \u2014 and would even seem to prevent the employees' termination based on newly arising grounds like new instances of poor performance or misconduct without, at a minimum, obtaining permission from the district court.\"",
      "The acting solicitor general, who represents the government before the Supreme Court, told the justices that Alsup's order is a \"profound invasion\" of the executive branch's ability to direct its internal affairs.",
      "She also warned that the reinstatements have posed logistical burdens that require significant resources, and said that the obligation to pay the fired probationary employees \"inflicts massive financial costs\" that cannot be recovered.",
      "\"Each day the preliminary injunction remains in effect subjects the Executive Branch to judicial micromanagement of its day-to-day operations,\" Harris wrote.",
      "But the unions and organizations challenging the firings said that the harms alleged by the government are self-inflicted.",
      "\"While the government complains that the reinstatement of more than 16,000 employees at the six covered agencies is an 'enormous' task that would interfere with agency functioning (without presenting evidence supporting that assertion), the scale of the task is simply a reflection of the scale of the Government's own unlawful action and its 'move fast and break things' ethos,\" lawyers for the challengers wrote in a filing.",
      "They called OPM's directives \"hasty and sloppy,\" and said that the government can still fire employees, as long as it complies with the law.",
      "\"The district court's reinstatement merely orders the government to return to the situation that existed before it embarked on illegal mass termination of probationary employees,\" the legal team for the unions and nonprofits wrote. \"If there are 'practical burdens' associated with the return to the status quo, they are of the government's own making.\"",
      "The case brought by the unions and groups is one of two challenging the mass firings of probationary workers. A group of 19 states filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland arguing the terminations were unlawful, and in March, a judge ordered affected probationary workers at more than a dozen agencies be reinstated.",
      "The judge then granted a preliminary injunction in early April, which applies to probationary workers at 20 agencies who live or work in the states involved in the lawsuit.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. But the same day,\u00a0three flights\u00a0carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men \u2014 137 of whom were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act \u2014 were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "The March 15 order was upheld\u00a0by a federal appeals court\u00a0on March 26. Two days later, the Trump administration\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to lift the lower court orders.",
      "On Monday, April 7, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the administration to resume deportations using the law, but said that individuals subject to removal are entitled to judicial review.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation. Top White House officials had argued migrants subject to deportation under the law are not entitled to due process. But, the Supreme Court said on April 7 that going forward, Alien Enemies Act detainees must receive notice \"that they are subject to removal under the Act,\" and the notice must allow them to challenge their detention.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, whose order temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese descent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

    "summary": "Migrants who came to the U.S. via a Biden-era online appointment app\u200b\u200b have been told to leave \"immediately\" in a message from the Department of Homeland Security.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has begun revoking the legal status of migrants who entered the U.S. under a Biden administration process powered by a smartphone app formerly known as CBP One, instructing them to leave the country immediately or face arrest and deportation.",
      "During the Biden administration, more than 900,000 migrants entered the U.S. at official entry points along the southern border after securing appointments through CBP One. They were typically given notices to appear in immigration court, to begin the asylum process, as well as a two-year grant of immigration parole, which allowed them to work in the U.S. lawfully. The policy was designed to dissuade migrants from crossing the border unlawfully.",
      "But the Trump administration has started sending notices to those who entered through the CBP One system, informing them that their parole status is being terminated over 7 days.",
      "\"If you do not depart the United States immediately you will be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States \u2014 unless you have otherwise obtained a lawful basis to remain here,\" the message sent by the Department of Homeland Security and obtained by CBS News reads.",
      "The notification encourages migrants to sign up for self-deportation through the very same app that allowed them to enter the U.S. It is now called CBP Home.",
      "\"Again, DHS is terminating your parole. Do not attempt to remain in the United States \u2014 the federal government will find you,\" the notice says. \"Please depart the United States immediately.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security confirmed the status cancellations, saying in a statement to CBS News that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \"has full authority to revoke parole.\"",
      "\"Canceling these paroles is a promise kept to the American people to secure our borders and protect national security,\" the department added. \"Formal termination notices have been issued, and affected aliens are urged to voluntarily self-deport using the CBP Home App. Those who refuse will be found, removed, and permanently barred from reentry.\"",
      "The Trump administration's actions should not immediately affect migrants who entered via CBP One and applied for asylum and have pending cases in immigration court. The government generally has to wait for those cases to be adjudicated or terminated before moving to deport them.",
      "The move to strip those who entered under the app of their legal status is the latest effort by the Trump administration to dismantle Biden-era immigration programs and expand the pool of migrants eligible to be arrested and deported.",
      "The administration has given more than half a million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who arrived under a separate Biden administration initiative until April 24 to self-deport or face arrest by deportation agents. Like CBP One entrants, those who came to the U.S. under this sponsorship policy, known as CHNV, were granted parole upon entering the country.",
      "Officials have also tried to phase out a Temporary Protected Status program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants, though that effort is currently held up in federal court.",

    "summary": "Pharmaceutical companies accused of fueling the nation's opioid crisis are paying state and local governments billions of dollars in legal settlements. But how much are victims getting?",
    "story": [
      "Christopher Julian's opioid journey is familiar to many Americans.",
      "He was prescribed painkillers as a teenager for a series of sports injuries. He said the doctor never warned him they could be addictive. Julian didn't learn that fact until years later, when he was cut off and began suffering withdrawal symptoms. At that point, he started siphoning pills from family members and buying them from others in his southern Maine community.",
      "After his brother died of brain cancer in 2011, Julian used opioids to cope with more than physical pain.",
      "He stole to support his addiction, cycled in and out of jail and treatment, and overdosed 10 times, he said. His mother once gave him CPR on their bathroom floor.",
      "Life was \"hell on Earth,\" said Julian, now 43 and in long-term recovery.",
      "Like tens of thousands of others who have suffered similarly, Julian filed claims for compensation from pharmaceutical companies accused of fueling the opioid crisis.",
      "Earlier this year, he received his first payout: $324.58.",
      "That's enough to fill his car with gas about eight times or pay about a tenth of the rent for an apartment he shares with his fiancee and two children.",
      "Meanwhile, Maine's Cumberland County, where Julian lives, has received more than $700,000 in opioid settlement money and expects nearly $1.6 million more in the coming years, according to a newly updated database from KFF Health News. Jurisdictions throughout his state have received more than $68 million to date, and governments nationwide have raked in upward of $10 billion, the database shows.",
      "That discrepancy between individuals' and governments' compensations highlights a sense of injustice felt by people directly affected by the crisis who say their suffering is the reason that governments secured these settlements.",
      "Opioid settlements with companies like Purdue Pharma, Walmart, and Johnson & Johnson have led to headline-grabbing multibillion-dollar payouts, but most of the windfall is flowing to state and local governments, not directly to victims of the crisis.",
      "Only a handful of companies \u2014 those that filed for bankruptcy, including Purdue Pharma, Mallinckrodt, Endo, and Rite Aid \u2014 have set aside payouts for individuals. To qualify, people must have filed claims within a certain window and provided documents proving they were prescribed painkillers from that company. Even then, many victims will receive just a few thousand dollars, lawyers and advocates estimate. Most of these companies have not started paying yet, so victims might have to wait months or years more before seeing the cash.",
      "In contrast, state and local governments have already received settlement\u00a0money. To understand the size of those payouts, KFF Health News in January downloaded data from BrownGreer, the court-appointed firm administering many national opioid settlements, and used it to update a searchable database that allows users to determine how much their city, county, or state has received or expects to receive each year.",
      "Governments are receiving that money because attorneys general argued that their states' public safety, health, and social service systems were harmed by the opioid crisis. Jurisdictions are supposed to spend settlement money on addiction treatment, recovery, and prevention programs. But many affected individuals and families say governments have failed to adhere to that mission.",
      "\"At the very minimum, they could spend these dollars right to prevent the future loss of life,\" said Ryan Hampton, a national recovery advocate and previous co-chair of a committee in the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy case, where he represented victims. \"That is the opposite of what we've seen to date.\"",
      "In Pennsylvania, a group of bereaved family members raised similar concerns to Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, who finalized opioid settlements when he was attorney general.",
      "\"Instead of directing funds toward evidence-based solutions, you and your administration have allowed counties to divert these resources into law enforcement, ineffective programs, and initiatives that already have other funding streams available \u2014 disrespecting both our families and the lives lost,\" they wrote in a letter dated Feb. 14. \"Meanwhile, bereaved families \u2014 many of whom have lost everything \u2014 have no financial relief.\"",
      "\"Governments were way more powerful\"",
      "To be sure, many governments have spent millions of settlement dollars on treatment programs, recovery supports, distribution of overdose reversal medications, and other efforts. Some officials in charge of the money say those services, which reach many residents, can have a greater impact than individual payouts.",
      "Will Simons, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania governor, said in a statement that the Shapiro administration has invested nearly $90 million of settlement funds into treatment, recovery, harm reduction, and prevention initiatives, including prevention programs for youths, a drug and alcohol call center, and loan repayment programs aimed at retaining workers in the addiction treatment and recovery field.",
      "Many of the awarded organizations \"support families who have lost loved ones to this crisis, providing counseling and other family supports,\" Simons said.",
      "A few jurisdictions have created fairly modest funds directed at individuals, such as one in Boston to aid families who have lost loved ones to addiction, and a fund in Alabama for grandparents having to raise children because of parental substance use.",
      "But nationwide, there's little that resembles the widespread cash payments that many advocates, like Hampton, originally envisioned.",
      "In the mid-2010s, Hampton said, he and other advocates considered filing class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies but realized they didn't have the resources.",
      "A few years later, when state attorneys general began pursuing cases against those companies, victims were thrilled, thinking they would finally get compensation alongside their governments. Hampton and other advocates held rallies, shared their stories publicly, and galvanized support for the states' lawsuits.",
      "In 2019, when Hampton became co-chair of the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy and arrived at the negotiating table with state attorneys general and other entities, he thought \"everybody was there to take on the big bad pharmaceutical company and to put victims' interests first,\" he said. But as the negotiation proceeded among various creditors vying for the company's assets, he said, \"governments were way more powerful than victims and believed that they were more harmed than victims in terms of cost.\"",
      "Details of the Purdue settlement are still being finalized, and payments are unlikely to start until next year, but estimates suggest state and local governments will receive the lion's share, while more than 100,000 victims will split a fraction of the bankruptcy payout.",
      "Mallinckrodt, a manufacturer of generic opioids, is the only company that had begun paying victims as of early 2025, said Frank Younes, a partner at the Nebraska-based law firm High & Younes, which is representing personal injury claimants in several opioid bankruptcies.",
      "After paying roughly 25% in administrative fees to the national trust overseeing the bankruptcy and an additional 40% in attorney fees, some of his clients have received between $400 and $700, Younes said.",
      "He expects payouts from two other companies \u2014 Endo and Rite Aid \u2014 \"will be even lower.\"",
      "But many victims won't receive anything. Some didn't know they could file claims until it was too late. Others struggled to obtain medical records from shuttered doctors' offices or pharmacies that didn't retain older documents.",
      "Out of nearly 20,000 people who contacted Younes' firm to participate in the various opioid bankruptcies, he said, only about 3,500 were able to file.",
      "\"Do something for these families\"",
      "John McNerney was told his Purdue Pharma claim didn't qualify, because he hadn't been prescribed enough OxyContin to meet the threshold. He submitted claims for Mallinckrodt and Endo instead.",
      "McNerney, 60, who lives in Boca Raton, Florida, said he suffered a spinal injury decades ago from a fall during a plumbing repair. For years afterward, he was prescribed various painkillers. Once his doctors cut him off, he began using pills a friend bought off the street. McNerney spent about $30,000 on rehabs before he entered long-term recovery.",
      "Now when he sees governments spending settlement money on police cars or library books about addiction \"instead of putting 100% of it into rehab,\" he said, \"it really bothers the heck out of me.\"",
      "\"I haven't received a nickel,\" he said.",
      "In Ohio, a group of affected families were similarly frustrated that money wasn't reaching them or the places where they thought it was needed most.",
      "The families teamed up with local nonprofits to submit grant applications to the OneOhio Recovery Foundation, which controls most of the state's opioid settlement funds. They asked for several million dollars to put toward family support groups, training for family members who take in children whose parents have substance use disorders, and emergency cash aid for families to buy cribs or school supplies and cover funeral costs.",
      "Jackie Lewis, a member of the group, said that when her 34-year-old son, Shaun, died of an overdose, she had to pay his funeral costs by credit card. She has filed a claim in the opioid bankruptcies but hasn't received any money yet.",
      "\"Too many families didn't have a credit card to do that with,\" Lewis said. \"There are families I've talked to that couldn't do flowers. Some had to do a cremation instead of a traditional funeral.\"",
      "Her group did not receive funding in the first round of grants from the OneOhio Recovery Foundation.",
      "Connie Luck, a spokesperson for the foundation, said the legal documents that established the foundation do not allow direct payments to individuals affected by the crisis. The foundation has awarded over $45 million to 245 projects throughout the state, including dozens that provide family support services like child care and rental assistance.",
      "\"We deeply empathize with those who have lost loved ones to the opioid epidemic \u2014 their pain is real, and it fuels the Foundation's mission to end this crisis and prevent it from happening again,\" Luck said in a statement.",
      "In Maine, Julian has made peace with his $325 payout, deciding to consider it a surprise bonus rather than compensation for his years of suffering.",
      "But he hopes governments will use their more substantial sums to provide real help \u2014 food and rental assistance for people in recovery and more treatment beds so no one has to wait six months to enter rehab as he once did.",
      "\"They're getting millions of dollars,\" said Julian, who has lost numerous close friends to overdose. \"They could do something for these families that have suffered great losses.\"",
      "KFF Health News data editor Holly K. Hacker contributed to this article.",
      "METHODOLOGY",
      "For more than two years, KFF Health News has been tracking how state and local governments use \u2014 and misuse \u2014 billions of dollars in opioid settlement funds. This database marks our third update of data showing how much money state and local governments have received through national settlements with companies that made or distributed prescription painkillers.",
      "BrownGreer, the court-appointed firm administering many national opioid settlements, tracks how much money it has delivered to various state and local governments, as well as how much is allocated to those jurisdictions for future years. It initially kept this information private.",
      "In 2023, KFF Health News negotiated to obtain that information and made it public for the first time. Five months later, BrownGreer began posting updated versions of the information on a public website.",
      "Last year, KFF Health News downloaded BrownGreer's data on payouts from pharmaceutical distributors AmerisourceBergen (now called Cencora), Cardinal Health, and McKesson, as well as opioid manufacturer Janssen (now known as Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine), and used the state-by-state spreadsheets with separate entries for each settling company to create a searchable database.",
      "This year, KFF Health News has updated that database with new data from BrownGreer, including payouts from opioid manufacturers Allergan and Teva, as well as CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart pharmacies.",
      "KFF Health News downloaded data from BrownGreer's website between Jan. 20 and 24, 2025, concerning payouts from all companies. Users can use the database to determine the total dollar amount their city, county, or state has received or expects to receive each year.",
      "Although this is the most comprehensive data available at a national scale, it provides just a snapshot of all opioid settlement payouts. Other settlements, including with OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma, are still pending. This data does not reflect additional settlements that some state and local governments have entered into beyond the national deals, such as the agreement between Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio and regional supermarket chain Meijer. As such, this database undercounts the amount of opioid settlement money most places have received and will receive.",
      "Payment details for some states are not available, because those states were not part of national settlement agreements, had unique settlement terms, or opted not to have their payments distributed via BrownGreer. A few examples:",
      "\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 West Virginia declined to join several national settlements and instead reached individual settlements with many of these companies.",
      "\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Texas and Nevada were paid in full by Janssen outside the national settlement, so their payout data reflects payments only from other companies with which they entered national settlements.",
      "\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Florida, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania, among others, opted to receive a lump-sum payment via BrownGreer then distribute the money to localities themselves.",
      "BrownGreer shows that several states received some of their anticipated 2027 payment from the distributors (AmerisourceBergen \u2014 now called Cencora \u2014 Cardinal Health, and McKesson) early in 2024. However, for three states \u2014 Colorado, Michigan, and Washington \u2014 BrownGreer does not provide data on how much of this prepayment went to each locality. As such, locality payments in these states may be undercounted for 2024 and overcounted for 2027.",
      "For Oregon, BrownGreer shows 2024 payments from Walmart as fully paid in its statewide data but lists some August 2024 payments for localities as \"projected.\" Since the data was downloaded well past that August 2024 date, we have included those \"projected\" amounts in the 2024 paid total for Oregon localities. No other states had this discrepancy.",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Apr 2025 08:46:12 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump issued a proclamation on March 14 invoking the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants who are allegedly members of the gang Tren de Aragua.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang using a seldom-invoked wartime authority, but clarified that those subject to removal under the law are entitled to judicial review.",
      "The high court split 5-4 in granting a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in the dispute over President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang without a hearing. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the three liberal justices in criticizing the majority's decision.",
      "In its unsigned decision, the Supreme Court said the detainees who are challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act are confined in Texas, so the venue for their case is \"improper\" in the District of Columbia, which is where the dispute has been considered.",
      "\"As a result, the government is likely to succeed on the merits of this action,\" the court said in its ruling lifting two temporary restraining orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington that prevented removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "It added that going forward, detainees subject to the 1798 law \"must receive notice\" that they face removal under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,\" the court said.",
      "The federal district court issued an order last month that prevented the government from deporting the migrants under the 220-year-old law while legal proceedings move forward, and the administration asked the Supreme Court to lift that order.",
      "The decision from the high court to do so comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary, as Mr. Trump's second-term policies have collided with the federal courts. More than 100 cases that challenge key aspects of his agenda have been filed across the country, and disputes challenging at least six of the president's actions have so far reached the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "The ongoing fight over Mr. Trump's effort to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants is one of the most high-profile of the cases, and the district court's decision temporarily blocking the removals sparked calls from the president and his GOP allies for the judge presiding over the dispute to be impeached.",
      "In its decision, the court said the opinion confirms that detainees subject to removal orders under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation.",
      "\"The only question is which court will resolve that challenge. For the reasons set forth, we hold that venue lies in the district of confinement,\" it said.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, and joined in part by Barrett. She called the majority's legal conclusion \"suspect\" and accused the Trump administration of largely ignoring \"its obligations to the rule of law.\"",
      "\"The government's conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. That a majority of this court now rewards the government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible. We, as a nation and a court of law, should be better than this,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh highlighted the area of agreement among the court. All nine justices, he wrote, agree that judicial review is available. But he said they split as to where that review should take place.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on social media after the ruling, \"The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself. A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cheered the ruling with a warning to migrants in the U.S. unlawfully, saying in a statement, \"leave now or we will arrest you, lock you up and deport you.\"",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU who argued before the lower courts, told CBS News, \"We are disappointed that we will need to start the court process over again in a different venue, but the critical point is that the court rejected the government's remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is a big victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed a proclamation under the Alien Enemies Act last month, claiming that Tren de Aragua is \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion\" against the U.S. and declaring that all members of the gang in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to immediate detention and removal. The law had previously been invoked three times, and only during declared wars.",
      "The day after Mr. Trump's proclamation, five Venezuelan nationals who were being held at a detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act violated the terms of the law and asked a federal district court in Washington, D.C., to block their removals.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg swiftly agreed to stop their deportations for 14 days and later expanded his temporary order to prohibit the administration from removing all noncitizens in U.S. custody who are subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation. The judge allowed deportations under other legal authorities. A hearing on a request for a longer preliminary injunction is set for April 8, though it's unclear whether that will proceed as scheduled.",
      "Boasberg is also separately examining the circumstances surrounding the removal of 137 people under the Alien Enemies Act who were on planes bound for El Salvador while proceedings unfolded. The deportations raised questions as to whether the Trump administration violated an oral order from Boasberg calling for any planes carrying migrants subject to removal under the law to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's temporary order, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last month\u00a0declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations. The appeals court divided 2-1 in turning down the government's request to halt Boasberg's directive.",
      "In the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act grants the president sweeping national security authority.",
      "The district court's order, she argued in a filing, is \"forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans. Those orders \u2014 which are likely to extend additional weeks \u2014 now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"",
      "The administration also reiterated its request that the Supreme Court step in to curb the temporary restraining orders that have been issued by federal judges and block enforcement of a policy nationwide.",
      "\"Here, the district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"",
      "But lawyers for the Venezuelan migrants accused the president of stretching the limits of the Alien Enemies Act, which they said risked allowing the government to \"immediately begin whisking away anyone\" it unilaterally claims is a member of a criminal gang to a foreign prison.",
      "\"The president's effort to shoehorn a criminal gang into the AEA, on a migration-equals-invasion theory, is completely at odds with the limited delegation of wartime authority Congress chose to give him through the statute,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "They also argued that many of the people flown out of the U.S. to a Salvadoran prison are not members of Tren de Aragua, and at least eight were Venezuelan women who were returned to the U.S.",
      "Allowing the deportations to resume would have devastating consequences for their clients, the lawyers said. Already, 130 Venezuelan men have been sent to El Salvador, where they have been \"confined, incommunicado, in one of most brutal prisons in the world, where torture and other human rights abuses are rampant,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Without the TRO, plaintiffs will suffer extraordinary and irreparable harms \u2014 being sent out of the United States to a Salvadoran prison, where they will remain incommunicado, potentially for the rest of their lives, without having had any opportunity to contest their designation as gang members,\" lawyers for the migrants said.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court comes as the justices are considering a separate request from the Trump administration to lift a lower court order that required the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador to the United States.",
      "The man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was among those on the deportation flights at issue in the case involving the Alien Enemies Act, but he was removed under a different immigration law. Chief Justice John Roberts earlier Monday temporarily paused the district court's order that set an 11:59 p.m. Monday deadline for the government to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.",

      "In a post on his Truth Social app, Mr. Trump said \"any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set.\"",
      "He added, \"Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th.\"",

      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations, adding to a 10% global tax applied to all products shipped to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the\u00a0new taxes\u00a0are needed to erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to members of the European Union.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's imposition of a 34% tariff on Chinese imports, which is set to go into effect on April 9, Beijing last week announced it would add a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10.",
      "If Mr. Trump implements his plans, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of 20% tariffs aimed at spurring China to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week.",

      "Consumers generally bear the brunt of tariffs because importers like Walmart, which must pay the import duties when they accept shipments from other nations, typically seek to spread all or most of the cost through higher price tags on imported goods.

    "summary": "Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man, was deported to El Salvador on March 15 despite a protective order.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily paused a lower court's order that required the Trump administration to return a\u00a0Maryland man\u00a0who was\u00a0mistakenly arrested\u00a0and removed to El Salvador back to the U.S. by 11:59 p.m. Monday.",
      "Roberts' administrative stay gives the Supreme Court more time to consider the matter and will remain in place \"pending further order of the undersigned or of the court,\" it states. He issued his order hours after the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the\u00a0legal battle over the removal of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia last month.",
      "The Justice Department's request for emergency relief from the high court came as it faced a court-ordered 11:59 p.m. deadline to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. He was deported to a Salvadoran supermax prison on March 15 despite a 2019 protective order that should have prevented him from being sent to the country.",
      "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to block that district court order, claiming that it \"sets the United States up for failure\" because it cannot compel El Salvador to \"follow a federal judge's bidding.\"",
      "\"The Constitution charges the president, not federal district courts, with the conduct of foreign diplomacy and protecting the nation against foreign terrorists, including by effectuating their removal,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement that the Justice Department welcomed the chief justice's stay \"as we continue to fight this case and protect the executive branch from judicial overreach.\"",
      "The dispute over Abrego Garcia's removal sparked widespread attention and outrage after the Trump administration admitted in a court filing last week that his deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error\" and \"oversight.\" The 29-year-old father was removed from the U.S. on a series of deportation flights transporting hundreds of people to the notorious Salvadoran prison known as CECOT.",
      "Those flights are at the center of a separate high-profile court battle involving President Trump's attempts to use the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. The Supreme Court is currently weighing a separate request from the Justice Department to allow it to resume deportations using the seldom-invoked authority.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 when he was 16 years old, according to court records. In 2019, he was arrested alongside three other men in Maryland and detained by federal immigration authorities while an immigration judge examined his case.",
      "During a bond hearing before the immigration judge, the Department of Homeland Security put forth evidence claiming that a \"proven and reliable source\" confirmed Abrego Garcia had ties to the MS-13 gang. The judge denied his request for release on bond, which was upheld by an immigration appeals board.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have argued in court filings that the only evidence of his alleged gang ties came from a confidential informant who claimed he was an active member of MS-13 and the fact that he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and sweatshirt when he was arrested. They also said Abrego Garcia has no criminal history. \"He has never been charged or convicted of any criminal charges, in the United States, El Salvador, or any other country,\" his lawyers wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia was released from federal custody after another immigration judge granted him a \"withholding of removal\" to El Salvador, a legal status that bars officials from removing individuals who prove they are more likely than not to be subject to persecution in their home country. In the order, the judge found that if Abrego Garcia returned to El Salvador, he would likely face persecution by local gangs.",
      "Abrego Garcia's wife told CBS News that her husband attended regular check-ins with immigration authorities after he was released and was working as a sheet metal worker. But he was arrested again on March 12 because of what the Trump administration said was his \"prominent role\" in MS-13 and questioned about his ties to the group, which Secretary of State Marco Rubio designated as a \"foreign terrorist organization\" in February.",
      "Abrego Garcia was then transferred to a detention facility in Texas, his wife said, and then placed on the flight to El Salvador on March 15.",
      "While the Trump administration acknowledged that it erred in removing Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, it opposed efforts to bring him back to the U.S. because of his alleged affiliation with MS-13. The Justice Department has also argued that the government does not have jurisdiction over Abrego Garcia anymore because he is in the custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "A federal judge in Maryland held a hearing on the challenge to Abrego Garcia's removal, and ultimately ordered the administration to return him to the U.S. by 11:59 p.m. Monday. During the proceedings, a Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, conceded that Abrego Garcia \"should not have been removed,\" and said he was \"frustrated\" by a lack of information from the Trump administration as to why Abrego Garcia was arrested by immigration authorities. Reuveni was placed on administration leave in the wake of the hearing.",
      "The judge, Paula Xinis, issued a scathing opinion Sunday that said the federal government \"confessed grievous error\" that \"shocks the conscience.\"",
      "The Trump administration appealed the district court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit and asked it to swiftly put Xinis' order requiring Abrego Garcia to be returned to the U.S. on hold.",
      "Sauer then sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court. His request for the high court to block Xinis' decision came just before the 4th Circuit rejected the administration's request to step into the dispute.",
      "The solicitor general, who was confirmed to the role last week, called the district court's decision \"unprecedented and indefensible,\" and claimed the the lower courts are trying to \"seize control over foreign relations, treat the Executive Branch as a subordinate diplomat, and demand that the United States let a member of a foreign terrorist organization into America tonight.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun redeploying staff to respond to the deadly outbreak of measles in Texas, a spokesperson said Monday, a week after steep layoffs at the agency impacted its response to the spread of the virus.",
      "\"A team of three deployed yesterday to meet with county and state officials to assess the immediate needs to respond to this outbreak. The team is meeting with officials again today,\" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said in an email.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first said Sunday that the CDC would be redeploying to Texas at its governor's request, after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak. An 8-year-old girl was the second fatality there this year.",
      "\"Once the assessment is complete, more CDC staff will be sent to Texas per Sec. Kennedy's order and the governor's request. The first teams deployed to Texas arrived on March and returned to CDC on April 1,\" McDonald said.",
      "Multiple agency staff working on the CDC's measles response were among the thousands cut from the agency last week, officials have told CBS News.",
      "A handful of employees at agencies within the department have been brought back to work so far, multiple officials said, at least through the end of the 60 day period before their layoff notices formally take effect.",
      "McDonald did not comment on whether laid-off staff who had been working on the agency's measles response would be among those Kennedy might reinstate.",
      "The ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states has driven this year's tally of U.S. measles cases to the highest levels seen since a large wave of cases in 2019, which was the worst in the U.S. in decades.",
      "While dozens of measles cases are reported every year, usually linked to undervaccinated travelers returning from trips outside the country, health authorities have warned that ongoing community spread of the virus this year is now threatening America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.",
      "There have been six measles outbreaks so far this year, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states makes up the majority of cases. Smaller outbreaks are also ongoing in New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",
      "Details of the sixth outbreak have not yet been released, the spokesperson said, citing patient privacy.",
      "Kennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread",
      "While in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.",
      "Kennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.",
      "In a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"",
      "Budesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.",
      "Campbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.",
      "Clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.",
      "\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"",
      "\"Vaccination will prevent measles, but for those who do get measles, rigorous studies, and not anecdotal reports, will help us to better treat them,\" said Campbell.",
      "Kennedy's embrace of alternative therapies has been contradicted by other health experts, including former Trump administration officials.",
      "\"My children and grandchildren will not die of measles, because they are vaccinated.\u00a0 And there is no substitute, nor any effective treatment, for measles,\" Dr. Brett Giroir, an adviser to the department this year, wrote in an opinion piece published by RealClearHealth last week.",
      "The editorial from Giroir, who previously worked as assistant secretary of health during President Trump's first term, was published before news of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak. In the U.S., a child last died from measles in 2015.",
      "\"One child's death from measles is a tragedy not only for the family and their community but also for our nation.\u00a0 If we can't stop measles, really what can we do?\u00a0 Let's not wait for another tragedy,\" Giroir said.",

      "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson reached a deal with Rep. Anna Paulina Luna amid her push to allow new parents to vote remotely, which paralyzed the House last week and threatened to delay a key vote on President Trump's agenda in the coming days.",
      "Luna, a Florida Republican, announced Sunday she and Johnson had a deal to use vote pairing \u2014 an agreement between an absent member and a member who is physically present and plans to vote on the opposite side of the question, effectively canceling out the vote. The present member casts their vote, then withdraws it and announces that they have paired with the absent member. The vote is not included in the vote total, but their positions are published in the Congressional Record.",
      "\"It will be open for the entire conference to use when unable to vote (e.g., new parents, bereaved, emergencies, etc.),\" Luna wrote Sunday.",
      "Johnson said Monday the solution is \"no harm, no foul\" and \"solved her concerns, so that's a great thing.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, suffered an embarrassing loss to kill the effort to allow new parents to vote remotely around the birth of their child. Johnson, who considers proxy voting to be unconstitutional, said any further floor action was halted and sent members home.",
      "A deal could allow House leaders to move ahead on other legislative priorities this week, including holding a vote on a Republican budget blueprint that passed the Senate over the weekend.",
      "Mr. Trump weighed in Thursday on the debate, telling reporters that he supported Luna's effort to allow new parents to vote remotely. But a day later, Johnson wrote on social media that Mr. Trump told him, \"Mike, you have my proxy on proxy voting.\"",
      "The measure to allow new parents to vote remotely was introduced by Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado in January. The bill would allow new parents to designate a colleague to vote for them for 12 weeks after they or their spouse gives birth. The bill would also allow that period to begin earlier if the lawmaker has a serious medical condition or isn't able to travel safely.",
      "Luna, a cosponsor of the bill, moved to bypass leadership and launched a\u00a0discharge petition, a procedural move that allows a measure to move forward without the speaker's approval, to force a vote on it. The discharge petition quickly reached the threshold needed to force a vote, with 206 Democrats and 11 other Republicans signing on.",
      "But Republicans tried to derail Luna's effort by inserting language into a rule governing debate on an unrelated bill on election security to table her discharge petition. Nine Republicans joined all Democrats during a procedural vote Tuesday to help sink it.",
      "Pettersen said in a statement Monday that the agreement between Luna and Johnson \"does not address the barriers we've fought so hard to overcome.\"",
      "\"Instead of letting us vote, he has instead gone to historic lengths to kill our resolution and make sure the large majority of his Members don't have a voice,\" she said of Johnson. \"Let's be clear: these changes are not a win for us and Speaker Johnson has turned his back on moms and dads in Congress and working families.\"",

      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",

      "As markets fall, and with his\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0set to take effect on Wednesday, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "No pause in tariffs",
      "During a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Trump confirmed on Monday that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs. When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",

      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Saturday as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before.

We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on Sunday on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0on Sunday. Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street Monday, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday to raise duties imposed on China to 50% beginning Wednesday, after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase by Tuesday or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",

    "summary": "President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on about 90 countries, including China and the European Union. Here's the list.",
    "story": [
      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations will face only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries will be charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports will face the baseline rate of 10%, while China will face a 34% tariff.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his\u00a0Wednesday remarks.",
      "Asian nations will face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic. On top of China's 34% reciprocal tariff, imports from that nation will also face previously announced 20% tariffs, bringing that nation's total rate to more than 60%, she added.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "China retaliated last week by saying it planned to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products. On April 7, Mr. Trump shot back at China by saying he plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on its imports if the Asian nation doesn't withdraw its plan to add retaliatory import duties.",
      "If Mr. Trump carries through with that threat, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When will these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates will become effective at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries likely to retaliate against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "For now, other countries are taking a more measured approach in their response. European Union trade chief Maros Sefcovic is scheduled to meet with U.S. officials on Friday after Mr. Trump hit the 27-nation bloc with a 20% tariff.",

    "summary": "As the Trump administration makes cuts to federal health agencies, some Alzheimer's experts are worried about the impact on research and patients with the disease.",
    "story": [
      "As the Trump administration makes\u00a0major cuts to\u00a0federal health agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, some Alzheimer's experts are worried about research for the brain-impairing disease being halted, which could impact treatment options and the lives of patients and their families.",
      "The Alzheimer's Association\u00a0said last week that two related programs have had staff placed on administrative leave as part of the reductions: The Healthy Brain Initiative, which aims to improve understanding around brain health, and\u00a0Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for Alzheimer's, which focuses on risk reduction as well as increasing detection and diagnosis.",
      "These programs \"have a meaningful impact on Americans everyday,\" the organization said in a statement, adding that the BOLD program, as well as other Alzheimer's programs, were just unanimously reauthorized by Congress last year.",
      "The association's president and CEO Joanne Pike said these public health programs are critical to those dealing with Alzheimer's and dementia across the country.",
      "\"Among other things, they ensure that people living with dementia, caregivers and health providers have the information, resources and support they need,\" Pike said. \"The programs remain intact, but continuing on a path of reducing staff and resources could cause irreversible damage.\"",
      "According to the nonprofit\u00a0Alzheimer's Impact Movement, federal funding for Alzheimer's research accounts for as much as $3.8 billion each year.",
      "\"Reduced research funding means we are delaying the development and refinement of treatments that could delay or prevent the onset of dementia symptoms, reducing quality of life and increasing suffering for both patients and families,\" Jason Krellman, a clinical neuropsychologist and assistant professor at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, told CBS News.",
      "He says this is a crucial time for brain disease research, as drugs are being developed that show potential to treat the underlying causes of Alzheimer's rather than just slowing its symptoms.",
      "\"Funding cuts will surely reduce or even stop the progress we are now starting to make toward cures for Alzheimer's disease and related conditions. That is especially problematic because our population is aging more than ever before and these diseases will therefore become much more prevalent in the years to come,\" he said.",
      "Cuts could threaten \"the entire pipeline\"",
      "Lawrence Chernin, CEO and co-founder of Dabble Health, a company focused on cognitive health monitoring, worries funding cuts could leave potentially life-changing innovations behind. He and his team are developing an app that he hopes could give people a \"cognitive score,\" similar to health apps that give sleep scores \u2014 but further testing is needed for scientific validatation.",
      "Despite promising data from a pilot study, Chernin said traditional investors often consider tools like theirs \"too early and too risky.\"",
      "\"Government funding through NIH and SBIR (Small Business Innovation Research) grants represents the only viable bridge from promising research to clinical validation,\" he told CBS News, adding that his company recently applied for an SBIR grant.",
      "\"Frankly, without this funding, our company may not survive,\" he said. \"These NIH cuts don't just threaten our company; they threaten the entire pipeline of early-stage medical innovations that could transform Alzheimer's care.\"",
      "SBIR helps fund the NIH's National Institute of Aging, which makes nearly $150 million in grants to small businesses each year. According to the institute, it is the largest source of early-stage funding for aging-related research and development, including interventions for Alzheimer's disease.",
      "And while Chernin recognizes some people think there's a lot of waste in government spending, he says \"overall it achieves so much,\" pointing to breakthroughs in cancer research, for example.",
      "\"Now, cancer isn't as terrible, actually, in terms of the scope of diseases like Alzheimer's is, because there are remedies for cancer,\" he said.",
      "Hoping for continued support",
      "Some, however, like Dr. Joshua Hare, who is chairman and chief science officer at biotechnology company Longeveron, are optimistic. The company just successfully completed a Phase 2 study, published last month in Nature Medicine, for an Alzheimer's medication they've been developing.",
      "\"Clearly, we have a president who is changing things big-time in all domains of our lives. ... They want to cut funding and streamline the NIH, that's clear, but I'm not at all convinced that they are anti-health,\" he told CBS News. Hare said he thinks there will be more funding for areas consistent with the Make America Healthy Again initiative, Department of Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s platform focusing on chronic disease, food additives and other priorities.",
      "So while there will be cuts to certain areas \u2014 COVID and DEI-related initiatives are already being hit, for example \u2014 Hare said he's not so worried about Alzheimer's research being slashed.",
      "\"I can't say that for sure. I'm not in the government. I just listened to the testimony that the new director of NIH gave to Congress in his confirmation hearings, and he specifically addressed Alzheimer's research, and he specifically said that there are avenues of research for Alzheimer's that are underfunded and deserve ongoing funding.\"",
      "His company has previously received NIH funding for a non-Alzheimer's, pediatrics-related trial, while the Alzheimer's Association entirely funded the Phase 1 trial for Longeveron's Alzheimer's drug, Hare said. \"If we didn't have that extraordinary funding from Alzheimer's Association and NIH, the company wouldn't have had been able to progress to where we are now.\" He said company remains \"full steam ahead\" on getting its product to those who \"need it as quickly as possible.\"",
      "While the long-term impacts of the cuts remain unclear, Charles J. Fuschillo, Jr, president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, said in a statement to CBS News that bipartisan cooperation is essential in the continued fight against Alzheimer's disease.",
      "\"We are grateful that federal policymakers in Congress and the White House worked together in a bipartisan manner over the last decade to deliver essential federal funding increases for Alzheimer's research, and appropriately treated Alzheimer's disease as a growing public health crisis, not a political issue,\" the statement read. \"Building on that progress is vital to ensure we reach the finish line of finding a cure for Alzheimer's.\"",

      "The Justice Department placed Reuveni on leave after he made the comments.",

      "An internal Justice Department memo reviewed by CBS News said Trump appointees are considering closing the Community Relations Service, which was created as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The mission of the office is to be \"America's peacemaker,\" tasked with \"preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, conflicts, and civil disorders, and in restoring racial stability and harmony.\"",
      "The Community Relations Service does not investigate or prosecute crimes and has no law enforcement authority, and according to the Justice Department, its services are both confidential and free of charge to communities that accept or request them. In 2021, the agency said of its mission that it sought to help realize Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"inspiring dream of a vibrant, all-embracing nation unified in justice, peace, and reconciliation.\"",
      "The office has a history of intervening during periods of heightened national unrest. It was credited with helping prevent another riot in 1993, as racial tensions re-emerged following the second trial of police who beat Rodney King in California.",
      "It also worked to ease rising racial tensions after the 1997 fatal police shooting of a Chinese-American man in Rohnert Park, California, in Akron, Ohio in 2022 after the shooting of a Black man by police and deploying twice to Minneapolis during the trial of Derek Chauvin after the killing of\u00a0George Floyd\u00a0in 2020 in Minnesota.",
      "Former leaders of the Community Relations Service worry that shuttering the office could lead to a surge in disputes between police departments or city leaders and minority communities nationwide.",
      "\"We would find and stop brush fires, before they became forest fires,\" said Ron Wakabayashi, a former regional director of the Community Relations Service. Wakabayashi told CBS News he fears the nation will be at greater risk of unrest, boycotts and lawsuits without the agency's Community Relations Service deployed regionally across nation.",
      "The Community Relations Service's low-profile approach means it has remained less well known even among federal government leaders, though it has been a vital asset for the Justice Department, according to some who have led the office. Community Relations Service employees have quietly intervened with church leaders, community leaders, relatives of victims of violence and city administrators to ward off unrest, lawsuits or boycotts.",
      "President John F. Kennedy conceived of the office in the early 1960s, saying the federal government should have experts who can \"identify tensions before they reach the crisis stage\" and \"work quietly to ease tensions and improve relations in any community threatened or torn with strife.\"",
      "The passage of hate crimes legislation in the wake of the killings of Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. in the late 1990s meant that the office's jurisdiction \"expanded to gender, sex, religion, protected classes of people,\" Wakabayashi said.",
      "He said the experienced employees of the Community Relations Service would develop relationships over the course of years in major cities, with leaders of houses of worship, police departments and activists to earn credibility and better equip themselves to mediate disputes.",
      "According to Wakabayasi, at one point the office employed 600 professional staff, including mediators and community outreach experts, in regional offices in Philadelphia, Dallas, Seattle, Detroit, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Boston.",
      "The Justice Department memo reviewed by CBS News indicates some of the current Community Relations Service staff would be reassigned to federal prosecutors' offices nationwide. Former staffers say that type of reorganization could cripple the federal government's ability to prevent racial strife in U.S. cities because community activists might be less willing to work with so-called peacemakers who may be perceived to be aligned with prosecutors' offices.",
      "Bert Brandenburg, who previously worked in the Community Relations Service, and other former Justice Department officials questioned plans to close the office: \"During eras of soaring racial tension \u2013 wouldn't it make sense to have people in communities while they arise ... so they don't lead to boycotts, litigation or unrest?\"",
      "\"Violence prevention works best when communities see conciliators as honest brokers they can open up with as part of working through conflicts, which is distinct from the critical work of prosecutors holding wrongdoers accountable,\" Brandenburg told CBS News.",

      "\"Further, to avoid clear irreparable harm, and because equity and justice compels it, the Court grants the narrowest, daresay only, relief warranted: to order that Defendants return Abrego Garcia to the United States,\" Xinis continued.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 6, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by one of the top Republicans in the Senate, Wyoming's John Barrasso, the whip. Good to have you here in person Senator.",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Thanks. Great to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to ask you about what the Secretary just laid out. He did not describe this as leverage to get to a deal. He said this, take them literally. The tariffs are here to stay. We've already seen some conservative groups, like the New Civil Liberties Alliance, file suit saying that these are not on solid constitutional and legal ground. Do you think the president's on solid legal ground?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, I think he is. But this is about a monumental change in the direction of our government. We are, and I'm talking about change in terms of the size as well as the priorities, and this is 180 degree change from what we had for the last four years with big government, big spending, big taxes, and we have a comprehensive economic plan to get to a strong, healthy, growing economy for the American people. That's why we passed what we did just yesterday in the Senate, because we want people to have more- better jobs, more opportunities and more money in their own pockets. So in terms of the tariffs, I believe they're a tool, and I think we have to go after China. They have been abusing us for years, and I believe the president is on firm constitutional grounds.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what- when I hear you talk about sort of the one, two punch on the economic plan for the president, tax cuts being one of them. Isn't there some coordination on sequencing here? Because wouldn't you go ahead and remove the regulations and go ahead with the tax cuts before you go to war with the entire world over trade?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the president has been talking about these tariffs every speech that I was with him during the during the campaign. There is no surprise here, he's also talked about making sure we don't have this $4 trillion tax increase that the Democrats want to have. We have a lot of work to do to reverse the damage that's been done over the last four years with with the Democrats that led to the highest inflation in 40 years. So the president wants to get a lot of things done, and I want to get a lot of things done in Congress as part of this comprehensive economic plan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sure you saw the Fed chair also say that we may be facing inflation now in part because of these tariffs. You know, some in the Senate are very concerned about having more control and say over trade. Maria Cantwell, a senator who will be with us later in this program partnered with Chuck Grassley, one of the most powerful Republicans, with this bill to try to claw back control. They want 48 hours notice on tariffs. Suggests they didn't get much this time, and they want them to expire after 60 days, unless Congress approves of them. Will leadership let this effort advance?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, Senator Grassley is Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, but let me just say the president is on firm legal grounds here. Over the last 90 years, Congress has given the president's different presidents more and more authority to deal with national security issues, with regard to tariffs, to use tariffs with regard to unfair trade. So the president has the authority. I think this is similar to the bill that Chuck Grassley introduced about five years ago. They had debate then, many of the co-sponsors are the same. This will get a thorough hearing, and then we'll see where it goes from there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think, though, that Congress needs to have more of a say on trade issues?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the Constitution says Congress has the entire say, but over the last 90 years--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not the way it's playing out now\u2013",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: --more and more authority have been given to the president to be able to be more nimble to react in terms of national security, in terms of unfair trade. And I think President Trump is doing what he has every right to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like you're open to making that more clear on what the limits should be.",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, there'll be a discussion in the Senate. We'll see which way the discussion goes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned the work that got done over the weekend. You did take this step forward in advancing the president's tax agenda and raising the debt ceiling with this budget framework, you know what a fight you're going to have with fellow Republicans over it in the house. Jodey Arrington, the budget chairman, called it unserious and disappointing. Accused your Republican colleagues of creating 6 trillion in new costs and a mere 4 billion in enforceable cuts. Is this headed for failure in the house?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: No, we are united in what we believe in terms of making sure we have a nation that is safe and prosperous. The Speaker of the House and the leadership of the House came out and endorsed what we have done, and said, hey, we ought to move ahead and take that next step--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Five Republicans have come out against it--",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: -- so what we have seen--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --that's a pretty narrow margin.",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: \u00a0But- but they all agree with what we want to do, which is unleash American energy to get energy prices down for people. They all agree that we ought to make sure that we don't have these $4 trillion tax increases. They all want to make sure we secure the border. So all of the parts of what we have here are part of what we want to have done. Now I'm the whip. My job is to count votes. We need 51 in the Senate. They need 218 in the house. We have to iron out the differences. We're committed to getting it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we know they're short about five votes right now. So it sounds like if you have to take another bite at the apple, the reason that this matters so much is procedurally, you've got to clear the way for all those big things you want to get, done, like the tax cuts by September. Speaker Johnson said he wants it done by May. Senator Lankford said it has to get done by August. Does all the instability speed things up for you?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, I'm not worried about deadlines. I want to get- I have an urgency to get it done as soon as we can, so we can get these policies in place and also to provide the certainty to people who are worried, are my taxes going to go up at the end of the year? They want to have the confidence that they're not going to go up. I think the more certainty we can provide to the to the folks around the country that they will see that we have- on the right path for a strong, healthy, growing economy, and we want to get the country back on track, and the sooner we can get this passed, the sooner we can reverse the damage the Democrats have done over the last four years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You got to get speaker Johnson to wrangle those votes though, which you admit they're not there right now.",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, we're going to put the language together. We do have to iron out the differences, and I'm committed to getting it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So in about 18 months, Congress will face elections, these midterm races. Here's your fellow Republican, Senator Rand Paul.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Historically, tariffs have also led to political decimation. When McKinley, most famously put tariffs on in 1890 they lost 50% of their seats in the next election, but Hawt-Smooley put on their tariff in the early 1930s we lost the House and the Senate for 60 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN \u00a06:22",
      "Are you afraid history is going to repeat itself in 2026?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, no, I'm not. There's a long way between now and the 2026 elections. President Trump won based on two things that the Democrats were the party of high prices and an open border. No one doubted president Trump's ability to get the border closed and 137,000 illegal immigrants in March of last year, Biden this past much down to 7000 so he has been able to do that. Republicans are going to be judged on the economy, which is why I'm not",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Fed's chairman is saying inflation is going to potentially go up and there's great uncertainty.",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: That's why I want to get this comprehensive economic plan in place as soon as possible. The certainty that the tax increases are not going to be there, the certainty that we have American energy and those jobs, the certainty we're bringing jobs back into the country, all of those things are going to make sure that by the election, 18 months from now, that people say, yeah, we're on the right path. Republicans have gotten the country back. Country is back on track right now from I think it's even your own CBS poll in terms of right track, wrong track, right direction, wrong direction. We're at the highest we've been in 20 years, in terms of the direction the country is heading.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that was pre tariffs. Senator Ted Cruz said this,",
      "TED CRUZ: Tariffs are a tax on consumers, and I'm not a fan of jacking up taxes on American consumers, so my hope is these tariffs are short lived, and they serve as leverage to lower tariffs across the globe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's a lot of concern, including from your your old friend Mitch McConnell. When do you get concerned that this is going to hurt the economic story you are trying to tell?",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, you won't be surprised. Ted and I were on the floor just two in the morning. I said, you know, I bet Margaret's going to show that tape of what you just said about tariffs, and we joked about it a little bit. But there is concern, and there's concern across the country. People are watching the markets. This is not a surprise. People are concerned about this. 40k- 401ks, retirement plans. They do the best when we have confidence in the future, when we have a strong, healthy, growing economy. And that's why we have a comprehensive economic plan to deal with all of this, to making sure the taxes don't go up, to cut so much of this reckless Washington spending, people saw the list of all the terrible things we've been spending money on the last four years, and people were offended and angry at that. What we're doing is also cutting a lot of this reckless Washington spending gives people more money in their own pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Markets move a lot faster than Congress does, Senator. So you've got your work cut out for you, but we appreciate you laying out the details for us.",
      "SEN. JOHN BARRASSO:Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

    "published": "Sun, 06 Apr 2025 15:26:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Probationary workers fired as part of President Trump's downsizing talked about their jobs and their ongoing employment limbo as legal fights continue.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Probationary workers were among the first victims of President Trump's second-term efforts to downsize the federal government. Mass firings across the federal government targeted thousands of them, but legal challenges over their termination have left them in an uneasy employment limbo after a pair of court rulings that cover employees at 20 agencies.",
      "These are workers who are in their first year or two of federal service, depending on their position, although probationary workers can also include experienced U.S. government employees who recently started working in a new position, including through promotions, or at a different agency.",
      "Sara Nelson, 50, was just two days away from the end of her probationary period, which started after she was hired in February 2024 at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA. She previously worked at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a different component of the Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "Nelson, who lives in Georgia, managed multi-million-dollar nationwide campaigns to raise awareness of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. Nelson said she loved the work she was doing and found it meaningful because it helped to connect Americans struggling with their mental health with a vital resource.",
      "\"Federal workers, the vast majority of us, are so dedicated to serving Americans, to serving our country,\" she said. \"We care about efficiencies in government. We're often caught up in these bureaucratic traps as well, but we're trying hard every day to bring 200%. The work of the government serves the American people.\"",
      "Nelson had received a positive performance review in January, she said, but the letter she got from the acting chief human capital officer at the Department of Health and Human Services stated that her \"performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the agency.\"",
      "\"It was totally unsettling,\" she said of receiving the termination letter. \"It's hard to describe because you know your team loves you and wants to keep you. You know there is a huge need, and yet you're being dismissed.\"",
      "Then, on March 18, Nelson received a brief, two-paragraph email from her agency informing her that she had been reinstated to her role. The notification came on the heels of two different court orders that required the administration to bring back probationary employees it had fired at more than a dozen agencies. The Justice Department has now asked the Supreme Court to lift one of those orders, covering more than 16,000 probationary workers at six agencies.",
      "\"HHS has canceled your separation from duty and you have been restored to duty in a paid Administrative Leave status through at least the end of this week. We will update you further once we have more information,\" the message Nelson received to her personal email address read.",
      "While the note included two email addresses to direct questions, Nelson said messages she sent about back pay have gone unanswered. She also has not received any further information about her position at SAMHSA since learning of her reinstatement, Nelson said.",
      "SAMHSA was impacted by layoffs of up to 10,000 people at the Health and Human Services Department. Another 10,000 at the department took early retirement or voluntary separation officers.",
      "While Mr. Trump and the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is leading the effort to shrink the size of the federal government, often speak of the need to root out waste at federal agencies, Nelson said there was never any assessment done within SAMHSA to pinpoint areas to improve efficiency.",
      "\"I can't describe the level of stress and confusion about what's happening,\" she said. \"We get the rug pulled out from under us multiple times. We're trying to find other jobs. But it's like, should I interview or might I get my old job back that I absolutely loved? But all we know at this point is we have to move forward.\"",
      "Court records have revealed that more than 24,500 federal workers who were in their probationary periods were fired in mid-February and have since been reinstated to comply with the judicial orders. Most of those employees have been put on administrative leave, agencies said, and whether they will be allowed to keep those jobs \u2014 and for how long \u2014 remains uncertain.",
      "\"They're trying to extend the authority of the executive, and the authority of [the Office of Personnel Management] in a manner that is completely inconsistent with the law and with the way the civil service system is set up to work,\" Michelle Bercovici, a lawyer at Alden Law Group who represents federal employees, said.",
      "Bercovici said federal employees can be fired and held accountable for performance, but \"you just have to follow the rules.\"",
      "Legal proceedings in the two cases involving the mass firings of government workers are ongoing, and on Tuesday, one of the judges issued a preliminary injunction that blocked terminations of probationary workers in 19 states and the District of Columbika, which sued over the removals.",
      "The injunction from U.S. District Judge James Bredar effectively extends an earlier decision ordering reinstatements at 20 agencies, but only for workers in the states that sued.",
      "Separate from the courts, some workers have found relief through the Merit Systems Protection Board, which reviews federal employee terminations.",
      "Isabel Dziak, 30, is among U.S. Forest Service workers in Juneau, Alaska, who were laid off in February. She served as a lead ranger at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center, a role that not only educates tourists but handles any medical emergencies and park safety.\u00a0 The park serves 25,000 visitors a day in peak season, according to Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, with the first cruise ships of the year set to arrive next week.",
      "Dziak said her team was gutted during government-wide probationary layoffs, and she was among the casualties because she was still in a probationary period, thanks to a promotion in 2023. She lost what she described as her dream job.",
      "\"I really showed up to my job every day, loving it and wanting to do the best and worked really hard to make a career for myself,\" Dziak said. \"Having it stolen in such an illegal way is just unfathomable.\"",
      "In late February, then-special counsel Hampton Dellinger filed a request with the Merit Systems Protection Board for a 45-day pause on the firings of roughly 6,000 probationary workers at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which includes the Forest Service.",
      "The board granted the stay early last month and ordered USDA employees to be reinstated to their positions.",
      "Dellinger had made his request to the MSPB while he pursued litigation challenging his own firing by Mr. Trump. A federal appeals court allowed his removal on March 5, the day the board granted his request to pause the USDA workers' firings. Dellinger has since dropped his case.",
      "In an earlier statement, he said the Office of Special Counsel \"requested this stay because the thousands of probationary terminations at USDA appear to have been carried out in a manner inconsistent with federal personnel laws.\"",
      "It's unclear who is serving as the acting special counsel. A request for comment from the Office of Special Counsel was not returned, and that information is not available on the agency's website. The acting special counsel would ask the MSPB to extend the pause on the firings of USDA workers that is set to expire on April 18.",
      "Mr. Trump also fired a member of the MSPB, leaving it with one member, acting chairman Henry Kerner. Because Kerner is the sole member of the board, it lacks a quorum and cannot issue final decisions on petitions for review until it is restored.",
      "\"The fundamentals of the civil service system are directly under fire,\" Bercovici said. \"The processes are still moving along as they should, but the administration is targeting the tips of the spear, the critical chokepoints where decisions actually happen.\"",
      "The administration believes it will prevail as the cases work their way up to the Supreme Court, arguing the firings were within the administration's authority to manage its internal affairs.",
      "A senior administration official blamed the lower courts and \"activist judges\" for keeping probationary employees in limbo and claimed many employees have moved on. The administration hopes they seek employment in the private sector, the official said.",
      "At the USDA, workers including Dziak have also received what was billed as a \"second and final\" deferred resignation offer, running through April 8.",
      "A spokesman said the Agriculture Department is giving employees an opportunity \"to take control of their next step in federal service before any changes take place.\" Roughly 75,000 federal workers accepted an earlier offer from the Trump administration to leave their government positions but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "After weighing whether to take the new offer and wondering if she was even eligible, Dziak decided to accept it, though it's pending approval from the agency. In the meantime, she says she's received two paychecks, as part of the backpay ordered by the MSPB.",
      "She said she was also asked about her interest in returning to work but is worried she could be fired in a future reduction-in-force.",
      "A major factor for Dziak is having health insurance coverage and whether she would be able to keep her plan until September through the deferred resignation program, she said. If not, Dziak said she may have to go back on Medicaid.",
      "\"That's kind of the sticky situation that I find myself in, plus the moral of do I want to take this essentially buyout,\" she said. \"Morally, I don't want to be bought out from my job that I've been battling to keep and ultimately decided to walk away from because the work environment is just terrible.\"",
      "Dziak called the confusion surrounding what happens next for federal workers like her \"disheartening.\"",
      "Alex, a National Park Service employee who works at a site in New York City, started his job in May 2024 and was working on programs for America's 250th Birthday celebration next year.",
      "Alex, who asked to be identified by his first name because he is still waiting to receive full back pay, said he was looking forward to educating park site visitors on the nation's history. Expecting to receive a termination email on Valentine's Day, when thousands of other probationary workers did, Alex said he left for the day after receiving no word from his agency.",
      "But when he returned on Monday, Alex said he had an after-hours email from Feb. 14 saying he had been fired for performance reasons, even though his most recent performance review rated him as \"fully successful.\"",
      "\"My biggest concern was with my career,\" he said. \"The main reason I took this job was to advance my career in the federal government.\"",
      "Alex said he had been working toward a specific hiring designation for certain employees of a land management agency, which allows them to compete for permanent positions in the competitive service, and qualified for it after he was fired and then reinstated.",
      "Like the other federal workers who were abruptly fired and then rehired, Alex said he received an email informing him that his termination had been canceled and cited his work on America's 250th Birthday as the reason. But he hasn't received any further guidance about benefits, and when he returned to his office, he didn't have a computer or an access card for more than a week.",
      "Alex said he still has several months on his lease in New York City but is applying now for other jobs, including as a state park ranger and at other federal agencies.",
      "\"Everyone is scared, and it puts a damper on working here,\" he said. \"It had been exciting, being in the big city working on these programs for the public, for the anniversary. Now, I just want to leave.\"",

      "We will get the latest from President Trump's point man on tariffs, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and check in with the number two Senate Republican, John Barrasso. He's tasked with carrying out the other part of the president's economic agenda, sweeping tax cuts.",
      "House Republican Don Bacon and Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell will also join us. They want Congress to reclaim its authority over trade policy.",
      "Then, as the administration continues talks with Russia for a possible peace deal in Ukraine, we will ask NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte what the budding relationship could mean for the future of the Western alliance.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "It is shaping up to be another turbulent week, as President Trump's trade war with the world escalates. The global sell-off triggered by President Trump's tariff announcements wiped out more than $6 trillion of wealth from the U.S. stock market in just two days.",
      "In a social media post yesterday, the president urged the country to hang tough, all this as tens of thousands of people took to the streets yesterday from Washington, D.C., to Minnesota and Columbus, Ohio, protesting many of Trump's policies, Elon Musk and tariffs.",
      "We begin this morning with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.",
      "Mr. Secretary, welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "HOWARD LUTNICK (U.S. Commerce Secretary): Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see about 60 percent of Americans have money in the stock market, which mean that retirees could be just as concerned as hedge fund managers this morning.",
      "Did you expect this level of shock in the financial markets?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, you have got to realize this is a national security issue. I mean, we don't make medicine in this country anymore. We don't make ships. We don't have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle, right?",
      "All our semiconductors are made overseas, so every button we press when we try to start our car or even use our microwave, these are all semiconductors. They're all made elsewhere. We have got to start to protect ourselves, and we have got to stop having all the countries of the world ripping us off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit, and the rest of the world has a surplus with us. They're earning our money. They're taking our money.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And Donald Trump has seen this, and he's going to stop it.",
      "So it is going to be a big change. Of course, it's going to be a big change, but the rest of the world has been ripping us off for all these many years. Donald Trump has seen it. He's spoken about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand that. And\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he's just not going to take it anymore, and that's his model.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that was abundantly clear during the presidential campaign how much the president truly believes in tariffs and putting it at the center of his economic policy.",
      "But you saw absolute panic in the global markets. Did you expect that, or were you surprised?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, I think the point is, you need to reset the power of the United States of America and reset it against all our allies and our enemies alike.",
      "The idea that all the countries of the world can run trade surpluses with America and buy our things with us, remember, $1.2 trillion \u2013 in 1980, we were a net investor, meaning we owned more of the rest of the world than they owned of us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, it's a different world. This is a different market.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And now \u2013 and now they own $18 trillion of us net. So that means the rest of the world \u2013 every year, when we run a $1.2 trillion deficit, the rest of the world buys $1.2 trillion of America.",
      "And it goes up and up and up, and eventually we're not going to own America, and we are going to be owned by the rest of the world.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 we can't fly a plane, we can't build our own planes, we don't have our own semiconductors. This is what the president is here to fix for America. It's in his hands and he wants to fix America. This is his chance to fix America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And we need him to fix it for our children and our grandchildren.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but for businesses to do what you're doing, because what I hear you laying out there is a plan to reindustrialize the United States and to bring companies back to America.",
      "For a CEO to choose to invest\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well said. Well said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But for a CEO to make those decisions, you know this, they need certainty. They need to know if it costs them more to stay overseas or if it costs them more to move here.",
      "So can you give them clarity, so that they don't just cut jobs because they're dealing with the cost of these tariffs? Can you tell them how long they're staying in place?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Absolutely.",
      "The United States of America is going to protect the people who invest in America. Trillions and trillions of dollars, you heard the president speak about it, are coming to invest in America. This is the economy of the world.",
      "We are the consumer of the world, and companies need to build it here and we will protect them for building it here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So does\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We will help the American workers. Yes, American workers are more expensive, but they're better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I got it.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We're going to protect all the factories that come to America. And that's what's coming here. So, the president is on it. He's going to protect them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Is the 10 percent tariff permanent?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, remember, this is a national security issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I got it. Is the 10 percent tariff permanent?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he needs to address our budget deficit.",
      "That \u2013 you know, the laws of America are the laws of America. He would like it to be that we need to protect the companies that invest here and we are going to protect the companies that invest here. That is the policy of the United States of America. That's why trillions of dollars are coming here.",
      "The ripoff of the United States of America is over.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: All these companies are going to come and invest here. That's what they're doing. That's why they have committed trillions of dollars. They know this is the economy. This is the place to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Mr. Secretary, though \u2013 Mr. Secretary, the campaign is over. You won.",
      "So I'm asking what the plan is. So, the Treasury secretary said on another network: \"We're going to hold the course. It's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.\"",
      "That makes it sound like the tariffs are staying in place at least for days or weeks. Is that correct? Or is the president considering postponing implementation to negotiate?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: There is no postponing. They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. That is sort of obvious.",
      "The president needs to reset global trade. Everybody has a trade surplus and we have a trade deficit. We are paying away our future and our lives. The countries of the world are ripping us off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And it's got to end. The president has made it crystal, crystal clear. This is the policy.",
      "We are going to protect \u2013 the factories that come build in America, we are going to protect them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: They're going to be successful. That's why they're going to build in America, the greatest economy in the Earth.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: All of these companies are going to come and build here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when three of the president's other economic advisers who are on other networks today say that 50 different countries have been calling the White House to try to talk about the tariffs, what does that mean?",
      "Because that makes it sound like there is a negotiation, which is different from saying the tariffs are permanent.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Well, what it shows is that all these countries know that they have been ripping us off and the day has come for that to end.",
      "Now, the problem is, it's not just tariffs. Like, I will give you an example. Like, Vietnam said, they'd like to be zero-zero. Remember, Vietnam sends us $120 billion worth of goods every year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, cheap manufacturing.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And we send them about $12 billion. Wait. We send them $12 billion.",
      "So it's not the tariffs. It has nothing to do with tariffs. If they went to zero-zero, they would go to $200 billion with us. We need to stop the ripoff. And zero-zero is the way to make them more of a ripoff.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but we don't have zero-zero, sir.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We need\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We don't have zero-zero, actually, because when we saw the president stand in the Rose Garden holding up that chart that you helped make, that wasn't actually tariffs.",
      "That was actually confusing to investors, because it was some kind of other formula. And the countries themselves seemed kind of random. Like, why are the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, which don't export to the United States and are quite literally inhabited by penguins, why do they face 10 percent tariffs?",
      "Did you use A.I. to generate this?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No. No, the idea \u2013 look, the idea is that there are many countries left off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are they on the list?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Because the idea \u2013 what happens is, if you leave anything off the list, the countries that try to basically arbitrage America go through those countries to us.",
      "Any country \u2013 like, we had tariffs \u2013 the president put tariffs on China, right, in 2018. And then what China started doing is, they started going through other countries to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: They just built through other countries through America.",
      "And so the president knows that. He's tired of it. And he's going to fix that. So, basically, he said, look, I can't let any part of the world be a place where China or other countries can ship through them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Through the\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: So he ended those loopholes, these ridiculous loopholes.",
      "And now what he's trying to say is, I'm going to fix the trade deficit of the United States of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: It's a national security issue. We need to make medicine. We need to make semiconductors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: We need to make ships. We need to have steel and aluminum. Come on, we need the greatness of America to actually be built in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he's tired of getting ripped off by the rest of the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, but, just to be clear, April 9, the so-called retaliatory tariffs, the reciprocal tariffs, I should say, are those coming or are they open to negotiation?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The tariffs are coming.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: He announced it and he wasn't kidding.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The tariffs are coming. Of course they are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Is the administration considering any kind of offset, any kind of subsidy? You mentioned, the first administration, there was some bailout to farmers to help them deal with the pain from Chinese retaliation.",
      "Are you looking at that now?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: I'm \u2013 not that I have \u2013 I have not participated in any meetings with respect to that. The country is focused on \u2013 you realize, trillions of dollars of factories are going to be built in America. That's huge GDP. The factories being built in America are huge GDP.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That takes years.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And that is going to matter to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have said that robots are going to fill those jobs. So, those aren't union worker jobs.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: No, it's really automated jobs. It's automated factories, automated factories. But the key is, who's going to build the factories, who's going to operate the factories, who's going to make them work, great American workers.",
      "You know, we are going to replace\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said robots on other networks. You said that to FOX.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 the armies of millions of people \u2013 well, remember, the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little, little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America.",
      "It's going to be automated. And great Americans, the tradecraft of America, is going to fix them, is going to work on them. They're going to be mechanics. There's going to be HVAC specialists. There's going to be electricians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: The tradecraft of America, our high school- educated Americans, the core to our work force is going to have the greatest resurgence\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories, which are all coming to America. That's what's going to build our next generation of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you concerned that \u2013 are you concerned, in the time it will take for a company to move to America, that it will benefit China in the \u2013 in the immediate term, that other markets will look to other suppliers, instead of dealing with the United States?",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: That is ridiculous. The problem is, everyone in the world sells to us.",
      "Our economy is the consumer of the world. We are the only one with a trade deficit. The rest of the world has a trade surplus. Why does Europe have a trade surplus? Is there something about Europe that's special? Seriously, are they a different world than we are? Why are they selling $200 billion a year\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary\u2026",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: \u2026 more to us?",
      "It's because it's not fair. The rules are made not fair. And President Trump is going to fix them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And he's doing it for America, and he's doing it for your children and mine and our grandchildren. This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And Donald Trump's been talking about this his whole life. This is Donald Trump's agenda.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: And we're all here to help him execute it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we will take him at his word, quite literally.",

      "Good to have you here in person, Senator.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO (R-Wyoming): Thanks. Great to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you about what the secretary just laid out. He did not describe this as leverage to get to a deal, said this \u2013 take him literally \u2013 the tariffs are here to stay.",
      "We have already seen some conservative groups, like the New Civil Liberties Alliance, file suit, saying that these are not on solid constitutional and legal ground. Do you think the president's on solid legal ground?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well I think he is.",
      "But, look, this is about a monumental change in the direction of our government. We are \u2013 and I'm talking about a change in terms of the size, as well as the priorities. And this is a 180-degree change from what we had for the last four years with big government, big spending, big taxes.",
      "And we have a comprehensive economic plan to get to a strong, healthy, growing economy for the American people. That's why we passed what we did just yesterday in the Senate, because we want people to have more \u2013 better jobs, more opportunities, and more money in their own pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: So, in terms of the tariffs, I believe they're a tool.",
      "And I think we have to go after China. They have been abusing us for years. And I believe the president is on const \u2013 firm constitutional grounds.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when I hear you talk about sort of the one-two punch on the economic plan for the president, tax cuts being one of them, isn't there some coordination on sequencing here?",
      "Because wouldn't you go ahead and remove the regulations and go ahead with the tax cuts before you go to war with the entire world over trade?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the president has been talking about these tariffs every speech that I was with him during the campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was indeed.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: There is no surprise here. He's also talked about making sure we don't have this $4 trillion tax increase that the Democrats want to have.",
      "We have a lot of work to do to reverse the damage that's been done over the last four years with the Democrats that led to the highest inflation in 40 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: So the president wants to get a lot of things done. And I want to get a lot of things done in Congress as part of this comprehensive economic plan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm sure you saw the Fed chair also say that we may be facing inflation now in part because of these tariffs.",
      "You know some in the Senate are very concerned about having more control and say over trade. Maria Cantwell, a senator who will be with us later in this program, partnered with Chuck Grassley, one of the most powerful Republicans, with this bill to try to claw back control. They want 48 hours' notice on tariffs, suggest they didn't get much this time.",
      "And they want them to expire after 60 days unless Congress approves of them. Will leadership let this effort advance?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, Senator Grassley is chairman of the Judiciary Committee.",
      "But let me just say, the president is on firm legal grounds here. Over the last 90 years, Congress has given the presidents, different presidents, more and more authority to deal with national security issues with regard to tariffs, to use tariffs with regard to unfair trade. So the president has the authority.",
      "I think this is similar to the bill that Chuck Grassley introduced about five years ago. They had debate then. Many of the cosponsors are the same. This will get a thorough hearing, and then we will see where it goes from there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think, though, that Congress needs to have more of a say on trade issues?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, the Constitution says Congress has the entire say, but over the last 90 years\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's not the way it's playing out now.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: \u2026 more and more authority has been given to the president to be able to be more nimble to react in terms of national security, in terms of unfair trade.",
      "And I think President Trump is doing what he has every right to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like you're open to making that more clear on what the limits should be?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, there will be a discussion in the Senate. We will see which way the discussion goes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned the work that got done over the weekend. You did take the step forward in advancing the president's tax agenda and raising the debt ceiling with this budget framework.",
      "You know what a fight you're going to have with fellow Republicans over in the House. Jodey Arrington, the Budget chairman, called it unserious and disappointing, accused your Republican colleagues of creating $6 trillion in new costs and a mere $4 billion in enforceable cuts.",
      "Is this headed for failure in the House?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: No.",
      "We are united in what we believe in terms of making sure we have a nation that is safe and prosperous. The speaker of the House and the leadership of the House came out and endorsed what we have done and said, hey, we ought to move ahead and take that next step.",
      "So what we have seen\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Five Republicans have come out against it. And it's a pretty narrow margin.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: But they all agree with what we want to do, which is unleash American energy to get energy prices down for people. They all agree that we ought to make sure that we don't have these $4 trillion tax increases.",
      "They all want to make sure we secure the border. So all of the parts of what we have here are part of what we want to have done. Now, I'm the whip. My job is to count votes. We need 51 in the Senate. They need 218 in the House. We have to iron out the differences. We're committed to getting it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know they're short about five votes right now. So it sounds like, if you have to take another bite at the apple \u2013 the reason that this matters so much is procedurally you have got to clear the way for all those big things you want to get done, like the tax cuts, by September.",
      "Speaker Johnson said he wants it done by May. Senator Lankford said it has to get done by August. Does all the instability speed things up for you?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, I'm not worried about deadlines. I want to get \u2013 I have an urgency to get it done as soon as we can, so we can get these policies in place and also to provide the certainty to people who are worried, are my taxes going to go up at the end of the year?",
      "They want to have the confidence that they're not going to go up. I think the more certainty we can provide to the folks around the country, that they will see that we have \u2013 on the right path for a strong, healthy, growing economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: And we want to get the country back on track. And the sooner we can get this passed, the sooner we can reverse the damage that the Democrats have done over the last four years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have got to get Speaker Johnson to wrangle those votes, though\u2026",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which you admit they're not there right now?",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Well, we're going to put the language together. We do have to iron out the differences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: And I'm committed to getting it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, in about 18 months, Congress will face elections, these midterm races.",

      "And that's why we have a comprehensive economic plan to deal with all of this, to making sure the taxes don't go up, to cut so much of this reckless Washington spending. People saw the list of all the terrible things we've been spending money on in the last four years, and people were offended and angry at that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: We're \u2013 what we're doing is also cutting a lot of this reckless Washington spending, gives people more money in their own pockets.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know markets move a lot faster than Congress does, Senator.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: They do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've got your work cut out for you.",
      "But we appreciate you laying out the details for us.",
      "SENATOR JOHN BARRASSO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you miss an interview or an episode of Face the Nation, you can watch it on our YouTube page or on FacetheNation.com.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell and Republican Congressman Don Bacon. They have some ideas about how Congress can rein in the president's power to issue tariffs.",
      "And we will discuss that on the other side of this break. So, stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We turn now to the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, Washington state senator, Maria Cantwell.",
      "Good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL (D-WA): Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Senator, you heard the - the Senate whip talk about your effort to claw back some control over trade. He said it will have a thorough hearing and we'll see where it goes from there. Do you have any indication of momentum among some of your Republican colleagues?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, the first day of interdiction we signed up seven Republicans. So, usually you don't get first introduction and get so many people on board. But I think it shows the anxiety that people have. I'm sure if they listen to their constituents, consumer challenges are already starting to surface. And certainly the stock market's impact on retirement income is shaking a lot of people.",
      "So, I'm sure my colleagues will hear from them. Today consumer groups are announcing and retailers the fact that they want Congress to take this action up. And so, I think we're hearing from a big segment of the economy, the consumer spending is a big part of GDP, and they're worried.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've got, what six Republicans at this point?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Seven.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Seven. And now you're saying retailers. Like, you have CEOs who are onboard or industry groups?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Industry groups, like the Retailers Association, the outdoor industry, the Consumer Electronics Group, Main Street Alliance, organizations who know their bread and butter comes from consumer spending, which is a big part of our economy. And so, they are very anxious about a plan.",
      "Listen, I listened to your segment. I've never heard so much about fuzzy math in my life. And the notion that that chart is getting so much national attention, you know, the letters in Greek - all the stuff that makes no sense. That's what people are - consumers are saying. How is this helping me, in a time of inflation? You're adding to my cost with a tax on my consumer goods.",
      "And so, I think that's why we're gaining support from these organizations today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Canada and China are among your state's largest export markets. Both of - have already announced retaliatory tariffs. I know you've said previously that the first Trump administration and the more limited tariffs still to this day have an impact on your state. So, how much wiggle room do we have with time here? Because you heard the Commerce secretary say that basically these aren't a negotiating ploy, that they are staying in place. That's what he says.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, I -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, how long before damage?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, we're - we have seen damage from the first Trump tariffs on things like apples, and markets closed. And what you do is you end up then losing farm family economies. You don't necessarily lose farmland. Some big corporation might buy it. But you lose family farms. So, our objective should be to help farmers open up doors to these overseas markets.",
      "The United States' goal here should be to make great manufactured products and grow great agriculture products and then get those markets opened up. But what the president is doing is instead of building those alliances, he basically is getting into a trade war that is having unbelievable impact, when his last tariffs on India -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: We reopened with the apple market and we went to India and said, let's - let's get rid of this. And we were successful. And that's the kind of action we would have - we want to see today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your state is one of the top five unionized states in the country. You have the world's largest plane manufacturer, Boeing, in Washington. So, I wonder if those union workers are as supportive of the tariffs as the auto industry workers have been. They are not against them, even though some are Democrats. In fact, they think some of them, including on this program, like Shawn Fain, have been very supportive.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, we're seeing - you could get the letter from the Machinist International. They don't support the president on this. And that is because they understand how much the United States and Canada have become an integrated supply chain. That helped us lower the cost of U.S. manufacturing for cars and for airplanes. And lowering that cost means that we're even more competitive.",
      "So, they don't like the uncertainty. And what they would like to see instead is the continuation of investment from the last administration. So, when you think of chips and science, and you think of the Inflation Reduction Act that made investments in next generation technology, the sectors that have a lot of employees want to win on innovation. They know that investment in innovation will help us outpace our competition, not a tariff that makes the product more expensive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Boeing's CEO testified, 80 percent of the airplanes they deliver are to markets outside the U.S., 80 percent of the content of those airplanes are manufactured here. They have a vested interest in clearing the decks for themselves here. What are they telling you about their conversations with the administration?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, everybody's concerned that the administration might retaliate against them. That, you know, that if they're not front and center in this - in this debate, but they're clear that they are being heard. I think people are saying that their strategy is - there's a demand for 40,000 airplanes and we could increase 1,000 more planes being sold, it would have a huge impact on the trade deficit.",
      "So, they are trying so say, Mr. President, don't cut the innovation and investment. Don't make semiconductors more expensive. Don't make the parts more expensive. Make it cheaper. And the United States bet on the American worker, and they will do the rest when it comes to the innovation that's required for America to build the best products.",
      "So, I think the president's math is wrong. I think he doesn't know the calculus is going to be so devastating to American consumers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CANTWELL: And that's why those groups are joining us today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cantwell, thank you for your time today.",
      "CANTWELL: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Nebraska Republican Congressman Don Bacon, who joins us this morning from Omaha.",
      "Congressman, I have a lot to get to with you on a number of topics here. But just to - to pick up on the tariffs that we've been speaking about. I know you are introducing companion legislation to what Senator Cantwell just laid out for us. But as I understand it, in the House, Republican leaders have already restricted the ability to rein in changes to the Mexico, Canada and China tariffs. They've tucked language into the continuing resolution.",
      "Does that get in your way when you are trying to now claw back some congressional control of tariffs?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON (R-NE): Well, first of all, good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me on.",
      "And I enjoyed listening to Senator Cantwell. I - I support the legislation that Senator Grassley, Senator Cantwell, we have a total of seven Republicans in the Senate. And I have some beginning support in the House side which will unveil tomorrow. It will be harder to pass this in the House no doubt. I think if we get 60 votes in the Senate it will put pressure on the House to look at this. And if we continue to see the stock market go a certain direction or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, I think then this bill becomes a very viable bill.",
      "So, it will not pass tomorrow -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Or maybe in the next couple weeks. But this will be in the queue that we can use. And it's time that Congress restores its authorities here. And the Constitution is clear, the House and the Senate, Congress has the power of tariffs and taxes. And we gave some of that power to executive branch. And I think, in hindsight, that was a mistake.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I hear you saying you have some momentum. Respectfully, sir, the president talked all the time during the campaign about tariffs. He put them at the centerpiece of his policy. He talked about the glory days of the 1800s and wanting to go back to them. Did Republicans just not take him seriously?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Well, there's a couple of facets to your question, Margaret. It's a good question. You're right, though, when you look back, it was Republicans supported tariffs in the 1800s. And up and through, what, 1930, when we passed the Smoot-Hartley Act that created one of the worst - well, the worst depressions we ever had, we learned from that, that tariffs and protectionism does not work and that free trade, in the end, as long as it's fair, we want fair trade. And I support the president wanting to get fairness. Some of these countries do treat us wrong. But fair trade should be the goal.",
      "And you're right, the president talked about those. He did not hide as this is part of his agenda. But here's my take on it, and I've - I've been studying politics since I was like 13 years old. People voted for President Trump because of the border. And he has really delivered there. They voted for him, too, because inflation surpassed wage increases. They've - they were poorer today than they were four years ago. And I really think people voted for President Trump because of that, the border, and maybe crime if they - crime in the big cities.",
      "I don't think, in the end, I don't think tariffs was really a big factor in people's decision-making when it came to last November.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, I just - I know we certainly covered them on this program. And it is surprising to me, or perhaps it shouldn't be, that the business community is so silent right now. As Senator Cantwell said, she said they're afraid.",
      "But there is a conservative group, the New Civil Liberties Alliance, that filed suit to challenge these tariffs in court. Do you think it is the courts where this ultimately gets settled?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I think ultimately it's in Congress once we see enough of this, but maybe the courts as well.",
      "The Constitution makes it very clear, Congress has control of taxes. And by the way - and let's be candid, tariffs are a tax. But they also mention tariffs in the Constitution. And we gave the president emergency powers. So, the courts will have to decide is what - what just happened, is this emergency powers or is this a total change in tariff policy. And I think it's really the latter. This is where Congress has to step in and say, do we really want to create this new policy on tariffs? And if it is, it should come from the Congress and not the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about your work on the Armed Services Committee. President Trump has fired the top two officials at the head of the very powerful National Security Agency. It's one of the most powerful intelligence agencies we have. It vacuums up information around the world through wiretapping, signals intercepts and they work with the military, with Cyber Command.",
      "Have you received any explanation to Congress as to why General Haugh, the four-star general unanimously confirmed to the job, was suddenly dismissed?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Margaret, I have not. But let me just comment on this. General Haugh is the absolute best leader in the U.S. military to lead Cyber Command and National Security Agency. He commanded both because half of Cyber Command relies on NSA to be effective in cyber operations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: So, you have to have this team. And he was in charge of both. He served 34 years in the military, and his entire career was working signals intelligence or cyber operations. Frankly, he is the best that we had. And they also fired the number two person at the National Security Agency without an explanation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I will tell you, this puts us back. It hurts us. And I will tell you, Russia and China today are laughing at us because we just fired the absolute best leaders, the most qualified. Guys that we spent three and a half decades preparing to have this role, and he's gone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: And it's - it's heartbreaking to see that that decision was made without explanation. And it hurt us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And - and our reporting, as a network, is that it came as a decision following an Oval Office meeting with a right-wing activist named Laura Loomer, who has spread conspiracy theories about 9/11, said anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant things, racist things.",
      "It also happened as at least six other National Security Council officials at the White House were dismissed on the advice of Laura Loomer.",
      "I'm wondering, again respectfully, sir, Republicans are in control and you have oversight. Are there going to be hearings on this? Are there other Republicans who are concerned and going to do something about it?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I'm sure there will be some oversight. I'm a - I'm the chairman of the Cyber Subcommittee, and so I guarantee you that we will have various military leaders, we'll have the secretary of defense speak to us, and he will be asked about this. And I will -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did he even know?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: I don't know that he knew, but we'll find out when we ask him. We'll ask him. He'll say that this is the president's right. And the president does have constitutional right to do this. But it doesn't make it appropriate or - OK, he may have the constitutional authority to do it, but it doesn't make it right.",
      "And, in the end, I'm going to make it clear, we just removed the most qualified military leader that we had to run Cyber Command and NSA. And we will ask about it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Now, we have oversight. That doesn't mean we can - the president does have the constitutional authority to do this. But we have a - we have an opportunity to probe into this and ask why.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you -",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: And I have a responsibility to make clear this was wrong. It hurt us. It hurt our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, do you think it is so that the president can split up those two commands and put someone of his own choosing, a political ally, at the top of the NSA?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: You know, it's possible. I know that's out there. But I would say that's a mistake. NSA is very important to Cyber Command. You can't do Cyber Command without the inputs from the National Security Agency, the SECNET (ph).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: If you separate them and put them under two different commands, then you're going to create a dysfunctional partnership and it will hurt our cyber operations against China and Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "OK. Congressman, we'd love to have you back for another conversation about cyber one time.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE DON BACON: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On Friday we spoke with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and began our conversation by asking about the potential impact of the Trump administration's sweeping global tariffs on the security alliance.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
      "MARK RUTTE, SECRETARY GENERAL, NATO: There are tensions between the allies because of these - this tariffs question. But this is not concerning the alliance as a whole because there will be potentially impact on - on the economies, but not to an extent that it will impact our collective defense. That's my firm conviction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The next summit is now going to be held in June. And leaders there expected to hike the military budget spending goal from 2 percent to 3 percent. The Trump administration wants it all the way up to spending about 5 percent on a country's own defense.",
      "How do you convince members to spend more, to counter the threat from Russia, at a time when the U.S. is going closer to it and the U.S. is putting economic pressure on Europe?",
      "MARK RUTTE: What Trump has done since he came into office is break the deadlock when it comes to this terrible war in Ukraine because we've got to stop the killing. We have got to stop the fighting. And I commend him for that.",
      "And then when it comes to defense spending, last couple of months, here in the European side of NATO, it is staggering, the amount of billions coming in. We have to continue doing this because, as I said in December, if he would stick to the old 2 percent, we cannot defend ourselves here in three to five years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at the same time that President Trump is calling for a peace deal in Ukraine, there is this parallel, separate effort to repair America's relationship with Russia. Doesn't the U.S. getting closer to Russia undercut your efforts to counter Russia?",
      "MARK RUTTE: Of course, I am - I am not in the room when all these talks take place. But what I am seeing from a - from distance and hearing from my American colleagues and all - including the president, whom I visited a couple weeks ago in a very successful meeting we had in the Oval Office and - and - and during lunch. There is this effort to bring this war to an end. The goal clearly is in the court of the Russians. They are not moving fast enough, is my impression, including the impression I'm getting from my American interlocutors. That - that Russia really has to do more to bring this war to an end. The Ukrainians are - are really close to the American position. And - and - and we have seen - we have to see how far the Americans can get this.",
      "But I am completely supporting that effort because this war of protection - - protection, it was unsustainable in the long term. So many people dying. So much of the Ukrainian infrastructure being damaged. Cities being destroyed. It's got to end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: General Cavoli, who you know well as the supreme allied commander of NATO, the U.S. general, is here in Washington testifying this week. He said, \"Russia intends to diminish U.S. leadership and influence.\" What is happening to NATO members here? And - and is Russia succeeding in this destabilization campaign?",
      "MARK RUTTE: What we are seeing in Europe, but also in the U.S., but - but let me speak for the European side of NATO, is that the Russians, through cyberattacks, assassination attempts, jamming commercial airplanes in the Baltic area, cyberattacks on the national health service in the United Kingdom, cutting critical (INAUDIBLE) infrastructure between the Baltic countries and Finland, and in other parts of the Baltic - in the Baltic Sea. They are - they are conducting this campaign.",
      "The good news is that as NATO, as collective, we are much, much better, not only at assessing what is happening, but also making sure that we prevent the next steps in this campaign from happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So that destabilization campaign has not halted or paused as these attempts to broker peace have been underway?",
      "MARK RUTTE: Well, I mean, this whole destabilization campaign is going on for years now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MARK RUTTE: And I have no day to day assessment. But the reports we are getting is that Russia is still very active. We are still worried about, for example, (INAUDIBLE) infrastructure. But things do (INAUDIBLE). And in his role as supreme allied commander, we have in - in less than ten days brought together a big endeavor by European NATO allies in the - in the Baltic Sea to really make it very difficult for the Russians to continue doing this.",
      "And again they - they hate us for this. And - and I love that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There are roughly about 90,000 or more U.S. troops stationed in Europe right now. Secretary Hegseth said Europe should not assume that presence is going to last forever. I know you say that the U.S. is committed to NATO, but do you have any sense of how fast or significant this kind of drawdown that's being mentioned by Hegseth could be? And is there NATO backup plan?",
      "MARK RUTTE: There are no concrete plans for the drawdown, but we know, and Pete Hegseth was very clear on this, is that this U.S. administration, but, by the way, this is U.S. policy since 2010, to pivot more towards Asia, towards the Indo-Pacific.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "MARK RUTTE: And agreement we have is that we will do whatever is necessary, and in surprises way. I completely acknowledge the fact that U.S. has, the United States, has more theaters to attend to, not only the Euro-Atlantic, but also the Indo-Pacific.",
      "And by the way, also thanks to President Trump and his position on this, as NATO we will be more and more active in the Indo-Pacific, with our partners. I will visit Japan next week to have my meetings there with the senior leadership to see how we can intensify that strong relationship we already have with the Indo-Pacific.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've raised concern that China is building towards 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030. Is that a direct threat to NATO?",
      "MARK RUTTE: It is. It is a direct threat to the stability of the whole world, including NATO territory, absolutely. They have now more NATO ships sailing than the United States. We have a problem. The United States, part of NATO, Canadian part of NATO, European part of the NATO, that we are not producing enough defense industrial product. We are producing, in - in a full year in ammunition what Russia is producing in three months, that's totally crazy. And that's why the president and I discussed and the other senior leaders in the U.S. and I discussed also with European allies that we have not only to ramp up spending, but also the defense industrial production, that includes cutting the red tape, both in the U.S. and here in Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, just to quickly clarify that - China's nuclear arsenal is a direct threat to NATO?",
      "MARK RUTTE: Well, it's there not to be used against China. But I would say, amore generally, let's not be naive about China. The build up of their armed forces is taking place at a pace which is incredible. And when we talk about Ukraine and bringing Ukraine to a durable end and a peace, a durable peace in the end, let's not forget that Russia is working with North Korea and China and Iran, and that in the end it is an audience of one watching what comes out of this. And that is the first secretary of the communist party of China, Xi Jinping, and he will access when there is a deal on Ukraine, who comes out on top. Is it the west or is it Russia? And if it is Russia, he would get his thoughts going about his territorial claims in the Indo-Pacific. So, there are big risks involved. And that's why we have to bring Ukraine to a peace which is lasting and that Putin will never try this again.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 6, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, welcome to \"Face the Nation.\"",
      "COMMERCE SECRETARY HOWARD LUTNICK: Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We see about 60% of Americans have money in the stock market, which mean that retirees could be just as concerned as hedge fund managers this morning. Did you expect this level of shock in the financial markets?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Well, you've got to realize this is a national security issue. I mean, we don't make medicine in this country anymore. We don't make ships. We don't have enough steel and aluminum to fight a battle, right? All our semiconductors are made overseas. So every button we press when we try to start our car or even use our microwave, these are all semiconductors. They're all made elsewhere. We've got to start to protect ourselves, and we've got to stop having all the countries of the world ripping us off. We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit, and the rest of the world has a surplus with us. They're earning our money. They're taking our money, and Donald Trump has seen this, and he's going to stop it. So it is going to be a big change. Of course, it's going to be a big change, but the rest of the world has been ripping us off for all these many years. Donald Trump has seen it. He's spoken about it--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I understand that and--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --and he's just not going to take it anymore. And that's his model.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And that was abundantly clear during the presidential campaign, how much the president truly believes in tariffs and putting them at the center of his economic policy, but you saw absolute panic in the global markets. Did you expect that or were you surprised?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: No, I think the point is, you need to reset the power of the United States of America and reset it against all our allies and our enemies alike. The- the idea that all the countries of the world can run trade surpluses with America and buy our things with us\u2013 remember, $1.2 trillion. in 1980 we were a net investor- meaning we owned more of the rest of the world than they owned of us--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, it's a different world now, it's a different market.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: And now- and now they own 18- they own $18 trillion of us, net. So that means the rest of the- every year when we run a $1.2 trillion deficit, the rest of the world buys $1.2 trillion of America, and it goes up and up and up. And eventually we're not going to own America, and we are going to be owned by the rest of the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you talking about--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Imagine if we had a war and we can't build a ship, we can't fly a plane. We can't build our own planes--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --we don't have our own semiconductors. This is what the President is here to fix for America. It's- he- in his hands, and he wants to fix America. This is his chance--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. So--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --to fix America, and we need him to fix it for our children and our grandchildren.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but for- for businesses to do what you're doing, because what I hear you laying out there is a plan to re-industrialize the United States and to bring companies back to America. For a CEO to choose to invest--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Well said. Well said.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --but for a CEO to make those decisions- you know this- they need certainty. They need to know if it costs them more to stay overseas, or if it costs them more to move here. So can you give them clarity, so that they don't just cut jobs because they're dealing with the cost of these tariff- tariffs. Can you tell them how long they're staying in place?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Absolutely. The United States of America is going to protect the people who invest in America. Trillions and trillions of dollars- you heard the President speak about it- are coming to invest in America. This is the economy of the world. We are the consumer of the world, and companies need to build it here, and we will protect them for building it here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: We will help the American workers, yes. American workers are more expensive, but they're better.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I got it--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: We're going to protect all the factories that come to America, and that's what's coming here. So, the President is on it--",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, is the 10% tariff permanent?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: He's going to protect them- well, remember, this is a national security issue--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I got it. Is the 10% tariff permanent?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --and he needs to address our budget deficit- that- the, you know, the laws of America are the laws of America, he would like it to be that we need to protect the companies that invest here, and we are going to protect the companies that invest here. That is the policy of the United States of America. That's why trillions of dollars are coming here. The rip off of the- of the United States of America is over. All these companies are going to come and invest here. That's what they're doing. That's why they've committed trillions of dollars. They know this is the economy--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Okay, Mr. Secretary, though--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --this is the place to go.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Secretary, the campaign's over. You won. So I'm asking what the plan is. So the treasury secretary said on another network, \"we're going to hold the course.\" \"It's not the kind of thing you can negotiate away in days or weeks.\" That makes it sound like the tariffs are staying in place at least for days or weeks. Is that correct? Or is the President considering postponing implementation to negotiate?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: There is no postponing. They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. That is sort of obvious. The president needs to reset global trade. Everybody has a trade surplus and we have a trade deficit. We are paying away our future and our lives. Come- the countries of the world are ripping us off, and it's got to end. The President has made it crystal, crystal clear. This is the policy we're going to protect. The factories that come build in America, \u00a0we're going to protect them. They're going to be successful. That's why they're going to build in America, the greatest economy in the earth. All of these companies are going to come and build here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when three of the President's other economic advisers, who are on other networks today, say that 50 different countries have been calling the White House to try to talk about the tariffs, what does that mean? Because that makes it sound like there is a negotiation, which is different from saying the tariffs are permanent.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Well, what it shows is that all these countries know that they've been ripping us off, and the day has come for that to end. Now the problem is, it's not just tariffs- like, I'll give you an example, like Vietnam said they'd like to be zero-zero. Remember, Vietnam sends us $120 billion worth of goods every year--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, cheap manufacturing",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: And we send them about $12 billion- wait, we send them $12 billion. So it's not the tariffs. It has nothing to do with tariffs. If they went to zero-zero, they would go to 200 billion with us. We need to stop the rip off, and zero-zero is- is the way--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --I know but we don't have zero-zero, sir.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --to make it more of a rip off. We need--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We don't have zero-zero actually, because when we saw the president stand in the Rose Garden holding up that chart that you helped make, that- that wasn't actually tariffs. That was actually confusing to investors, because it was some kind of other formula, and the countries themselves seemed kind of random. Like, why are the Heard and McDonald Islands, which don't export to the United States and are quite literally inhabited by penguins, why do they face a 10% tariff? Did you use AI to generate this?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: No. No, the idea- look, the idea is that there are no countries left off.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are they on the list?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: Because the idea- what happens is, if you leave anything off the list, the countries that try to basically arbitrage America go through those countries to us. Any country- like we had tariffs, the President put tariffs on China, right, in 2018, and then what China started doing is they started going through other countries to America. They just built through other countries, through America. And so, the President knows that, he's tired of it, and he's going to fix that. So basically he said, look, I can't let any part of the world be a place where China or other countries can ship through them\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Through the Heard Islands.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --so the end of those loopholes- these ridiculous loopholes. And now what he's trying to say is, I'm going to fix the trade deficit of the United States of America. It's a national security issue. We need to make medicine. We need to make semiconductors. We need to make ships. We need to have steel and aluminum. Come on, we need the greatness of America to actually be built in America. And he's tired of getting ripped off by the rest of the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but just to be clear, April 9, the so-called retaliatory tariffs- the reciprocal tariffs, I should say. Are those coming or are they open to negotiation?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: The tariffs are coming. He announced it, and he wasn't kidding. The tariffs are coming. Of course they are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Is the administration considering any kind of offset, any kind of subsidy? You mentioned the first administration, there was some bailout to farmers to help them deal with the pain from Chinese retaliation. Are you looking at that now?",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: I'm- not that I've- I have not participated in any meetings with respect to that. The country is focused on- you realize, trillions of dollars of factories are going to be built in America. That's huge GDP. The factories being built in America are huge GDP--",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That takes years--",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: And that is going to matter to us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said that robots are going to fill those jobs. So those aren't union worker jobs.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: No, it's really automated jobs. It's automated factories- automated factories. But the key is, who's going to build the factories? Who's going to operate the factories? Who's going to make them work? Great American workers. You know, we are going to replace--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said robots on other networks. You said that to FOX.",
      "SEC. LUTNICK: --the armies of millions of people- well, remember, the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little- little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America. It's going to be automated and great Americans- the tradecraft of America, is going to fix them, is going to work on them. They're going to be mechanics. There's going to be HVAC specialists. There's going to be electricians, the tradecraft of America. Our high school educated Americans- the core to our workforce, is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories, which are all coming to America. That's what's going to build our next generation of America.",

      "SEC. LUTNICK: That is ridiculous. The problem is, everyone in the world sells to us. Our economy is the consumer of the world. We are the only one with a trade deficit. The rest of the world has a trade surplus. Why does Europe have a trade surplus? Is there something about Europe that's special? Seriously, are they a different world than we are? Why are they selling 200 billion a year--",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on April 6, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, Washington state Senator Maria Cantwell, good to have you here.",
      "SEN. MARIA CANTWELL: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Senator, you heard the- the Senate whip talk about your effort to claw back some control over trade. He said it will have a thorough hearing, and we'll see where it goes from there. Do you have any indication of momentum among some of your Republican colleagues?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, the first day of introduction, we signed up seven Republicans. So usually you don't get a first introduction and get so many people on board, but I think it shows the anxiety that people have. I'm sure if they listen to their constituents, consumer challenges are already starting to surface, and certainly the stock market's impact on retirement income is shaking a lot of people. So I'm sure my colleagues will hear from them. Today, consumer groups are announcing, and retailers, the fact that they want Congress to take this action up. And so I think we're hearing from a big segment of the economy, the consumer spending is a big part of GDP, and they're worried.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you've got what? Six Republicans at this point?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Seven.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Seven, and now you're saying retailers like you have CEOs who are on board, or industry groups.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Industry groups like the Retailers Association, the outdoor industry, the consumer electronics groups, Main Street Alliance, organizations who know their bread and butter comes from consumer spending, which is a big part of our economy, and so they are very anxious about a plan. Listen, I listened to your segment. I've never heard so much about fuzzy math in my life, and the notion that that chart is getting so much national attention, you know, the letters and Greek- all the stuff that makes no sense. That's what people- consumers are saying. How is this helping me in a time of inflation? You're adding to my cost with a tax on my consumer goods. And so I think that's why we're gaining support from these organizations today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Canada and China are among your state's largest export markets. Both have- have already announced retaliatory tariffs. I know you've said previously that the first Trump administration and the more limited tariffs still to this day have an impact on your state. So how much wiggle room do we have with time here? Because you heard the commerce secretary say, basically, these aren't a negotiating ploy, that they are staying in place. That's what he says.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, I- I do--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So how long before damage?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, we're- we have seen damage from the first Trump tariffs on things like apples and markets closed, and what you do is you end up then losing farm family economies. You don't necessarily lose farmland, some big corporation might buy it, but you lose family farms. So our objective should be to help farmers open up doors to these overseas markets. The United States' goal here should be to make great manufactured products and grow great agricultural products and then get those markets opened up. But what the president is doing is, instead of building those alliances, he basically is getting into a trade war that is having unbelievable impact. When his last tariffs on India- India, we reopened with the apple market, and we went to India and said, let's- let's get rid of this. And we were successful. And that's the kind of action we would have- we want to see today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So your state is one of the top five unionized states in the country. You have the world's largest plane manufacturer, Boeing, in Washington. So I wonder if those union workers are as supportive of the tariffs as the auto industry workers have been. They are not against them, even though some are Democrats. In fact, they think, some of them, including on this program, like Shawn Fain, have been very supportive.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, we're seeing- you could get the letter from the Machinists International. They don't support the president on this, and that is because they understand how much the United States and Canada have become an integrated supply chain. That helped us lower the cost of U.S. manufacturing for cars and for airplanes, and lowering that cost means that we're even more competitive. So they don't like the uncertainty, and what they would like to see instead is the continuation of investment from the last administration. So when you think of CHIPS and Science, and you think of the Inflation Reduction Act that made investments in next generation technology, the sectors that have a lot of employees want to win on innovation. They know that investment and innovation will help us outpace our competition, not a tariff that makes the product more expensive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Boeing's CEO testified: 80% of the airplanes they deliver are to markets outside the U.S. 80% of the content of those airplanes are manufactured here. They have a vested interest in clearing the decks for themselves here. What are they telling you about their conversations with the administration?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, everybody's concerned that the administration might retaliate against them, that, you know, that if they're not front and center in this- in this debate, but they're clear that they are being heard. I think people are saying that their strategy is, if there's a demand for 40,000 airplanes, and we could increase 1,000 more planes being sold, it would have a huge impact on the trade deficit. So they're trying to say, Mr. President, don't cut the innovation and investment. Don't make semiconductors more expensive, don't make the parts more expensive, make it cheaper, and the United States bet on the American worker, and they will do the rest when it comes to the innovation that's required for America to build the best products. So I think the president's math is wrong. I think he doesn't know the calculus is going to be so devastating to American consumers, and that's why those groups are joining us today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cantwell, thank you for your time today.",

      "For the first time ever, scientists say they have made a species de-extinct, bringing the dire wolf back into the world thousands of years after it died off.",
      "Colossal Biosciences, a company based in Dallas, says it successfully birthed three dire wolves \u2014 a species that once roamed North America but has been extinct for more than 12,500 years \u2014 using revolutionary science.",
      "Colossal CEO Ben Lamm said the team used DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull to analyze the full genome of the species and create three healthy dire wolf puppies, according to a news release.",
      "The Colossal website explains that many dire wolf fossils were preserved in the La Brea tar pits, in the Los Angeles area, but the species' DNA was not preserved in the tar.",
      "But using two dire wolf samples from an international study on the extinct species, Colossal was able to uncover more dire wolf DNA that ever previously found. Company scientists were eventually able to analyze the species' genome \u2014 or its entire DNA set.",
      "Then they used CRISPR, a gene-editing technology, to genetically modify cells from a living gray wolf. Usually, cloning relies on tissue samples, but Colossal was able to use these modified cells to create embryos, then transferred them to a surrogate (a domestic dog, The Associated Press reported) to grow.",

      "\"Whatever ecological function the dire wolf performed before it went extinct, it can't perform those functions\" in today's environment, Lynch said.",

      "The company says its de-extinction process could help support conservation efforts globally. \"Preserving, expanding, and testing genetic diversity should be done well before important endangered animal species like the red wolf are lost,\" said Harvard geneticist and co-founder of Colossal, Dr. George Church.",
      "In 2021, Colossal announced plans to de-extinct the woolly mammoth \u2014 a concept Church had been developing for years. He told \"60 Minutes\" in 2019, \"I would say that probably in five years we'll know whether we can get this to work for mice, and maybe pigs and elephants. And then if we can get embryos to grow in the laboratory all the way to term, then it's probably a decade.\"",

      "With veteran commander Sergey Ryzhikov, 50, at the controls, flanked on the left by rookie cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky, 32, and on the right by Kim, 41, the Soyuz MS-27/73S ferry ship rocketed away from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:47 a.m. EDT (10:47 a.m. local time).",
      "\"The crew is feeling good, everything is nominal,\" Ryzhikov periodically assured Russian flight controllers as the rocket climbed toward orbit.",
      "Eight minutes and 46 seconds later, the third stage engine of the Soyuz 2.1a rocket shut down and the crew ship was released to fly on its own, followed moments later by deployment of its two solar panels and navigation antennas.",
      "The ferry ship then carried out an automated rendezvous with the space station, moving in for docking at the multiport Prichal module at 4:57 a.m. as the two spacecraft sailed 260 miles above western Russia.",
      "\"Congratulations, Sergey, congratulations on your arrival at the International Space Station,\" Russian mission control radioed. After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",
      "Welcoming them aboard were Soyuz MS-26/72S crewmates Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, along with SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.",
      "\"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional postdocking video conference.",
      "Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are replacing Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit, who were launched to the ISS on Sept. 11 and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own Soyuz on April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space.",
      "The Crew 10 fliers, launched on March 14, replaced their Crew 9 predecessors \u2014 Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov and Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams \u2014 who returned to Earth on March 18.",
      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",
      "As such, Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are expected to return to Earth around Dec. 9.",
      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",

    "summary": "SpaceX's third all-civilian privately chartered flight was the first to carry a crew into polar orbit.",
    "story": [
      "A wealthy bitcoin entrepreneur and three fellow adventurers plunged back to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Friday, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California to close out the first crewed flight around Earth's poles.",
      "Three-and-a-half days after launch Monday from the Kennedy Space Center \u2014 and after 55 passes above the North and South Poles \u2014 the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" fired its braking rockets at 11:26 a.m. EDT and slammed back into the discernible atmosphere about 25 minutes later.",
      "Enduring heat shield temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the spacecraft rapidly slowed down, deployed four big red-and-white parachutes and settled to an on-target 16-mph splashdown at 12:19 p.m.",
      "SpaceX crews deployed nearby rushed to the gently bobbing capsule and rigged it for a lift onto the company's recovery ship Shannon.",
      "In the first test of its kind, the crew exited the craft on their own, demonstrating the ability to get out of a Crew Dragon without help from recovery crews.",
      "Unlike crews returning from long-duration flights to the International Space Station who are carried out of their capsules, mission commander Chun Wang and his three companions were able to lift emergency gear up and out of the hatch before climbing out themselves.",
      "While they moved a bit gingerly after three-and-a-half days in weightlessness, Chun, Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, a German robotics specialist, and Australian polar guide Eric Philips were all smiles as they greeted support personnel and were escorted into the recovery ship for initial medical checks.",
      "Chun is a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, most recently in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean where he first met his crewmates, all veterans of polar expeditions.",
      "\"We ... all met on Svalbard, and we love the ice,\" Chun posted on X during the flight. \"The mission was planned when I lived there, and we fly polar because, in an ISS-like orbit, we are unable to see where we live. From this perspective, the mission has perfectly achieved its goal.\"",
      "Chun said before launch he planned to be on the lookout for Antarctic research stations, but Mikkelsen said during the flight that \"unlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible.\"",
      "Neither Chun nor his crewmates are licensed pilots. While Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "But the Crew Dragon is highly automated and can be controlled from the ground when necessary. SpaceX viewed the Fram2 flight as a stepping stone toward opening the door for more non-professionals to fly to orbit.",
      "Chun, an avid world traveler and polar visitor, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter Resilience for the trip to polar orbit, SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "The mission was named Fram2 in honor of a 19th century sailing ship \u2014 Fram, or \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic explorers to the poles. A small piece of the original ship's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun said before launch. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023. ... Fram2 isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "The crew planned to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew was equipped  with multiple laptops and tablets, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray  generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the  human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration  missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Throughout the flight, the crew posted spectacular videos, including a timelapse view of Earth below as the Crew Dragon sailed over Antarctica all the way to the North Pole, making the trip from one pole to the other every 46 minutes.",
      "\"Proud to be able to bring to space some incredible cameras and lenses capturing the first images of the Arctic and Antarctic shot by humans from space,\" Mikkelsen posted on X. \"These videos are BIG in file size and we look forwards to sharing them with you post-mission splashdown.\"",
      "Another video showed the entire state of Florida and the southeastern United States. Zooming in on the Kennedy Space Center, Chun marveled \"there's our launch pad. Oh my God!\"",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 12:46:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

    "summary": "The craft carrying astronaut Jonny Kim and two Russian cosmonauts docked with the space station. They're scheduled for an eight-month stay.",
    "story": [
      "Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL, Harvard Medical School graduate and now a NASA astronaut, blasted off with two cosmonaut crewmates aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket early Tuesday, chased down the International Space Station and moved in for a picture-perfect docking three hours after liftoff.",
      "With veteran commander Sergey Ryzhikov, 50, at the controls, flanked on the left by rookie cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky, 32, and on the right by Kim, 41, the Soyuz MS-27/73S ferry ship rocketed away from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:47 a.m. EDT (10:47 a.m. local time).",
      "\"The crew is feeling good, everything is nominal,\" Ryzhikov periodically assured Russian flight controllers as the rocket climbed toward orbit.",
      "Eight minutes and 46 seconds later, the third stage engine of the Soyuz 2.1a rocket shut down and the crew ship was released to fly on its own, followed moments later by deployment of its two solar panels and navigation antennas.",
      "The ferry ship then carried out an automated rendezvous with the space station, moving in for docking at the multiport Prichal module at 4:57 a.m. as the two spacecraft sailed 260 miles above western Russia.",
      "\"Congratulations, Sergey, congratulations on your arrival at the International Space Station,\" Russian mission control radioed. After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",
      "Welcoming them aboard were Soyuz MS-26/72S crewmates Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, along with SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.",
      "\"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional postdocking video conference.",
      "Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are replacing Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit, who were launched to the ISS on Sept. 11 and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own Soyuz on April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space.",
      "The Crew 10 fliers, launched on March 14, replaced their Crew 9 predecessors \u2014 Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov and Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams \u2014 who returned to Earth on March 18.",
      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",
      "As such, Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are expected to return to Earth around Dec. 9.",
      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",
      "\"So it's kind of all of the above, whatever the demands that the space station need at a time.\"",

      "Even with spotty weather in some states, millions of people from coast to coast saw a partial solar eclipse, in which the moon partially covers the sun. However, only those within the path of totality experienced the darkness of the total solar eclipse.",
      "When is the next total solar eclipse in the U.S. after the 2024 eclipse?",
      "Solar eclipses happen about twice a year, said Arav. \"Eclipses happen all over the Earth evenly,\" he told CBS News \u2014 but noted the timings when they occur are not regular. That means\u00a0eclipses can occur within just a few years, or every few decades, in North America.",
      "Before the eclipse in 2024, the last total solar eclipses visible from the U.S. were in 2017 and\u00a01979. The 2017 solar eclipse was the first whose path of totality crossed the entire continent in 99 years.",

      "The path of totality will cross Williston and Dickinson, North Dakota, and Great Falls, Montana.",
      "Path of totality for the 2045 total solar eclipse",
      "The next solar eclipse that crosses a significant portion of the continental U.S. will be in 2045, said Arav. That year, a solar eclipse on Aug. 12 will darken skies in parts of the U.S., Haiti, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname and Brazil.",
      "It will be visible in many states as it moves from coast to coast. The eclipse will start in California and move east to end in Florida, similar to 2017, Arav said.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 14:48:24 -0400",
    "summary": "SpaceX's third all-civilian privately chartered flight was the first to carry a crew into polar orbit.",
    "story": [
      "A wealthy bitcoin entrepreneur and three fellow adventurers plunged back to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Friday, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California to close out the first crewed flight around Earth's poles.",
      "Three-and-a-half days after launch Monday from the Kennedy Space Center \u2014 and after 55 passes above the North and South Poles \u2014 the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" fired its braking rockets at 11:26 a.m. EDT and slammed back into the discernible atmosphere about 25 minutes later.",
      "Enduring heat shield temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the spacecraft rapidly slowed down, deployed four big red-and-white parachutes and settled to an on-target 16-mph splashdown at 12:19 p.m.",
      "SpaceX crews deployed nearby rushed to the gently bobbing capsule and rigged it for a lift onto the company's recovery ship Shannon.",
      "In the first test of its kind, the crew exited the craft on their own, demonstrating the ability to get out of a Crew Dragon without help from recovery crews.",
      "Unlike crews returning from long-duration flights to the International Space Station who are carried out of their capsules, mission commander Chun Wang and his three companions were able to lift emergency gear up and out of the hatch before climbing out themselves.",
      "While they moved a bit gingerly after three-and-a-half days in weightlessness, Chun, Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, a German robotics specialist, and Australian polar guide Eric Philips were all smiles as they greeted support personnel and were escorted into the recovery ship for initial medical checks.",
      "Chun is a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, most recently in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean where he first met his crewmates, all veterans of polar expeditions.",
      "\"We ... all met on Svalbard, and we love the ice,\" Chun posted on X during the flight. \"The mission was planned when I lived there, and we fly polar because, in an ISS-like orbit, we are unable to see where we live. From this perspective, the mission has perfectly achieved its goal.\"",
      "Chun said before launch he planned to be on the lookout for Antarctic research stations, but Mikkelsen said during the flight that \"unlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible.\"",
      "Neither Chun nor his crewmates are licensed pilots. While Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "But the Crew Dragon is highly automated and can be controlled from the ground when necessary. SpaceX viewed the Fram2 flight as a stepping stone toward opening the door for more non-professionals to fly to orbit.",
      "Chun, an avid world traveler and polar visitor, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter Resilience for the trip to polar orbit, SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "The mission was named Fram2 in honor of a 19th century sailing ship \u2014 Fram, or \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic explorers to the poles. A small piece of the original ship's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun said before launch. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023. ... Fram2 isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "The crew planned to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew was equipped  with multiple laptops and tablets, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray  generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the  human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration  missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Throughout the flight, the crew posted spectacular videos, including a timelapse view of Earth below as the Crew Dragon sailed over Antarctica all the way to the North Pole, making the trip from one pole to the other every 46 minutes.",
      "\"Proud to be able to bring to space some incredible cameras and lenses capturing the first images of the Arctic and Antarctic shot by humans from space,\" Mikkelsen posted on X. \"These videos are BIG in file size and we look forwards to sharing them with you post-mission splashdown.\"",
      "Another video showed the entire state of Florida and the southeastern United States. Zooming in on the Kennedy Space Center, Chun marveled \"there's our launch pad. Oh my God!\"",

    "story": [
      "Amazon has told the White House it is interested in buying TikTok ahead of a key deadline by which its parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell the popular social media app or face a ban in the U.S., CBS News has learned, according to two people familiar with discussions.",
      "Amazon has submitted a bid for the app, the\u00a0New York Times reported earlier, citing people familiar with the matter. Another plan under consideration is for a new entity backed by U.S. companies like BlackRock and Oracle to lease TikTok's algorithm from ByteDance, according to a source familiar with the situation.",
      "Both Amazon and TikTok declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Amazon's bid comes after lawmakers last year passed a bill setting a\u00a0Jan. 19 deadline\u00a0for the sale, which Mr. Trump extended for 75 days. He set a deadline of Saturday, April 5, for ByteDance to either sell its stake in the app or be forced to shut down in the U.S.",
      "The retail giant made the offer in a letter addressed to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, according to people familiar with the matter, the New York Times reported.",
      "Retail industry analysts say Amazon's interest in TikTok underscores the social app's importance to online retailers, given its ability to drive e-commerce purchases.",
      "\"While Amazon is the No. 1 destination for searching for products, it remains a channel that is most suited to planned and specific purchases,\" GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"It has certainly made some inroads into becoming a place for consumer entertainment and discovery, which led to impulse purchases, but this is very much the preserve of TikTok and TikTok Shop. This more impulse driven part of the market is faster growing that more established e-commerce channels.\"",
      "AppLovin, a California-based mobile technology company, has also expressed interest in acquiring TikTok, a person familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "In remarks to reporters on Air Force One over the weekend, Mr. Trump addressed the matter of TikTok's sale, saying, \"We have a lot of potential buyers. There's a lot of interest in TikTok. The decision is going to be my decision.\"",
      "He added that he'd \"like to see TikTok remain alive.\"",
      "The U.S. government has said TikTok poses a threat to national security because its vast trove of customer data, including browsing patterns, locations and biometric information, could end up in the hands of the Chinese authorities.",
      "Ahead of the initial divestiture deadline, ByteDance earlier this year briefly shut down TikTok in the U.S. Mr. Trump quickly paused the ban and the service was restored.",
      "The ban does not target TikTok's U.S. users. But the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, signed into law in 2024 under former President Biden, would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores and web-hosting services to distribute or service TikTok.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks shed gains in the afternoon after an earlier rebound on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 2% after the Trump administration said it will impose a 104% tariff on China beginning at 12:01 a.m. EST Wednesday.",
      "Tuesday's losses add to the\u00a0three-day sell-off that has wiped out trillions in market value amid anxieties about the economic impact of President Trump's wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 800 points, or 2.1%, to close at 37,165. The S&P 500 dropped 2.8%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index tumbled 3.4%.",
      "The sell-off began on April 3, the day after Mr. Trump unveiled tariffs on imports from almost every nation, on top of a number of previously announced import duties targeting the auto, steel and aluminum industries, among others. Wall Street economists say the tariffs are likely to drive up inflation because they'll largely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices, which could stall U.S. economic growth and increase the risk of a recession.",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app\u00a0on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "But stocks rebounded early Tuesday, with some investors holding out hope that the tariffs could be pared back, with that optimism bolstered on Tuesday morning by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who told CNBC that the Trump administration is negotiating tariffs with a number of countries.",
      "\"I think we can end up with some good deals,\" Bessent said. \"And I actually think, as I said that over the weekend, President Trump has maximum negotiating leverage right here, right now, and I think it would be a mistake for anyone to think otherwise.\"",
      "Yet that optimism gave way to afternoon losses after White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the White House will begin collecting steep levies on imported goods from China starting on Wednesday.",
      "The 104% tariff rate is the result of an escalation in Mr. Trump's trade war, with the president on Monday threatening to slap an additional 50% tariff on imports from China after the nation said it would impose a 34% import fee on American products.",
      "China's retaliatory move came after Mr. Trump said China would face a 34% tariff on all goods imported to the U.S., a rate tailored specifically to China.",
      "\"The tariff overhang isn't going away, even if some of the reciprocal numbers from the April 2 chart wind up getting trimmed a bit, and the huge disruptions to global trade will have a substantially negative effect on growth (especially since they hit at a time when the economy was already slowing), while pushing inflation higher,\" said Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge in a research note.",
      "The rebound earlier in the day was partly due to investors seeking to buy stocks after they'd been knocked down, seizing the opportunity to buy shares at lower costs, some analysts noted. But the tariffs still remain in place, threatening the long-term growth of U.S. businesses, they added.",

      "Banks report their latest quarterly earnings on Friday, but most of the attention likely will be on their forecasts amid the rising global trade tensions ignited by Trump's tariffs.",
      "On Thursday, the government posts its latest inflation data, which could play into the Federal Reserve's next interest rate decision.

      "For the first time ever, scientists say they have made a species de-extinct, bringing the dire wolf back into the world thousands of years after it died off.",
      "Colossal Biosciences, a company based in Dallas, says it successfully birthed three dire wolves \u2014 a species that once roamed North America but has been extinct for more than 12,500 years \u2014 using revolutionary science.",
      "Colossal CEO Ben Lamm said the team used DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull to analyze the full genome of the species and create three healthy dire wolf puppies, according to a news release.",
      "The Colossal website explains that many dire wolf fossils were preserved in the La Brea tar pits, in the Los Angeles area, but the species' DNA was not preserved in the tar.",
      "But using two dire wolf samples from an international study on the extinct species, Colossal was able to uncover more dire wolf DNA that ever previously found. Company scientists were eventually able to analyze the species' genome \u2014 or its entire DNA set.",
      "Then they used CRISPR, a gene-editing technology, to genetically modify cells from a living gray wolf. Usually, cloning relies on tissue samples, but Colossal was able to use these modified cells to create embryos, then transferred them to a surrogate (a domestic dog, The Associated Press reported) to grow.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate's\u00a0budget resolution, which has been backed by President Trump and is key to extending his tax cuts, is opposed by a number of House Republicans who say it doesn't cut enough spending.",
      "The House must adopt the Senate-passed resolution to move forward on the president's agenda, and GOP leaders hoped to take that vote this week. But nearly a dozen House Republicans say they oppose the resolution or have serious concerns about the $1.5 trillion gap between the House and Senate versions. Speaker Mike Johnson's\u00a0slim\u00a0GOP majority means he can afford to lose the support of just three Republicans.",
      "The president is meeting with Republican holdouts on Tuesday as Johnson tries to coax them to back the 70-page resolution, the blueprint for\u00a0implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. Although Johnson has in the past been able to overcome pockets of opposition, this time, he faces objections from multiple corners of the GOP conference.",
      "House leaders aren't ruling out working through the weekend if they're unable to push the resolution through the lower chamber this week. Congress is scheduled to be in recess the next two weeks.",
      "The president endorsed the Senate-adopted budget resolution Monday night, saying in a post on Truth Social that it includes all of \"the elements we need to secure the Border, enact Historic Spending Cuts, and make Tax Cuts PERMANENT.\"",
      "\"There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE!\" Mr. Trump continued, adding that \"THE HOUSE MUST PASS THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION, AND QUICKLY.\"",
      "The budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate.",
      "The Senate adopted the compromise resolution Saturday after Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year. But both chambers must adopt identical budget resolutions to kickstart the broader reconciliation process, prompting GOP leaders to come together on the path forward in recent weeks.",
      "Still, the resolution doesn't address disagreements over where and how to make substantial spending cuts, pushing a confrontation further down the road.",
      "In the resolution, the Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more.

      "But the tax cuts were originally passed using \"current law\" scoring, which treats the renewal of expiring policies as new legislation. The House budget resolution relied on the current law baseline and acknowledges that continuing the tax cuts will cost $3.8 trillion. The 2017 Trump tax cuts are set to expire this year, and if they are not extended, taxes will go up for many filers.",

    "summary": "Small business owner Emily Ley says new U.S. tariffs on China will devastate her stationery store, calling the added costs \"catastrophic.\"",
    "story": [
      "Many U.S. small businesses could face a financial crunch as President Trump's reciprocal tariffs take effect on Wednesday, slapping new import duties on products from almost every nation across the globe.",
      "Some small businesses told CBS News they're worried about the impact from the sharp increase in tariffs that they'll soon be required to pay to the federal government. After paying the levies, they said they'll be left with two choices: raise the prices they charge customers or swallow the costs and take a financial hit.",
      "Small businesses, generally defined as enterprises with fewer than 500 employees and revenue of less than $7.5 million, account for almost half of all private-sector employment in the U.S. But they're also more vulnerable to tariff costs because they don't have the deep pockets or financial flexibility of large businesses, noted Aaron Terrazas, an economist at Gusto, which provides payroll and HR services to small and midsize businesses.",
      "\"For many small businesses, this is a one-two punch,\" Terrazas said. \"They are getting higher prices from suppliers, and their customers are more skittish\" just as they're grappling with heavier tariffs.",
      "Among those businesses reckoning with the added costs is Simplified, an online stationery business that has manufactured its colorful planners in China since 2013. Its owner, Emily Ley, told CBS News that the new reciprocal tariffs \"will have a devastating impact\" on her business, costing her an additional $630,000 in fees over the next year.",
      "On April 3, Ley filed a lawsuit\u00a0alleging Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority in dictating the import duties. Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to impose tariffs and regulate foreign commerce.",
      "\"This additional tax burden is catastrophic to our business,\" Ley added. \"We've already raised our prices as much as possible to absorb previous tariff increases. There's a limit to how much we can increase prices before we price ourselves out of the market.\"",
      "To cope with the costs, she said the company is reducing salaries and scaling back expansion plans.",
      "Recipe for a revival?",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs will revive American manufacturing by incentivizing both domestic and foreign companies to build factories in the U.S. But small businesses, which typically operate on thin margins, generally don't have the capacity to quickly shift their supply chains or build local production facilities given the higher cost of labor in the U.S.",
      "Even large businesses that have the financial heft to move its plants back to the U.S., such as Apple, would require years to build a factory in the U.S., noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 8 research note.",
      "\"Maybe over time, we will build a supplier base, but that takes time,\" Terrazas said. \"But in the interim there is this transition period that is very perilous for small businesses.\"",
      "Not all small businesses can wait that long. Alyssa Chambers, the founder of NOVA Essence Inside Out, which makes candles and other wellness products, said she plans to absorb the cost of tariffs applied to the Chinese-made candle jars and waxes she relies on \u2014 for now.",
      "Chambers said she would reassess her business' pricing toward the end of summer and depending on the state of the economy.",
      "For small businesses, buying from American manufacturers isn't really an option, Chambers added, noting that a U.S.-made candle jar costs about $12 each. By contrast, she can buy a 15-pack of jars made in China for about $20. Although she expects that price to rise to about $40 after the tariffs hit home, it's still cheaper than buying domestically.",
      "Other small businesses simply don't have the option of buying from domestic manufacturers, said Matt Weyandt, co-founder of chocolate maker Xocolatl. Because cocoa is grown near the equator, very little of it can be grown in the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"Despite that, we'll now be paying an additional 10% or more for all of our cocoa beans on top of their already elevated prices,\" Weyandt said. \"This is not going to bring cocoa farming jobs to the U.S. or increase American manufacturing \u2014 it's just going to hurt American chocolate manufacturers.\"",
      "To be sure, there are some small businesses that could continue to thrive even with higher tariffs Terrazas said. That includes domestic food manufacturers or health care businesses that don't rely on imports, such as elder or child care companies.",
      "Skittish consumers",
      "Small businesses are coping with the tariffs just as Americans are growing more pessimistic about the economy, with consumer confidence slumping to a 12-year low last month.",
      "\"In the long term, American consumers are really remarkable. But in the short term, it's hard,\" said Kevin Klowden, an economist with the Milken Institute, a think tank. \"It is definitely different because this is an intent to force a structural shift.\"",
      "But, Klowden added, Mr. Trump is doing so \"by significantly putting pressure on the cost structure of the entire system.\"",
      "Whether inflation-weary consumers will accept price hikes from businesses remains to be seen. If the tariffs aren't reduced, inflation could pick up this year, reaching as high as 4% by year end, up from about 2.8% currently, according to Wall Street economists.",
      "\"This is a moment of elevated risk for the economy,\" Terrazas said.",

      "\"China's position on China-US economic and trade relations has been made very clear,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said, adding, \"It is surprising and sad to hear such ignorant and impolite words from this vice president.\"",
      "President Trump has upended the world economy with sweeping tariffs and has ruled out any pause in his aggressive trade policy despite a dramatic market sell-off.",
      "In addition to a universal baseline tariff of 10% on goods imported into the U.S., Mr. Trump also announced \"reciprocal\" duties for imports coming from certain countries, which are set to take effect Wednesday. China was hit with the highest of those additional taxes, initially 34%, although Mr. Trump then upped it to 104% after Beijing imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "Speaking to Fox News on Thursday, Vance defended U.S. tariffs as an antidote to a \"globalist economy\" he said had not worked for ordinary Americans.",
      "\"We borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things those Chinese peasants manufacture,\" Vance said. \"That is not a recipe for economic prosperity. It's not a recipe for low prices, and it's not a recipe for good jobs in the United States of America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump believes the tariffs will revive America's lost manufacturing base by forcing foreign companies to relocate to the U.S., rather than making goods abroad. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik told \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan on Sunday that the policy will help protect American factories and \"reset the power\" of the country.",
      "However, economists have questioned the approach, with some saying the tariffs are arbitrary and others raising concerns about the ways in which Mr. Trump's levies will drive up the price of everyday goods. On Monday, Goldman Sachs economists cited the tariffs in a report that raised the odds of a U.S. recession to 45%, while JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned the taxes could slow economic growth and \"will likely increase inflation.\"",

    "story": [
      "As\u00a0measles\u00a0cases rise across the United States, misinformation about the life-threatening infection can put people at risk.",
      "Nationwide, cases have surpassed 600, with infections confirmed in 21 states. The majority of cases have been reported in Texas, where more than 500 people have been infected and\u00a0two children\u00a0have died.",
      "Here's what to know about some of the common measles myths:",
      "Myth: Measles isn't serious",
      "Measles is a highly\u00a0contagious disease\u00a0and in some cases, it can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. Two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico have died in this year's outbreak.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, many who are unvaccinated can suffer greatly. For example, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people with measles will be hospitalized, about 1 out of every 1,000 children who catch it will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage. Up to 3 of every 1,000 children infected with measles will die, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Up to 9 out of 10 susceptible people who come in close contact to someone with measles will get the disease, the CDC says. The virus is transmitted by contact with infectious droplets or by breathing the air an infected person breathed, coughed or sneezed in. Even after an infected person leaves an area, the virus can remain infections in the air for up to two hours, the CDC says.",
      "Myth: The MMR vaccine isn't effective",
      "Decades of research and analysis show the\u00a0measles vaccination, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0safe and effective",
      "One dose of the MMR vaccine is 93% effective against measles and the recommended two doses is 97% effective, the CDC says. And\u00a0for most people, the MMR vaccine will protect you for life.",
      "The Texas outbreak is primarily affecting\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or have an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither had underlying health conditions before they got sick from measles, the Texas health department said.",
      "Before vaccines became available in the 1960s, an estimated 3 to 4 million Americans would catch measles each year, about 48,000 would be hospitalized, and between 400 to 500 \u2014 mostly children \u2014 died each year, the CDC says.",
      "After previously downplaying the growing number cases, and a history of making false and misleading claims about the safety of the MMR vaccine, Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u00a0voiced support for the vaccine during an April visit to Texas, where he attended a service for the second child who died there.",
      "In a social media\u00a0post, he wrote: \"The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\"",
      "In an opinion piece published by Fox News in March, Kennedy also encouraged the shot, writing, \"vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,\u00a0said on \"CBS Mornings\"\u00a0that that Kennedy's comments are an important step.",
      "\"The secretary is one of the leading proponents of the myth that these vaccines cause autism, and so for him to be acknowledging that one of the most important tools we have to curb this outbreak is vaccination is really important here,\" she said.",
      "Myth: The MMR vaccine causes autism",
      "Numerous scientific studies over many years have shown there is\u00a0no connection between autism and the MMR vaccine. Still, the unfounded fears persist. This is largely due to a paper published in The Lancet medical journal in the 1990s that was later retracted after its data was found to be false and manipulated.",
      "But vaccines are among the most studied medical interventions. For example, more than 12,000 people took part in clinical trials of the most recent MMR vaccine, according to the FDA.",
      "Autism Speaks, an autism awareness organization, also makes clear that autism and vaccines are not linked.",
      "\"Scientists have conducted extensive research all over the world over the last two decades to examine the link between childhood vaccinations and autism.\u202fThe result of this research is clear: vaccines do not cause autism,\" the organization's website states.",
      "Myth: Vitamin A can prevent or cure measles",
      "Kennedy has also shared some misleading information about the potential role of vitamins in measles treatment and prevention.",
      "In some studies, Vitamin A has been shown to reduce the severity of measles and the risk of death from the virus \u2014 but these studies were among highly malnourished populations in low-income countries. Research shows Vitamin A supplements are\u00a0not a substitute\u00a0for measles vaccination, even among severely malnourished groups.",
      "\"Vitamin A reduces the risk of some complications among severely malnourished kids who have Vitamin A deficiency. It does not prevent measles or the damage the infection does to the immune system,\" Gounder, who is also an infectious disease specialist, said. \"Vitamin A is not a substitute for measles vaccination.\"",
      "In the U.S., Vitamin A deficiency is rare,\u00a0affecting less than 1%\u00a0of the population. Too much Vitamin A can also lead to the risk of liver toxicity, according to the National Institutes of Health.",

    "summary": "Tattoos have been used by the Trump administration to allege Venezuelan men deported from the U.S. are members of the Tren de Aragua gang.",
    "story": [
      "Tattoos of crowns, a clock and other symbols have been used by the Trump administration to allege Venezuelan men deported from the U.S. are members of the Tren de Aragua gang. But experts and police in a Colorado city who have investigated the gang say tattoos aren't reliable markers of affiliation.",
      "The administration alleges the deportees it sent to El Salvador's notorious maximum security prison are gang members, mostly with Tren de Aragua, and some with MS-13. It has also acknowledged that \"many\" of them have no criminal records.",
      "President Trump invoked the 1798 wartime Alien Enemies Act, claiming Tren de Aragua is invading the United States, to deport many of the men. The administration also declared Tren de Aragua a terrorist organization.",
      "Court documents, lawyers and family members of some of the migrants have said their tattoos were reasons they were determined to be alleged Tren de Aragua members.",
      "The wife of Franco Jose Caraballo, a barber from Venezuela with no criminal record, said officers kept asking questions about his tattoo of a pocket watch that marks the time of their daughter's birth.",
      "A lawyer for Caraballo says he's not a gang member and his wife said he is innocent when asked what worries her about his detention in the Salvadoran prison.",
      "Another man, Andry Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez Romero, has crown tattoos over the words \"Mom\" and \"Dad.\" Hern\u00e1ndez Romero is a makeup artist who identifies as gay. He faced discrimination and threats in Venezuela because of his sexual orientation and political views and was seeking asylum in the U.S., his attorney said in a court filing.",
      "A questionnaire, used in correctional facilities to assess potential gang affiliation, appears to show that Hern\u00e1ndez Romero's tattoos were the only basis to allegedly connect him to Tren de Aragua.",
      "\"The crown has been found to be an identifier for a Tren de Aragua gang member,\" an officer wrote in the filing.",
      "Many experts disagree that tattoos can identify members of the gang.",
      "\"Expert after expert tells us tattoos are not a reliable indicator of whether you're part of this particular gang,\" Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who is leading the legal challenge against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, told 60 Minutes.",
      "Rebecca Hanson, an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Florida, wrote in a court filing for the case that there are no tattoos, symbols or hand gestures associated with the group.",
      "\"The TdA, and gangs more generally in Venezuela, do not have a history of using tattoos to indicate membership,\" she said. \"TdA members may, of course, have tattoos, but this is not part of a collective identity.\"",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, which Mr. Trump has claimed is a \"war zone\" overrun by the Tren de Aragua, Police Chief Todd Chamberlain said it's very difficult to identify Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Chamberlain said he would not describe the city as a \"war zone,\" but said Aurora has been \"ground zero\" for the gang's activities. The city saw organized violent crime concentrated in three apartment complexes, one of which is now shuttered.",
      "The Aurora Police Department likely has the best understanding of the Tren de Aragua gang of any U.S. law enforcement agency, he said.",
      "\"It's unlike MS-13, it's unlike a Crip or a Blood,\" he said. \"If you go back to gangs in the early '80s or the '90s again, the way they walked, the way they talked, what they wore, they had very obvious signs.\"",
      "But Tren de Aragua does not, he said.",
      "Rather than focusing on trying to identify gang members, Chamberlain said his department has focused on criminal activity.",
      "\"For us, it wasn't about what gang they were involved in. It's about what criminal activity they were involved in, and we knew that there was criminal activity,\" he said. \"If we could connect it to TdA as we were evolving this process, that's great.\"",
      "Chamberlain said his department counted a total of nine confirmed Tren de Aragua members who passed through Aurora in the last two years.",
      "Jeanette Rodriguez, who serves as a liaison between local law enforcement and the Venezuelan migrant community in Aurora, said Tren de Aragua members don't flaunt obvious signs of gang membership.",
      "\"If you compare it to like MS-13, they're very proud of who they are, and they would tattoo them on their faces, and are very proud of who they are. Tren de Aragua, they know the value of laying low,\" she said.",
      "Hanson noted that the Trump administration's partial reliance on tattoos to conclude migrants are members of Tren de Aragua \"appears to result from an incorrect conflation of gang practices in Central America and Venezuela.\"",
      "It's different than in El Salvador and Honduras, where \"gangs have long used tattoos to indicate membership and identity,\" she said.",
      "At CECOT, the El Salvador prison, many of the inmates have prominent tattoos. One, Marvin Vazquez, who is an MS-13 member, said \"you gotta kill\" to get a tattoo like the \"MS\" ones he showed on his chest and abdomen.",
      "Vazquez was arrested in El Salvador after the government declared war on the gangs in 2022.",
      "Gustavo Villatoro, El Salvador's minister of justice and public security, said tattoos are one way the government identifies gang members. He said not all the prisoners in CECOT have been convicted of crimes.",
      "Top White House officials have argued the Trump administration does not need to follow due process to remove individuals from the U.S. under the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act. However, on Monday, April 7, the Supreme Court said detainees must receive notice that they are subject to removal under the law and must be allowed to challenge their detention.",
      "Asked if he was worried some migrants were incorrectly identified as gang members, Mr. Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan said he's not.",
      "\"I'll trust the men and women at ICE,\" Homan said. \"I've been assured numerous times that everybody in that plane from Venezuela was a TdA member. The rest of 'em were MS-13.\"",
      "Homan said the government did not rely just on tattoos, but would not share evidence to prove the deportees are gang members.",
      "And in cases like those of Caraballo and Hern\u00e1ndez Romero, it's unclear what other basis was used to allege they are Tren de Aragua members.",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Apr 2025 12:57:01 -0400",
    "summary": "More than 16,000 probationary workers at six different agencies were fired in mid-February.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to halt a lower court order that required six federal agencies to rehire more than 16,000 probationary workers who had been fired.",
      "The high court granted a request for emergency relief from the Trump administration, which sought to move forward with its efforts to drastically scale back the size of the federal government as legal proceedings continue. In an unsigned order, the Supreme Court said the injunction issued by the district court in mid-March \"was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-organization plaintiffs in this case. But under established law, those allegations are presently insufficient to support the organizations'\" legal right to sue, a concept known as standing.",
      "Its stay will remain in place will litigation plays out. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson said they would have denied the Justice Department's request for relief.",
      "Probationary workers, generally those who were still in one or two-year trial periods, were the early targets of mass firings that are part of President Trump's government-cutting initiative. Many have been left in limbo since mid-February, when they were fired and then had their employment restored weeks later as a result of court orders.",
      "Labor unions and nonprofit groups that brought the lawsuit challenging the firings vowed to continue fighting for probationary workers.",
      "\"There is no doubt that thousands of public service employees were unlawfully fired in an effort to cripple federal agencies and their crucial programs that serve millions of Americans every day,\" the coalition said in a statement. \"Today's order by the U.S. Supreme Court is deeply disappointing but is only a momentary pause in our efforts to enforce the trial court's orders and hold the federal government accountable.\"",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court arose after thousands of probationary workers received notices that they had been terminated. The letters, many of which used similar language, based the firings on individual performance, though federal workers argued in court filings that they had received positive performance reviews.",
      "In response to the firings, a group of labor unions and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit in federal district court in California. The lawsuit claimed that the Office of Personnel Management directed the mass terminations of probationary workers, acting outside of its authority.",
      "In late February, U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued a temporary restraining order deeming earlier guidance from OPM to federal agencies about the firing of probationary workers \"illegal\" and invalid. The judge also concluded that the mass firings were likely unlawful.",
      "On the heels of that decision, OPM acting director Charles Ezell issued revised guidance clarifying that it is \"not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees.\"",
      "Following a hearing last month, the judge ordered six agencies \u2014 the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior, Treasury and Veterans Affair \u2014 to immediately offer reinstatement to all probationary workers who were fired the previous month.",
      "Human resources officials at the half-a-dozen agencies told the court that they had rehired the fired employees and placed them on administrative leave before returning them to full-duty status.",
      "The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to pause that decision while it appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined the request.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the district judge did not have the power to grant reinstatement to thousands of probationary workers, and refuted that OPM had directed the firings in the first place.",
      "\"An order directing reinstatement of thousands of employees across six agencies is intolerable,\" she wrote in a filing. \"The injunction appears to prevent the agencies from terminating the employees based on an exercise of the agencies' independent judgment \u2014 and would even seem to prevent the employees' termination based on newly arising grounds like new instances of poor performance or misconduct without, at a minimum, obtaining permission from the district court.\"",
      "The acting solicitor general, who represents the government before the Supreme Court, told the justices that Alsup's order is a \"profound invasion\" of the executive branch's ability to direct its internal affairs.",
      "She also warned that the reinstatements have posed logistical burdens that require significant resources, and said that the obligation to pay the fired probationary employees \"inflicts massive financial costs\" that cannot be recovered.",
      "\"Each day the preliminary injunction remains in effect subjects the Executive Branch to judicial micromanagement of its day-to-day operations,\" Harris wrote.",
      "But the unions and organizations challenging the firings said that the harms alleged by the government are self-inflicted.",
      "\"While the government complains that the reinstatement of more than 16,000 employees at the six covered agencies is an 'enormous' task that would interfere with agency functioning (without presenting evidence supporting that assertion), the scale of the task is simply a reflection of the scale of the Government's own unlawful action and its 'move fast and break things' ethos,\" lawyers for the challengers wrote in a filing.",
      "They called OPM's directives \"hasty and sloppy,\" and said that the government can still fire employees, as long as it complies with the law.",
      "\"The district court's reinstatement merely orders the government to return to the situation that existed before it embarked on illegal mass termination of probationary employees,\" the legal team for the unions and nonprofits wrote. \"If there are 'practical burdens' associated with the return to the status quo, they are of the government's own making.\"",
      "The case brought by the unions and groups is one of two challenging the mass firings of probationary workers. A group of 19 states filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland arguing the terminations were unlawful, and in March, a judge ordered affected probationary workers at more than a dozen agencies be reinstated.",
      "The judge then granted a preliminary injunction in early April, which applies to probationary workers at 20 agencies who live or work in the states involved in the lawsuit.",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Apr 2025 12:18:39 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries go into effect Wednesday. Here's what to know about the import taxes.",
    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump\u00a0announced last week\u00a0\u2014 an import tax blitz on long-standing global trade partners he referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs.",
      "The additive tariffs were unveiled alongside an across-the-board levy of 10% on\u00a0dozens of nations and territories, from major exporters to the U.S. such as China to the British-controlled Falkland Islands, which has fewer than 4,000 residents.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in the April 2 news conference, touting the tariffs as a way to boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with countries he said impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.",
      "But economists note that that in addition to roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses, the tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners are hard to structure.",
      "While the 10% baseline tariffs on all U.S. trading partners went into effect on April 5, the reciprocal levies are\u00a0 set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product-by-product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges for German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But applying tariffs that match other countries' exactly would be an administratively complex task given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products, noted Jacquez.",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app\u00a0on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" he said.",
      "Other experts have suggested that Trump's goal behind the levies is less about driving companies to shift their production to the U.S., or generating federal revenue, than about pressuring other nations to strike trade deals with the Trump administration.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-specific tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs across the board, the White House announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to their trade imbalances with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump on April said his administration would impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations. In calculating the percentage of taxes charged by each nation on U.S. exports, the White House said it included not just levies, but all trade practices on a country-by-country basis that it deemed unfair, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers. Mr. Trump characterized the discounted tariff rates as \"kind.\"",
      "For example, the U.S. said it would match China's 67% rate with a 34% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S. China retaliated last week, saying it would impose its own\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, to which Mr. Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. If Mr. Trump carries through with the threat, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%.",
      "At 50%, Lesotho, an African nation, and French territories Saint Pierre and Miquelon face the highest country-specific tariff rates. Vietnam, where Apple produces some of its iPhones, is subject to a 46% tariff under Mr. Trump's plan.",
      "Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration, anticipated that the White House would \"come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods.\"",
      "As a result, the U.S. would tax some other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours, in a scenario Jacquez predicted would lead to retaliation against the U.S.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\" a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",
      "Simon MacAdam, deputy chief global economist with Capital Economics, anticipated that likely targets would include leading U.S. trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam. In 2024, the largest U.S. trade deficits around the globe \u2014 meaning countries from which the U.S. imports more than it exports \u2014 were with the following nations, according to federal data:",

      "Are reciprocal tariffs likely to drive up consumer prices?",
      "While the levies have not yet gone into effect, experts say any reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices\u00a0as companies look to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "Consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply for products for which there are no comparable substitutes.",
      "\"The more price-insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",

      "He said he hasn't gotten any sleep, running on energy from last night's victory.",
      "\"It's amazing. It doesn't feel real yet,\" Haugh said. \"I can't wait to get back to Gainesville and see the fans there and go celebrate.\"",
      "Haugh described the tension of those final seconds from his perspective on the court, particularly focusing on his defensive mindset as the clock wound down.",
      "\"I was just hoping to not let my man score. I didn't want to be the one who gave up the game-tying or the game-winning bucket,\" Haugh said. \"I just kind of locked on him, and then I saw the ball go loose, and that time started ticking down. Once we kind of gained possession, the buzzer ran out. Just craziness from there.\"",
      "The championship game's unusual ending featured a Houston player who appeared poised to take a potential game-tying shot but opted instead to drop the ball as time expired.",
      "\"I thought Walt did a great job of getting to close out on him and it kind of limited him to kind of double clutch and thought about a shot,\" Haugh said. \"Just credit to Walt and him getting on there and closing out on him.\"",
      "Haugh also revealed that the team's comeback was fueled by their coach's halftime message when they faced a double-digit deficit.",
      "\"He just told us to stay the source and stay focused,\" Haugh said. \"We were in that situation a lot this tournament, probably more than we would like to be. But we had experience with that. And being down in a deficit, and we got down to 12 or whatever when the second half began. And we got into that time-out and just said remain calm. And he does a great job of keeping us level and running our game plan.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798\u200b to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members kicked off a legal battle.\u200b",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. But the same day,\u00a0three flights\u00a0carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men \u2014 137 of whom were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act \u2014 were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "The March 15 order was upheld\u00a0by a federal appeals court\u00a0on March 26. Two days later, the Trump administration\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to lift the lower court orders.",
      "On Monday, April 7, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the administration to resume deportations using the law, but said that individuals subject to removal are entitled to judicial review.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation. Top White House officials had argued migrants subject to deportation under the law are not entitled to due process. But, the Supreme Court said on April 7 that going forward, Alien Enemies Act detainees must receive notice \"that they are subject to removal under the Act,\" and the notice must allow them to challenge their detention.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, whose order temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese descent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has begun revoking the legal status of migrants who entered the U.S. under a Biden administration process powered by a smartphone app formerly known as CBP One, instructing them to leave the country immediately or face arrest and deportation.",
      "During the Biden administration, more than 900,000 migrants entered the U.S. at official entry points along the southern border after securing appointments through CBP One. They were typically given notices to appear in immigration court, to begin the asylum process, as well as a two-year grant of immigration parole, which allowed them to work in the U.S. lawfully. The policy was designed to dissuade migrants from crossing the border unlawfully.",
      "But the Trump administration has started sending notices to those who entered through the CBP One system, informing them that their parole status is being terminated over 7 days.",
      "\"If you do not depart the United States immediately you will be subject to potential law enforcement actions that will result in your removal from the United States \u2014 unless you have otherwise obtained a lawful basis to remain here,\" the message sent by the Department of Homeland Security and obtained by CBS News reads.",
      "The notification encourages migrants to sign up for self-deportation through the very same app that allowed them to enter the U.S. It is now called CBP Home.",
      "\"Again, DHS is terminating your parole. Do not attempt to remain in the United States \u2014 the federal government will find you,\" the notice says. \"Please depart the United States immediately.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security confirmed the status cancellations, saying in a statement to CBS News that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \"has full authority to revoke parole.\"",
      "\"Canceling these paroles is a promise kept to the American people to secure our borders and protect national security,\" the department added. \"Formal termination notices have been issued, and affected aliens are urged to voluntarily self-deport using the CBP Home App. Those who refuse will be found, removed, and permanently barred from reentry.\"",
      "The Trump administration's actions should not immediately affect migrants who entered via CBP One and applied for asylum and have pending cases in immigration court. The government generally has to wait for those cases to be adjudicated or terminated before moving to deport them.",
      "The move to strip those who entered under the app of their legal status is the latest effort by the Trump administration to dismantle Biden-era immigration programs and expand the pool of migrants eligible to be arrested and deported.",
      "The administration has given more than half a million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who arrived under a separate Biden administration initiative until April 24 to self-deport or face arrest by deportation agents. Like CBP One entrants, those who came to the U.S. under this sponsorship policy, known as CHNV, were granted parole upon entering the country.",
      "Officials have also tried to phase out a Temporary Protected Status program for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants, though that effort is currently held up in federal court.",

    "summary": "Pharmaceutical companies accused of fueling the nation's opioid crisis are paying state and local governments billions of dollars in legal settlements. But how much are victims getting?",
    "story": [
      "Christopher Julian's opioid journey is familiar to many Americans.",
      "He was prescribed painkillers as a teenager for a series of sports injuries. He said the doctor never warned him they could be addictive. Julian didn't learn that fact until years later, when he was cut off and began suffering withdrawal symptoms. At that point, he started siphoning pills from family members and buying them from others in his southern Maine community.",
      "After his brother died of brain cancer in 2011, Julian used opioids to cope with more than physical pain.",
      "He stole to support his addiction, cycled in and out of jail and treatment, and overdosed 10 times, he said. His mother once gave him CPR on their bathroom floor.",
      "Life was \"hell on Earth,\" said Julian, now 43 and in long-term recovery.",
      "Like tens of thousands of others who have suffered similarly, Julian filed claims for compensation from pharmaceutical companies accused of fueling the opioid crisis.",
      "Earlier this year, he received his first payout: $324.58.",
      "That's enough to fill his car with gas about eight times or pay about a tenth of the rent for an apartment he shares with his fiancee and two children.",
      "Meanwhile, Maine's Cumberland County, where Julian lives, has received more than $700,000 in opioid settlement money and expects nearly $1.6 million more in the coming years, according to a newly updated database from KFF Health News. Jurisdictions throughout his state have received more than $68 million to date, and governments nationwide have raked in upward of $10 billion, the database shows.",
      "That discrepancy between individuals' and governments' compensations highlights a sense of injustice felt by people directly affected by the crisis who say their suffering is the reason that governments secured these settlements.",
      "Opioid settlements with companies like Purdue Pharma, Walmart, and Johnson & Johnson have led to headline-grabbing multibillion-dollar payouts, but most of the windfall is flowing to state and local governments, not directly to victims of the crisis.",
      "Only a handful of companies \u2014 those that filed for bankruptcy, including Purdue Pharma, Mallinckrodt, Endo, and Rite Aid \u2014 have set aside payouts for individuals. To qualify, people must have filed claims within a certain window and provided documents proving they were prescribed painkillers from that company. Even then, many victims will receive just a few thousand dollars, lawyers and advocates estimate. Most of these companies have not started paying yet, so victims might have to wait months or years more before seeing the cash.",
      "In contrast, state and local governments have already received settlement\u00a0money. To understand the size of those payouts, KFF Health News in January downloaded data from BrownGreer, the court-appointed firm administering many national opioid settlements, and used it to update a searchable database that allows users to determine how much their city, county, or state has received or expects to receive each year.",
      "Governments are receiving that money because attorneys general argued that their states' public safety, health, and social service systems were harmed by the opioid crisis. Jurisdictions are supposed to spend settlement money on addiction treatment, recovery, and prevention programs. But many affected individuals and families say governments have failed to adhere to that mission.",
      "\"At the very minimum, they could spend these dollars right to prevent the future loss of life,\" said Ryan Hampton, a national recovery advocate and previous co-chair of a committee in the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy case, where he represented victims. \"That is the opposite of what we've seen to date.\"",
      "In Pennsylvania, a group of bereaved family members raised similar concerns to Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, who finalized opioid settlements when he was attorney general.",
      "\"Instead of directing funds toward evidence-based solutions, you and your administration have allowed counties to divert these resources into law enforcement, ineffective programs, and initiatives that already have other funding streams available \u2014 disrespecting both our families and the lives lost,\" they wrote in a letter dated Feb. 14. \"Meanwhile, bereaved families \u2014 many of whom have lost everything \u2014 have no financial relief.\"",
      "\"Governments were way more powerful\"",
      "To be sure, many governments have spent millions of settlement dollars on treatment programs, recovery supports, distribution of overdose reversal medications, and other efforts. Some officials in charge of the money say those services, which reach many residents, can have a greater impact than individual payouts.",
      "Will Simons, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania governor, said in a statement that the Shapiro administration has invested nearly $90 million of settlement funds into treatment, recovery, harm reduction, and prevention initiatives, including prevention programs for youths, a drug and alcohol call center, and loan repayment programs aimed at retaining workers in the addiction treatment and recovery field.",
      "Many of the awarded organizations \"support families who have lost loved ones to this crisis, providing counseling and other family supports,\" Simons said.",
      "A few jurisdictions have created fairly modest funds directed at individuals, such as one in Boston to aid families who have lost loved ones to addiction, and a fund in Alabama for grandparents having to raise children because of parental substance use.",
      "But nationwide, there's little that resembles the widespread cash payments that many advocates, like Hampton, originally envisioned.",
      "In the mid-2010s, Hampton said, he and other advocates considered filing class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies but realized they didn't have the resources.",
      "A few years later, when state attorneys general began pursuing cases against those companies, victims were thrilled, thinking they would finally get compensation alongside their governments. Hampton and other advocates held rallies, shared their stories publicly, and galvanized support for the states' lawsuits.",
      "In 2019, when Hampton became co-chair of the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy and arrived at the negotiating table with state attorneys general and other entities, he thought \"everybody was there to take on the big bad pharmaceutical company and to put victims' interests first,\" he said. But as the negotiation proceeded among various creditors vying for the company's assets, he said, \"governments were way more powerful than victims and believed that they were more harmed than victims in terms of cost.\"",
      "Details of the Purdue settlement are still being finalized, and payments are unlikely to start until next year, but estimates suggest state and local governments will receive the lion's share, while more than 100,000 victims will split a fraction of the bankruptcy payout.",
      "Mallinckrodt, a manufacturer of generic opioids, is the only company that had begun paying victims as of early 2025, said Frank Younes, a partner at the Nebraska-based law firm High & Younes, which is representing personal injury claimants in several opioid bankruptcies.",
      "After paying roughly 25% in administrative fees to the national trust overseeing the bankruptcy and an additional 40% in attorney fees, some of his clients have received between $400 and $700, Younes said.",
      "He expects payouts from two other companies \u2014 Endo and Rite Aid \u2014 \"will be even lower.\"",
      "But many victims won't receive anything. Some didn't know they could file claims until it was too late. Others struggled to obtain medical records from shuttered doctors' offices or pharmacies that didn't retain older documents.",
      "Out of nearly 20,000 people who contacted Younes' firm to participate in the various opioid bankruptcies, he said, only about 3,500 were able to file.",
      "\"Do something for these families\"",
      "John McNerney was told his Purdue Pharma claim didn't qualify, because he hadn't been prescribed enough OxyContin to meet the threshold. He submitted claims for Mallinckrodt and Endo instead.",
      "McNerney, 60, who lives in Boca Raton, Florida, said he suffered a spinal injury decades ago from a fall during a plumbing repair. For years afterward, he was prescribed various painkillers. Once his doctors cut him off, he began using pills a friend bought off the street. McNerney spent about $30,000 on rehabs before he entered long-term recovery.",
      "Now when he sees governments spending settlement money on police cars or library books about addiction \"instead of putting 100% of it into rehab,\" he said, \"it really bothers the heck out of me.\"",
      "\"I haven't received a nickel,\" he said.",
      "In Ohio, a group of affected families were similarly frustrated that money wasn't reaching them or the places where they thought it was needed most.",
      "The families teamed up with local nonprofits to submit grant applications to the OneOhio Recovery Foundation, which controls most of the state's opioid settlement funds. They asked for several million dollars to put toward family support groups, training for family members who take in children whose parents have substance use disorders, and emergency cash aid for families to buy cribs or school supplies and cover funeral costs.",
      "Jackie Lewis, a member of the group, said that when her 34-year-old son, Shaun, died of an overdose, she had to pay his funeral costs by credit card. She has filed a claim in the opioid bankruptcies but hasn't received any money yet.",
      "\"Too many families didn't have a credit card to do that with,\" Lewis said. \"There are families I've talked to that couldn't do flowers. Some had to do a cremation instead of a traditional funeral.\"",
      "Her group did not receive funding in the first round of grants from the OneOhio Recovery Foundation.",
      "Connie Luck, a spokesperson for the foundation, said the legal documents that established the foundation do not allow direct payments to individuals affected by the crisis. The foundation has awarded over $45 million to 245 projects throughout the state, including dozens that provide family support services like child care and rental assistance.",
      "\"We deeply empathize with those who have lost loved ones to the opioid epidemic \u2014 their pain is real, and it fuels the Foundation's mission to end this crisis and prevent it from happening again,\" Luck said in a statement.",
      "In Maine, Julian has made peace with his $325 payout, deciding to consider it a surprise bonus rather than compensation for his years of suffering.",
      "But he hopes governments will use their more substantial sums to provide real help \u2014 food and rental assistance for people in recovery and more treatment beds so no one has to wait six months to enter rehab as he once did.",
      "\"They're getting millions of dollars,\" said Julian, who has lost numerous close friends to overdose. \"They could do something for these families that have suffered great losses.\"",
      "KFF Health News data editor Holly K. Hacker contributed to this article.",
      "METHODOLOGY",
      "For more than two years, KFF Health News has been tracking how state and local governments use \u2014 and misuse \u2014 billions of dollars in opioid settlement funds. This database marks our third update of data showing how much money state and local governments have received through national settlements with companies that made or distributed prescription painkillers.",
      "BrownGreer, the court-appointed firm administering many national opioid settlements, tracks how much money it has delivered to various state and local governments, as well as how much is allocated to those jurisdictions for future years. It initially kept this information private.",
      "In 2023, KFF Health News negotiated to obtain that information and made it public for the first time. Five months later, BrownGreer began posting updated versions of the information on a public website.",
      "Last year, KFF Health News downloaded BrownGreer's data on payouts from pharmaceutical distributors AmerisourceBergen (now called Cencora), Cardinal Health, and McKesson, as well as opioid manufacturer Janssen (now known as Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine), and used the state-by-state spreadsheets with separate entries for each settling company to create a searchable database.",
      "This year, KFF Health News has updated that database with new data from BrownGreer, including payouts from opioid manufacturers Allergan and Teva, as well as CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart pharmacies.",
      "KFF Health News downloaded data from BrownGreer's website between Jan. 20 and 24, 2025, concerning payouts from all companies. Users can use the database to determine the total dollar amount their city, county, or state has received or expects to receive each year.",
      "Although this is the most comprehensive data available at a national scale, it provides just a snapshot of all opioid settlement payouts. Other settlements, including with OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma, are still pending. This data does not reflect additional settlements that some state and local governments have entered into beyond the national deals, such as the agreement between Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio and regional supermarket chain Meijer. As such, this database undercounts the amount of opioid settlement money most places have received and will receive.",
      "Payment details for some states are not available, because those states were not part of national settlement agreements, had unique settlement terms, or opted not to have their payments distributed via BrownGreer. A few examples:",
      "\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 West Virginia declined to join several national settlements and instead reached individual settlements with many of these companies.",
      "\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Texas and Nevada were paid in full by Janssen outside the national settlement, so their payout data reflects payments only from other companies with which they entered national settlements.",
      "\u00b7\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Florida, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania, among others, opted to receive a lump-sum payment via BrownGreer then distribute the money to localities themselves.",
      "BrownGreer shows that several states received some of their anticipated 2027 payment from the distributors (AmerisourceBergen \u2014 now called Cencora \u2014 Cardinal Health, and McKesson) early in 2024. However, for three states \u2014 Colorado, Michigan, and Washington \u2014 BrownGreer does not provide data on how much of this prepayment went to each locality. As such, locality payments in these states may be undercounted for 2024 and overcounted for 2027.",
      "For Oregon, BrownGreer shows 2024 payments from Walmart as fully paid in its statewide data but lists some August 2024 payments for localities as \"projected.\" Since the data was downloaded well past that August 2024 date, we have included those \"projected\" amounts in the 2024 paid total for Oregon localities. No other states had this discrepancy.",

      "The high court split 5-4 in granting a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in the dispute over President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang without a hearing. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the three liberal justices in criticizing the majority's decision.",
      "In its unsigned decision, the Supreme Court said the detainees who are challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act are confined in Texas, so the venue for their case is \"improper\" in the District of Columbia, which is where the dispute has been considered.",
      "\"As a result, the government is likely to succeed on the merits of this action,\" the court said in its ruling lifting two temporary restraining orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington that prevented removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "It added that going forward, detainees subject to the 1798 law \"must receive notice\" that they face removal under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,\" the court said.",
      "The federal district court issued an order last month that prevented the government from deporting the migrants under the 220-year-old law while legal proceedings move forward, and the administration asked the Supreme Court to lift that order.",
      "The decision from the high court to do so comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary, as Mr. Trump's second-term policies have collided with the federal courts. More than 100 cases that challenge key aspects of his agenda have been filed across the country, and disputes challenging at least six of the president's actions have so far reached the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "The ongoing fight over Mr. Trump's effort to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants is one of the most high-profile of the cases, and the district court's decision temporarily blocking the removals sparked calls from the president and his GOP allies for the judge presiding over the dispute to be impeached.",
      "In its decision, the court said the opinion confirms that detainees subject to removal orders under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation.",
      "\"The only question is which court will resolve that challenge. For the reasons set forth, we hold that venue lies in the district of confinement,\" it said.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, and joined in part by Barrett. She called the majority's legal conclusion \"suspect\" and accused the Trump administration of largely ignoring \"its obligations to the rule of law.\"",
      "\"The government's conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. That a majority of this court now rewards the government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible. We, as a nation and a court of law, should be better than this,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh highlighted the area of agreement among the court. All nine justices, he wrote, agree that judicial review is available. But he said they split as to where that review should take place.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on social media after the ruling, \"The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself. A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cheered the ruling with a warning to migrants in the U.S. unlawfully, saying in a statement, \"leave now or we will arrest you, lock you up and deport you.\"",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU who argued before the lower courts, told CBS News, \"We are disappointed that we will need to start the court process over again in a different venue, but the critical point is that the court rejected the government's remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is a big victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed a proclamation under the Alien Enemies Act last month, claiming that Tren de Aragua is \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion\" against the U.S. and declaring that all members of the gang in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to immediate detention and removal. The law had previously been invoked three times, and only during declared wars.",
      "The day after Mr. Trump's proclamation, five Venezuelan nationals who were being held at a detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act violated the terms of the law and asked a federal district court in Washington, D.C., to block their removals.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg swiftly agreed to stop their deportations for 14 days and later expanded his temporary order to prohibit the administration from removing all noncitizens in U.S. custody who are subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation. The judge allowed deportations under other legal authorities. A hearing on a request for a longer preliminary injunction is set for April 8, though it's unclear whether that will proceed as scheduled.",
      "Boasberg is also separately examining the circumstances surrounding the removal of 137 people under the Alien Enemies Act who were on planes bound for El Salvador while proceedings unfolded. The deportations raised questions as to whether the Trump administration violated an oral order from Boasberg calling for any planes carrying migrants subject to removal under the law to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's temporary order, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last month\u00a0declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations. The appeals court divided 2-1 in turning down the government's request to halt Boasberg's directive.",
      "In the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act grants the president sweeping national security authority.",
      "The district court's order, she argued in a filing, is \"forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans. Those orders \u2014 which are likely to extend additional weeks \u2014 now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"",
      "The administration also reiterated its request that the Supreme Court step in to curb the temporary restraining orders that have been issued by federal judges and block enforcement of a policy nationwide.",
      "\"Here, the district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"",
      "But lawyers for the Venezuelan migrants accused the president of stretching the limits of the Alien Enemies Act, which they said risked allowing the government to \"immediately begin whisking away anyone\" it unilaterally claims is a member of a criminal gang to a foreign prison.",
      "\"The president's effort to shoehorn a criminal gang into the AEA, on a migration-equals-invasion theory, is completely at odds with the limited delegation of wartime authority Congress chose to give him through the statute,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "They also argued that many of the people flown out of the U.S. to a Salvadoran prison are not members of Tren de Aragua, and at least eight were Venezuelan women who were returned to the U.S.",
      "Allowing the deportations to resume would have devastating consequences for their clients, the lawyers said. Already, 130 Venezuelan men have been sent to El Salvador, where they have been \"confined, incommunicado, in one of most brutal prisons in the world, where torture and other human rights abuses are rampant,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Without the TRO, plaintiffs will suffer extraordinary and irreparable harms \u2014 being sent out of the United States to a Salvadoran prison, where they will remain incommunicado, potentially for the rest of their lives, without having had any opportunity to contest their designation as gang members,\" lawyers for the migrants said.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court comes as the justices are considering a separate request from the Trump administration to lift a lower court order that required the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador to the United States.",
      "The man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was among those on the deportation flights at issue in the case involving the Alien Enemies Act, but he was removed under a different immigration law. Chief Justice John Roberts earlier Monday temporarily paused the district court's order that set an 11:59 p.m. Monday deadline for the government to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.",

    "story": [
      "Florida defeated Houston 65-63 to take home the school's third NCAA men's basketball championship\u00a0\u2014 their first in 18 years. The Gators came back from down double digits to take the lead in the final minute of the game.",
      "Florida and Walter Clayton Jr. somehow overcame Houston's spirit-crushing defense Monday night in an NCAA title-game thriller not decided until Clayton's own defense stopped the Cougars from taking a game-winning shot at the buzzer.",
      "Clayton finished with 11 points, all in the second half, but what he'll be remembered for most was getting Houston's Emanuel Sharp to stop in the middle of his motion as he tried to go up for the game-winning 3 in the final seconds.",
      "Clayton ran at him, Sharp dropped the ball and, unable to pick it up lest he get called for traveling, watched it bounce there while the clock ticked to zero. The Cougars and coach Kelvin Sampson were denied their first championship.",
      "Will Richard had 18 points to keep the Gators in it, winning their third overall title and first since the back-to-back championships of 2006 and 2007.",
      "\"Yeah, it's special. I feel like that's why everyone in our locker room came to Florida, just to bring Florida back to that national relevance and bring back a national championship to Gainesville. So it's special,\" Richard said in an interview on \"CBS Mornings\" Tuesday, adding that he didn't sleep at all after the big win: \"We had to enjoy and soak it all in!\"",
      "This was a defensive brawl, and for most of the night, Clayton got the worst of it.",
      "He was 0 for 4 from the field without a point through the first half. He didn't score until 14:57 remained in the game. He finished with one 3-pointer and, before that, a pair of three-point plays that kept the Gators in striking range.",
      "But it was Florida's defense, not Houston's, that controlled the final minute.",
      "After Alijah Martin made two free throws to put Florida ahead 64-63 \u2014  its first lead since 8-6 \u2014 the Gators lured Sharp into a triple-team in the corner, where Richard got him to dribble the ball off his leg and out of bounds.",
      "Florida made one free throw on the next possession and that set up the finale. The ball first went to L.J. Cryer \u2014   who led the Cougars with 19 points. Blanketed by Richard, he threw to Sharp, who was moving to spot up for a 3 when Clayton ran at him. That left him with no choice but to let the ball go.",
      "Sampson, who designed a defense that held Florida under 70 points for only the second time this season, looked on in shock.",
      "Instead of the 69-year-old becoming the oldest coach to win the title, the 39-year-old Golden becomes the youngest since N.C. State's Jim Valvano in 1983 to win it all.",
      "The Gators trailed by 12 points early in the second half, and Clayton wasn't the only one getting frustrated.",
      "The Florida bench got a technical during a quick span of three foul calls in less than a minute. Later in the second half, Houston's smothering defense baited Rueben Chinyelu into a technical after committing a foul.",
      "But that wasn't enough. Houston ends up at the same place as the Phi Slama Jama teams of the 1980s \u2014   in second place, but memorable.",
      "This gut-wrenching loss came two nights after the Cougars fashioned a wild comeback of their own, from 14 down against Duke.",
      "All three Final Four games were decided down the stretch, none by more than six.",

      "\"A total solar eclipse is one of the most spectacular things anyone can see in their lifetime,\" Virginia Tech astrophysicist Nahum Arav told CBS News. The eclipse \"looks like a black hole in the sky,\" said Arav, who watched the paths of totality of eclipses in 1991 and 2017.",
      "The 2024 eclipse started on the Pacific Coast of Mexico, and then moved into Texas.

      "When is the next total solar eclipse in the U.S. after the 2024 eclipse?",
      "Solar eclipses happen about twice a year, said Arav. \"Eclipses happen all over the Earth evenly,\" he told CBS News \u2014 but noted the timings when they occur are not regular. That means\u00a0eclipses can occur within just a few years, or every few decades, in North America.",
      "Before the eclipse in 2024, the last total solar eclipses visible from the U.S. were in 2017 and\u00a01979. The 2017 solar eclipse was the first whose path of totality crossed the entire continent in 99 years.",
      "Even though eclipses may seem to occur randomly, scientists can pinpoint exactly when and where they will happen.",
      "\"There is no ambiguity, as we know exactly where it will land,\" said Arav.",
      "There will be eight total solar eclipses visible from parts of the continental U.S. in the 21st century, Arav said, with one occurring about every 12 years, on average.",
      "The next one is predicted to occur on Aug. 23, 2044, NASA said. However, the path of totality from this eclipse will only touch three states, according to\u00a0The Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to public interest in space.",

      "Path of totality for the 2044 total solar eclipse",
      "The 2044 eclipse will start in Greenland on Aug. 23, 2044, and will continue its path through Canada.",

      "The path of totality will cross Williston and Dickinson, North Dakota, and Great Falls, Montana.",
      "Path of totality for the 2045 total solar eclipse",
      "The next solar eclipse that crosses a significant portion of the continental U.S. will be in 2045, said Arav. That year, a solar eclipse on Aug. 12 will darken skies in parts of the U.S., Haiti, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname and Brazil.",
      "It will be visible in many states as it moves from coast to coast. The eclipse will start in California and move east to end in Florida, similar to 2017, Arav said.",

      "During a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Mr. Trump said \"we're having direct talks with Iran,\" beginning Saturday. \"We have a very big meeting, and we'll see what can happen,\" he said. The president said Iran is \"going to be in great danger\" if the direct talks don't go well.",

      "In a post on his Truth Social app, Mr. Trump said \"any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set.\"",
      "He added, \"Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th.\"",

      "In response to Mr. Trump's imposition of a 34% tariff on Chinese imports, which is set to go into effect on April 9, Beijing last week announced it would add a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10.",
      "If Mr. Trump implements his plans, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of 20% tariffs aimed at spurring China to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week.",
      "Last year, the U.S. imported about $439 billion worth of goods from China, ranging from Apple iPhones to clothing, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative.",
      "Excluding the threat of an added 50% levy on Chinese imports, American consumers could face higher costs of about $3,789 per year due to the previously announced tariffs, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Consumers generally bear the brunt of tariffs because importers like Walmart, which must pay the import duties when they accept shipments from other nations, typically seek to spread all or most of the cost through higher price tags on imported goods.

      "Opening statements began Monday in the Arizona trial of \"Doomsday mom\"\u00a0Lori Vallow Daybell, the mother who was\u00a0sentenced to life in prison\u00a0in Idaho for killing her children in 2019.",
      "In Arizona, Vallow Daybell has been indicted of conspiracy to commit murder in the death of her fourth husband, Charles Vallow.",
      "She has pleaded not guilty to the charge and is\u00a0representing herself\u00a0at the trial.",
      "\"I'm fighting for my life here,\" Vallow Daybell\u00a0told CBS affiliate AZFamily's True Crime Arizona correspondent Briana Whitney in a jailhouse interview ahead of opening statements.",
      "Jury selection in the Arizona case began on Monday, March 31. About 200 potential jurors were screened,\u00a0AZFamily reported, but many were ruled out by Vallow Daybell and prosecutors because they knew about the case. Sixteen jurors, including four alternates, were chosen. The jury is made up of 13 men and three women, AZFamily reported.",
      "AZFamily has been permitted by the judge to stream the trial on a 30-minute delay. The trial is expected to last until mid-May at the latest.",
      "What did Lori Vallow Daybell do?",
      "Lori Vallow Daybell was sentenced to life in prison without parole in the killings of her children, Tylee Ryan and Joshua Jaxon \"JJ\" Vallow. Tylee was Vallow Daybell's child from a previous relationship. She and Charles Vallow adopted JJ in 2012.",
      "In 2018, Vallow Daybell met doomsday fiction author Chad Daybell. A year later, she separated from Vallow and began a relationship with Daybell.",
      "The couple held apocalyptic religious beliefs that prosecutors claimed were used to justify the killings of Tylee, JJ and Daybell's first wife, Tammy Daybell.",
      "Tylee and JJ disappeared within two weeks of each other in September 2019. In October 2019, Tammy Daybell was found dead in her bed. A coroner said her death initially appeared to be due to natural causes, but an autopsy wasn't conducted before her body was buried. Two weeks later, in November 2019, Daybell and Vallow Daybell were married in Hawaii.",
      "The remains of Tammy Daybell were exhumed in December 2019, an autopsy was performed and her cause of death was determined to be asphyxiation. In February 2020, Vallow Daybell was arrested in Hawaii for ignoring a police order to produce her children, who had been reported missing by their grandparents. Several months later, in June 2020, the bodies of Tylee and JJ were found on a property owned by Chad Daybell.",
      "Daybell and Vallow Daybell were each charged in the deaths of Tammy Daybell, Tylee and JJ. In separate trials, they were each found guilty of murder and conspiracy to commit murder in the children's deaths. Vallow Daybell was also convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in Tammy Daybell's death and of theft charges related to financial payments sent to her children.",
      "Daybell was found guilty of murder in Tammy Daybell's death, as well as several other related charges. He has been sentenced to death.",
      "What was Lori Vallow Daybell's relationship with Charles Vallow?",
      "Lori Vallow Daybell and Charles Vallow were married from 2006 to 2019.",
      "In early 2019, Vallow became very worried about his wife. He went to the police with his concerns, telling them that Vallow Daybell believed she was a \"god\" who was preparing for the end of days.",
      "\"She threatened me, murder me, kill me,\" he told police in a conversation recorded on video, according to \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Vallow filed for divorce in February 2019. In the filing, he said that Vallow Daybell had threatened to murder him. He also expressed fears for JJ and Tylee's safety.",
      "How did Charles Vallow die?",
      "Charles Vallow was shot and killed by Lori Vallow Daybell's brother, Alexander Lamar Cox, on July 11, 2019.",
      "Vallow had gone to the home where Vallow Daybell was living with Cox and the two children after their separation to pick up JJ. The home was in Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix, Arizona.",
      "In police video, Tylee said that she heard Vallow and Cox arguing.",
      "\"Honestly, it feels, it feels like 2 seconds, and 40 minutes at the same time. ... I just kind of heard yelling over everything. I don't know, I kind of just do that when everything is, like, really loud, I kind of just tune what people are saying out,\" she told detectives.",
      "Cox told police that he had killed Vallow in self-defense. He was not arrested.",
      "Cox's wife, Zulema Pastenes, testified that Daybell and Vallow Daybell had convinced him that his divine mission was to protect his sister. Pastenes said that Cox told her he feared the pair would make him their \"fall guy.\" That conversation, Pastenes said, occurred a day before Cox's sudden death in December 2019. Medical examiners said he died of a pulmonary blood clot.",
      "What to know about the latest charges",
      "Lori Vallow Daybell has been charged with conspiring with Alex Cox to kill Charles Vallow. The trial is taking place in Phoenix, Arizona, where Vallow died.",
      "April Raymond\u00a0told \"48 Hours\" that Vallow Daybell, her former friend, told her\u00a0she believed Vallow was already dead and had a demon living inside him. She would later make similar comments about her children.",
      "In December 2024, a judge ruled that Vallow Daybell was mentally fit to stand trial. She will be able to wear civilian clothes and will not be shackled, but will have to wear a shock vest, AZFamily said.",
      "Complicating the trial is Vallow Daybell's decision to represent herself. Vallow Daybell said that she has studied case law during her time in prison. She also said she has experience in court that will help her represent herself.",
      "\"My intention is to say the things that I would say for myself,\" Vallow Daybell said in the jailhouse interview with Whitney.",
      "She said her attorneys in Idaho did not always say what she wanted them to and \"sometimes you just have to be able to do it for yourself.\"",
      "Vallow Daybell said she hadn't decided yet if she would testify at the trial.",
      "\"We're going to see how it goes,\" she said.",
      "The logistics of preparing for the case have been a challenge, Vallow Daybell said. At a\u00a0hearing on March 18 she said it was difficult for her to communicate with her legal team while in jail.",
      "\"Where I am at the jail, the communication is very difficult for me to get ahold of my investigator, get ahold of my paralegal. I'm 23 hours a day locked down. If I don't have Wi-Fi, I don't have a phone, if I don't have battery, I don't have a phone,\" she said.",
      "If found guilty, Vallow faces life in prison with the possibility of parole after 25 years. She is already serving multiple life sentences with no possibility of parole after the convictions in Idaho.",
      "This trial is not the last of her legal troubles. Vallow Daybell also faces a charge of conspiracy to commit murder for the attempted shooting of her niece's ex-husband, Brandon Boudreaux.\u00a0Boudreaux was shot at in 2019\u00a0while driving near his home but was unhurt. Prosecutors say Cox carried out the shooting but missed his target. Vallow Daybell has pleaded not guilty to the charge.",
      "Lori Vallow Daybell's \"Dateline\" interview",
      "In a jailhouse interview with NBC's \"Dateline,\" which aired in March, Vallow Daybell made multiple baseless claims. She was often combative toward correspondent Keith Morrison as she claimed to be innocent of all charges.",
      "She said she \"was not there\" when JJ and Tylee were killed and was not involved in Tammy Daybell's death. She tried to blame JJ's death on Tylee, Morrison said, but investigators have said Tylee died before JJ.",
      "\"She came in and she had her own agenda,\" Morrison said of Vallow Daybell ahead of the airing of the \"Dateline\" episode. \"She wanted to be the aggressor.\"",
      "During the interview, Vallow Daybell also briefly discussed how she would serve as her own attorney in the Charles Vallow case. She called the process \"great\" but a \"difficult thing to do.\"",

      "\"I spoke with Marco Rubio, I'm in regular contact with the other members of the American administration. I think you guys are really trying, step-by-step, to get to a situation where this war can end,\" Rutte said, before questioning Russia's commitment to the process.",
      "\"Russians also have to dance the tango, and at this moment they don't seem to do so,\" Rutte said, while the Ukrainians \"are really close to the American position.\"",
      "Russia has not yet agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire proposed by the U.S. and has said there are still outstanding issues that must be resolved first.",
      "Rubio, who is attending a NATO conference in Brussels, told reporters Friday, \"We will know from their answers very soon whether they are serious about proceeding with real peace or whether it's a delay tactic. Now we've reached the stage where we need to make progress.\"",
      "Rutte said it was President Trump's inauguration that kickstarted the peace process, telling Brennan that \"until January this year, nothing happened when it came to bringing this war to an end.\"",
      "The two sides and the U.S. are working to hammer out the details of a partial ceasefire.",
      "NATO and the Trump tariffs",
      "Rutte said that he does not believe Mr. Trump's global tariffs, which slammed Europe and many allies, will harm the military alliance.",
      "\"I'm not saying it doesn't have an impact on individual allies, but it does not have an impact on the alliance,\" said NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in an interview recorded Friday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "He added that it's \"my firm conviction\" that a potential trade war will not affect Europe's defense spending or commitment to NATO.",
      "Mr. Trump has frequently criticized NATO countries for spending less than 2% of their gross domestic product on defense and in his second administration pushed for members to more than double their defense spending to 5%.",
      "Rutte argued Friday that European countries have already ramped up their spending.",
      "\"It is staggering the amount of billions coming in. It \u2014you have to compare this to the days of the Cold War, when you look at the overall defense spending now being ramped up in Europe,\" Rutte said.",
      "Nuclear deterrence",
      "Pressed by Brennan over statements made by the leaders of Germany, Poland and France about expanding a western European nuclear umbrella \u2014 beyond the assurances of protection provided by the U.S. and United Kingdom \u2014 Rutte said he's confident in the U.S.' nuclear security guarantee.",
      "\"Marco Rubio this week basically repeated what President Trump has said three times now on television: that the U.S. is completely committed to NATO, is completely committed to Article 5,\" Rutte said. \"That includes the U.S. being the ultimate guarantor, through the nuclear deterrent, for NATO territory, including, and particularly of course, the European part of NATO.\" Article 5 says that an attack on any NATO member country is an attack on all members.",
      "Rutte said the Trump administration has \"consistently\" said it is committed to the alliance.",
      "\"What I'm urging my European colleagues to do is to put on the television and sometimes listen to the senior American leadership when it comes to NATO,\" Rutte said. \"Instead of worrying constantly about, 'Is the U.S. still committed to NATO?' The answer is yes, it has been consistently coming out of the American system over the last three months.\"",

      "Israel announces new corridors",
      "Meanwhile, Israel says it has deployed troops to a newly established security corridor across Southern Gaza. Netanyahu announced the new Morag Corridor on Saturday and suggested it would cut off the southern city of Rafah, which Israel has ordered evacuated, from the rest of Gaza.",
      "A military statement Saturday said troops with the 36th Division had been deployed in the corridor. It was not immediately clear how many had deployed or where exactly the corridor was located. Morag is the name of a Jewish settlement that once stood between Rafah and Khan Younis, and Netanyahu suggested it would run between the cities.",

      "Israel has also reasserted control over the Netzarim corridor that cuts off the northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, from the rest of the strip. The Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors run from the Israeli border to the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "Hamas says situation is \"highly dangerous\" for hostages",
      "Hamas, which had long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. even before it carried out the brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked\u00a0the war in Gaza, said Friday that Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza was creating a \"highly dangerous\" situation for the hostages still held there. It warned that half of the living captives were in areas where the Israeli army had ordered evacuations.",
      "\"Half of the living Israeli (hostages) are located in areas that the Israeli occupation army has requested to be evacuated in recent days,\" Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, said in a statement, AFP reported. \"We have decided not to transfer these (hostages)... but (this situation) is highly dangerous to their lives.\"",
      "Hamas says it will only release the remaining 59 hostages \u2014 24 of whom are believed to be alive \u2014 in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli pullout from Gaza. The group has rejected demands that it lay down its arms or leave the territory.",
      "Israel has issued sweeping evacuation orders for parts of northern Gaza ahead of expected expansions in its ground operations. The U.N. humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since Israel abruptly ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month that had been brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.",
      "To pressure Hamas, Israel has imposed\u00a0a monthlong blockade\u00a0on food, fuel and humanitarian aid that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle \u2014 a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime. Israel said earlier this week that enough food had entered Gaza during a six-week truce to sustain the territory's roughly 2 million Palestinians for a long time.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostages, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements and other deals.

The bodies of 14 children and five women were recovered from the school in the Tuffah neighborhood of Gaza City, and the death toll could rise because some of the 70 wounded sustained critical injuries, said Health Ministry spokesman Zaher al-Wahidi.",
      "The Civil Defense rescue agency in Gaza said Friday that at least 31 people were killed in the strike on the school, with around 100 others injured.  More than 30 other Gaza residents were killed in strikes on homes in the nearby neighborhood of Shijaiyah, al-Wahidi said, citing records at Ahli Hospital.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck a \"Hamas command and control center\" in the Gaza City area, and that it took steps to lessen harm to civilians. Israel gave the same reason \u2014 striking Hamas militants in a \"command and control center\" \u2014 for attacking a United Nations building used as a shelter a day earlier, killing at least 17 people.",
      "Hamas, which had long been designated a terrorist organization by Israel and the U.S. even before it carried out the brutal Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, called the strike on the school a \"heinous massacre\" of innocent civilians.",
      "Israel has long accused Hamas of hiding weapons and fighters in and around civilian infrastructure, but the Israel Defense Forces provided no immediate evidence to back up its claim that Hamas commanders were present in the Gaza school or the U.N. building it bombed this week.",
      "The strikes came as Israel's military ordered more residents in parts of northern Gaza to evacuate west and south to shelters, warning that it planned to \"work with extreme force in your area.\" A number of the Palestinians fleeing the targeted areas did so on foot, with some carrying their belongings on their backs and others using donkey carts.",
      "\"My wife and I have been walking for three hours covering only one kilometer,\" said Mohammad Ermana, 72. The couple, clasping hands, each walked with a cane. \"I'm searching for shelters every hour now, not every day,\" he said.",

The U.N. humanitarian office said around 280,000 Palestinians have been displaced since Israel abruptly ended a ceasefire with Hamas last month that had been brokered by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar.",
      "The fresh evacuation orders came a day after senior government officials said Israel would seize large parts of the Palestinian territory and establish a new security corridor across it. Israel has imposed a monthlong blockade on food, fuel and humanitarian aid on Gaza that has left civilians facing acute shortages as supplies dwindle \u2014 a tactic that rights groups say is a war crime.

      "Overnight strikes by Israel killed at least 55 people in the Gaza Strip, hospital officials said Thursday.",
      "In the southern city of Khan Younis, officials said the bodies of 14 people had been taken to Nasser Hospital \u2013 nine of them from the same family. The dead included five children and four women. The bodies of another 19 people, including five children aged between 1 and 7 years and a pregnant woman, were taken to the European hospital near Khan Younis, hospital officials said. In Gaza City, 21 bodies were taken to Ahli hospital, including those of seven children.",
      "Later in the day, strikes killed four more people in Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, and another two people were killed in central Gaza and taken to Al Aqsa Hospital.",
      "The attacks came as the Israeli military promised an independent investigation of a March 23 operation in which its forces opened fire on ambulances in southern Gaza. U.N. officials say 15 Palestinian medics and emergency responders were killed, and their bodies and ambulances were buried by Israeli soldiers in a mass grave.",
      "The military initially said the ambulances were operating suspiciously and that nine militants were killed. The military said the probe would be led by an expert fact-finding body \"responsible for examining exceptional incidents\" during the war. Rights groups say such Israeli investigations are often lacking and that soldiers are rarely punished.",
      "The head of the Palestine Red Crescent Society, Younes Al-Khatib, said Thursday he believed some of the medics were still alive when they were overtaken by Israeli forces. The organization's radio dispatchers heard a conversation in Hebrew between medics and Israeli soldiers after the ambulances had come under fire, Al-Khatib told members of the U.N. Security Council.",
      "Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, told the U.N. Security Council he was turning over a video he obtained, allegedly showing the moments leading up to the Israeli killing of 15 humanitarian workers in Gaza.",
      "Mansour said the video shows that the aid workers, including eight members of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, were traveling in emergency vehicles with the lights on at night to deconflict with Israeli Defense Forces. But, Mansour said, the video \"found on the body of one of the martyrs,\" shows that the Israeli army ambushed the vehicle despite the emergency lights.",

    "story": [
      "Europe vowed retaliation. China plotted tariffs of its own. Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "As part of his enthusiastic outreach to Mr. Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Mr. Trump, who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \"American Patriot\" gala.",
      "\"Make Argentina Great Again!\" Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.",
      "It would have been the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders since Mr. Trump's election victory last November as President Milei, who has imposed a sweeping austerity program to fix Argentina's long troubled economy, offers himself as one of Mr. Trump's strongest allies in the global culture war against the \"woke\" left.",
      "Whether Milei's staunch alliance with Mr. Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.",
      "\"He has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\" said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \"He hasn't managed to do that yet.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit.",
      "He threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Mr. Trump did. He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Mr. Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. He even promoted a cryptocurrency token echoing the $Trump memecoin \u2014 at great political cost. In Milei's case, the cryptocoin Libra collapsed and left investors holding the bag, to the tune of $250 million. He later admitted that he posted about the coin without properly vetting the details.",
      "Milei has also slashed government spending, similarly to what Mr. Trump and Elon Musk have done with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has reduced government spending in Argentina by over 30% since taking office in 2023 by eliminating about a dozen government agencies, laying off 10% of the federal workforce and freezing state wages and pensions. While the cuts have lowered the country's hyperinflation, they have pushed up unemployment and poverty rates. Weekly protests have been held criticizing the cuts.",
      "The cuts were something Milei promised while running for office, even wielding a chainsaw during his campaign. He then gifted Musk\u00a0a giant chainsaw modeled\u00a0after the power tool. Musk waved the chainsaw during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "Railing against socialism and feminism at speaking events all over the world \u2014 including at CPAC \u2014 Milei has fashioned himself into something of a MAGA celebrity.",
      "Argentinian government reacts to Trump tariffs",
      "While U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Mr. Trump's tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Mr. Trump's pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.",
      "\"As you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\" Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president's name as he spoke in Spanish.",
      "In Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Mr. Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.",
      "\"We do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\" Milei's spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Mr. Trump's announcement. \"I don't see why there should be so much concern about this.\"",
      "For all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina's largest-circulation daily, Clar\u00edn, declared: \"Trump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\"",
      "In Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \"highly productive\" meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.",
      "Milei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves.",
      "Milei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front.",
      "It was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund's biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \"an informal meeting\" with Mr. Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018.",
      "But on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Mr. Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet.",
      "The president's office said nothing about his meeting \u2014 or, non-meeting \u2014 with Mr. Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn't say whether he and Milei met.",
      "Major Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.",
      "\"When I woke up, I thought I'd find on TV the photo-op with your 'friend' Trump that you went looking for,\" left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner wrote on social media. \"What a way to mess around and spend money on nothing.\"",

    "story": [
      "An African giant pouched rat is being honored in the record books after detecting more than 100 landmines and other undetonated explosives in Cambodia, Belgian non-profit APOPO announced Friday.",
      "The rat, named Ronin, was named APOPO's most successful Mine Detection Rat. He also was acknowledged by the Guinness World Records.",
      "Since August 2021, Ronin has detected 109 landmines and 15 items of unexploded ordnance, APOPO said. The record-smashing rodent is expected to do another two years or more of detection work, the non-profit said.",
      "\"Ronin's achievements are a testament to the incredible potential of positive reinforcement training. He's not just an asset; he's a valued partner and colleague,\" said Phanny, Ronin's handler, in a news release from APOPO.",
      "The previous record was held by the African giant pouched rat Magawa, who detected 71 landmines and 38 pieces of unexploded ordnance over the course of five years.",
      "APOPO has been training mine-detecting rats for over 25 years. Ronin underwent clicker training, where the rat learns to associate the sound of a click with a treat, to motivate him to learn how to smell explosives. He was also trained to work systemically within a grid pattern and to indicate landmines by scratching at the ground. Ronin and rats like him work for about 30 minutes a day, APOPO said. When they reach a certain age, they are moved to a retirement community and remain under APOPO's care. Magawa, the previous record-holder, was retired in 2021 and died in 2022.",
      "Undetonated landmines and ordnance are a huge problem in Cambodia. Decades of conflict have left up to six million unexploded munitions in the country's soil, according to the Landmine Monitor's 2024 report. Since 1979, those buried bombs have caused about 20,000 deaths and 45,000 injuries, the Landmine Monitor reported. Demining efforts have been underway for decades, including the work done by Ronin and other APOPO rats. In 2023, there were only 32 reported casualties involving landmines in Cambodia, according to the Landmine Monitor. The site does not distinguish between injuries and deaths when referring to casualties.",
      "The APOPO's efforts are not limited to Cambodia. The non-profit estimates that about 110 million landmines are buried across 60 countries. In 2023, 1,431 deaths were connected to these landmines. The agency said it continues to work to remove landmines and unexploded ordnance from the world.",
      "\"When we launched APOPO, the common view was that it would take around 500 years to clear all landmines from the Earth's surface,\" said Christine Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \"25 years later, there is light at the end of the tunnel, and if the international community fully supports the collaboration of all demining operators, we could clear the remaining minefields in our lifetime.\"",

      "\"There are 11 factories in the country, most of which export goods to the U.S. and provide employment to 12,000 workers,\" Shelile said. \"Goods currently in production will be affected by these tariffs and will not be exported to the U.S.\"",
      "He said he'd asked factories to continue operating \"while we work on solutions,\" and added that the U.S. action showed his country needed to \"diversify\" its trade relationships, which he said it had already started exploring.",
      "\"We cannot rely solely on the U.S.,\" he said. \"While this transition will take time, the process is already underway.\"",
      "To determine the rates of its new tariffs, the White House used a formula to calculate the sum of all the trade practices it deems unfair from other nations, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers. Economists have questioned the methodology, and many\u00a0foreign governments have complained\u00a0the levies are unfair and misrepresent their trade imbalances with the U.S.",
      "The White House claims, by way of that formula, that Lesotho imposes 99% tariffs and other barriers on U.S. imports.",
      "Below is a look at the small kingdom, sometimes called \"the Switzerland of Africa\" thanks to its mountainous landscape. It took a bigger tariff hit from the White House this week than any other country.",
      "Where is the Lesotho?",
      "Completely surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is the largest of only three enclaved states in the world, but it is far bigger than San Marino or Vatican City, both of which are within Italy's borders.",
      "At about 11,720 square miles, it is about the same size as Belgium but has a population of roughly 2.3 million, compared to Belgium's nearly 12 million.",
      "Lesotho is known for the beauty of its mountainous terrain and styles itself the \"Kingdom in the Sky.\"",
      "More than 80% of the country sits 5,900 feet above sea level and it is home to southern Africa's only ski resort. Its highest peak is Mount Thabana Ntlenyana, with an altitude of 11,424 feet.",
      "A constitutional monarchy like Britain, it is ruled by 61-year-old King Letsie III, who has no formal power. The government is led by a prime minister selected through national parliamentary elections.",
      "What is Lesotho's economy like?",
      "With an annual gross domestic product of just over $2 billion, Lesotho is largely dependent on South Africa \u2014 it biggest trading partner \u2014 from which it imports most of its food, selling water in return.",
      "The economy has been heavily reliant on textile exports bound for the United States through the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade deal, which provides duty-free access to the U.S. market for some African products. The Trump administration's imposition of tariffs on African nations has raised questions over how likely the White House is to renew the AGOA pact when it expires in September.",
      "Its traditional Basotho blankets are a national symbol and renowned for their vibrant patterns and woolen warmth. They are often loaded with meaning, from celebrating life and nationality, to fertility and royalty, peace, love and courage.",
      "Lesotho ranks among the world's poorest countries despite huge mineral reserves. British mine company Gem Diamonds said in 2018 that it had discovered a 910-carat stone in one of its several Lesotho diamond mines.",
      "The country also pioneered the growing of cannabis for medical use in Africa.",
      "Unemployment has remained stubbornly high, hitting nearly 25% in 2023, according to the World Bank.",
      "\"Poverty and inequality remain significant challenges,\" the World Bank says. \"Despite efforts to improve living standards, a significant portion of Lesotho's population lives below the poverty line, with rural areas being particularly affected. Access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and clean water remains limited, contributing to poor health outcomes and educational attainment. High rates of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis further strain the healthcare system, reducing the workforce and increasing the dependency ratio.\"",
      "A link to Prince Harry through charity, until recently",
      "A charity co-founded by Prince Harry in Lesotho to help people living with HIV ran into turbulence this month after a bitter boardroom row led King Charles III's younger son to step down as patron.",
      "Its Zimbabwe-born chairperson, Sophie Chandauka, publicly accused the prince of \"bullying\" and being involved in a \"cover up,\" accusations the former royal has dismissed as lies.",
      "Harry founded the charity in 2006 with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, before it expanded to Botswana.",
      "The charity's name, Sentebale, is a tribute to his mother, Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997 when he was just 12.",
      "Lesotho's struggle with HIV/AIDS",
      "At least one in four adults in Lesotho is infected with HIV, one of the highest rates in the world.",
      "More than 230,000 people were receiving anti-retroviral treatment in 2021, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "In 2020, the country achieved the UN's \"90-90-90\" goal of 90% of people with the virus being diagnosed, on treatment and achieving viral suppression.",
      "The country also has the second-highest incidence of Tuberculosis in the world, estimated at 724 cases per 100,000 people.",

      "London \u2014 London's Metropolitan Police have charged comedian and actor Russell Brand with one count of rape, oral rape and indecent assault and two other counts of sexual assault, the police force said Friday. Brand issued a statement on Friday denying the allegations against him.",
      "British detectives have said they started investigating the TV star in September 2023 after \"receiving a number of allegations, which followed reporting by Channel 4's Dispatches and The Sunday Times.\"",
      "In September 2023, those British media outlets published claims by four women\u00a0who said they were sexually assaulted or raped by Brand between 2006 and 2013, at the height of his fame.",
      "\"The women who have made reports continue to receive support from specially trained officers. The Met's investigation remains open and detectives ask anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information, to come forward and speak with police,\" Metropolitan Police detective superintendent Andy Furphy said in a statement Friday.",
      "The police said in a statement that Brand would appear in a London court for a first hearing on May 2.",

      "He was to remain free on bail until his court appearance.",

      "In the video, which appeared to have been recorded outside of the U.K., Brand alluded to his adoption of Christianity, saying he accepted that \"I was a fool, before I lived in the light of the lord.\"",
      "\"I was a drug addict, sex addict, and an imbecile,\" he said, \"but what I never was, was a rapist. I've never engaged in non-consensual activity. I pray that you can see that by looking in my eyes.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 12:46:04 -0400",
    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

      "Over time, people who clear their throat often may find themselves doing it even more because of muscle memory. (iStock)",

      "\"A cooler environment facilitates this temperature drop, promoting deeper and more restful sleep.\"",

      "Semaglutide medications like Ozempic and Wegovy have exploded in popularity in recent years due to their effectiveness in diabetes control and weight loss.",
      "Research has revealed additional benefits beyond those primary uses \u2014 but some negative side effects have also emerged.",

      "MEN GOING BALD TURN TO 'NEW BOTOX' FOR HAIR LOSS TREATMENT",

      "After adjusting for other factors, they found that the semaglutide users were overall 50% more likely to experience hair loss compared to the other group.",
      "Women were more likely to have this outcome, with twice the risk of men.",
      "\u2018Not surprising\u2019",
      "The researchers were not surprised by the results, according to co-study author Dr. Mahyar Etminan, an epidemiologist and CEO of Epilytics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.",
      "\"There were [previous] anecdotal reports of hair loss and also reports of hair loss in clinical trials of the drugs,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "HAIR LOSS? GUT HEALTH ISSUES? DR. NICOLE SAPHIER REVEALS SMART FIXES",
      "Dr. Patrick Davis, a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon and hair restoration expert, agreed that the findings were not surprising.",
      "\"We have heard this anecdotally when patients consult us for surgical restoration of their face after rapid weight loss,\" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "After adjusting for other factors, researchers found that the semaglutide users were overall 50% more likely to experience hair loss compared to the other group. (iStock)",
      "\"Hair growth (and loss) are quite dependent on factors such as diet, essential vitamins, bodily stress and genetics.\"",
      "The first three factors come into play during weight loss, he noted \u2014 \"and semaglutide-driven loss is likely no exception.\"",
      "Previous studies have shown that changes inducing stress or affecting one\u2019s nutritional intake could pose an increased risk of hair loss, the doctor added.",
      "\"Hair growth (and loss) are quite dependent on factors such as diet, essential vitamins, bodily stress and genetics.\"",
      "\"This study references that those who lost more than 20% of their body weight had higher rates of hair loss than those who didn\u2019t,\" Davis noted.",
      "\"This study theorizes that this may be due to suspected physiological stress, which may be a symptom of such rapid weight loss.\"",
      "Long-term hair loss seems to be more unlikely, the doctor said, as the \"inciting event\" (weight loss and stress) often normalizes as individuals reach their target weight.",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The study did have some limitations, noted researcher Etminan.",
      "Those included the fact that it could not verify hair loss through medical records, but only identified medical codes for hair loss.",
      "Women were more likely to experience semaglutide-related hair loss, with twice the risk of men. (iStock)",
      "Davis, the plastic surgeon, also noted that this research references another study in which Wegovy users had an elevated risk of hair loss (3.3%) relative to the placebo group (1.4%).",
      "\"While this clearly shows an increased risk, 3.3% is still a very low rate of incidence,\" he said.",
      "HAIR GROWTH COULD SLOW DOWN WITH THIS POPULAR DIET PLAN, STUDY REVEALS",
      "This early study, which was published in the preprint server medRxiv, has not yet been peer-reviewed.",
      "\"Future studies are required to ascertain the association between semaglutide and hair loss,\" the researchers wrote.",
      "Doctors' advice",
      "Those who experience hair loss while taking semaglutide drugs should consult with a dermatologist to determine whether it's due to an adverse effect of these medications, Etminan advised.",
      "\"This is a relatively new adverse event and not much is known about it,\" he said. \"Questions about who is most at risk and whether the hair loss will reverse upon stopping the drug can be addressed in future studies.\"",

      "\"I think many of us had been anticipating it for quite some time, we knew that change was drastically needed at FDA when it came to tobacco control, because tobacco control had really gotten out of control,\" David Oliveira, who recently left the FDA after six years, said in response to FDA chief tobacco regulator Brian King being removed from his post earlier this month.",
      "\"There were many, many failures in the key core missions for the center that needed dramatic change in new leadership. Many of us, whether it be from public health, consumers, small business owners, industry, including even Senator Dick Durbin, who last year at a hearing said to Brian King, \u2018It looks to me like you have fallen down on the job.\u2019 So really it runs the spectrum with the people that are unhappy with what's gone on recently with the FDA in terms of tobacco regulation.\"",
      "One of the most prominent missteps at the FDA over the past few years, according to Oliveira, was the influx of illicit Chinese vapes into the U.S. market, which he says made him feel like a \"canary in a coal mine\" as he warned about the potential dangers and little was done.",

      "Although the rate of youths smoking cigarettes is now at an all-time low, according to the CDC, youth use of Chinese vapes has increased dramatically since 2020, as China has become the world\u2019s leading producer of e-cigarettes, often promoting illicit vapes with flavors appealing to children.",
      "Sales of unauthorized, flavored disposable vapes in the United States amounted to around $2.4 billion in 2024, or 35% of the e-cigarettes from outlets such as convenience stores and supermarkets, Reuters reported.",
      "That compares to sales worth $3.2 billion in 2023 and $2.8 billion in 2022, the data, which comes from market research firm Circana, shows.",
      "\"We have set up a regulated system, which most of the American players have said, okay, these are the rules of the road, we will obey them, we will comply, and we expect, we hope that our products will be authorized,\" Oliveira explained. \"The Chinese have said, well, forget that. There's huge consumer demand for these products for billions of dollars, and we will shamelessly, recklessly, irresponsibly market these products, dump them on our shores because they know there's billions of dollars to be had. And then, unfortunately, the FDA was ill-equipped, ill-prepared. Didn't have the skill to go after and shut that down. And now we have an industry that's absolutely out of control with these products.\"",
      "Oliveira told Fox News Digital that the agency has been delegating too much power to other departments like Border Patrol and Department of Justice rather than using the authority it has to crack down with boots on the ground against China\u2019s market flooding, adding that a \"lack of focus\" and \"cavalier attitude\" has left the U.S. behind the 8-ball.",

      "Under King, the FDA rejected applications for millions of flavored e-cigarettes, citing insufficient data that the products would help adult smokers. Those rejections have resulted in multiple lawsuits against the FDA from vape makers, including one that was argued before the Supreme Court in December.",
      "Another issue under King, Oliveira explained, was that DEI became a prominent focus that ultimately led to less focus on getting the job in front of them done correctly.",
      "FDA headquarters. (iStock)",
      "\"I think we saw a lot more of that once Brian King came in and the fact of the matter is his version of DEI was some of the things that many people don't find appealing,\" Oliveira said. \"The idea of virtue signaling or doing it just to be able to wear it on your sleeve and talk about it. So you just do things around the edges like, oh, let's change and stop using the word grandfathered because of the historical overtones and origins of that term. And then let's have everyone put their pronouns in their email.\"",
      "The FDA recently removed DEI materials from its website amid President Donald Trump signing executive orders to rid the practice from the federal government and instead focus on meritocracy. Oliveira told Fox News Digital that DEI was a distraction from the mission at the FDA.",
      "\"I think it made some people uncomfortable just because of the focus on it when we knew that our work was so critical to helping people live healthier lives, that there was so much work to be done, that we were behind the 8-ball because of all the mistakes and because of this very fast-moving industry that government will always struggle to keep up with the technology. There was much work to be done. There was so more that we could have been doing that we weren't doing. So anytime you have anything that you feel like takes your eye off the ball a little bit, that can be frustrating in the workplace for sure.\"",
      "Oliveira also told Fox News Digital that the FDA under King in the Biden years was beholden to the \"crusade\" against menthol cigarettes, led by prominent voices like billionaire Michael Bloomberg, which he says was based more on a \"paternalistic\" attitude toward the Black community than it was about making a positive difference.",

      "\"He crushed small American businesses, sparked black markets, and ushered in hundreds of new combustible cigarette products. It was a masterclass in hypocrisy: he preached health equity while his policies ravaged marginalized communities by stripping them of safer alternatives to smoking. And while tobacco companies thrived, he sneered at the powerless and never found the simple integrity to tell Americans the truth that vaping is the most effective way to quit smoking and is vastly safer than cigarettes.\"",

      "A former GOP congressman tapped by President Donald Trump to oversee the country's nuclear arsenal is facing a grilling before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday on his road to confirmation.",
      "Brandon Williams, nominated to become Under Secretary of Energy for Nuclear Security, is a Navy veteran who formerly chaired the energy subcommittee for the House Science, Space and Technology Committee during his brief stint in Congress.",
      "He brings with him thousands of hours of experience supervising the operation of a nuclear power plant and propulsion plant on a nuclear submarine, and he's undergone rigorous training to supervise two naval reactor designs, sources tell Fox News Digital.",
      "Tom D'Agostino, a former administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration himself who served under former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said Williams' nomination comes at a critical time for nuclear deterrence.",
      "\"There's no question in my mind that he has what it takes from a technical expertise, technical competence and technical leadership standpoint, because he's already proven it,\" D'Agostino told Fox News Digital. \"He's proven it in the Navy. And just having gone through and made it through the nuclear propulsion program, which is the heralded program started by Admiral Rickover over 50 years ago, I have absolutely no doubt at all that he could run this organization.\"",

      "\"It's obviously proven time and time again, that electricity, power lifts the standard of living for all that have it,\" D'Agostino said. \"And so having a somebody at the helm of the NNSA, which isn't a commercial nuclear power organization, it s a national security power organization, but there are relationships between the two, but having somebody like him in that position at this point in time is a really important, it's very important.\"",
      "\"There's no question that other powers \u2013 China, Russia, whatever, you can throw in, maybe, however you think about North Koreans \u2013 but the reality is there's geopolitical instability,\" he said. \"Over years, having a strong nuclear deterrent led by people that know what they're doing and will get the job done is a key of that nuclear deterrance. It's not just the warheads themselves, it's the technical competence of the people in the organization.\"",
      "\"Brandon Williams, absolutely, Congressman Williams certainly has that,\" D'Agostino told Fox News Digital. \"And he's, you know, he's confirmed he'll be leading an organization that is filled with technically competent people that know how to get the job done. So this is an important time. The world is watching. There's no question about it.\"",
      "In his opening statement, Williams thanked Trump for the nomination and promised the committee that, if confirmed, he would \"work diligently to strengthen the capability, credibility and communication of our strategic deterrence.\" Williams said he \"shares the president\u2019s commitment to peace through strength\" and looked forward to serving under Energy Secretary Chris Wright.",
      "\"At the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration has functioned in relative obscurity for many decades but has recently been thrust back into the public\u2019s consciousness. In my estimation, the men and women of the NNSA compromise one of the greatest scientific and engineering organizations in human history,\" Willaims said. \"This workforce, since the Manhattan Project, continues to ensure the safety, security, reliability and effectiveness of our nuclear stockpile. If given the opportunity to lead this extraordinary organization, I will do so humbly in the shadow of great Americans like Admiral Rickover, Ernest Lawrence and Robert Oppenheimer.\"",
      "Ahead of Tuesday's hearing, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., penned a letter to Williams arguing that he lacks any of the extensive technical experience of his predecessors.",
      "Williams completed training at the Naval Nuclear Power School and\u00a0served as a junior officer\u00a0on a nuclear submarine, but\u00a0Warren said he does not possess\u00a0any advanced degree in physics or engineering. The Democratic senator said the NNSA is in the middle of a $200 billion nuclear modernization project, which the Government Accountability Office\u00a0has found\u00a0has already exceeded initial cost estimates by more than $2 billion and is behind by almost 10 years.",

      "\"I am concerned that a leader without strong technical expertise and extensive experience could put our nuclear deterrent at risk and waste billions of dollars,\"\u00a0Warren said in a statement. \"The person confirmed to lead the NNSA\u2026must also make it abundantly clear that they would not share information with companies that might support China\u2019s own nuclear modernization efforts, further jeopardizing American national security.\"",
      "Trump has touted nominees to his Cabinet as \"outsiders,\" as the Republican prioritizes upending the entrenched bureaucracy in Washington.",
      "American Nuclear Society CEO Craig Piercy told Fox News Digital that Williams participated in a number of discussions over the past few years as a House member focused on ensuring policymakers have a good textual understanding of nuclear energy.",
      "\"The one thing that I can say about Brandon Williams is he's thoughtful, he listens, and he asks good questions,\" Piercy said. \"Those are all the hallmarks of a good leader who cut their teeth in the nuclear Navy, right? And I mean, the nuclear Navy is the source for a significant portion of the workforce in nuclear today. And it brings a certainness free to core.\"",
      "\"He's always been knowledgeable, he has always demonstrated an understanding, not just of technology, but of the larger, you know, geopolitical consequences of the technology,\" Piercy said.",
      "Piercy said the next NNSA administrator must focus both on ensuring both the efficacy of the nuclear stockpile and deterring the proliferation of nuclear weapons.",
      "\"I think that part of the challenge here is also, while we're doing both of those things, ensuring that American nuclear companies have an opportunity to export civil nuclear technologies to other countries that have the energy needs, and those are fairly broad,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"There is a way of doing that safely without compromising our non-proliferation objectives. And in fact, you know, having the U.S. engaged in civil nuclear commerce is a good thing for the country because it gives us greater influence over the safety and non-proliferation norms globally. So it's a big challenge for anyone in that job and obviously it requires the whole of government approach to do it well.\"",
      "D'Agostino said Williams' lack of experience in the federal government should not raise concerns about his ability to effectively manage the nuclear arsenal. In his own career before leading the NNSA, D'Agostino said he picked up experience in the military and as a civilian employee before joining the executive branch. Williams also has that military experience, but is unique in that he brings with him strong relationships from his time on Capitol Hill.",

      "\"He has that experience in the military and he has that experience on Capitol Hill, which is frankly incredibly important to understand\u2026 So there are similarities from the standpoint of cultural and commitment to national security and serving your country,\" D'Agostino told Fox News Digital. \"That will serve the country well. I'm confident of that because a big part of the job in the NNSA, in addition to leading a technical organization, is also about relationships on the Hill, explaining to members what's going on in the program and why it's so important.\"",
      "The role of NNSA administrator involves overseeing the nation's nuclear laboratories. D'Agostino named the Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Los Livermore National Laboratories as the three of the largest laboratories in the country and \"with the highest qualifications and standards, frankly, throughout the world\" that \"were a part of the organization that developed the nuclear deterrent\" and are \"a key part of maintaining the nuclear-deterrent stockpile.\" Another of significance is the Naval Nuclear Laboratory underneath Admiral William J. Houston, which is part of the Naval Reactors Program.",

      "\"Those Naval Nuclear Laboratories are also part of NNSA,\" D'Agostino said. \"Because Congressman Williams is a product of the naval nuclear propulsion program, his understanding of and experience with these laboratories will be important to maintain their technical competence and supporting, frankly, the country's security well into the future.\"",

      "What is doubleclickjacking?",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a new spin on an old hacking trick known as clickjacking. Normally, clickjacking works by hiding malicious buttons underneath real ones, so when you think you\u2019re clicking something harmless, you\u2019re actually giving permission for something dangerous. With doubleclickjacking, it takes things a step further. It\u2019s triggered when you double-click, allowing hackers to sneak in an extra, invisible command. Your first click might do something normal. The second click? That\u2019s where the damage happens.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",

      "Click \"Allow\" on a hidden pop-up",
      "Share your location",
      "Approve a login, payment or even a crypto transaction",
      "What makes doubleclickjacking especially dangerous is that most websites weren\u2019t designed to defend against it. Traditional security features usually protect against a single click, but they often fail when a second click is involved. That small detail opens the door for attackers to bypass layers of protection.",
      "This trick doesn\u2019t just affect websites, either. It can also interfere with browser extensions like crypto wallets and VPNs, sometimes tricking users into approving actions or turning off protection without realizing it. On mobile devices, a simple double-tap can trigger the same effect. To make matters worse, this vulnerability is more widespread than you might expect. Many well-known websites haven\u2019t fixed it yet. All it takes is one quick double-click in the wrong place, and you could unknowingly give away access to sensitive parts of your device.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "How does doubleclickjacking work?",
      "Here\u2019s a simplified version of how the trick plays out. A malicious website quietly loads invisible elements behind or over visible ones, like an embedded frame, hidden button, or disguised pop-up. On your first click, the attacker uses that action to reposition those hidden elements so that your next click lands exactly where they want it. On your second click, you unknowingly interact with the hidden content. You might be clicking \"Allow\" on a browser permission, authorizing a login, or disabling a setting, without ever realizing it. Because modern browsers are lightning fast, this all happens in a split second. The entire setup and switch are virtually invisible to the user. From your perspective, it just feels like a normal double-click.",

      "Doubleclickjacking might be sneaky, but there are simple ways to keep yourself safer online. Here are some practical steps you can take right now:",
      "1. Be cautious about double-clicking on unfamiliar websites: It might sound obvious, but most of us click (and double-click) automatically. If a site prompts you to double-click anything, especially for a login, permission or download, ask yourself if it\u2019s really necessary. Hackers rely on you acting quickly without thinking.",
      "2. Keep your browser updated: Browsers like Chrome, Edge and Safari regularly release patches for these vulnerabilities. That means delaying updates could leave you exposed to tricks like doubleclickjacking. Turn on automatic updates if possible, or make sure to manually keep up with updates so you\u2019re always protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Browser-based tools and extensions can help block hidden or malicious scripts before they run, but they\u2019re not foolproof. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords for every account:\u00a0Don\u2019t reuse passwords. If one account gets compromised, hackers can use it to access your other accounts. A password manager helps you create and store strong passwords effortlessly. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Limit unnecessary permissions: Take control of your privacy by reviewing which websites have access to your camera, microphone, and location. Many sites request these permissions by default, even when they don\u2019t need them. Head into your browser\u2019s privacy settings and revoke access from any site you don\u2019t fully trust. For example, here's a guide on\u00a0how to navigate Google's privacy settings.",
      "6. Avoid sketchy sites and pop-ups: If a website looks outdated, spammy or aggressively pushes you to click something, get out of there. Avoid downloading random files, and don\u2019t trust pop-ups that claim you\u2019ve won something, need to \"fix\" your device or \"verify\" your login info.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a clever new spin on a classic hacking trick that allows cybercriminals to take control over your device or account, just from a simple double-click. Because this kind of attack is nearly invisible and works on popular browsers, it\u2019s important to stay alert. Always be cautious when interacting with unfamiliar websites, especially if you're being asked to double-click. Keeping your browser updated and limiting unnecessary permissions can go a long way in reducing your risk. Most importantly, having the right digital protection tools in place can help stop these types of threats before they ever reach you.",

      "Tom from Carol Stream, Illinois, reached out to us with this same problem: \"When I\u2019m out of town and my internet goes down, all of my \u2018internet of things\u2019 goes down too. Yes, I\u2019m supposed to turn off my router and turn it on again, but if I\u2019m not at home, is there anything I can do when I\u2019m out of town? Any help? It\u2019s very frustrating!\"",
      "Tom, we understand your frustration. It can be inconvenient when your internet goes down, especially when you\u2019re not at home to reset your router. However, there are ways to reset your router remotely. Here are the general steps to resetting your router remotely using a web browser.",

      "How to reset your router remotely (the right way)",
      "Before we start, though, it's important to note that you will need administrator access to your router. Luckily, this is simple if it's your own home router. Unless you've changed the settings, your router uses the default username and password for its model, which you can find by a simple web search. However, leaving your router at default settings is a serious security risk. Make sure to change the default login and local IP address as soon as possible.",
      "If you're at home, you can use your local network IP (typically http://192.168.1.1) to log in to your router. This only works when your device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network. This is known as LAN (Local Area Network) access.",
      "If you're away from home (like at work or in a hotel), you won\u2019t be able to use 192.168.x.x to access your router. Instead, you\u2019d need to use your router\u2019s public IP address (also called WAN address). This requires setting up remote access in advance, usually by enabling remote management, Dynamic DNS or using a VPN. Be aware that this can open your network up to security vulnerabilities if not done carefully.",
      "Important: Allowing your router to be administered from the internet (WAN) is not recommended for most users due to the significant security risks. If you choose to do this, use strong, unique passwords, and consider VPN access instead.",
      "Use your ISP\u2019s app",
      "The safest and easiest method \u2014 if available \u2014 is to use your internet service provider\u2019s app. Most of the major ISPs in North America now allow you to reset your networking equipment remotely via a smartphone app, making it even easier to reset your router. This assumes you are using their router and not one you purchased for yourself. If you use a third-party router, you'll need to follow the steps above to reset it. Using an ISP app avoids opening your home network to the internet directly and usually includes built-in security protections.",

      "A smart plug lets you power cycle your router from anywhere by turning the plug off and on using a mobile app. This is a much safer option than enabling remote router access. It doesn't require exposing your router to the internet.",
      "Smart plugs come with smartphone apps that will allow you to set schedules and remotely turn and off and on plugs around your house, including the plug you plug your router into.",

For remote access, you'd need your router\u2019s public IP and advanced setup, which can be risky if not secured properly.

      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has more on the \"sophisticated penetration\" of several carriers on \"Special Report.\"",
      "If there\u2019s one thing that has become clear over the past year, it\u2019s that Apple devices are not as secure as the company wants you to believe.",
      "We\u2019re four months into 2025 and there have already been over 10 instances in which attackers specifically targeted Apple users, and these are just the incidents we know of.",
      "I\u2019ll admit no device is foolproof, but there seems to be a growing trend where bad actors prefer targeting Apple users over other platforms. In fact, security researchers have recently identified a new phishing campaign in which hackers, who previously focused on Windows, are now setting their sights on Apple IDs.",

      "What you need to know",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0LayerX Labs have uncovered a new phishing campaign that specifically targets Mac users, marking a shift from its previous focus on Windows. The attackers initially lured Windows users with fake Microsoft security alerts designed to steal login credentials. However, after Microsoft, Chrome and Firefox implemented new security features to block these attacks, the hackers started redirecting their efforts toward Mac users instead.",
      "The new attack closely mirrors its predecessor but with key modifications. The phishing pages have been redesigned to resemble Apple\u2019s security warnings, making them appear legitimate to macOS users. The attack code has also been adjusted to specifically detect macOS and Safari users, ensuring that only Apple users see the fraudulent pages.",
      "Plus, despite shifting their focus, the attackers continue to host these phishing pages on Microsoft\u2019s Windows[.]net domain. Since this is a trusted Microsoft platform, it allows the phishing pages to evade detection by security tools that assess risk based on domain reputation.",

      "Instead of reaching the intended site, they land on a compromised domain parking page. From there, they are redirected through multiple websites before ultimately arriving at the phishing page, which presents a fake Apple security warning. Believing their Apple ID is at risk, victims are tricked into entering their credentials, unknowingly handing them over to the attackers.",
      "One notable case involved a person using Safari who was working at a business secured by a Secure Web Gateway. Despite the organization\u2019s security measures, the phishing attempt managed to bypass the gateway\u2019s protections.",

      "Phishing campaigns are increasingly targeting macOS users, but you\u2019re not defenseless. Here are four essential steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0A reliable antivirus program is your first line of defense against phishing attempts and malicious websites. While Apple\u2019s built-in security features provide some protection, they aren\u2019t foolproof, especially against sophisticated phishing attacks that mimic legitimate Apple warnings. A robust antivirus solution can detect and block malicious sites before you even reach them, preventing you from accidentally entering your credentials on a fraudulent page. Additionally, advanced security software can identify suspicious redirects and alert you before you fall victim to typosquatting traps.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Keep your software up to date:\u00a0Regular\u00a0updates to macOS and your applications aren\u2019t just about new features. They\u2019re critical patches that fix security vulnerabilities. Attackers are quick to exploit any weakness, so ensuring your operating system and all installed software are current minimizes the risk of a breach. Enable automatic updates where possible so you\u2019re always protected by the latest security enhancements.",
      "3. Regularly monitor your Apple ID activity: Even with strong security measures in place, it\u2019s important to keep an eye on your Apple ID account for any signs of unauthorized access. Apple allows users to review their account activity, including devices logged into the account and recent changes. Regularly check your Apple ID settings to ensure that only trusted devices are connected and that no suspicious activity has occurred. If you notice anything unusual, such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, immediately change your password and remove unauthorized devices. This proactive approach can help you catch potential breaches early and minimize damage.",

      "4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Strong, unique passwords for every account are essential, but they\u2019re even more effective when combined with\u00a0two-factor authentication. Even if attackers manage to steal your credentials through a phishing attack,\u00a02FA adds an extra barrier that makes unauthorized access significantly harder. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Use a recovery key for enhanced security: Apple offers an optional feature called a recovery key, which is a 28-character code that provides an extra layer of security for your Apple ID. When you enable a recovery key, Apple disables its standard account recovery process, meaning you\u2019ll need this key, along with access to a trusted device or phone number, to reset your password or regain access to your account. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to take control of your account.",
      "To set up a recovery key, go to\u00a0Settings > [Your Name] > Sign-in & Security > Recovery Key on your iPhone, iPad or Mac. Follow the prompts to generate and confirm your recovery key. Be sure to write it down and store it in a secure location, such as a safe or with a trusted family member. Keep in mind that losing both your recovery key and access to trusted devices can permanently lock you out of your account. However, if used responsibly, this feature gives you greater control over your account\u2019s security.",
      "6. Enable biometric authentication: Apple devices offer advanced\u00a0biometric authentication options like Face ID and Touch ID, which provide an extra layer of security. These features make it significantly harder for attackers to gain access to your device or sensitive accounts, even if they manage to steal your credentials. Enable biometric authentication wherever possible, especially for apps and services that store personal or financial information. Since biometric data is unique to you, it adds a level of protection that passwords alone cannot provide.",
      "7. Practice safe browsing:\u00a0Many attacks rely on simple user mistakes, such as mistyping a URL or clicking on suspicious links. Always verify that you\u2019re visiting legitimate websites before entering any personal information. Be skeptical of unexpected security alerts, even if they mimic Apple\u2019s design. Learning to identify the subtle signs of phishing, like unusual URL structures or generic greetings, can help you avoid falling for these scams.",

The reality is that attackers are no longer ignoring Mac users, they\u2019re actively targeting them, and Apple\u2019s response has been anything but proactive. While Microsoft, Google and others roll out new security measures to counter evolving threats, Apple remains slow to adapt, relying on outdated assumptions about its platform\u2019s safety.",

Keep all software and devices\u00a0up to date to avoid vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. Install firewalls,\u00a0strong antivirus software and intrusion detection systems to block malicious activities before they can cause harm. Regularly patch operating systems and applications to stay ahead of cybercriminals. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Implement strong password policies and use a password manager: Ensure all passwords are unique, at least 15 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Also, consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely. This reduces the risk of password reuse and weak passwords, which are common entry points for ransomware attacks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "3. Educate and train employees on cybersecurity awareness:\u00a0Many ransomware attacks start with phishing emails or social engineering tactics. As seen in the scam targeting executives, attackers often use fear-based tactics to manipulate victims into acting quickly. Train your employees, particularly high-level executives, to recognize suspicious emails, fraudulent requests and phishing attempts.",
      "4. Backup data and maintain a secure recovery plan:\u00a0Data backups are a critical safeguard against ransomware. Regularly back up critical data to secure, offline locations that ransomware cannot access. Testing your recovery plans frequently ensures that if an attack does occur, you can recover quickly with minimal impact on operations. In addition, consider using a cloud service with encryption to ensure that even if an attack happens, the backup remains safe.",
      "5.\u00a0Utilize two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Two-factor authentication is an essential security measure that adds an extra layer of protection to sensitive systems and data. With 2FA, even if attackers manage to obtain login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access critical systems without the second factor of authentication, whether it\u2019s a code sent to a phone or biometric verification.",
      "6. Verify threats before taking action:\u00a0If you receive a ransom demand (digital or physical), investigate its legitimacy. Scams often lack proof of data breaches or network compromise. Consult cybersecurity experts or law enforcement before responding.",
      "7. Report suspicious activity: Notify law enforcement or organizations like the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center if you encounter scams or ransomware threats. Reporting helps authorities track and mitigate these activities.",

      "Healthcare is seriously lagging when it comes to cybersecurity. It's crazy that so many health institutions don\u2019t have a CISO or a dedicated security team. Instead, the IT department, which isn\u2019t always trained in cybersecurity, gets stuck trying to handle it all. With so much sensitive data at risk, it\u2019s shocking that so many healthcare organizations still treat cybersecurity as an afterthought.",
      "Cyberattacks are only going to get worse, and unless the industry steps up its game, it\u2019s just a matter of time before more hospitals, clinics and health systems get hit. It\u2019s time to take security seriously.",

      "The JCPOA has increasingly been considered a collapsed agreement after the U.S. withdrew in 2018 under the first Trump administration, followed by increasingly flagrant violations by Iran of the nuclear deal.",

      "A single veto is enough to block a resolution being enacted, and progress in the council has become stagnant following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But even if Russia objects to reimposing sanctions on Iran, as Tehran has become a close ally of Moscow\u2019s, it actually has very few options for blocking the snapback mechanism that it previously agreed to, so long as at least one other nation actually calls for the sanction tool.",

      "India's parliament passed a controversial bill that amends laws governing Muslim land endowments, known as waqfs, by including non-Muslims on the boards that manage these properties and increasing government oversight.\u00a0The government claims the changes aim to combat corruption and promote diversity, but critics argue it undermines Muslim rights and could lead to the confiscation of historic religious sites.Muslim groups and opposition parties have expressed concerns that the bill is politically motivated, and could marginalize Muslims by altering ownership rules and requiring waqf boards to validate property claims.",

      "The government claims the changes aim to combat corruption and promote diversity, but critics argue it undermines Muslim rights and could lead to the confiscation of historic religious sites.",
      "Muslim groups and opposition parties have expressed concerns that the bill is politically motivated, and could marginalize Muslims by altering ownership rules and requiring waqf boards to validate property claims.",
      "India's parliament passed a controversial bill moved by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s Hindu nationalist government to amend laws governing Muslim land endowments, while Muslim groups and opposition parties protested the move.",
      "The bill would add non-Muslims to boards that manage waqf land endowments and give the government a larger role in validating their land holdings. The government says the changes will help to fight corruption and mismanagement while promoting diversity, but critics fear that it will further undermine the rights of the country\u2019s Muslim minority and could be used to confiscate historic mosques and other property.",
      "The debate was heated in both houses of parliament. The Lower House debated it Wednesday through early Thursday, while in the Upper House, the fiery discussion lasted more than 16 hours into early Friday.",
      "The Congress-led opposition firmly opposed the proposal, calling it unconstitutional and discriminatory against Muslims. Modi\u2019s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party lacks a majority in the Lower House, but its allies helped to pass the bill.",
      "MUSLIMS IN INDIA VOICE CONCERNS THAT NEW CITIZENSHIP LAW COULD FURTHER MARGINALIZE THEM",
      "In the Lower House, 288 members voted for the bill while 232 were against it. Similarly, 128 favored it and 95 voted against it in the Upper House. The bill will now be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent to become law.",

      "Minority Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju introduced the bill to change a 1995 law that set rules for the foundations and set up state-level boards to administer them.",
      "Many Muslim groups, as well as the opposition parties, say the proposal is discriminatory, politically motivated and an attempt by Modi\u2019s ruling party to weaken minority rights.",
      "The bill was first introduced in parliament last year, and opposition leaders have said some of their subsequent proposals for it were ignored. The government has said opposition parties are using rumors to discredit them and block transparency in managing the endowments.",
      "What\u2019s a waqf?",
      "Waqfs are a traditional type of Islamic charitable foundation in which a donor permanently sets aside property \u2014 often but not always real estate \u2014 for religious or charitable purposes. Waqf properties cannot be sold or transferred.",
      "Waqfs in India control 872,000 properties that cover 405,000 hectares (1 million acres) of land, worth an estimated $14.22 billion. Some of these endowments date back centuries, and many are used for mosques, seminaries, graveyards and orphanages.",
      "Law would change who runs waqfs",
      "In India, waqf property is managed by semi-official boards, one for each state and federally run union territory. The law would require non-Muslims to be appointed to the boards.",
      "Currently, waqf boards are staffed by Muslims, like similar bodies that help administer other religious charities.",
      "During the parliamentary debate, Home Minister Amit Shah said non-Muslims would be included in waqf boards only for administration purposes and to help run the endowments smoothly. He added that they were not there to interfere in religious affairs.",
      "\"The (non-Muslim) members will monitor whether the administration is running as per law or not, and whether the donations are being used for what they were intended or not,\" he said.",
      "Muslim groups, like The All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said such comments were against the fundamentals of Islamic endowments as such bodies necessarily need to be governed by Muslims only. The board said the bill was \"a blatant infringement on the constitutional rights of Muslim citizens\" and called on citizens to hit the streets against it.",
      "Mallikarjun Kharge, the Congress president, said, \"Why should waqf bodies allow non-Muslims as members when Hindu temple trusts don\u2019t allow people of other religions in their fold?\"",
      "One of the most controversial changes is to ownership rules, which could impact historical mosques, shrines, and graveyards, since many such properties lack formal documentation as they were donated without legal records decades, and even centuries, ago.",
      "Questions about title",
      "Other changes could impact mosques on land held in centuries-old waqfs.",
      "Radical Hindu groups have laid claim to several mosques around India, arguing they are built on the ruins of important Hindu temples. Many such cases are pending in courts.",
      "The law would require waqf boards to seek approval from a district level officer to confirm the waqfs\u2019 claims to property.",
      "Critics say that would undermine the board and could lead to Muslims being stripped of their land. It\u2019s not clear how often the boards would be asked to confirm such claims to land.",
      "\"The Waqf (Amendment) Bill is a weapon aimed at marginalizing Muslims and usurping their personal laws and property rights,\" Rahul Gandhi, the main opposition leader, wrote on social media platform X. He said the bill was an \"attack on the Constitution\" by the BJP and its allies \"aimed at Muslims today but sets a precedent to target other communities in the future.\"",
      "INDIA\u2019S RELIGIOUS DIVIDE CONTINUES TO WIDEN BETWEEN MUSLIM, HINDU COMMUNITY",
      "Fears among Muslims",
      "While many Muslims agree that waqfs suffer from corruption, encroachments and poor management, they also fear that the new law could give India\u2019s Hindu nationalist government far greater control over Muslim property, particularly at a time when attacks against minority communities have become more aggressive under Modi, with Muslims often targeted for everything from their food and clothing styles to inter-religious marriages.",
      "Last month, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom said in its annual report that religious freedom conditions in India continued to deteriorate while Modi and his party \"propagated hateful rhetoric and disinformation against Muslims and other religious minorities\" during last year\u2019s election campaign.",
      "Modi\u2019s government says India is run on democratic principles of equality and no discrimination exists in the country.",
      "Muslims, who are 14% of India\u2019s 1.4 billion population, are the largest minority group in the Hindu-majority nation, but they are also the poorest, a 2013 government survey found.",

      "He said that at Musk's Tesla plant in Texas, a portion of the engines \u2014\u00a0at least for electric vehicles \u2014 contain batteries that come from Japan and China and other electronics are imported from Taiwan.",
      "\"The difference is, in our thinking and Elon's on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron. We want the transmissions made in Indianapolis. We want the engines made in Flint and Saginaw. And we want the cars manufactured here,\" Navarro said.",
      "He went on to suggest that acquiring car parts from foreign countries is \"bad for our economics\" and \"bad for our national security.\"",
      "\"We want them to come here and with Elon, it's fine. He's a car man. He's a car person. That's what he does. And he wants the cheap foreign parts. And we understand that, but we want 'em home,\" said Navarro, who added \"and everything's good with Elon.\"",
      "Replying to an X post of the Navarro interview, Musk said that Navarro is \"truly a moron.\"",
      "\"What he says here is demonstrably false,\" Musk wrote in one post, adding in another post that Tesla \"has the most American-made cars. Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks.\" He later sarcastically apologized, saying the comparison \"was so unfair to bricks.\u201d",
      "Musk broke with Trump on Saturday on the tariffs, saying at an event that he wants to see a \"zero-tariff situation\" between the U.S. and Europe.",
      "Navarro responded to Musk's comments during an interview with Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" saying:\u00a0\"It was interesting to hear Elon Musk at the beginning talk about a zero-tariff zone with Europe. He didn\u2019t understand that. The thing that\u2019s, I think, important about Elon to understand, he sells cars.\"",
      "Asked if there was an internal rift between the two Trump advisers, Navarro said that there is \"no rift here.\" He added, \"We don\u2019t mind him saying whatever he wants, but just the American people need to understand that we understand what that\u2019s all about. It\u2019s fine.\"",
      "Navarro, a longtime ally of the president, butted heads with other White House officials during Trump's first term, but has remained a key part of Trump's inner circle over the years.",
      "\"He went to jail for President Trump. I\u2019m not sure how much more you could show loyalty, which is what President Trump values,\" a former Trump adviser told NBC News. \"Sure, Elon is his guy and they get along great, but there is just another level there\" with Navarro.",
      "\"If this turns out to be an all-out war, I very much doubt Peter is the one who is going to come out on the wrong end of it,\" the former adviser said. \"I really wish it was not so public and am not sure how exactly it will play out, but I know that the president very much values what Peter did for him.\"",
      "Navarro served four months in federal prison last year after he was convicted of contempt of Congress for defying a congressional subpoena from the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Hours after his release from prison in July, he took the stage at the Republican National Convention and fiercely defended Trump.",
      "Asked Tuesday about the apparent beef between Musk and Navarro, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, \"These are obviously two individuals who have very different views on trade and on tariffs. Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., reacted to the dispute on the Senate floor. \u201cThe chaos within the Trump administration was shown a few minutes ago when Elon Musk called Peter Navarro, the chief architect of these tariffs, a moron. That\u2019s Musk\u2019s word. He called him a moron,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "\u201cTheir plan is so crazy, so controversial, that this administration cannot get its act together with them calling names about each other, to \u2014 against one another, about this tariff plan.\u201d"

    "summary": "Small sneaker makers and huge companies like Nike face challenges from tariffs, as many sneakers are made in China, Vietnam and Taiwan, which have been hit with tariffs on goods sent to the United States.",
    "story": [
      "Devlin Carter created his luxury sneaker company, SIA Collective, six years ago and built it into a multimillion-dollar brand by providing fashionable, high-quality footwear manufactured mostly in China. But the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs have raised the cost of importing goods from many countries, including China, to the United States.",
      "And Carter is incensed.",
      "\u201cThese are ridiculous tariffs that make no sense,\u201d Carter said. \u201cSmall businesses like mine have to pay these tariffs, and it\u2019s not a small thing. It\u2019s a lot. So there\u2019s no way to see this as something that\u2019s good \u2014 for anybody.\u201d",
      "The sneaker industry is a $70 billion-a-year enterprise. And with almost no sneakers manufactured in America, the latest tariffs Trump has imposed have the industry \u2014 and the global economy \u2014 reeling, generating a ripple effect that puts the future of many small sneaker companies in jeopardy, Carter said.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s all unnecessary,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s not just the independent producers like Carter who are figuring out what to do next. Even sneaker behemoth Nike faces challenges, as most of its goods are produced in Vietnam, which was hit with a 46% tariff, and Taiwan, with a 32% tariff on goods sent to the United States.",
      "Economist Peter Schiff said on X last week that it would cost Oregon-based Nike more to build production plants in the United States than it would to pay the tariffs. \u201cThe result will be fewer sneakers sold in the U.S. at much higher prices,\u201d he said.",
      "A reporter asked Trump on Monday whether the American public\u2019s \u201cpain threshold\u201d could handle the impact of his tariffs. \u201cI think your question is so stupid,\u201d Trump told the reporter. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\u201d",
      "The tariffs threaten economic stability in general and especially small-business owners like Carter, who relies heavily on shipments from countries like China, where 90% of his shoes are produced. His shoes go for an average of around $220 a pair, he said.",
      "\u201cSay I pay $100 to have a pair of shoes made in China,\u201d he said. \u201cWith the tariffs, that shoe now costs $150 or more [to make]. And it shouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d",
      "He said multiplying the tariffs by the number of shoes he has manufactured \u201cadds up to a big number. So what do you do? Most pass the difference, the increase, along to the customer. Even if you split the increase, it still can become a burden to the customer, because I know that with all the other stuff he has done \u2014 like gutting the federal government \u2014 there is consumer fear out there.\u201d",
      "And that fear could result in a decrease in sneaker sales, Carter said. He was able to ship more than $2 million in sneakers before the tariffs were imposed.",
      "\u201cPeople buy my shoes because they like them, but it\u2019s a luxury item,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how many of my supporters feel like they\u2019re about to lose their job. They could be thinking: \u2018I need to put this toward groceries. I think we\u2019re going into a recession, so I\u2019m not spending money.\u2019 If you feel like your job is shaky and the economy is shaky, your way of life is shaky, you go into survival mode. And in survival mode most people don\u2019t spend. And that comes back to hurt the small-business owner.\u201d",
      "Earl West, a confirmed sneakerhead, has collected more than 1,800 pairs of athletic shoes, which he stores in his home near Atlanta. That number is likely to rise much more slowly than in recent years, West said, because of the tariff-induced price increases.",
      "\u201cThat pair of $180 sneakers is going to cost me $250 now,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I have to be very selective on what I\u2019m going to buy and when, because I can\u2019t afford to spend $250 on a pair of sneakers every other week \u2014 as a collector, that\u2019s what we do. We\u2019re not, we\u2019re not buying to sell.\u201d",
      "West mapped out his planned sneaker purchases for each year. The tariffs have upset that schedule.",
      "\u201cIn some cases, I\u2019m just going to do without the shoes,\u201d he said. West often purchased in the United Kingdom, Germany and Hong Kong. \u201cBut they are all under tariffs, so now my effort in getting that shoe from over there may be severely hampered, because now I\u2019m not going to go to the U.K. or wherever, because it\u2019s going to cost me. Instead of $60 to ship it to me, it\u2019s going to cost me $120 to get it here \u2014 plus the cost of the shoe. And that\u2019s just too much.\u201d",
      "Sneaker resellers are taking a hit, too, West said.",
      "\u201cThink about it: As a reseller, you have to buy a $150 shoe at a higher rate than it\u2019s worth. And then you have to sell it even higher to make money,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be a problem.\u201d"

    "summary": "The administration is looking at possible strikes against the cartels as it gears up for a major campaign against gangs trafficking narcotics over the border",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is considering launching drone strikes on drug cartels in Mexico as part of an ambitious effort to combat criminal gangs trafficking narcotics across the southern border,\u00a0according to six current and former U.S. military, law enforcement and intelligence officials\u00a0with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Discussions among White House, Defense Department and intelligence officials, which are still at an early stage, have included possible drone strikes against cartel figures and their logistical networks in Mexico with the cooperation of Mexico\u2019s government, the sources said.",
      "Still, the administration has made no final decision and reached no definitive agreement about countering the cartels. And unilateral covert action, without Mexico\u2019s consent, has not been ruled out and could be an option of last resort, the sources said. It is unclear whether American officials have floated the possibility of drone strikes to the Mexican government.",
      "If Mexico and the United States proceed together with drone strikes or other action, it would not be the first time they have launched a joint effort to take on the cartels, nor would it be the first time that American military and intelligence worked in concert with Mexico\u2019s law enforcement and army.",
      "But what the Trump administration is contemplating could be unprecedented both in the number of U.S. personnel involved and in the use of American unmanned aircraft to bomb cartel personnel and assets.",
      "Administration officials and nominees have repeatedly refused to rule out drone strikes in public statements.",
      "The U.S. military and the CIA have dramatically stepped up\u00a0surveillance flights over Mexico to collect intelligence in advance of what is likely to be a major campaign against the cartels, which the White House has labeled a threat to national security, the six sources said. The flights are being carried out\u00a0with Mexico\u2019s approval, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re looking to build a target deck,\u201d one of the former officials, who is familiar with the administration\u2019s plans, said of the surveillance flights. The potential target list most likely could include cartel operatives, vehicles, warehouses and other parts of the gangs\u2019 network, the sources said.",
      "The White House National Security Council did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "After this article was originally published, Sheinbaum addressed it and the question of U.S. drone strikes in a press conference.",
      "\"We reject any form of intervention or interference. That\u2019s been very clear, Mexico coordinates and collaborates, but does not subordinate itself. There is no interference, nor will there be,\" she said, according to a translation provided by the Mexican embassy to the U.S.",
      "\"While this idea hasn\u2019t been formally proposed, we\u2019ve made it clear that it wouldn\u2019t address the root of the issue. What truly works is ongoing attention to root causes, arrests driven by intelligence and investigation, coordination, and zero tolerance for impunity. We categorically reject any such actions, and we don\u2019t believe they will happen. There is a strong, ongoing dialogue on security and many other matters.\"",
      "Possible unilateral strikes",
      "The administration has already been shifting military, intelligence and law enforcement resources toward combating the cartels, current and former officials said.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for ambassador to Mexico, Ronald Johnson, refused to rule out unilateral U.S. military action inside Mexico. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly warned Mexican officials in private about possible unilateral U.S. action. Both have said variations of \u201call cards are on the table\u201d when it comes to tackling the cartels.",
      "According to a memoir by Mark Esper, who was defense secretary during Trump\u2019s first term, Trump asked him in 2020 whether the military could fire missiles into Mexico to destroy drug labs and then deny the United States had conducted the strike. Trump and his aides have rejected Esper\u2019s account as false.",
      "The administration hopes to coordinate any action against the cartels with Mexico\u2019s military and law enforcement agencies, the six sources said.\u00a0They also said most administration officials see unilateral military action as a last resort that could cause a rupture with Mexico and jeopardize vital cooperation on immigration.",
      "Staging a military attack on the cartels in Mexico without the government\u2019s consent would arguably violate international law, though both Democratic and Republican administrations have argued that the United States has a right to defend itself from threats within a country that has lost control of its own security.",
      "Advocates of using drones believe that if enough military pressure is placed on the cartels, they will decide that the cost is not worth the money they can make from fentanyl. But some experts and former U.S. officials who worked on counternarcotics are skeptical, arguing that drone strikes could prove to be merely symbolic or, worse, backfire politically for Mexican leaders and jeopardize further cooperation.",
      "During Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n\u2019s tenure from 2006 to 2012, the two countries embarked on a major campaign to strike at the cartels\u2019 leaders, dubbed the \u201ckingpin strategy.\u201d American spy agencies provided intelligence, U.S. military teams trained elite Mexican commandos, and U.S. law enforcement agents worked alongside their Mexican counterparts.",
      "Former officials and experts disagree about the results of the effort. Some former U.S. law enforcement officials maintain that it made real inroads and was cut short just as the cartels were weakening. The Bush and Obama administrations portrayed it as effective.",
      "But targeting gang kingpins also created a vacuum and triggered a spree of intense violence among rival cartels. Once Calder\u00f3n\u2019s party was voted out of office, the joint operations with the United States ended and the government curtailed the Mexican military\u2019s role in the counternarcotics fight.",
      "Some supporters of the Trump administration, including the six current and former officials, argue that its refusal to publicly rule out unilateral U.S. military action, coupled with tariffs and other measures, could push Mexico to accept joint operations that it might have rejected in the past.",
      "How far to go in targeting the cartels \u2014 including whether to use unilateral military action \u2014 is the subject of an ongoing debate in the administration, the six current and former officials said.",
      "Mexico under pressure",
      "Arturo Sarukh\u00e1n, who was Mexico\u2019s ambassador to the United States from 2007 to 2013, said it seems U.S. unilateral military action in Mexico is now a live possibility for the first time since 1914, when the United States attacked and occupied the port of Vera Cruz.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt if there were unilateral action inside Mexico, this would put the bilateral relationship into a nosedive,\u201d said Sarukh\u00e1n, who is now based in Washington. \u201cIt would be put in a tailspin, as it would represent a violation of international law and an act of war.\u201d",
      "Sarukh\u00e1n said he believes Mexico has undermined its own position by failing to come to grips with rampant drug trafficking over the past decade, creating conditions that tried the patience of its more powerful neighbor.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s Mexico\u2019s failings and mistakes that have put us in this position today,\u201d he said.",
      "Sheinbaum, Mexico\u2019s relatively new president,\u00a0has shown a willingness to cooperate with the Trump administration on the border and in countering the cartels, current and former U.S. officials said.",
      "Sheinbaum had already begun to step up enforcement efforts when she took office in early October, after years of a hands-off approach under former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lop\u00e9z Obrador, who\u00a0claimed more than once that fentanyl\u00a0was not produced in Mexico.",
      "Sheinbaum\u2019s decision to allow CIA surveillance flights during the Biden administration marked a significant change in Mexico\u2019s stance, two current and two former officials said.",
      "But Mexico remains sensitive to any perceived bullying or threat of domination by its larger neighbor, and Sheinbaum warned against any unilateral U.S. military action after Trump designated the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "\u201cThere has always been a tremendous level of suspicion by Mexican authorities of the U.S.,\u201d said another source, a former American diplomat who served in Mexico and who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss personal observations about discussions between the two governments. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t exactly given them reason recently to believe any differently.\u201d",
      "However, one of the six sources, who was a senior Drug Enforcement Administration official in the Biden administration, said pressure from the Trump White House already has pushed Mexico to take much tougher action against drug cartels after what he called \u201chandwringing\u201d by the Biden team. He said he believes fear of Trump could push Mexico to accept U.S. military action.",
      "\u201cPolitics aside, Trump is not f------ around with this stuff,\u201d he said, adding that Mexican officials may fear potential economic retaliation if they defy the Trump administration.",
      "\u2018The gloves are off\u2019",
      "After Trump decided to declare six Mexican drug cartels foreign terrorist organizations, U.S. intelligence agencies and military units now have sweeping legal authorities to conduct espionage and covert operations targeting the criminal networks in Mexico and beyond.",
      "Derek Maltz, a career DEA agent now serving as its acting head, told NBC News that the designation has opened up a host of new tools and that it is something he has been advocating for many years.",
      "Ideally, he said, the United States would secure agreement from the Mexican government before any military strikes against cartel infrastructure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s their country, and obviously we believe in strong partnerships,\u201d Maltz said. \u201cThat said, at some point it\u2019s about the safety of our kids.\u201d",
      "In Phoenix, where, the DEA says, 60% of the fentanyl that reaches the United States first arrives, DEA Special Agent in Charge Cheri Oz said that the last few months have been a breath of fresh air in the struggle to stem the flow.",
      "\u201cThe gloves are off,\u201d she said in an interview for \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d last month. \u201cI think what we\u2019re doing right now is working, and I think in a few months, we\u2019re going to start seeing, really, the rewards from our efforts.\u201d",
      "Maltz said there has been \u201chistoric, unprecedented action\u201d working with Mexico on drug enforcement in the first few months of the Trump administration.",
      "Mexico last month sent 10,000 troops to its northern border, where they are searching vehicles for fentanyl as they cross.",
      "Also last month, Mexico extradited 29 people alleged to be drug traffickers to the United States, including Rafael \u201cRafa\u201d Caro Quintero, who was convicted of masterminding the kidnapping and murder of a DEA agent in the 1980s but was released from Mexican prison in 2013.\u00a0He was re-arrested in Mexico in 2022.\u00a0His handover has deep meaning for DEA agents.",
      "It is difficult to measure progress in the war on fentanyl at any moment in time.\u00a0Overdose deaths fell 24% in the year that ended in September, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but that has largely been attributed to awareness of hidden fentanyl and to Narcan treatment, and tens of thousands of people in the United States are still expected to die by fentanyl this year.",
      "Seizure numbers fluctuate, but law enforcement officials say most of the fentanyl smuggled into the United States is not discovered, despite DEA statistics showing 125 million pills containing fentanyl seized in the Phoenix division along since 2016.",
      "What gives officials hope right now, the current and former DEA officials said, is intelligence suggesting that Mexican cartels are off balance.",
      "Oz, the DEA chief in Phoenix, said intelligence shows cartel leaders are unsure how to respond to the improved cooperation between the United States and Mexico and the increased pressure on their operations.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re scrambling right now,\u201d Oz said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of disorganization amongst the cartels.\u201d",
      "Past battles and skepticism",
      "Dating to the 1980s, American presidents have turned to law enforcement agencies, the CIA and the military to work with Mexican authorities to battle cartels. But the results have been mixed and often marked by recriminations in both countries.",
      "Vanda Felbab-Brown, an expert on narcotics trafficking at the Brookings Institution, said building U.S. cooperation with Mexican law enforcement remains the most promising approach to get at the cartels. She said she believes interrogating key figures in the gangs\u2019 networks would be more productive than drone strikes.",
      "\u201cDropping bombs is seductive but accomplishes not very much and comes with enormous risk,\u201d she said.",
      "Some former diplomats and law enforcement officials are skeptical that fentanyl trafficking can be significantly curtailed through military action. They argue that there is no silver bullet and that the solution has to include close collaboration with Mexican authorities, scanning equipment at border crossings, cracking down on money laundering and enlisting the help of private companies that produce chemicals used to make the drug.",
      "The drug is so concentrated and portable that it does not require the large-scale logistical networks associated with plant-based drugs, experts said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about something that a person could put in the trunk of their car,\u201d said Annie Pforzheimer, a former senior U.S. diplomat who worked on counternarcotics.",
      "Mike Vigil, former chief of international operations for the DEA, said the Trump administration would be likely to struggle to find suitable targets for drone bombing raids.",
      "The cartels do not operate large pharmaceutical labs to produce fentanyl; instead, they use \u201cnothing more than a metal tub,\u201d with chemicals mixed with a shovel or a long stick, Vigil said. Most of the smugglers ferrying the fentanyl across ports of entry are U.S. citizens, who easily move back and forth across the border.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a military problem. It\u2019s more of a law enforcement problem,\u201d Vigil said.",
      "But a former U.S. military officer with experience in the region believes the cartels are likely to pull back from fentanyl smuggling if they come under relentless attack and will look for a way to do business without provoking a U.S. reaction.",
      "\u201cCartels are not terrorist organizations,\u201d the former military officer said. \u201cThey are not ideologically aligned; they are not religious. They don\u2019t want to die for their job.\u201d"

      "The actor and director dialed into \"The Howard Stern Show\" Tuesday where he was asked about what happened with Tapia de Veer. The composer publicly announced in an interview with the New York Times that he would not be returning for a fourth season of the hit HBO series, and hinted at strife between him and White stemming back to the first season.",
      "\"I just don't think he respected me. He, like, wants people to know that he's edgy and dark and I'm, I don't know, like, I watch reality TV,\" White said to Stern.",
      "Tapia de Veer, who won three Emmys for his work on the show, told the Times in the interview published Wednesday that he had creative disagreements and fights with White, adding that the creator initially wanted music that lacked edge for the first season's theme.",
      "\"He had a temp score, a song that is more like something you would listen to in Ibiza, in some clubby place with a chill, sexy vibe,\" Tapia de Veer told the outlet. \"And there\u2019s literally no edge to it. It\u2019s a good song; it\u2019s nice music. There\u2019s just absolutely no \u2014 whatever you find in the 'White Lotus' music, the relationships with the characters \u2014 there\u2019s none of that. It\u2019s just nice background music.\"",
      "When the show's third season premiered on Feb. 16, social media exploded with audience members who noted the discontinuation of the theme song from the first two seasons, which was replaced by music that paid homage to Thailand, where the season was set.",
      "Tapia de Veer wanted to humor the public's longing for the familiar war cry melody by weaving it into a longer version of the Season 3 theme, but said White refused due to their fights, the Times reported. The composer uploaded the longer version to his YouTube last month.",
      "White, on the other hand, said he never fought with the composer.",
      "\"We never really even fought, I don't know what \u2014 he says we feuded, I don't think I ever had a fight with him except maybe some emails,\" White said on \"The Howard Stern Show.\"",
      "\"But it was just basically, like, me giving him notes, you know? Like I just don't think he liked to have to go through the process of getting notes from me or wanting revisions or whatever,\" he said.",
      "White said Tapia de Veer is not a team player \"and wanted to do it his way,\" but was still \"thrown\" that the composer spoke to the press \"to s*** on\" him and the show ahead of the finale.",
      "\"It was kind of a b---- move,\" he said.",
      "White also said he felt the composer was making a big deal out of differences in opinion, but highlighted that he thinks Tapia de Veer is \"very talented.\"",
      "Stern also weighed in on the reported feud.",
      "\"Why quit a smash hit show because you got some notes and some differences, just f---ing work it out,\" Stern said.",
      "After the radio show aired Tuesday, Tapia de Veer wrote on his X account that he's \"gonna have to tell the full story now.\"",
      "\"I did try to avoid it, dude...,\" the composer wrote."

    "summary": "GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna struck a deal with Speaker Mike Johnson after an intraparty spat brought the House floor to a halt last week.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans on Tuesday voted to block a bipartisan push to allow lawmakers who are new parents to vote remotely rather than in person, officially ending a GOP standoff over an issue that had ground legislative business to a halt for the past week.",
      "After President Donald Trump intervened in the intraparty spat late last week, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., who led the proxy voting push, struck a deal with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to allow new parents \u2014 as well as other members who are away from the Capitol for bereavement or other emergencies \u2014 to use a method called \u201cvote pairing.\u201d",
      "This would essentially allow a member who is absent to \u201cpair\u201d their vote with someone who plans to vote on the other side of the issue. That person would vote \u201cpresent,\u201d and the congressional record would reflect the position of each member.",
      "Another version of vote pairing would allow two absent members on opposite sides of an issue to have their official positions reflected in the official record even though they are unable to vote.",
      "The vote-pairing provision was tucked in a rule package that the House passed on Tuesday afternoon to advance their bills for the week. That same rule also tables the original proxy voting proposal written by Luna and Rep. Brittany Pettersen, D-Colo., who gave birth to a son in January and has brought him on the House floor for critical votes, including on Tuesday. Johnson, his leadership team and many conservative lawmakers had opposed the resolution, slamming it as \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d",
      "Pettersen and Luna, who gave birth to her first child in 2023, rallied bipartisan support. The duo collected 218 signatures \u2014 a majority of the House, including 11 Republicans \u2014 and Luna filed the proposal as a discharge petition, which would allow them to circumvent leadership and force a floor vote.",
      "One week ago, Johnson moved to pass a separate rule package that would have killed Luna\u2019s effort, but she and her allies blocked it from passing. In turn, Johnson sent House lawmakers home for the rest of the week without taking up any of the GOP-led bills they had planned to vote on.",
      "Luna praised Trump after reaching her deal with Johnson over the weekend.",
      "\u201cThanks to POTUS and his support of new moms being able to vote when recovering from child brith as well as those who worked hard to get these changes done,\u201d Luna wrote on X. \u201cIf we truly want a pro-family Congress, these are the changes that need to happen.\u201d",
      "Pettersen and other Democrats said the GOP compromise fell far short of the proxy voting proposal, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., calling the Republican opposition \u201ca very strange hill for them to die on.\u201d It\u2019s unclear if any Democrats will even participate in the vote-pairing exercise in the future.",
      "Just before Tuesday\u2019s vote, Pettersen and Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif., gave notice to advance the bill they worked on with Luna anyway. It won\u2019t go anywhere with Luna and other Republicans now not on board.",
      "\u201cSpeaker Johnson made it impossible for Republicans,\u201d Pettersen told NBC News in an interview off the House floor on Tuesday.",
      "Pettersen said she learned through the process that \u201cpolitics can be incredibly frustrating and misleading,\u201d and defended Luna when pressed by reporters.",
      "\u201cShe was being blamed for the floor stopping. But actually, Speaker Johnson decided to do that to make sure that we didn\u2019t have a vote on this,\u201d Pettersen said. \u201cIt was not Representative Luna, and she was getting a ton of heat.\u201d",
      "Holding her 9-week-old son, Sam, Pettersen shared that deciding to fly back to Washington four weeks after giving birth in February to vote against a Republican budget resolution was a \u201cdifficult decision.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was worried about Sam\u2019s health \u2026 not knowing how many days I would be stuck here not having any support \u2014 but knowing if I didn\u2019t show up I would never forgive myself,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you shouldn\u2019t be forced to be in that position. You\u2019re being prevented from doing your job because you\u2019re a woman and because you have a baby.\u201d",
      "Asked if vote pairing would suffice, Pettersen replied: \u201cWhat Republican would be willing to vote present for me this week? Nobody. That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bottom line is we need more women,\u201d added Pettersen, who is only the 14th member of Congress to give birth while serving. \u201cWe need more moms in Congress to actually change the way we do things here.\u201d",
      "Jacobs, who joined Pettersen on the floor, said it was \u201cdisheartening\u201d to see Republican leadership block the proxy voting proposal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really disheartening, obviously. Like I always knew that like them calling themselves the \u2026 party of family values was hypocritical, but just to see the length they would go to prevent young families from being adequately represented in Congress, it\u2019s really disheartening,\u201d she said."

      "The issue comes amid sweeping government changes to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign against so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies in the federal government. In some cases, officials have scrambled to remove and then restore online content as changes came to light.",

    "story": [
      "Eating combinations of common food additives may be tied to a slightly increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, according to a study published Tuesday in the journal PLOS Medicine.",
      "A growing body of evidence has linked certain food additives to cancer, diabetes, heart disease and changes to the gut microbiome. Many of these studies, however, were focused on single ingredients.",
      "\u201cIn real life, we ingest a mixture of additives,\u201d said Mathilde Touvier, director of the nutritional epidemiology research team at Universit\u00e9 Sorbonne Paris Nord and the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, who co-authored the new study.",
      "Touvier and her team looked at about eight years of data from more than 108,000 adults from the French NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 cohort, a long-running study that looks at the links between food and health.",
      "Poring over the participants\u2019 reported diets, the researchers identified five mixtures of additives people commonly consumed together. The combinations don\u2019t look unlike an ingredient list you might find on the label of an ultra-processed food.",
      "Mixture 1: Sodium carbonates; diphosphates; glycerol; ammonium carbonates; potassium carbonates; sorbitolMixture 2: Modified starches; pectins; guar gum; carrageenan; polyphosphates; potassium sorbate; curcumin; xanthan gumMixture 3: Magnesium carbonates; riboflavin; alpha-tocopherol; ammonium carbonatesMixture 4: Ammonium carbonates; sodium carbonates; diphosphates; alpha-tocopherol; DATEM; magnesium carbonates; lecithinsMixture 5: Citric acid; sodium citrates; phosphoric acid; sulphite ammonia caramel; acesulfame K; aspartame; sucralose; arabic gum; malic acid; carnauba wax; paprika extract, capsanthin, and capsorubin; anthocyanins; guar gum; pectins",
      "Mixture 1: Sodium carbonates; diphosphates; glycerol; ammonium carbonates; potassium carbonates; sorbitol",
      "Mixture 2: Modified starches; pectins; guar gum; carrageenan; polyphosphates; potassium sorbate; curcumin; xanthan gum",
      "Mixture 3: Magnesium carbonates; riboflavin; alpha-tocopherol; ammonium carbonates",
      "Mixture 4: Ammonium carbonates; sodium carbonates; diphosphates; alpha-tocopherol; DATEM; magnesium carbonates; lecithins",
      "Mixture 5: Citric acid; sodium citrates; phosphoric acid; sulphite ammonia caramel; acesulfame K; aspartame; sucralose; arabic gum; malic acid; carnauba wax; paprika extract, capsanthin, and capsorubin; anthocyanins; guar gum; pectins",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s relatively uncommon for all of them to appear in a single product, however, it\u2019s entirely possible to consume all of them across different foods throughout the day, especially when eating a variety of processed or ultra-processed foods,\u201d said Mengxi Du, a research associate at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who studies nutrition and health and wasn\u2019t involved with the study.",
      "Carrageenan and potassium sorbate, two additives in Mixture 2, are found together in sweetened condensed milk. Xanthan gum is commonly found in mayonnaise and gluten-free prepared foods. Pectin is in cream cheese.",
      "\u201cThese are pretty common products in someone\u2019s fridge and a lot of times we combine them,\u201d Du said.",
      "Two groups \u2014 Mixture 2 and Mixture 5 \u2014 were linked to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes, the researchers found. People with more of these combinations in their diet were more likely to develop the disease, regardless of how healthy their diet was overall.",
      "Mixture 2 was heavy in emulsifiers and thickening agents, including carrageenans, which are found in plant-based milks and processed meats, and modified starches, which thicken and stabilize packaged sauces, soups and baked goods. Mixture 5 contained ingredients commonly found in sugary and artificially-sweetened drinks, and included artificial sweeteners, natural dyes and acidifiers.",
      "Still, the study was observational, meaning it doesn\u2019t show cause and effect. Studies that require participants to recall their diets are also notoriously tricky. The limitations make it difficult to draw strong conclusions from the study, which Touvier and her team said will require more research.",
      "\u201cThe additives may be markers of something else, rather than causing Type 2 diabetes themselves,\u201d said Dr. Tom Rifai, an internal and lifestyle medicine doctor in Cleveland Clinic\u2019s department of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism. Rifai owns a lifestyle coaching company that includes nutrition counseling. \u201cThese could be a marker for what we call calorie density.\u201d",
      "Food additives are ubiquitous in ultra-processed foods, which usually pack in many more calories in much smaller amounts of food than minimally and unprocessed foods.",
      "\u201cAt the very least, these additives are markers of ultra-processing, which we know makes people eat more without realizing they are taking in a lot more calories,\u201d Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, said in an email.",
      "The same is true for the three groups of additives that were not found to be linked to diabetes risk. Nestle said that while the study cannot show causation, the results are consistent with \u201cpresent thinking that additives may well be anything but benign.\u201d",
      "Some food additives do play an important role in food safety. Potassium sorbate, for example, stops yeast and fungus from growing in packaged food. Others \u2014 including emulsifiers, which create certain textures, and artificial dyes \u2014 have come under scrutiny.",
      "Last month, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. directed the Food and Drug Administration to review its rule on \u201cgenerally recognized as safe,\u201d or GRAS, ingredients. The rule allows manufacturers to add certain additives to food without FDA review. It was originally intended for common ingredients such as salt or vinegar but has come to cover an expansive range of additives.",
      "In 2023, California became the first state to ban four food additives: brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben and Red Dye No. 3. In March, West Virginia banned seven food dyes.",
      "In the first three months of this year, 20 states \u2014 including Illinois, Missouri, New York, Oregon and Pennsylvania \u2014 introduced similar bans, but not on any of the additives included in the new study.",
      "It\u2019s too early to tell whether food additives, when eaten together, can have a synergistic effect, Du said. It\u2019s possible that one ingredient, safe on its own, may be linked to health problems when combined with other ingredients, for example. Or an ingredient\u2019s mild health effects could be amplified when mixed with other additives.",
      "Given that ultra-processed foods account for more than half of the calories an average American eats in a day, research that further investigates such an effect is worthwhile, she said."

      "A department spokesperson said the agency is \u201csimply asking school districts to certify they are following the law and not using race preferences or pernicious race stereotypes in schools.\u201d",
      "Even some Republican-led states believe they don\u2019t need to get the document signed by each school. Missouri\u2019s education office said schools previously provided assurances that should cover the department\u2019s demand and it will reach out to districts \u201cif additional information is necessary.\u201d",
      "Others are moving to follow the order, including Virginia and Arizona, where state education chief Tom Horne said the order \u201caligns completely with my philosophy.\u201d",
      "Vermont\u2019s education chief assured schools the state supports DEI practices and said superintendents won\u2019t need to sign the certification. Instead, the state will assure federal officials it\u2019s already following federal law, Zoie Saunders, the state\u2019s education secretary, said in a Monday letter to school districts.",

In a 2020 memo to agency staff, DeVos wrote that \u201cembracing diversity and inclusion are key elements for success.\u201d The states argue the Education Department is shifting its position without explanation.",
      "The states also accuse the Education Department of making broad declarations about the illegality of DEI without citing policies that violate federal law. Minnesota\u2019s letter said if the federal agency has identified DEI practices that violate civil rights law, \u201cwe request advisement of them.\u201d",
      "Many states said they\u2019re still reviewing the letter."

    "story": [
      "A lower-calorie Mediterranean diet, combined with regular exercise, helped older women lose weight without causing bone density loss, new research suggests.",
      "Weight loss, especially quick or significant weight loss, is known to reduce bone mineral density and increase risk of fracture. Older women are more prone to bone loss due to drops in estrogen during menopause.",
      "Of the 10 million Americans with osteoporosis \u2014 a \u201csilent\u201d disease that weakens bones and rarely causes symptoms \u2014 more than 80% are women, a quarter of whom are aged 65 or older, according to the Food and Drug Administration's Office of Women\u2019s Health.",
      "Lifestyle changes, however, could offset those negative effects by preventing muscle loss, which plays a major role in overall bone strength, said Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Gavil\u00e1n, co-first author of the study and biostatistician at the University of Rovira I Virgili in Spain.",
      "The research, published in the journal JAMA Network Open, builds on a 2023 study that found a similar low-calorie diet and exercise regime lowered total body and visceral fat (fat that surrounds organs) in the same study group.",
      "In the new research, 924 Spanish adults ages 55\u201375 who are overweight or have obesity, and have metabolic syndrome \u2014 a cluster of conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar \u2014 were separated into two groups.",
      "One group followed a Mediterranean diet with a 30% calorie reduction and gradually increased their physical activity to meet international recommendations for their age group.",
      "The exercise routine consisted of:",
      "45-minute walks, six days a week.Strength, flexibility and balance exercises three days per week.30- to 40-minute resistance training sessions two days per week.",
      "45-minute walks, six days a week.",
      "Strength, flexibility and balance exercises three days per week.",
      "30- to 40-minute resistance training sessions two days per week.",
      "People in the control group followed a Mediterranean diet with no restrictions or exercise recommendations.",
      "A Mediterranean diet consists mostly of plant-based foods, fish and healthy fats like olive oil.",
      "Each participant had their own daily calorie intake based on their weight, height and sex, Gavilan said.\u00a0They reduced their calories by cutting down on meats and sausages, sugars, white bread, packaged fruit juices and sugary drinks.",
      "All participants received special X-rays that measured their bone mineral density in their femur and lumbar spine at the start of the study and then a follow-up after three years.",
      "Overall, bone density improved the most in the lumbar spine among those in the lower-calorie diet and exercise group, Gavil\u00e1n said. Women received the most benefits with a 1.8% improvement in lumbar spine bone density.",
      "Dr. Dolores Shoback, an endocrinologist with UCSF Health who was not involved in the study, called this a \u201cvery modest effect\u201d compared to improvements you see with drugs used to treat osteoporosis. Studies have found increases in bone density in the lumbar spine anywhere from 3\u201313% after a year of treatment with these medications.",
      "She said this is likely because the study participants didn\u2019t have a lot of bone loss from the start, and they also didn\u2019t lose that much weight. People in the intervention group lost 3% of their total body weight over three years, which equals to about three pounds on average, Gavil\u00e1n said.",
      "Still, experts say the study sheds light on the crucial roles diet and exercise play in mitigating the effects that rapid weight loss has on bone health\u2014 a phenomenon more people are experiencing with the use of weight loss drugs.",
      "How weight loss affects bone health",
      "The risk of bone loss increases when a person drops a lot of weight in a short period of time, said Dr. Kristi Tough DeSapri, an internal medicine physician and osteoporosis expert with the Bone Health & Osteoporosis Foundation. Quick weight loss means there's less resistance on the bone as someone loses muscle along with fat, said DeSapri, who was not involved in the study.",
      "Risk for bone loss depends on many factors, such as age, body weight, physical activity levels and diet.\u00a0Hormonal changes associated with weight loss, as well as a lack of calcium and vitamin D in calorie-restricted diets, can also contribute to bone loss, research shows.",
      "A 10% weight loss can result in a 1% to 2% bone loss in different areas of the body, research indicates. The bone loss numbers may double or triple in people who undergo bariatric surgery or use weight loss drugs such as semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk\u2019s Ozempic and Wegovy, DeSapri said.",
      "A study published last year found that people who used GLP-1 medications without exercising experienced a significant decrease in bone density in their hip and spine; when exercise was added to the mix, bone mass was protected.",
      "Shoback said the exercise regime in the new study may \u201cbe a big commitment every day\u201d for older adults to realistically follow, but it could be valuable for younger adults who are at high risk for metabolic syndrome and may experience rapid weight loss with medications.",
      "Although the study was conducted in Spain, experts say the diet and exercise plan could benefit adults in the U.S.",
      "In the United States, there\u2019s a big push now for protein and supplements, DeSapri said.",
      "\u201cBut when we\u2019re talking about obesity, metabolic syndrome and weight loss, the Mediterranean diet has already been validated as a lifestyle that can make a difference,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of experts who recommend health screenings, says that women 65 years and older should receive a bone density scan for osteoporosis.",
      "Osteoporosis risk can be lowered by staying physically active, not smoking, limiting alcohol use and getting enough vitamin D and calcium in the diet via milk and salmon, or supplements, Shoback said.",
      "Hormone therapy is another effective way to reduce bone loss after menopause.",
      "\u201cLifestyle combined with a heart healthy diet \u2014 if people can do that, that\u2019s going to help them a lot for so many of the complications that come your way as we age,\u201d Shoback said."

      "As tariffs roil the U.S. economy,\u00a0Walmart\u00a0may find safety in a new part of its business that\u2019s driving more store traffic and online sales: its membership program, Walmart+.",
      "Customers who belong to the subscription-based service accounted for nearly 50% of spending across Walmart\u2019s website and app\u00a0in the U.S. in the most recent full fiscal year, which ended in late January, the company told CNBC. On average, Walmart+ members shop twice as much and spend nearly three times as much as Walmart customers who aren\u2019t subscribers.",
      "The membership program\u2019s gains come at a helpful time for Walmart. The big-box retailer\u00a0disappointed Wall Street with its outlook\u00a0for the year ahead even before President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0announced tariffs on goods from around the world, sparking retaliation and fears of a global recession.",
      "As the largest grocer in the U.S., the discounter has advantages in an economic downturn. Even so, Walmart+ could help insulate it from tariff turmoil, not only because it\u2019s a new source of revenue, but also because it helps to drive loyalty.",
      "In an interview with CNBC, Chief Growth Officer Seth Dallaire described the program as a \u201cfrequency driver.\u201d He said Walmart has seen a rise in spending per subscriber and strong growth of sign-ups through Walmart+ Assist, a program that allows customers who qualify for government assistance to pay half price for membership.",
      "More from CNBC",
      "Treasury Secretary Bessent says China\u2019s escalation was \u2018big mistake,\u2019 country playing with \u2018losing hand\u2019 Fake job seekers are flooding U.S. companies that are hiring for remote positions, tech CEOs say Trump tariffs: Elon Musk calls Peter Navarro \u2018dumber than a sack of bricks\u2019",

      "He added that as Walmart+ grows, higher profits will allow Walmart to keep grocery prices low and invest in other areas to make it more competitive. The company can also use customer insights to pitch itself to advertisers \u2014 another growing, high-margin business for Walmart \u2014 and inform choices about the products it puts on shelves.",
      "Walmart is expected to give an update on its retail business and other alternative revenue streams, such as the membership program and advertising, on Tuesday and Wednesday at an investor event in Dallas. The company, often seen as a barometer for consumer health in the U.S., could also give commentary on the state of the U.S. economy.",
      "Walmart+ drives e-commerce boom",
      "Walmart+, which\u00a0launched almost five years ago, has become a loyalty play and one of the reasons why Walmart has been able to\u00a0grow profits faster than sales. It\u00a0offers perks\u00a0including free shipping, free same-day grocery deliveries for orders of $35 or more, gas discounts and a Paramount+ subscription.",
      "The membership program was Walmart\u2019s answer to Amazon Prime. It\u2019s just another page the retailer has taken from the playbook of Amazon, which\u00a0surpassed Walmart in revenue\u00a0for the first time in the fourth quarter.",
      "Later this month, Walmart will look to build on member loyalty by using another tool deployed by Amazon. Starting April 28, it will throw Walmart+ Week, a special event with deeper deals on the program\u2019s existing perks like gas discounts and free sandwiches from Burger King.",
      "Walmart+, which costs $98 annually or $12.95 per month, also explains in part why the discounter\u2019s e-commerce business has boomed. Walmart has\u00a0posted 11 quarters in a row\u00a0of double-digit online sales gains in the U.S.,\u00a0with 20% growth\u00a0in the most recent quarter.",
      "Walmart has not disclosed the number of Walmart+ subscribers. Market researcher Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates the program had about 25 million members as of the end of January, according to estimates based on quarterly consumer surveys and industry research. That\u2019s more than double its estimate of around\u00a011 million to 11.5 million\u00a0in the fall of 2022.",
      "Walmart+ has much less reach than Prime. Amazon\u2019s subscription service, which debuted in 2005, has an estimated 190 million members in the U.S., according to CIRP. Nearly three-quarters of Amazon\u2019s customer base reported having a Prime membership, according to CIRP surveys, compared with 43% of Walmart.com shoppers who reported having a Walmart+ membership.",
      "Walmart+ is still winning over more customers, however. Three years ago, only 23% of Walmart.com shoppers reported having a Walmart+ membership.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs loom",
      "Walmart\u2019s investor event this week will coincide with the\u00a0expected start of steep tariffs\u00a0on countries across the globe that have\u00a0become major production hubs\u00a0for the company and other retailers, including\u00a0China,\u00a0Vietnam\u00a0and Cambodia. The tariffs are expected to start on Wednesday, after 10% levies took effect on Saturday.",
      "Walmart\u00a0gave its forecast\u00a0for the full year in February, ahead of Trump\u2019s broad tariff expansion. In late February, the discounter said it\u00a0expects full-year net sales\u00a0to grow 3% to 4% and adjusted operating income to increase between 3.5% and 5.5% on a constant currency basis. That includes a 1.5 percentage point headwind from\u00a0acquiring smart TV company Vizio\u00a0and from having a leap year in 2024.\u00a0The company said in February that it expects full-year adjusted earnings of $2.50 to $2.60 per share, which includes a 5 cent per share headwind from currency.",
      "Escalating global trade conflicts have raised concerns that a recession may be looming. And consumers weren\u2019t feeling great even before Trump announced the new duties: consumer sentiment\u00a0dropped in March to its lowest level since 2022, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s survey.",
      "As retailers brace for\u00a0the impact of tariffs, Walmart \u201cis not immune,\u201d but should be better positioned, said Seth Sigman, a retail analyst at Barclays. As the nation\u2019s largest grocer, its business is steadier even if shoppers pull back on other kinds of spending, he said. As a giant company, it has greater ability to nudge suppliers to share higher costs and to absorb some of them. And as a well-known value retailer, it can gain sales if upper- and middle-income shoppers seek lower prices, he said.",
      "Plus, he added, new moneymakers like membership have brought greater profitability and \u201ca stickier customer.\u201d"

      "When voice authentication startup Pindrop Security posted a recent job opening, one candidate stood out from hundreds of others.",
      "The applicant, a Russian coder named Ivan, seemed to have all the right qualifications for the senior engineering role. When he was interviewed over video last month, however, Pindrop\u2019s recruiter noticed that Ivan\u2019s facial expressions were slightly out of sync with his words.",
      "That\u2019s because the candidate, whom the firm has since dubbed \u201cIvan X,\u201d was a scammer using deepfake software and other generative AI tools in a bid to get hired by the tech company, said Pindrop CEO and co-founder\u00a0Vijay Balasubramaniyan.",
      "\u201cGen AI has blurred the line between what it is to be human and what it means to be machine,\u201d Balasubramaniyan said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is that individuals are using these fake identities and fake faces and fake voices to secure employment, even sometimes going so far as doing a face swap with another individual who shows up for the job.\u201d",
      "Companies have long fought off attacks from hackers hoping to exploit vulnerabilities in their software, employees or vendors. Now, another threat has emerged: Job candidates who aren\u2019t who they say they are, wielding AI tools to fabricate photo IDs, generate employment histories and provide answers during interviews.",
      "The rise of AI-generated profiles means that by 2028 globally 1 in 4 job candidates will be fake, according to research and advisory firm Gartner.",
      "The risk to a company from bringing on a fake job seeker can vary, depending on the person\u2019s intentions. Once hired, the impostor can install malware to demand ransom from a company, or steal its customer data, trade secrets or funds, according to Balasubramaniyan. In many cases, the deceitful employees are simply collecting a salary that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to, he said.",
      "\u2018Massive\u2019 increase",
      "Cybersecurity and cryptocurrency firms have seen a recent surge in fake job seekers, industry experts told CNBC. As the companies are often hiring for remote roles, they present valuable targets for bad actors, these people said.",
      "Ben Sesser, the CEO of BrightHire, said he first heard of the issue a year ago and that the number of fraudulent job candidates has \u201cramped up massively\u201d this year. His company helps more than 300 corporate clients in finance, tech and health care assess prospective employees in video interviews.",
      "\u201cHumans are generally the weak link in cybersecurity, and the hiring process is an inherently human process with a lot of hand-offs and a lot of different people involved,\u201d Sesser said. \u201cIt\u2019s become a weak point that folks are trying to expose.\u201d",
      "But the issue isn\u2019t confined to the tech industry. More than 300 U.S. firms inadvertently hired impostors with ties to North Korea for IT work, including a major national television network, a defense manufacturer, an automaker, and other Fortune 500 companies, the Justice Department\u00a0alleged\u00a0in May.",
      "The workers used stolen American identities to apply for remote jobs and deployed remote networks and other techniques to mask their true locations, the DOJ said. They ultimately sent millions of dollars in wages to North Korea to help fund the nation\u2019s weapons program, the Justice Department alleged.",
      "That case, involving a ring of alleged enablers including an American\u00a0citizen, exposed a small part of what U.S. authorities have said is a sprawling overseas network of thousands of IT workers with North Korean ties. The DOJ has since filed more\u00a0cases\u00a0involving North Korean IT workers.",
      "A growth industry",
      "Fake job seekers aren\u2019t letting up, if the experience of Lili Infante, founder and chief executive of CAT Labs, is any indication. Her Florida-based startup sits at the intersection of cybersecurity and cryptocurrency, making it especially alluring to bad actors.",
      "\u201cEvery time we list a job posting, we get 100 North Korean spies applying to it,\u201d Infante said. \u201cWhen you look at their resumes, they look amazing; they use all the keywords for what we\u2019re looking for.\u201d",
      "Infante said her firm leans on an identity-verification company to weed out fake candidates, part of an emerging sector that includes firms such as iDenfy, Jumio and Socure.",
      "The fake employee industry has broadened beyond North Koreans in recent years to include criminal groups located in Russia, China, Malaysia and South Korea, according to Roger Grimes, a veteran computer security consultant.",
      "Ironically, some of these fraudulent workers would be considered top performers at most companies, he said.",
      "\u201cSometimes they\u2019ll do the role poorly, and then sometimes they perform it so well that I\u2019ve actually had a few people tell me they were sorry they had to let them go,\u201d Grimes said.",
      "His employer, the cybersecurity firm KnowBe4, said in October that it\u00a0inadvertently hired\u00a0a North Korean software engineer.",
      "The worker used AI to alter a stock photo, combined with a valid but stolen U.S. identity, and got through background checks, including four video interviews, the firm said. He was only discovered after the company found suspicious activity coming from his account.",
      "Fighting deepfakes",
      "Despite the DOJ case and a few other publicized incidents, hiring managers at most companies are generally unaware of the risks of fake job candidates, according to BrightHire\u2019s Sesser.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re responsible for talent strategy and other important things, but being on the front lines of security has historically not been one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cFolks think they\u2019re not experiencing it, but I think it\u2019s probably more likely that they\u2019re just not realizing that it\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "As the quality of deepfake technology improves, the issue will be harder to avoid, Sesser said.",
      "As for \u201cIvan X,\u201d Pindrop\u2019s Balasubramaniyan said the startup used a new video authentication program it created to confirm he was a deepfake fraud.",
      "While Ivan claimed to be located in western Ukraine, his IP address indicated he was actually from thousands of miles to the east, in a possible Russian military facility near the North Korean border, the company said.",
      "Pindrop, backed by Andreessen Horowitz and Citi Ventures, was founded more than a decade ago to detect fraud in voice interactions, but may soon pivot to video authentication. Clients include some of the biggest U.S. banks, insurers and health companies.",

      "Hey you guys! It's the 40th anniversary of the beloved classic movie \"The Goonies.\"",
      "Released in 1985, the action-adventure follows a ragtag band of kids on their quest to find a pirate's treasure while being chased by a trio of bumbling criminals hoping to beat them to it. Think Indiana Jones meets \"The Sandlot,\" with a sprinkle of \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" thrown in for good measure.",
      "If it sounds Steven Spielberg-esque, it is. The Oscar-winning director conceived the story, Chris Columbus penned the screenplay and Richard Donner directed the film, which not only has become a cult classic, but was also inducted into the National Film Registry's 2017 class of films for its cultural impact and significance.",
      "While \"The Goonies\" is mainly remembered for its swashbuckling adventure, at its heart, it's a story about true friendship: both on screen and off.",
      "One that was still very much on display as original cast members Sean Astin, Corey Feldman, Martha Plimpton, Kerri Green, Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano reunited to talk to TODAY's Joe Fryer about their experience filming the iconic movie, the possibility of a sequel, as well as the close bond the actors formed back in the \u201880s.",
      "\"It\u2019s like when you go through an extreme trauma,\" joked Plimpton of their longtime relationships. \"You somehow managed to survive and come out the other side. You're sort of inextricably linked to them forever and ever and ever, no matter what you do. For better or for worse,\" she laughed.",
      "\"We really were like a family,\" said Green. \"A big dysfunctional, but loving, family. It was such an important time for all of us, it was such an important period of the age that we were at. We really grew up together.\"",
      "Astin agreed, saying that during his last visit with Donner, who died in 2021 at the age of 91, the director shared with him that the reason he believed \"The Goonies\" was so successful was that the cast was \"real.\"",
      "\"Even though it\u2019s this pirate fantasy, it\u2019s real people who were really those characters, the characters become linked in the show,\" said Astin.",
      "\"And we did in life,\" he concluded.",
      "More than 40 years later, they're still tight. Like siblings returning for a family reunion, there's good-natured ribbing, catching up on life and they're happy to share their memories and thoughts about the enduring movie.",
      "Oscar winner Ke Huy Quan, who played Data in the movie, wasn't present; nor was Josh Brolin, who played Mikey's older brother, Brand; or Jeff Cohen, who portrayed Chunk. Other memorable \"Goonies\" characters Anne Ramsey (Mama Fratelli) and John Matuszak (Sloth) passed away in 1988 and 1989, respectively.",
      "Curious to know what might have happened to the beloved \"Goonies\" characters after the credits rolled, TODAY.com joined Fryer in speaking with Astin, Davi, Feldman, Green, Pantoliano, and Plimpton, and asked them what they think their counterparts, Mikey, Jake, Mouth, Andy, Francis and Stef, would be doing today.",
      "Here's what they revealed.",
      "Sean Astin: Mikey",
      "In the film, Astin's character, Mikey, leads the Goonies on a wild adventure in search of One-Eyed Willy's hidden treasure.",
      "Where does Astin think Mikey would be today?",
      "\"(There's) no question what Mikey would be doing,\" Astin says. \"He'd be curating a museum that would take you on tours down through the caves and to the cave room, because the ship sailed away, but he would be following in his father's footsteps and curating a museum.\"",
      "Kerri Green: Andy",
      "Green plays Andy, the high school cheerleader-turned-action heroine, who falls head over heels for Brand. The pair develop a sweet teen romance, sharing a series of smooches, with the exception of one mistaken kiss (\"Brand, what happened to your braces?\") with Mikey.",
      "What does Green think Andy would be up to now?",
      "\"All I can picture is that Andy would probably still be in that tennis dress but drinking martinis,\" Green says, inspiring a chorus of laughs from the rest of the cast.",
      "Martha Plimpton: Stef",
      "As Andy's wisecracking best friend, Stef, Plimpton is the Goonies' voice of reason and often the mom figure of the motley crew.",
      "\"I feel like I'm babysitting, except I'm not getting paid,\" remains her enduring quote.",
      "Where would Stef be now?",
      "\"She and her wife would have a really nice ... fishing boat. They'd have their own deep-sea fishing tourism maybe,\" says Plimpton.",
      "\"That would be their weekend thing,\" she explains. \"The rest of the time, they'd have their nice, big fishing boat \u2014 but very sustainable, eco-friendly \u2014 and they'd have their own seafood shop or something. And she and her wife would probably have adopted a few kids.\"",
      "Corey Feldman: Mouth",
      "Of the \"Goonies\" bunch, it is Feldman's character, Mouth, who leads the gang into one mishap after another, all while dropping sarcastic one-liners (not to mention a few \"s---\" bombs) and creating hilarious mayhem from start to finish.",
      "Forty years later, would Mouth still be goading Chunk into doing the \"Truffle Shuffle\"?",
      "\"I'd be running for governor,\" says Feldman, \"in the state of Oregon.\"",
      "\"And shilling bitcoin,\" Plimpton volunteers.",
      "\"We'd be hosting fundraisers for him at the museum,\" adds Astin.",
      "Robert Davi: Jake",
      "After making his escape from prison, the opera-singing Jake Fratelli joins his brother and mother in scheming to pinch One-Eyed Willy's treasure, all while torturing his captive brother, Sloth.",
      "It's not surprising that Davi, a real-life jazz crooner, thinks that Jake would have established himself as a singer.",
      "\"Jake would put an act together of standards, and Francis would be managing him \u2014 and stealing from him,\" Davi surmises.",
      "\"But Jake is so happy singing, that we're going from club to club, and that's what Jake would be doing,\" he continues.",
      "\"And we have the map that Mama left in her shoe, in her coffin,\" Davi adds.",
      "\"You cannot leave this question open-ended,\" interrupts Feldman, laughing.",
      "\"Let me finish my moment!\" Davi laughs back before elaborating. \"Mama told Jake that the map is in the shoe, and we looked in her shoes, we didn't find it. So, we have to exhume her body,\" says Davi.",
      "With the rest of the cast utterly in stitches, Davi concludes, \"I'd be looking for the treasure while I'm singing, and (Francis is) ripping me off. ... That's what happens.\"",
      "\"What treasure? What treasure?\" Feldman asks. \"The treasure was found ... 40 years ago!\"",
      "Joe Pantoliano: Francis",
      "Pantoliano portrays the black sheep of the Fratelli crime family and says that Francis would have gone on to become an entrepreneur.",
      "\"I would be running the chain of Fratelli family restaurants,\" says Pantoliano of Francis' epilogue.",
      "\"And I would be singing at the restaurants as he's ripping me off,\" interrupts Davi.",
      "\"And I'd be supplying the restaurants with seafood,\" finishes Plimpton.",
      "With the gang still together more than four decades after their pirating adventure (theoretically, anyway), it's obvious that much like the mantra, Goonies really do never say die."

      "Just two days after the Season 3 finale of \"The White Lotus,\" the hit HBO show's creator Mike White responded to the series' composer announcing he was quitting the show due to creative differences between him and White.",
      "White, who also directed and executive produced the series, said in an interview with Howard Stern on April 8 that he didn't know what happened with Cristobal Tapia de Veer, the composer behind the music for the series since Season 1.",
      "\"I honestly don\u2019t know what happened, except now I\u2019m reading his interviews because he decides to do some PR campaign about him leaving the show,\" White said. \"I don\u2019t think he respected me.\"",
      "\"He wants people to know that he\u2019s edgy and dark and, I don\u2019t know, like I watch reality TV,\" he continued. \"We never really even fought. He says we feuded. I don\u2019t think I ever had a fight with him \u2014 except for maybe some emails. It was basically me giving him notes.\"",
      "White added that the thought Tapia de Veer didn't like the process of getting notes or wanting revisions from him because \"he didn't respect me.\"",
      "\"I knew he wasn\u2019t a team player and that he wanted to do it his way. I was thrown that he would go to\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0to s--- on me and the show three days before the finale,\" he said. \"It was kind of a b---- move.\"",
      "Stern replied that White was the director, and that the people on his team need to go along with his vision. He's also the writer and executive producer of the series.",
      "\"Honestly, that's why it did work the first couple of seasons, because we did go through the process,\" White said. \"But by the time the third season came around, he'd won Emmys, and I don't know, he had this song go viral, and so he just did not want to go through the process anymore. He didn't want to get notes from me.\"",
      "\"He would just always look at me, like he always had this, like, contemptuous smirk on his face, and whenever he was dealing with me because I just think he thought I was just a chimp or something,\" he continued.",
      "White said Tapia de Veer was \"definitely making a big deal out of just a creative difference of opinion,\" and added that he thought the composer was \"very talented.\"",
      "\"I have never kissed somebody's a-- so hard to just get him to, you know, to lead that horse to water,\" White said.",
      "\"He just didn't respect me,\u00a0I guess, so have fun doing whatever you're doing next,\" he added. \"I don't know, onwards for me.\"",
      "Just days before the finale aired on April 6, Tapia de Veer told The New York Times that he wouldn't be returning for Season 4 of \"The White Lotus\" after experiencing creative differences with the show's team.",
      "\"I announced to the team a few months ago that I was not coming back, that I was leaving. I didn\u2019t tell Mike for various reasons; I wanted to tell him just at the end for the shock and whatever,\" Tapia de Veer said. \"Except I told the whole editorial team and music editor and producer and all that, but I didn\u2019t think that they were going to tell him. At some point he heard about that.\"",
      "Tapia de Veer said there had been disagreements with the music since Season 1 of the show aired in 2021, and that he had not been given any direction for the theme song for Season 3.",
      "\"Enlightenment,\" the Season 3 theme, was a departure from the beloved tracks from previous seasons -- leaving viewers without the iconic vocals that devoted fans came to love in Season 2.",
      "\"I have, like, over 20 versions of that theme, with and without the ooh-loo-loo-loos. But of course, in the 1:45 titles that\u2019s allowed, there\u2019s nothing from the other ones,\" he said. \"That was kind of a risk, but we never talked about that. I don\u2019t think everybody was really aware of how attached people were to the ooh-loo-loo-loos.\"",
      "When the first episode of the new season aired in February, Tapia de Veer said he began getting calls for a statement about the new theme song.",
      "\"People are furious about the change of the theme, and I thought that was interesting,\" he said. \"I texted the producer and I told him that it would be great to, at some point, give them the longer version with the ooh-loo-loo-loos, because people will explode if they realize that it was going there anyway. He thought it was a good idea. But then Mike cut that \u2014 he wasn\u2019t happy about that.\"",
      "\"I mean, at that point, we already had our last fight forever, I think. So he was just saying no to anything. So I just\u00a0uploaded that to my YouTube,\" he added, referring to a longer version of the song he posted on March 19.",
      "While the backlash to the new theme song was immediate, as the season continued, the anger directed toward Tapia de Veer subsided, he said.",
      "\"At one point, people were like insulting me and sending me horrible things.

      "Tapia de Veer reflected on his choice to leave the 15-time Emmy award-winning show.",

Maybe I was being unprofessional, and for sure Mike feels that I was always unprofessional to him because I didn\u2019t give him what he wanted. But what I gave him did\u00a0this, you know \u2014 did those Emmys, people going crazy,\" he said.",
      "He added that he was happy with the risks he took for the series' music.",
      "\"That is the main thing that I\u2019m most happy about \u2014 it was worth all the tension and almost forcing the music into the show, in a way, because I didn\u2019t have that many allies in there,\" he said.",
      "\"I treasure that more than something else I did that was just a success, and it works and that\u2019s that, with less struggle,\" he continued. \"This was a good struggle.\""

      "Over the course of the season, her character forms a bond with Tanya, an unstable heiress, by offering not only spa treatments but a level of emotional support that extends well beyond the role of a typical esthetician.",
      "Tanya takes a liking to Belinda, extending the offer to fund Belinda\u2019s dream of starting her own spa.",
      "But when Tanya connects with Greg (Jon Gries), an unexpected romantic interest whom she eventually goes on to marry, she focuses more on her new relationship than Belinda.",
      "Though Belinda goes the extra mile for Tanya, going so far as to offer emotional support as she grieves her mother\u2019s death, Tanya reneges on her promise to invest in the business.",
      "The season ends with Belinda waving at the boat carrying Tanya away from the resort, looking bereft.",
      "What happened between Belinda and Pornchai in Season 3?",
      "Belinda finds herself in Thailand in Season 3 of \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d as a participant in a months-long wellness exchange program. She's meant to learn the practices at the spa in the Thailand resort to bring them back to Maui, and teach her own techniques to the estheticians local to the Koh Samui resort.",
      "Belinda and Pornchai \u2014 who works at the Koh Samui resort spa \u2014 quickly fall for each other. Amid their flirtation, they float the idea of opening a spa together.Yet she, too, backpedals on this commitment, just as Tanya once did to her, when she comes into money.",
      "Here's how. In Season 2, Greg plotted to have Tanya murdered so he could inherit her fortune. When Belinda sees Greg in Thailand going by the name Gary, she does some Googling, and puts the pieces together. Greg offers her money in exchange for her silence. Belinda\u2019s son Zion negotiates the sum up from $100,000 to $5 million.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to be virtuous and have certain kinds of ideals when you have no money and don\u2019t have to really put your money where your mouth is. It\u2019s one thing to be, \u2018oh yeah, I\u2019m gonna do this spa for women,\u2019 whatever her sort of fantasy was \u2014 but she needs someone to bankroll it,\u201d he said on\u00a0\u201cThe White Lotus Official Podcast.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat (choice to have her leave Pornchai behind) was actually an anchoring idea, that she would go and have this kind of Stella-gets-her-groove-back kind of thing with somebody there and is maybe fantasizing about maybe starting a business with this person, and then this windfall comes and it\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m outta here.

I gotta go.\u2019 Belinda\u2019s a little bit more heartbroken \u2014 and she doesn\u2019t say no. She\u2019s just like, \u2018Right now, I have to get my bearings \u2026\u2019 And I do think that maybe she\u2019d circle back,\u201d she said.",

      "Rothwell also told Variety that Belinda never led Pornchai on as much as Tanya led Belinda on.",
      "\"If people rewatch this season, she never agrees to go into business with Pornchai; she\u2019s just considering it. Which I think is a subtle but massive difference from Season 1, where you have Tanya being like, 'Yes, let\u2019s do it. Give me the papers. Show me your business plan.'She doesn\u2019t lead him on. Pornchai was definitely more into Belinda and the idea than Belinda was,\" she said.",
      "What does it all mean?",
      "It's a bittersweet full circle moment. In Season 1, Tanya leaves the door open with Belinda. \"I\u2019m going to call you,\" she says. This, perhaps, is Tanya's roundabout way of making good on the promise. The $5 million Belinda now has was once Tanya\u2019s, after all.",
      "Belinda's newfound freedom underlines another theme the \"White Lotus\" is interested in: The gap between the haves and the have-nots, and hotel staff and employees. Belinda, who was so long in the \"staff\" category, gets to experience how it feels to have money, and becomes cold in the process.",
      "There are other telling parallels between Belinda and Tanya. Both women gravitated toward what they did not originally have. Tanya had money, but leaves the hotel to chase love with Greg; Belinda had the potential for love with Pornchai, but leaves the hotel to truly experience what it's like to have money.",
      "Of course, none of this would have been possible without Greg, the most self-serving character of them all. He chooses to be with Tanya in Season 1, and to give Belinda her hush money in Season 3. This twisted, self-interested character \u2014 protecting his health in Season 1, wealth in Season 2 and freedom in Season 3.",
      "The final shots collapse the parallel between Belinda and Tanya. Tanya died on a boat in Season 2; the show ends with Belinda on a boat. It's almost like Belinda is picking up right where Tanya left off."

      "Last year, Aiken reflected on the similarities and differences between himself and Parker during an appearance on the Adam Carolla Show. He noted that early on, Parker\u2019s behavior mirrored his own, but as Parker hit puberty, differences began to emerge, particularly in how they handle conflict and anger.",

      "She added, \"I saw how the media treated people who gained and lost weight and how that effected my brain chemistry.\"",
      "The musician noted that she still catches herself thinking harmful ideas from \"toxic diet culture.\" But she's trained herself to \"swat\" away those ideas \"like a fly,\" she said, waving her hand in front of her.",
      "Lizzo told Shetty when she finds herself thinking those negative thoughts, she reminds herself, \"This is your body. You only get one of these. Enjoy her and let her enjoy you.\""

Though June was surrounded by loved ones \u2014 including husband Luke (O-T Fagbenle) and best friend Moira (Samira Wiley) \u2014 she remained haunted by her past life, and the fact that her daughter (with Luke; Nichole\u2019s dad is Nick, played by Max Minghella) Hannah remained in the Gilead system.",
      "She worried she might be hunted by the theocracy\u2019s representatives for extradition and retribution, and that Serena, given freedom to preach her gospel, could win over Canadians. Both women got chances during the season to shoot one another, and never did.",
      "Unable to live properly without getting Hannah out of Gilead, June and Luke traveled to No Man\u2019s Land between Canada and Gilead to learn where she was, but ended up being captured by Gilead sympathizers. They\u2019re separated (again!) and are unsuccessful in liberating their daughter.",
      "Toward the end of the season, June and Luke were again reunited, but violent Gilead supporters and anti-refugee protesters started going after June and other refugees. June dodged bullets but not a truck, and was mowed down, her arm broken. Luke caught the driver and beat him up \u2014 and the driver eventually died.",
      "The couple realized that Canada was no longer a safe haven, so with help from US-in-exile representative Mark Tuello (Sam Jager), they head for a train that would take them to Alaska. The police arrested Luke on the platform, and June and Nichole were the only ones able to board the train, though.",
      "Serena turned into a symbol",
      "Most of Season 5 found Serena pregnant and struggling to redefine herself. Instead, she became a symbol in both Gilead and Canada \u2014 and for a time, got a taste of what it was like to be treated as a kind of handmaid.",
      "With her husband dead, she insisted on bringing his body back to Gilead for a state funeral, which was broadcast internationally. Gilead leaders didn\u2019t know what to do with a powerful, pregnant widow, so they made her an unofficial global ambassador for Gilead and more or less washed their hands of her. Meanwhile, devout followers in Canada began to flock to Serena.",
      "Released from detention, Serena was taken in by Canadian Gilead believers, Alanis\u00a0(Genevieve Angelson) and Ryan (Lucas Neff)\u00a0Wheeler.",
      "Serena decided to focus less on Gilead\u2019s political needs and more on women\u2019s fertility issues. But as her pregnancy advanced, The Wheelers started to exert more control: She had to get remarried; no single mothers were allowed in their world.",
      "When Serena learned that June and Luke were detained in No Man\u2019s Land, she journeyed with the hit man tasked with killing June. Given the chance to shoot June herself, Serena shot Ezra and the two women went on the run \u2014 just as Serena went into labor.",
      "Serena gave birth to Noah with June\u2019s help, but the delivery made her sick and she returned to Canada \u2014 where Noah was given to the Wheelers.",
      "As her health improved, she was treated almost like a handmaid in the house, useful only for nursing her own baby. But given a free window, she fled the Wheelers with Noah and boarded the same train as June \u2014 both women on the run yet again, with their children.",
      "What about everyone else?",
      "A lot of time in Season 5 was spent on flashbacks, including how June came to be the Waterfords\u2019 Handmaid, along with other backstory. The side characters in Season 5 largely hovered around June and Serena\u2019s story, but here\u2019s what we learned about a few others:",
      "Emily (Alexis Bledel) left her wife and son and headed back to Gilead. Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd) continued to train future Handmaids, but was rebuffed when she tried to reform the system (expect her character to be set up this season for the \"Handmaid's\" sequel, \"The Testaments,\" which is set to go into production next week).  Janine (Madeline Brewer) was briefly posted with The Putnams, but after an act of rebellion was sent back to the Red Center to work with Aunt Lydia, then got dragged away by security to an unknown fate. (All the way to the set of Netflix's \"You,\" maybe, where she's a major player in that series' final season.) Nick got married and his wife became pregnant, which which shifted his alliances \u2014 though he still had feelings for June.",

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 It\u2019s a well-established routine.",
      "Every day, Zeev Engelmayer takes a seat at his bay window overlooking his backyard in central Tel Aviv. His mission? Fighting despair with an army of colorful markers in a bid to bring hope to the people of Israel.",
      "For the past 18 months since the Hamas terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, he has drawn a daily postcard, many featuring Israeli hostages. Some have been turned into banners, T-shirts and profile pictures on social media and have been embraced by the families of those taken captive. One even made its way to Pope Francis.",
      "Although the subject matter is often dark, the postcards are for the most part colorful and innocent. \u201cI use a child\u2019s style because a child has the ability to have hope even in times that are very difficult,\u201d he told NBC News in February.",
      "In the first two weeks after the Hamas attacks, Engelmayer said he drew in black and white to reflect the deep sadness he felt about the attacks on Israel, which saw 1,200 people killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. He said his first piece paid homage to \u201cGuernica,\u201d the 1937 anti-war masterpiece by renowned Spanish artist Pablo Picasso.",
      "But then one morning he said he picked up colored pens and began to draw.",
      "Titled \u201cSomething Terrible Is About to Happen,\u201d the picture he produced that day depicted Kibbutz Be\u2019eri, a small community in southern Israel where dozens of civilians and security personnel were killed on the morning of the Hamas attack and more than 30 residents were also taken hostage.",
      "\u201cI wanted to show the difference between what was before, this peaceful place, and the green trees and the flowers,\u201d Engelmayer said. \u201cI wanted to show the moments before it happened.\u201d",
      "The first postcard he drew of a hostage, he added, was of grandmother Yaffa Adar, now 86, who was filmed as she was taken away in a golf cart from her home in nearby Kibbutz Nir Oz while surrounded by armed militants.",
      "\u201cShe had a little smile,\u201d said Engelmayer, adding that she held her head up high so as not to give her captors \u201cthe satisfaction of taking her hostage.\u201d",
      "Instead of drawing her capture, he said he imagined her happy return home. \u201cI drew her surrounded by a woman with colorful dresses, spreading flowers in the air,\u201d he said of Adar, who was freed four days later, on Nov. 24, 2023, after 49 days in captivity.",
      "Engelmayer said after that he was approached by relatives of many hostages asking him to depict their loved ones. They told him all about their hobbies and passions, as well as personal anecdotes, in the hope of inspiring him.",
      "One also made it to Pope Francis via an Italian diplomat, Engelmayer said, adding that the pontiff then \u201cprayed for the hostages.\u201d",
      "Throughout, Engelmayer said he was determined to highlight the plight of those in Hamas captivity, although many have since been freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners as part of a ceasefire deal earlier this year and during a previous pause in fighting in November 2023.",
      "After Phase 1 of what was to be a three-stage ceasefire deal, Israel last month stepped up attacks in Gaza, where it has killed more than 50,500 people since the Oct. 7 attacks, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "Some days, Engelmayer said he struggled to \u201cfind the optimism.\u201d In September 2024, when American Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin\u2019s body was found shot execution style, alongside five other hostages, he said he \u201cdrew a very pessimistic, difficult painting.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 A huge deal touted by President Donald Trump as a victory in his campaign to \u201ctake back\u201d the Panama Canal from China could be on the rocks amid pushback from Beijing.",
      "The $23 billion sale involving two ports run by CK Hutchison, a private company based in the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, to a consortium led by U.S. investment firm BlackRock had originally been scheduled to be signed last week.",
      "But an agreement between the two has been delayed under pressure from China, whose market regulator launched a review of the deal as state-run newspapers attacked it as undermining China\u2019s national interests.",
      "NBC News takes a look at the sale and what it may mean politically and economically for the United States and China, the world\u2019s two biggest economies.",
      "Why is it important?",
      "During Trump\u2019s inaugural speech in January, he claimed without providing evidence that China controlled the 50-mile canal, and vowed that the U.S. will take back the waterway, which he said was \u201cvital\u201d to national security. The Panamanian government has administered the U.S.-built canal since the U.S. relinquished it to the Central American country in 1999.",
      "Trump did not rule out military action and has directed the Defense Department to draw up plans to send more troops to Panama to \u201creclaim\u201d the canal, through which 40% of U.S. trade passes.",
      "Panama denies Trump\u2019s accusations about the neutrality of the canal, which is enshrined in its constitution. But in an attempt to relieve the pressure from Washington, in January the country  launched an audit of CK Hutchison\u2019s Panama Ports Company (PPC), which since 1997 has operated two ports along the canal, Balboa on the Pacific side and Crist\u00f3bal on the Atlantic side.",
      "On Monday, Panama\u2019s comptroller general said the audit had found that the contract was overly favorable to Hutchison PPC, costing Panama $1.3 billion in revenue, and that authorities would file a lawsuit against officials involved in its renewal in 2021.",
      "The findings come as CK Hutchison is negotiating the sale to BlackRock, which includes a 90% interest in the two Panama Canal ports and an 80% controlling interest in 43 other ports outside Hong Kong and China. When the deal was announced on March 4, the companies said that definitive documentation for the Panama Canal operations would be signed by April 2.",
      "Trump quickly declared victory. \u201cTo further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we\u2019ve already started doing it,\u201d he said in an address to Congress last month, citing the proposed deal.",
      "China\u2019s 'long-arm' jurisdiction",
      "The sale of the two Chinese-run ports is about more than just Panama, said Christopher Hernandez-Roy, senior fellow and deputy director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "\u201cIt represents a major victory for the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to roll back China in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d he said, adding that is something China \u201cwould not want to happen.\u201d",
      "Though CK Hutchison, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, Beijing quickly signaled its displeasure with the deal.",

      "Chinese government offices in Hong Kong have reposted articles from pro-Beijing newspapers criticizing the sale as undermining China\u2019s national interest.

    "story": [
      "Among the top goals for President Trump and his administration in hitting trading partners with\u00a0steep tariffs\u00a0is bringing manufacturing capacity back to the U.S., even if it comes at the price of\u00a0short-term market and economic duress. But in Cambodia, the Asian country hit with the highest tariff rate of any in the new trade plan, that goal is highly unlikely.",
      "While the 49% tariff rate that the Trump administration is placing on Cambodian goods will lead to an existential crisis for Cambodian factories and workers already at the low-end of global income distribution, reshoring of its manufacturing to the U.S. is not going to happen, according to a trade group that represents U.S. interests in the retail manufacturing hub.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re absolutely not going to go back to the United States,\u201d said Casey Barnett, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, the trade association representing U.S. companies manufacturing in Cambodia. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that Americans want to sit down and sew a pair of sweatpants for long hours of the day,\u201d Barnett said.",
      "Barnett said manufacturers in Cambodia are looking at other countries to mitigate the tariffs, but the U.S. is not among the options. Some companies are looking to move their supply chains to Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia. Other companies are moving more slowly, thinking there might be a reversal on the tariffs.",
      "Factories in Cambodia are by no means in a good position for the moment, according to Barnett, looking for ways to survive for the next few months.",
      "\u201cThe labor-intensive garment factories here in Cambodia simply cannot continue to operate with a 49% additional tariff. They can\u2019t survive and are looking for alternatives,\u201d he said.",
      "For now, at least, no new orders are being placed. \u201cThere are orders being paused. Everyone\u2019s facing uncertainty and they want to wait a bit to see how the dust settles,\u201d Barnett added.",
      "The Cambodian government is working on a number of steps to mitigate the pressure, such as fiscal policies, including tax credits.",
      "Under Armour, Rawlings Sporting Goods, Lululemon, Black & Decker, Hugo Boss, Hearth & Home, Eddie Bauer, Dollar General, Diageo, Asics, Adidas, and Bass Pro Shops are among the retail companies that import from Cambodia to North America. There is an ever wider list of items imported from garments to footwear, travel goods, bicycles, agriculture products, furniture, solar panels, tires, and kitchen cabinets.",
      "Expect a pause in executive decision making",
      "Andrei Quinn-Barabanov, supply chain industry practice lead at Moody\u2019s, says that even if companies manufacture as cheaply as possible, relocating supply chains is a major investment.",
      "\u201cSupply chain investments are meant to be longer term and when you have tremendous uncertainty like this you are unlikely to make these decisions. Companies will wait to see what the tariff response will be from other countries, as well as nontariff restrictions they will put on U.S. companies. You will have very little executive decision making.\u201d",
      "The White House has claimed that Cambodia\u2019s tariffs on the U.S. reach as high as 97%, a claim disputed by the country, as well as by multiple sources of tariffs data, including the World Trade Organization. The Observatory of Economic Complexity, which also studies trade data, says some consumer products such as snacks, cosmetics, and automobiles can see much higher tariffs than the average, as high as 35%, in Cambodia. The U.S. average tariff on Cambodian goods is 2.6%.",
      "The administration has continued to argue that the return of manufacturing to the U.S. will ultimately lead to greater revenue for the U.S. \u201cIf we put up a tariff wall, the ultimate goal would be to bring jobs back to the U.S. But in the meantime, we will be collecting substantial tariffs,\u201d\u00a0Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on CNBC\u00a0on Tuesday. \u201cIf we\u2019re successful, tariffs would be a melting ice cube, in a way, because you\u2019re taking in the revenues as the manufacturing facilities are built in the U.S., and there should be some level of symmetry between the taxes we begin taking in with the new industry from the payroll taxes as the tariffs decline.\u201d",
      "Andre C. Winters, founder and principal of supply chain consultancy and planning company, HudsonWinters,\u00a0recently told CNBC\u00a0he is doubtful that companies will bring manufacturing back to the U.S. in a hurry. \u201cThis trade war is not an incentive to come back to the United States,\u201d said Winters. \u201cCompanies will look to other countries that are being hit with lower tariffs. If I\u2019m paying 40% in Vietnam and I can get 20% tariff in another country, I\u2019ll go there, because in the end, it is still cheaper than coming back to America.\u201d",
      "Barnett said the U.S. consumer will be footing at least part of the bill, as\u00a0many companies have warned.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s going to push up the prices for the American consumer,\u201d he said. \u201cCambodia\u2019s been helping American families buy those back-to-school clothes at an affordable price. These tariffs are simply going to raise prices for American families and not bring manufacturing back to the U.S.\u201d",
      "Bringing manufacturing back to the United States is\u00a0not the only reason for the Trump tariffs plan, according to President Trump and his trade advisers, with reducing the nation\u2019s trade deficit and debt, and enabling tax cuts, also critical to their strategy, and that has become clear as nations begin to offer tariff concessions.",
      "Cambodia\u2019s prime minister\u00a0sent a letter to the Trump administration\u00a0in recent days outlining significant reductions in tariff rates for U.S. goods. Vietnam offered to take tariffs on U.S. imports to 0%, an offer that Trump noted, but that the Trump administration later indicated would not be enough for the administration to lift its new levies.",
      "Trade deficits and \u201cnontariff cheating\u201d are as important, said White House trade advisor Peter Navarro on Monday in a CNBC interview, in rejecting the premise of the Vietnamese offer.",
      "In a comparison of trade deficits, Cambodia ranks low on the list compared to many international manufacturing nations. U.S. goods trade with Cambodia totaled an estimated $13 billion in 2024,\u00a0according to the USTR. U.S. goods exports to Cambodia in 2024 were $321.6 million, up 4.9 percent ($14.9 million) from 2023. U.S. goods imported from Cambodia totaled $12.7 billion in 2024, up 9.3 percent ($1.1 billion) from 2023. The U.S. goods trade deficit with Cambodia was $12.3 billion in 2024 and is not in the top ten of trade deficits.",
      "Trump advisors have used the term\u00a0\u201cburden sharing\u201d\u00a0to discuss the broader philosophy behind the aggressive tariffs stance and argue other countries will bear the cost of tariffs. Many economists have pointed to the risks tied to\u00a0hitting some of the poorest nations in the world\u00a0with high tariffs. Cambodia is among the 11 nations that account for a small part of the U.S. trade deficit but have exports to the U.S. representing over 10% of their GDP, according to the Center for Global Development. \u201cFor people working in the apparel industry, the conditions are\u00a0harsh, but the wages these jobs offer represent a real opportunity, particularly for women,\u201d it noted.",
      "Barnett echoed those fears, saying the tariff rates which will only increase poverty in Cambodia, lead to the loss of jobs, and further widen the trade deficit.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of a panic and that\u2019s tragic because there are one million of the world\u2019s poorest people currently employed in this industry here in Cambodia, and many of them are women trying to make ends meet. Their monthly salary is around $300,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cCambodia is between a rock and a hard place.\u201d"

      "Harry\u2019s protection was downgraded in February 2020 when he stepped down as a full-time member of the royal family and moved to the United States with his wife, Meghan. This meant the British state provided security on a case-by-case basis.",
      "The Duke of Sussex is challenging this decision in a case that is set to span Tuesday and Wednesday, arguing that the body responsible for protecting royals was not following its own rules. He said he and his family were under particular threat because of the abuse his wife receives from some sections of the public and the media, which Harry says are racially motivated.",
      "\u201cPrince Harry inherited a security risk at birth, for life,\u201d an unnamed legal representative said in a previous statement. \u201cHe remains sixth in line to the throne, served two tours of combat duty in Afghanistan, and in recent years his family has been subjected to well-documented neo-Nazi and extremist threats.\u201d",
      "His challenge was rejected in February last year by Britain\u2019s High Court, which said the decision to change his security status was neither irrational nor procedurally unfair. Harry initially lost the right to appeal last April, before overturning that in the summer.",
      "In a separate ruling, he also had his offer to personally bankroll protection by Britain\u2019s Metropolitan Police rejected. The British government said its police forces are not available for private hire.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration has ended funding to U.N. World Food Program emergency programs helping keep millions alive in Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen and 11 other impoverished countries, many of them struggling with conflict, according to the organization and officials who spoke to The Associated Press.",
      "The World Food Program, the largest provider of food aid, appealed to the U.S. to roll back the new cuts in a social media post Monday. The unexpected round of contract cancellations has targeted some of the last remaining humanitarian programs run by the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to two U.S. officials, a United Nations official and documents obtained by the AP.",
      "\u201cThis could amount to a death sentence for millions of people facing extreme hunger and starvation,\u201d WFP said on X.",
      "The agency said it was in contact with the Trump administration \u201cto urge for continued support\u201d for lifesaving programs and thanked the United States and other donors for past contributions.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other administration officials had pledged to spare emergency food programs and other life-and-death aid from deep cuts to U.S. foreign assistance. There was no immediate comment Monday from the State Department.",
      "The projects were being canceled \u201cfor the convenience of the U.S. Government\u201d at the direction of Jeremy Lewin, a top lieutenant at Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency who was appointed to oversee the elimination of USAID programs, according to termination notices sent to partners and viewed by the AP.",
      "In Syria, a country battling poverty, hunger and insecurity after a 13-year civil war and an insurgency by the Islamic State group, some $230 million in contracts with WFP and humanitarian groups was terminated in recent days, according to a State Department document detailing the cuts that was obtained by the AP.",
      "The single biggest of the targeted Syria programs, at $111 million, provided bread and other daily food to 1.5 million people, the document says.",
      "About 60 letters canceling contracts were sent over the past week. An official with the United Nations in the Middle East said all U.S. aid to WFP food programs across Yemen, another war-divided country that is facing one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters, has been stopped, apparently including food that already had arrived in distribution centers.",
      "WFP also received termination letters for U.S.-funded programs in Lebanon and Jordan, where Syrian refugees would be hit hardest, the U.N. official said.",
      "Some of the last remaining U.S. funding for key programs in Somalia, Afghanistan and the southern African nation of Zimbabwe also was affected, including for those providing food, water, medical care and shelter for people displaced by war, one of the U.S. officials said.",
      "The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.",
      "Current and former USAID experts and partners said some $560 million in humanitarian aid was cut to Afghanistan, including for emergency food assistance, the treatment of severely malnourished babies, lifesaving medical care, safe drinking water, and emergency mental health treatment for survivors of sexual and physical violence.",
      "Another of the notices, sent Friday, abruptly pulled U.S. funding for a program with strong support in Congress that had sent young Afghan women overseas for schooling because of Taliban prohibitions on women\u2019s education, said an administrator for that project, which is run by Texas A&M University.",
      "The young women would now face return to Afghanistan, where their lives would be in danger, according to that administrator, who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "The abrupt end of WFP programs threatens some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations, many of which depend on such food aid, according to humanitarian groups. The U.S. and other donors long have seen efforts to ease humanitarian crises as being in their strategic interest by stemming mass migration, conflicts and extremism, which struggles for resources can bring.",
      "WFP chief Cindy McCain said in a posting on social media that the cuts \u201cundermine global stability.\u201d",
      "Rubio had notified Congress and courts last month that USAID contract cuts were over, with about 1,000 programs spared worldwide and more than 5,000 others eliminated. That added to the shock of the new cuts.",
      "The Trump administration has accused USAID of wastefulness and advancing liberal causes.",
      "Trump\u2019s freeze on all foreign assistance through USAID and the State Department led to a brief shutdown of services at the al-Hol camp, where tens of thousands of alleged Islamic State fighters and their families are kept under guard.",
      "That shutdown raised fears of an uprising or breakout at the camp. U.S. officials quickly intervened to restore services.",
      "The State Department document obtained by the AP identifies two newly terminated contracts, run by Save the Children and the U.N. Population Fund, which provided mental health services and other care to women and children at al-Hol. It was not immediately clear if any other services were affected at the camp.",
      "The U.S. had been the major funder of the WFP, providing $4.5 billion of the $9.8 billion in donations to the food agency last year."

      "If the plan is fully implemented, the total tariffs on goods imported into the United States from China\u00a0would be as much as 104%. In response, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said China \u201cfirmly opposes\u201d Trump\u2019s tariff threats, calling its previous countermeasures \u201centirely justified.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end,\u201d the ministry said in a statement Tuesday, adding that Trump\u2019s threat to escalate tariffs on China is a \u201cmistake upon a mistake.\u201d",
      "Trump threatened the new 50% duty on China, effective Wednesday, if Beijing does not withdraw its 34% tariffs on all U.S. goods by Tuesday, which China imposed in retaliation for a 34% levy on Chinese goods the Trump administration announced last week.",
      "\u201cAdditionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\u201d Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social. \u201cNegotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately.\u201d",
      "Beijing\u2019s retaliatory tariffs are scheduled to take effect Thursday.",
      "\u201cI believe the actions of the U.S. side do not reflect a willingness to engage in serious dialogue,\u201d Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Tuesday at a regular briefing in Beijing.",
      "The U.S. should \u201cadopt an attitude of equality, respect and reciprocity\u201d if it \u201ctruly wants to negotiate,\u201d Lin said.",
      "The Commerce Ministry urged the United States to cancel all unilateral tariff measures against China and resolve trade disputes through dialogue.",
      "\u201cPressure and threats are not the correct way to deal with China,\u201d it said. \u201cChina reiterates that there are no winners in a trade war, and protectionism leads nowhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its own interests,\u201d it added.",
      "Stocks in mainland China and Hong Kong rose Tuesday as Beijing scrambles to stabilize its markets amid panic over Trump\u2019s tariffs, with Chinese state-backed funds pledging to buy local stocks.",
      "The Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong had climbed about 1.5% at the close of trading on Tuesday, a day after its biggest single-day decline in nearly three decades following China\u2019s tariff retaliation against the U.S. China\u2019s blue-chip CSI 300 Index closed up 1.7% after plummeting 7% on Monday.",
      "State money is \u201cmore like a short-term stabilization gesture,\u201d said Gary Ng, senior economist for Natixis in Hong Kong. But it\u2019s \u201cunrealistic,\u201d he said, to expect China to inject state-owned funds into its stock market indefinitely if the trade war with the U.S. escalates.",
      "China will hit back at Trump with the same 50% duties if he proceeds with his threat, said Andy Xie, an independent economist in Shanghai.",
      "\u201cIf Trump wants to take you to hell, you take him with you,\u201d Xie said of China\u2019s possible response in a phone interview Tuesday.",
      "Xie said he thinks Beijing has concluded that compromise will only lead to more pressure from Trump. \u201cChina cannot back down anymore,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump\u2019s 50% tariff threat doesn\u2019t make a lot of difference, Xie added, as Chinese goods already face more than 70% in U.S. duties accumulated since Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "China has decreased its dependence on the American market, with its exports to the U.S.\u00a0dropping to 14.7% in 2024, down from 19.2% in 2018 when Trump started a trade war with the world\u2019s second-largest economy, according to the country\u2019s state-run People\u2019s Daily newspaper.",
      "\u201cChina [and] the United States will decouple. It\u2019s a matter of time,\u201d Xie said. \u201cYou have to bite the bullet.\u201d",

Trump may pressure Netanyahu to move toward ending\u00a0the war in Gaza\u00a0\u2014 at the very least through some interim truce with Hamas that would pause the fighting and free more hostages. Gilboa said Trump is hoping to return from his first overseas trip \u2014 expected next month to Saudi Arabia \u2014 with some movement on a deal to normalize relations with Israel, which would likely require significant Israeli concessions on Gaza.",

      "Although Israel is a tiny market for U.S. products, the United States is a key trade partner of Israel. Much of that trade is for high-tech services, which are not directly affected by the tariffs, but key Israeli industries could be impacted.",
      "The Manufacturers Association of Israel estimates that the tariffs will cost Israel about $3 billion in exports each year and lead to the loss of 26,000 jobs in industries that include biotechnology, chemicals, plastics and electronics.

      "The letter, first reported by NBC News, comes after a call last month\u00a0between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin,\u00a0during which\u00a0Putin suggested that American and Russian skaters play matches against one another.\u00a0According to the Kremlin, Trump \u201csupported\u201d the idea.",
      "The NHL said Monday it was \"not part of the original conversation, and there have been no further discussions.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said last month that while hockey was mentioned on the leaders\u2019 call, the White House is \u201cmore interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d",
      "Last month, the NHL said that it was aware of the conversation but that it was \u201cnot a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time,\u201d The Associated Press reported.",
      "Razom for Ukraine, a U.S.-based organization that co-signed and helped send the letter to the NHL, hoped for a stronger position from the league.",
      "\u201cSo the NHL has come out with a statement that most certainly did not put to rest concerns and worries,\u201d said Razom for Ukraine\u2019s director of public engagement, Daniel Balson.\u00a0\u201cOur letter simply asks for the NHL to make plain and public its opposition to any such collaboration.",
      "\u201cAs NHL and KHL players would\u00a0ostensibly\u00a0be playing together on the ice, Russian bombs would be raining fire on Ukraine civilians.\u201d",
      "When asked about the prospect of a game in a media call Tuesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the idea was \u201ca purely hypothetical idea\u201d and that \u201cthere are no specifics.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow can one criticize something that does not exist? Someone is always criticizing something,\u201d he added. \u201cLet\u2019s give them this opportunity.\u201d",
      "But the Kremlin has a long history of using sports to boost its soft power and launder its international reputation, Balsom said.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s interested in portraying Russia as a modern member in good standing of the international community\u00a0that wins medals and demonstrates athletic excellence,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThis is all belied by the fact that, as we\u2019re having this conversation, Russia\u2019s military are committing war crimes in Ukraine, they\u2019re occupying territory, and they\u2019re killing many, many innocent individuals, innocent civilians, including hundreds of Ukrainian athletes who lost their lives,\u201d he added.",
      "Hours before the coalition sent the letter, Ovechkin, the Washington Capitals star, scored his 895th career goal, topping Wayne Gretzky\u2019s record.",
      "Ovechkin has long been seen as closely tied to Putin, even smiling with him in his Instagram profile picture. And Putin congratulated Ovechkin on his milestone goal.",
      "Ovechkin did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.",
      "\u201cThis is somebody who has proudly proclaimed his affiliation with a Russian leadership that is unrepentant in its abuse of some of the most vulnerable Ukrainians in the world, that\u2019s territorially expansionist, that has launched an unprovoked and incredibly violent aggression and that has kidnapped kids. It\u2019s incumbent on somebody like Ovechkin to dissociate himself from the Kremlin,\u201d Balson said.",
      "At the time of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022,\u00a0Ovechkin told reporters: \u201cPlease, no more war. It doesn\u2019t matter who is in the war, Russia, Ukraine, different countries.\u201d"
