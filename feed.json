      "Appearing on \u201cSesame Street\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Appearing on \u201cSesame Street\u201d? That's the best idea.",
      "The 55th season of the acclaimed family program features a star-studded lineup of musicians that would be the envy of any summer festival: SZA, Chris Stapleton, Noah Kahan, Rene\u00e9 Rapp and Samara Joy.",
      "The upcoming season will focus on lessons in emotional well-being. It debuts Jan. 16 on MAX with new episodes releasing every Thursday. \u201cSesame Street\u201d will also be available on PBS stations and to stream on PBS Kids in the fall.",
      "No one is more excited than Elmo himself.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot to learn from music \u2014 yeah, timing and harmonies and melody and different styles and different cultures,\u201d the 3 1/2-year-old monster told The Associated Press. \u201cIt's really cool! We've got a lot of wonderful people come and do some music with us on \u2018Sesame Street,' like Miss Rene\u00e9 Rapp and SZA! Chris Stapleton, Noah Kahan, Samara Joy \u2014 lots of great people!\u201d",
      "Songs double as life lessons on \u201cSesame Street,\u201d from an alt-R&B-pop track about gratitude with SZA to an acoustic number about feelings with Rapp.",
      "\"SZA is really cool \u2014 really talented. And \u2018gratitude\u2019 was a new word for Elmo, too. So, Elmo learned all about gratitude with SZA,\u201d he said.",
      "\"Elmo was feeling really, really happy after his playdate with Miss Rene\u00e9. It was a really beautiful song. She's got a great voice and Elmo hopes she comes back soon.\u201d",
      "As for the secret to a great \u201cSesame Street\u201d song? According to Tony - and Grammy-winning composer, producer and \u201cSesame Street\u201d music director Bill Sherman, its \u201cearworms on earworms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the verse is an earworm, so is the chorus. Mostly in pop music, the chorus is the earworm, and the verses are just a bunch of jumble.\u201d The difference, he explains, is that pop songs are about three and a half minutes long. Children's music is about a minute and a half. \u201cYou only have a very finite amount of time to do what you got to do.\u201d",
      "Usually, writers on the show provide Sherman and his team of songwriters with a script and lyrics detailing the lesson of each episode, as well as the name of the musical guest. Then they get to work, composing music true to the genre and spirit of each artist.",
      "Those musical guests take different levels of involvement, but the result is always awe-inspiring.",
      "Other highlights from this season include Kahan performing a foot-stomping folk song about music and feelings, Joy using jazz improvisation to teach a lesson in taking turns and a country ode to music and friends courtesy of Stapleton.",
      "\u201cChris Stapleton really wanted to write his own song,\u201d says Sherman, and so the pair hopped on a Zoom and wrote a song together, Stapleton with his guitar in tow, ideas flowing. \u201cIt was really one of the most surreal two-hour Zooms that I really ever had in my life.\u201d",
      "Joy took a different approach. \u201cSamara Joy insisted on singing live,\" says Sherman. \u201cIt very rarely happens on \u2018Sesame Street.\u2019 I can only count, like, a few times. So, there was like Stevie Wonder back in the day, which is a classic. And there\u2019s like Billy Joel, there\u2019s John Legend, there\u2019s a couple people that actually sing live. But Samara insisted on it.\u201d",
      "Her reasoning was simple. \"She said, \u2018Well, this whole episode is about improvisation and thinking on your toes. And so, if it\u2019s prerecorded, that\u2019s the opposite of what we\u2019re trying to teach.\u2019\"",
      "If there is a theme that connects all these performances to one another, it's a spirit of connection. At least, that's Elmo's theory: \u201cElmo thinks that music brings people together, you know? And some people who like some things and some people who like other things can kind of come together because they like the same kind of music. And that's kind of cool!\u201d",
      "\u201cSesame Street,\u201d designed by education professionals and child psychologists, is shown in more than 150 countries, has won over 200 Emmys, 11 Grammys, two Peabody Awards and received a Kennedy Center Honor for lifetime artistic achievement, the first time a television program got the award.",
      "There've been no shortage of great musical guests across the show's five decade run. So, who would they like to see pay a visit in the future? \u201cMiss Taylor Swift! Maybe she could revisit her \u2018Red\u2019 era?\u201d chimes in Elmo. That's his favorite of her albums.",
      "\u201cBut also, Elmo would love to sing with Miss Beyonc\u00e9. Destiny's Child was on \u2018Sesame Street,\u2019 so Elmo would love to have her back.\u201d"

He was charged then with theft of a major artwork and witness tampering for his role in the ruby slippers case.",
      "The slippers were stolen in 2005 from the Judy Garland Museum in her hometown of Grand Rapids. Their whereabouts remained a mystery for nearly 13 years until the FBI recovered them in 2018. They fetched a record for movie memorabilia of $32.5 million last month, according to Heritage Auctions.",

      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized",
      "After a rocky few years and the disbanding of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globes have seemingly stabilized. Now the question is: Can they still put on a good show?",
      "The 82nd Golden Globes, beginning Sunday night at 8 p.m. EST, will hope to rekindle some of the frothy comic energy of the days when Ricky Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted. Last year's comeback edition, hosted by Jo Koy, was widely panned, but it delivered where it counted: Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS signed up for five more years.",
      "This time, comedian Nikki Glaser will be emceeing the ceremony from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California. The Globes, now owned by Todd Boehly's Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, will be broadcast live by CBS and available to stream live for subscribers to Paramount+ with Showtime beginning at 8 p.m. Eastern.",
      "While Glaser doesn't have as widely seen contenders as last year, when \u201cOppenheimer\u201d and \u201cBarbie\u201d were the headliners, the show does promise about as much star power as Hollywood can muster. Nominees including Zendaya, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Angelina Jolie, Daniel Craig, Denzel Washington, Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Selena Gomez.",
      "Jacques Audiard's Netflix musical \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d comes in as the lead nominee, with 10 nods, followed by Brady Corbet's postwar epic \u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d with seven, and Edward Berger's papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d with six. Among the top-nominated series are \u201cThe Bear,\u201d \u201cShogun\" and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d",
      "Here are a few things to look for heading into Sunday's Globes:",
      "The best actor in a drama category is a bruiser, with a field of Ralph Fiennes (\"Conclave\"), Adrien Brody (\"The Brutalist\"), Daniel Craig (\"Queer\"), Colman Domingo (\"Sing Sing\"), Sebastian Stan (\"The Apprentice\") and Chalamet, for the Bob Dylan film \u201cA Complete Unknown.\u201d While Fiennes or Brody might take it, a win for Chalamet would be the first major award for the 29-year-old star \u2014 and surely would get the Oscar talk going.",
      "Just days before the Globes, Blake Lively sued \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d director Justin Baldoni and several others tied to the romantic drama, alleging harassment and a coordinated campaign to attack her reputation for coming forward about her treatment on the set. Baldoni, who has denied it, joined in a suit accusing The New York Times for libel in its story on her allegations.",
      "Whether or not any of this gets mentioned on the Beverly Hilton Ballroom stage, it will surely be on the minds of many attendees. Among the nominees for box-office achievement is \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine,\u201d which star and was co-produced by Ryan Reynolds, Lively's husband. Glaser, whose sharply barbed jokes at a roast of Tom Brady helped catapult her to this moment, isn't known for biting her tongue.",
      "\u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d may have be favored over \u201cWicked\u201d for the best comedy or musical award, but Jon M. Chu\u2019s theatrical hit is also in the mix for the Globes\u2019 nascent cinematic box office achievement award. Either, or both, of the leading ladies of \u201dWicked\u201d could also win: Erivo in the leading actress category, and Grande in supporting.",
      "The Globes, taking place about two weeks before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, could get very political if presenters and winners are so inclined to continue what's been a mutually antagonistic relationship between Hollywood and Trump. That may be unlikely, though; so far in Hollywood's awards season, most nominees have tried to stay out of the fray.",
      "That's with a major exception, though, in \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the young Trump drama starring Sebastian Stan and Jeremy Strong. Both were nominated by the Globes. Stan was also nominated a second time for his performance in \u201cA Different Man.\u201d",
      "It's been an unusually uncertain awards season so far in many respects. No one movie has really stepped forward as the leading best picture contender, though several films \u2014 including \u201cConclave,\u201d \u201cAnora,\u201d \u201cWicked,\" \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d \u2014 can all make a decent case. The Globes don't typically do much to sort out the field, but a strong showing from any of the above could add fuel to their Oscar campaign.",

      "\u201cThe opportunities to create together, to do something creative where we're both fulfilled, it's like how rare is that? She's down and she's so talented, so I'm really lucky,\" Baena said.",
      "A representative for Plaza said that in addition to Plaza, Baena is survived by his mother, Barbara Stern, stepfather Roger Stern, father Scott Baena, stepmother Michele Baena, brother Brad Baena and stepsiblings Bianca Gabay and Jed Fluxman."

      "Kelce quickly proved there\u2019s space for another JK in late night \u2014 Kelce disappeared into a portal where he walked out into (a pantsless) Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s office to ask for hosting advice \u2014 and moderated a loose panel of sports topics with guests Charles Barkley, rapper and actor Lil Dicky, and NFL Network analyst Brian Baldinger.",
      "And Kelce said he received real guidance from Kimmel on the art of hosting.",
      "\u201cHe sat me down and really explained some things that he thought would accelerate this process for me,\u201d Kelce said.",
      "Kelce bantered with the guests during commercial breaks and took questions from a few of about 300 fans in the audience. When a fan from New Jersey invited Kelce to his wedding, the retired star quipped, \u201cI don\u2019t go into New Jersey.\u201d",
      "Eagles fan and Penn State student Caleb Tinley learned only two days earlier he was randomly selected for a pair of free tickets and was first in line around noon to get a good seat for the taping. He\u2019s a fan of the \u201c New Heights \u201d podcast Kelce co-hosts with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and figured the TV show was as close to that experience as he could get.",
      "\u201cEver since he had that speech at the Super Bowl, he became a Philly legend,\u201d Tinley said.",
      "The 37-year-old Kelce \u2014 who retired in March after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles \u2014 has watched his profile balloon in retirement. The Super Bowl winner already hosted the podcast but has become a prolific pitchman hawking everything from chicken wings to soup, to laundry detergent to cereal, to hoagies to his own beer company.",
      "Kelce was already omnipresent on television and social media, so what was one more gig to add to his resume?",
      "So \u201cLate Night\u201d was born.",
      "Kelce is in the first year of a multiyear agreement with ESPN and already appears on the network\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Countdown\u201d show. The retired center taking center stage on a late-night staple such as a talk show \u2014 no Letterman, though he did wear his Cleveland Heights letterman's jacket \u2014 seemed a natural extension into his growing entertainment profile.",
      "The show\u2019s title is a homage to \u201cThey Call It Pro Football,\u201d which was NFL Films\u2019 first full-length film in 1967. NFL Films originated in Philadelphia and founders Ed and Steve Sabol are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. It also featured the voice of John Facenda, whose tone was imitated on the show by Kelce and his panel as they narrated modern NFL highlights.",
      "\u201cI knew I wanted NFL Films because I felt like we wanted to make a show that celebrated the NFL landscape,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cNot just from current players and current games, but of past games and past players. Past announcers. NFL fans and the subculture of the NFL. We wanted to create a show that really embraced all of that.\u201d",
      "The Philadelphia-based band Snacktime provided the music. Kylie Kelce, fresh off dethroning Joe Rogan as the No. 1 podcast on the Spotify charts, served as the foul-mouthed sidekick from her perch in \u201cKylie\u2019s Korner.\u201d",
      "Kelce's expletives in the monologue were no momentary brain cramp as he transitioned from locker room talk to cable television. Kelce and his wife peppered their conversations with profanity \u2014 this is late night, after all \u2014 and tried to make the relationship seem as real in the studio as it is at home, where the couple raise three daughters, with a fourth expected this year.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted the language to be real and authentic to me,\u201d Kelce said after the show. \u201cWe overdid it a little bit today to kind of prep the audience on what to expect. I think the F-bombs was the one thing where I was told, we might want to be a little bit cautious there but, listen, we want to give you range to be who you are.\"",
      "The debut one-hour \u201cLate Night\u201d episode was taped Friday in front of a live audience from Philly concert venue Union Transfer. The show aired at 1 a.m. EST on ESPN and will tape the next four Friday nights. The schedule coincides with the last week of the NFL\u2019s regular season and the playoffs.",
      "Comedian Seth Herzog warmed up the crowd and joked the event had a no-phones policy so Kelce wouldn\u2019t smash them like he did in a viral moment at Penn State.",
      "The Philly slant couldn\u2019t be missed \u2014 they filmed a bit where a female fan spewed bites of a hoagie into the mouth of, well, Jason Kelce from the future, and Barkley played to the crowd when he picked the Eagles to win the Super Bowl \u2014 but the real Kelce said he wanted a show that would appeal to fans nationwide.",
      "Smash hit or not, there are no promises from ESPN of anything beyond the limited run.",
      "\u201cWe really just wanted to try something fun to do and I think everybody was on board to experiment and see what happens,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cI do think there's room for this, especially within the football season.\u201d",
      "After Kelce participated in a skit with parents Ed and Donna, celebrated with a fastest beer-chugging winner and shared a cold one at the bar with Eagles great Harold Carmichael, he broke down the show the same way he would as an Eagles player in the postgame locker room.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s game day,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cPlenty of errors, just like a game. Plenty of things to clean up. But just so happy with how it went.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs such as Toronto, Los Angeles and New York \u2014 than in those in Asia, including Hong Kong and Taipei",
      "Twenty years after he was a young, struggling actor in Toronto, Thomas Lo is now the one giving young Asian actors their big breaks. He just had to go to Hong Kong to do it.",
      "The Chinese Canadian has been the creative director of one of the island city's biggest TV broadcasting companies for only a few years, but is already making original English-language content to reach viewers around the world.",
      "\u201cIt was a bit of a full-circle moment for me,\u201d Lo told The Associated Press. \u201cYou see more Asians but you\u2019re still seeing the same Asians on screen, right? We\u2019re looking for more opportunities on a grander scale and it\u2019s not just in front of the camera. It\u2019s behind the camera as well.\u201d",
      "It's vastly different to work as an Asian actor in North American hubs \u2014 Toronto, Los Angeles, New York \u2014 than in those in Asia \u2014 such as Hong Kong or Taipei. Actors in Asia don't as often have to deal with auditioning for stereotypical characters, being the only Asian on a set or getting tokenized. Historically, many Asian American and Canadian actors have even relocated from the West to countries in Asia to find better opportunities in entertainment.",
      "A few film and TV producers on both sides of the Pacific, however, are looking to shake up those dynamics by crisscrossing their show biz ecosystems. The hope is a win-win with fledgling talent in the Asian diaspora gaining global exposure \u2014 and Asia-based productions getting wider audiences. For example the Hulu series \u201cShogun,\u201d which won 18 Emmys, demonstrated a successful collaboration between Japanese and Western cast and crew \u2014 which included Japanese Americans.",
      "At the helm of Hong Kong's Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB), Lo led its first collaboration with an American company \u2014 on an original TV drama with scenes in both English and Cantonese. Two crews on two different continents filmed \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d a series about a Chinese American aspiring music producer in Los Angeles (Nathan Ing) who becomes telepathically connected to a Hong Kong advertising executive (Cantopop singer Jocelyn Chan).",
      "Chan, 30, was born in Hong Kong but spent ages 3-11 in Vancouver, British Columbia. She returned to Hong Kong for her music career partly because of concern about succeeding in North America.",
      "\u201cA lot of people probably had similar sentiments to me where it's more possible if we came back to this home,\u201d Chan said of finding success in the entertainment industry in Asia. \u201cWe all feel like we have two homes.\u201d",
      "Her role in \u201cCross My Mind\u201d is powerful, assertive and far from Western stereotypes of Asian women as meek.",
      "The partnership between Los Angeles-based Wong Fu Productions and TVB started with one side sliding into the other's DMs on Instagram.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be cool if we can kind of tap into their audience of what they built because that\u2019s who we\u2019re trying to speak with,\u201d Lo said, about reaching Asian American viewers.",
      "Wong Fu, which started in 2003, is now a thriving YouTube channel of Asian American-centered skits and other content. Simu Liu was among its then-emerging actors.",
      "\u201cNow we have actors that want to work with us for free and are just like \u2018Put us in whatever,\u2019 knowing that it\u2019s a way to connect with Asian Americans first,\u201d said Wesley Chan, Wong Fu co-founder and creative director. \u201cThen that can also be a way to propel them.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan, no relation to Jocelyn, was intrigued by the challenge of shepherding a story that incorporates Asian and Asian American protagonists. He and his team wrote six episodes of \u201cCross My Mind\u201d in six months to film in 2022.",
      "\u201cWe knew that they wanted to make a story that could kind of show the cultural differences between an American and someone in Hong Kong,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that was really cool because to even know that there is a difference \u2014 or to share that there\u2019s a difference \u2014 I think is a nuance that is not seen very often.\u201d",
      "Meshing work styles was no small feat. Wesley Chan noticed crews in Los Angeles and Hong Kong \u2014 where there are no unions \u2014 worked differently. It in some ways paralleled the bicultural nature of the show itself.",
      "The show premiered in April 2023 on myTV Super, TVB's streaming platform that has 9 million subscribers. It debuted the following December in the U.S. on two new streaming platforms that have since merged into GoldenTV, which focuses on English language content for Asian American viewers.",
      "\u201cThere's two different audiences on both sides of the world, but it\u2019s still content that I think has eyeballs,\u201d said Takashi Cheng, GoldenTV's founder. \u201cThe fact that they need English-language programming tells you that American or English content is not dead. It\u2019s in fact very much attractive in foreign countries.\u201d",
      "GoldenTV has gained thousands of subscribers since launching nearly two years ago, Cheng said. The platform plans to grow with unscripted shows. In September, it premiered entertainment news show \"The Takeaway,\u201d hosted by influencer Michelle Park. Actor Daniel Wu (\"American Born Chinese\") is developing a docuseries on his love of racing.",
      "Wu, 50, rose to fame after moving to Hong Kong. Someone like Wu \u2014 who was born in the San Francisco Bay Area, became a Hong Kong cinema star and then pivoted to Hollywood \u2014 is a \u201crarity,\" Lo said. Before digital audiences, it was difficult to alternate between Asian and American screens, he continued.",
      "\u201cI think we were a breath of fresh air for those actors and talents and artists, when we said that we\u2019re going to be producing English content,\u201d Lo said. \u201cThere is an audience that\u2019s untapped here.\u201d",
      "Wesley Chan said Wong Fu is not ruling out being \u201ca conduit\u201d for more crossover collaborations.",
      "Jocelyn Chan is still maintaining her singing career with hit singles and a solo Hong Kong concert this year. But she says the success of \u201cCross My Mind,\u201d has given her the courage to think about acting beyond Hong Kong. She\u2019s now looking for an agent in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt kind of pushed me to not wait,\u201d said Chan, who is also a sound healer and practitioner. She also thinks there's more space for talent who grew up bicultural. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like an even more niche representation within the wider Asian representation.\u201d"

      "Setting boundaries at work can be tricky",
      "NEW YORK -- When Justin Stewart started his career, he juggled several jobs to make ends meet. He poured himself into his full-time role as a news show production assistant from 3 a.m. until noon. Then he rushed to the airport where he rented cars or to the big box stores where he pulled retail shifts.",
      "Sometimes, he slept in his car between jobs. Then he was hospitalized for exhaustion and a staph infection.",
      "\u201cWhile people around me praised my hustle, I eventually paid the price,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe doctor looked at me and said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what lifestyle you\u2019re living, but you\u2019re too young to be this stressed. You\u2019re going to have to quit something.'\"",
      "So Stewart, now 36, began setting boundaries. He gave up the side jobs, deciding he could survive without extra income. If people from the news show texted him after-hours, he let them know he was off-duty and where else to call.",
      "Setting boundaries at work, and in life, can be tricky. Many people find it difficult to say no, especially to a manager. Some get a sense of satisfaction from being needed or pleasing others.",
      "But learning to turn down a request or invitation is essential for protecting our physical and mental health, experts say. And as with any new skill, drawing boundaries gets easier with practice.",
      "Experts in well-being and organizational behavior, along with other workers, shared strategies for setting limits.",
      "Adding tasks to your calendar may seem counterintuitive if scaling back is the goal, but can provide more control over your time.",
      "Bobby Dutton, the founder of event production company GBM6, uses a technique he calls \u201caggressive calendering.\u201d He schedules the task he\u2019s most likely to procrastinate on, such as handling contracts and invoices, for every Monday at 2 p.m. To keep his calendar from becoming overloaded, he also books time for recurring routine tasks like making coffee, walking the dog and eating lunch.",
      "If you\u2019re unaccustomed to saying no, you can write down what you\u2019re going to say beforehand and rehearse it. Stewart worked on letting colleagues know when his assignment load began feeling too heavy with phrases like \u201cHey, this is a lot for me\" or \"You gave me seven stories, I think I can get four or five done.\u201d",
      "Cara Houser, a workplace engagement coach, says you don\u2019t have to explain yourself when declining a request. You can simply say you\u2019re not available at that time, followed by \u201cThanks for asking, and I hope to have more capacity next time.\u201d",
      "If the recipient of your \u201cno\u201d tries to argue, you can respond, \u201cI hear you feel that way. But for me, this is what I\u2019ve decided to do for that day,\u201d Houser said.",
      "Entrepreneur Amber Krasinski grew up in a working-class environment where saying no to a boss could mean losing a paycheck. As the founder of marketing company IvyHill Strategies, Krasinski worries she'll lose clients if she turns down a project. \u201cNot yet\u201d is her go-to phrase when one more project is too much.",
      "\u201cThat phrase has helped me through a lot of situations,\u201d she said.",
      "It can be tempting to agree immediately when we're asked to chip in. But there may be times when we're better off demurring. When faced with a new work request, take five minutes to assess your workload, energy level and priorities before responding, suggests Israa Nasir, a psychotherapist in New York.",
      "Nasir says a former boss frequently texted work-related questions at 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. \u201cI didn\u2019t say, \u2018Don\u2019t text me,\u2019\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2019Can we check in on Fridays before the weekend? So everything that\u2019s on your mind, you can (tell me) and then I can plan my time accordingly.\u201d",
      "Pay attention to the activities and interactions that leave you feeling drained or overwhelmed, Nasir said. Put those kinds of events on a \u201cNo List.\" The list doesn't mean you decline every time you're asked, but don't say yes right away, she advises.",
      "Mobile devices make it easier to work from anywhere, and harder to draw boundaries. But there are ways to adjust our devices so they're less distracting.",
      "After noticing that she checked email far too frequently on weekends, Nasir starting moving the Gmail app from her iPhone\u2019s homepage to the second page from Friday night to Sunday night.",
      "An email signature is another tool you can use to manage expectations, by publishing working hours or upcoming vacation schedules, said Candice Pokk, a senior consultant in organizational effectiveness at Segal Consulting.",
      "Pokk includes a \u201cWell Being Notice\u201d at the bottom of her emails which reads, \u201cReceiving this email outside normal working hours? Managing a work-life balance is unique for everyone. I have sent this email at a time that works for me. Please respond at a time that works for you.\u201d",
      "With the popularity of online meeting software, it's easy for others to overload your calendar with invitations. Accepting every one can leave little time for other work.",
      "Janine Pelosi, CEO of Oslo-based video technology company Neat, thinks workers should be able to leave a meeting that's not relevant to them, if it's an environment where that's accepted.",
      "If you're unsure it's worthwhile to attend, you can request an agenda in advance, or ask what is the desired outcome, she said.",
      "Publisher Lori Perkins, 65, was working 12 to 16 hours daily when a cancer diagnosis halted her routine. During chemotherapy, she could only muster up enough energy to put in four hours a day, and even then felt like she was working \u201cin a vat of molasses.\u201d",

      "She practices saying \u201cno\u201d in her head and in her journal, where she also chronicles what happened after she said it. She's gained time to visit museums, friends and the theater.",

      "An annual U.S. government report on \u201cnotorious markets\u201d known for counterfeiting and other violations of intellectual property says that nearly all 35,000 online pharmacies around the world are being run illegally",
      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "Fewer than 1 in 1,000 U.S. adolescents with commercial insurance received gender-affirming medications during a recent five-year period",
      "As U.S. lawmakers debate issues around health care for transgender youth, it\u2019s been difficult to determine the number of young people receiving gender-affirming medications, leaving room for exaggerated and false claims.",
      "Now, a medical journal has published the most reliable estimate yet and the numbers are low, reflecting more clearly on medical practices now being weighed by the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Fewer than 1 in 1,000 U.S. adolescents with commercial insurance received gender-affirming medications \u2014 puberty blockers or hormones \u2014 during a recent five-year period, according to the study released Monday.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and most of those states face lawsuits. A decision by the Supreme Court in a Tennessee case is expected later this year. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "\u201cWe are not seeing inappropriate use of this sort of care,\" said lead author Landon Hughes, a Harvard University public health researcher. \u201cAnd it\u2019s certainly not happening at the rate at which people often think it is.\u201d",
      "The researchers analyzed a large insurance claims database covering more than 5 million patients ages 8 to 17.",
      "Only 926 adolescents with a gender-related diagnosis received puberty blockers from 2018 through 2022. During that time, 1,927 received hormones. The findings, published in JAMA Pediatrics, suggest that fewer than 0.1% of all youth in the database received these medications.",
      "The researchers found that no patients under age 12 were prescribed hormones, an indication that doctors are appropriately cautious about when to start such treatments, Hughes said.",
      "\u201cI hope that our paper cools heads on this issue and ensures that the public is getting a true sense of the number of people who are accessing this care,\u201d he said.",
      "The database included insurance plans in all 50 states, but did not include youth covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for low-income people.",
      "The study did not look at surgeries among transgender adolescents. Other researchers have found those procedures are extremely rare among young people.",

      "Indonesia\u2019s new government has begun an ambitious project to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia's new government started an ambitious project on Monday to fight malnutrition by feeding nearly 90 million children and pregnant women that is expected to cost $28 billion through 2029, although critics question whether the program is affordable.",
      "The Free Nutritious Meal program delivers on a campaign promise by President Prabowo Subianto, who was elected last year to lead the nation, which has more than 282 million people and Southeast Asia's largest economy. He said the program aims to fight the stunting of growth that afflicts 21.5% of Indonesian children younger than 5 and would raise the income of farmers.",
      "Subianto has pledged to accelerate GDP growth to 8% from 5% now.",
      "In his inauguration speech in October, Subianto said many children are malnourished. His promise to provide free school lunches and milk to 83 million students at more than 400,000 schools is part of a longer-term strategy to develop the nation\u2019s human resources to achieve a \u201cGolden Indonesia\u201d generation by 2045.",
      "\u201cToo many of our brothers and sisters are below the poverty line, too many of our children go to school without breakfast and do not have clothes for school,\u201d Subianto said.",
      "Subianto\u2019s signature program could cost upward of 450 trillion rupiah ($28 billion) by the end of his term in 2029. He said his team has made the calculations to run such a program, and \u201cWe are capable.\u201d",
      "The government's target is to reach an initial 19.5 million schoolchildren and pregnant women in 2025 with a budget of 71 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion) so as to keep the annual deficit under a legislated ceiling of 3% of GDP, said Dadan Hindayana, the head of the newly formed National Nutrition Agency.",
      "Hindayana said the money would buy an estimated 6.7 million tons of rice, 1.2 million tons of chicken, 500,000 tons of beef, 1 million tons of fish, vegetable and fruit, and 4 million kiloliters of milk.",
      "Nearly 2,000 cooperatives will be involved in the free meals program by providing eggs, vegetables, rice, fish, meat, milk and other food, Cooperative Minister Budi Arie Setiadi said.",
      "On Monday, a truck carrying food arrived at SD Cilangkap 08, a primary school in the Jakarta satellite city of Depok. The 740 students were provided rice, stir-fried vegetables, tempeh, stir-fried chicken and oranges.",
      "\u201cWe will send a team to each school to facilitate the meal distribution to students every day,\u201d Hindayana said, adding that the program will provide one meal per day for each student from early childhood education to senior high school, covering a third of the daily caloric needs for children, with the government providing the meals at no cost to recipients.",
      "But the program has drawn criticism from investors and analysts over the scale of its logistics, the burden on state finances and the economy, and its relation to the interests of industrial lobby groups.",
      "Nailul Huda, a researcher at the Center of Economic and Law Studies, said Indonesia\u2019s state finances are not strong enough to support the program and this will lead to additional national debt.",
      "\u201cThe burden on our state budget is too heavy if it is forced to reach 100% of the target recipients, and it will be difficult for Prabowo\u2019s government to achieve the economic growth target of 8%,\u201d Huda said.",
      "He warned it could also worsen the external balance of payments for the country, which is already a major importer of rice, wheat, soybeans, beef and dairy products.",
      "Reni Suwarso, the director of Institute for Democracy, Security and Strategic Studies, said the decline in the stunting rate in Indonesia was far from the target of a 14% reduction in 2024.",
      "According to the 2023 Indonesian Health Survey, the national stunting prevalence was 21.5%, down around 0.8% from the previous year. The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund estimated that one in 12 Indonesian children younger than 5 suffers from low weight while one in five is shorter than normal. Both conditions are caused by malnourishment.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s so bad and must be solved,\u201d Suwarso said. \u201cChild malnourishment has severe consequences, threatening the health and long-term development of infants and young children throughout this nation.\u201d",
      "___",
      "This story corrects that the expected cost of the program is $28 billion instead of $28 million and explains that it is through 2029.",

      "Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe",
      "HOUSTON -- HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Winter weather brings various hazards that people have to contend with to keep warm and safe.",
      "These dangers can include carbon monoxide poisoning, hypothermia and frozen pipes that can burst and make homes unlivable.",
      "Public safety officials and experts say there are multiple ways people can prepare themselves to avoid these winter weather hazards and keep themselves safe.",
      "The hazards are on the radar this week because millions of people in the United States are set to be hit with moderate to heavy snow from Kansas City to Washington. Cold conditions are also gripping the East Coast.",
      "Officials say that during a winter storm, people should stay indoors. But home heating systems running for hours can increase the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning as the deadly fumes can be produced by furnaces, stoves and heaters, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Carbon monoxide can also be created when people use portable generators or run cars in their garages to stay warm or charge their phones.",
      "Dr. Alex Harding, assistant professor of emergency medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said that because carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, people won\u2019t necessarily be aware of it.",
      "\u201cThe symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning can be really insidious. They can sneak up on patients and can range from just developing a headache or maybe a little bit of nausea to all the way to losing consciousness and seizures,\u201d he said.",
      "The cold weather hitting much of the East Coast has the ability to be dangerous or deadly because of unsafe exposure to elements. This week's winter storms are tracking to the south, and cold air will likely be present as far south as Georgia, said Jon Palmer, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Gray, Maine.",
      "The cold temperatures could sneak up on people in parts of the country that have largely experienced a mild winter so far.",
      "\u201cReally cold temperatures and winds can make temperatures feel a lot colder, and the result of that could be cold air that could eventually lead to frostbite at a much faster rate or hypothermia at a much faster rate than normal,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Prolonged exposure to frigid temperatures can put people at risk to hypothermia, a condition that happens when one\u2019s body loses heat faster than it can produce it.",
      "\u201cHypothermia is definitely one of the bigger concerns, especially if we do have any kind of certainty in like power grids or electricity failing,\u201d Harding said.",
      "The danger of hypothermia is greater for someone who is outside, exposed to wind gusts and isn\u2019t wearing appropriate clothing or has clothing that gets wet.",
      "\u201cIf they have a safe place that\u2019s warm, where they can hunker down, where they have water and food and all those kind of necessities \u2026 then that\u2019s going to limit their exposure to those risks,\u201d Harding said.",
      "But vulnerable populations like people with disabilities or homeless individuals can have problems finding a warm and safe place to stay.",
      "Frozen pipes in a home during severe winter weather is a particular problem in parts of the South because such equipment is often located outside structures. But other parts of the country also have to deal with this problem.",
      "Jose Parra, a master plumber with Abacus Plumbing, Air Conditioning & Electrical in Houston, advises people to insulate any pipes that are exposed to the outside, turn off and drain sprinkler systems and let faucets inside a home drip during freezing temperatures so water can run through the pipes and protect them.",
      "\u201cA lot of what we\u2019re fixing, I would say 80% to 90%, could have been prevented with just a little bit of work ahead of time,\u201d Parra said.",
      "Experts acknowledge that cold weather can be hard for electric vehicles, but they say with some planning and a little adjustment, owners should be able to travel pretty much as normal.",
      "Inside EV batteries, lithium ions flow through a liquid electrolyte, producing electricity. But they travel more slowly through the electrolyte when it gets cold and don\u2019t release as much energy. That cuts into the range and can deplete a battery faster.",
      "In the short run, automakers are likely to come up with better ways to protect battery life and warm them for charging, Neil Dasgupta, associate professor of mechanical and materials science engineering at the University of Michigan, told The Associated Press earlier this year. And there are new battery chemistries in development that are more resilient in cold weather.",

But in Oregon and elsewhere in the country, progressive lawmakers' attempts to expand abortion access sometimes clash with rural constituencies.",
      "",
      "Oregon is considered one of the most protective states in the country when it comes to abortion. There are no legal limits on when someone can receive an abortion in the state, and the service is covered by its Medicaid system. Still, efforts to expand access in the rural, largely conservative areas that cover most of the state have encountered resistance and incredulity.",
      "",
      "It's a divide that has played out in elections in such states as Nevada, where voters passed a ballot measure in November that seeks to codify abortion protections in the state constitution. Residents in several rural counties opposed the measure.",
      "",
      "In Oregon, during the months just before the Baker City closure was announced, Democratic state lawmakers were focused on a proposed pilot program that would launch two mobile reproductive healthcare clinics in rural areas. The bill specified that the van-based clinics would include abortion services.",
      "",
      "State Rep. Christine Goodwin, a Republican from a southwestern Oregon district, called the proposal the \"latest example\" of urban legislators telling rural leaders what their communities need.",
      "",
      "The mobile health clinic pilot was eventually removed from the bill that was under discussion. That means no new abortion options in Oregon's Baker County  --  and no new state-funded maternity care either.",
      "",
      "\"I think if you expanded rural access in this community to abortions before you extended access to maternal healthcare, you would have an uprising on your hands,\" said Paige Witham, 27, a member of the Baker County healthcare steering committee and the mother of two children, including an infant born in October.",
      "",
      "A study published in JAMA in early December that examined nearly 5,000 acute care hospitals found that by 2022, 52% of rural hospitals lacked obstetrics care after more than a decade of unit closures. The health implications of those closures for young women, the population most likely to need pregnancy care, and their babies can be significant. Research has shown that added distance between a patient and obstetric care increases the likelihood the baby will be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit, or NICU.",
      "",
      "Witham said that while she does not support abortion, she believes the government should not \"legislate it away completely.\" She said that unless the government provides far more support for young families, like free child care and better mental healthcare, abortion should remain legal.",
      "",
      "Conversations with a liberal school board member, a moderate owner of a timber company, members of Baker City's Republican Party chapter, a local doula, several pregnant women, and the director of the Baker County Health Department  --  many of whom were not rigidly opposed to abortion  --  all turned up the same answer: No mobile clinics offering abortions here, please.",
      "",
      "Kelle Osborn, RN, a nurse supervisor for the Baker County Health Department, loved the idea of a mobile clinic that would provide education and birth control services to people in outlying areas. She was less thrilled about including abortion services in a clinic on wheels.",
      "",
      "\"It's not something that should just be handed out from a mobile van,\" she said of abortion services. She said people in her conservative rural county would probably avoid using the clinics for anything if they were understood to provide abortion services.",

More than two-thirds of people in \"maternity care deserts\"  --  all of which are in rural counties  --  must drive more than a half-hour to get obstetric care, according to a 2024 March of Dimes report. For people in the Southern states where lawmakers installed abortion bans, abortion care can be up to 700 miles away, according to a data analysis by Axios.",
      "",
      "Nathan Defrees, MD, grew up in Baker City and has practiced medicine here since 2017. He works for a family medicine clinic. If a patient asks about abortion, he provides information about where and how one can be obtained, but he doesn't offer abortions himself.",

      "He also pointed to the small number of patients requesting the service locally. Just six people living in Baker County had an abortion in 2023, according to data from the Oregon Department of Public Health. Meanwhile, 125 residents had a baby that year.",
      "",
      "A doctor with obstetric training living in another rural part of the state has chosen to quietly provide early-stage abortions when asked. The doctor, concerned for their family's safety in the small, conservative town where they live, asked not to be identified.",
      "",
      "The idea that better access to abortion is not needed in rural areas seems naive, the doctor said. People most in need of abortion often don't have access to any medical service not already available in town, the doctor pointed out. The first patient the doctor provided an abortion for at the clinic was a meth user with no resources to travel or to manage an at-home medication abortion.",

      "Flu is taking off in the U.S., with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of flu-like illness last week",
      "The holidays came with a side of flu for many Americans, with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of illness last week, according to the latest government health data.",
      "\u201cA lot of flu out there,\u201d said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Carrie Reed.",
      "Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flu-like symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of cold-like symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly.",
      "The most recent CDC hospitalization data and other indicators show that the flu virus is trending higher than the other germs, Reed said. Several seasonal flu strains are driving cases, with no dominant one, she added.",
      "Pediatric hospitals have been busy since November with RSV, but \u201cinfluenza has now joined the party,\u201d said Dr. Jason Newland, an infectious diseases specialist at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.",
      "\u201cNow we\u2019re really starting to roll,\u201d he added. \u201dOur hospitals are busy.\u201d",
      "One indicator of flu activity is the percentage of doctor\u2019s office visits driven by flu-like symptoms. That level last week was about equal to the peak of last winter\u2019s respiratory virus season \u2014 which occurred at the same time of year. Reed noted that most people avoid medical appointments over the holidays if they can help it, so the data in late December might be skewed by people who came down with sudden illnesses.",
      "Last week's flu activity was particularly intense in the South, Southwest and western U.S. The states reporting lesser amounts of suffering were mostly in the northern Great Plains and in New England.",
      "So far this season, the CDC estimates, there have been at least 5.3 million flu illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations, and 2,700 deaths \u2014 including at least 11 children.",
      "It\u2019s not clear if this winter respiratory virus season will be any worse than others. So far it seems relatively typical, at least for kids, Newland said.",
      "U.S. health officials recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccination, and they say it\u2019s not too late to get a shot.",
      "You should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth because germs can spread that way, health officials say. You should also wash your hands with soap and water, clean frequently touched surfaces and avoid close contact with people who are sick.",
      "The CDC also has been keeping its eye on a rise of illnesses from norovirus, a nasty stomach bug, with 91 outbreaks reported early in December.",
      "Investigators also have been closely watching another kind of influenza virus, the Type A H5N1 version of bird flu. The CDC says 66 human U.S. cases of that were reported last year, but none of them in the last week.",
      "The cases are \u201cfairly sporadic\u201d and the overall risk to the public remains low, Reed said. Almost all have been traced to direct contact with infected animals, with no proof of spread between people.",

      "Baxter's North Cove, North Carolina, facility provided about 60% of the IV solutions used across the U.S. as well as several other fluids vital to patient care, noted Nancy Foster, vice president of quality and safety policy at the American Hospital Association (AHA). \"While remarkable progress has been made in reactivating Baxter's plant operations, hospitals are still receiving less than their normal required amounts of these fluids.\"",
      "While the impact of the supply shortage varies across the country, \"and the significance of the impact on a particular hospital depends on the methods they have been using to conserve fluids, whether Baxter was their sole supplier, the patient population they serve, and other factors,\" Foster said, \"we know some hospitals are still restricting access to elective surgeries, and most are using alternative strategies for hydrating patients when possible and utilizing smaller bags of fluids when appropriate.\"",
      "Though hospitals have long endured shortages of a variety of medical supplies and drugs, the shortage of IV fluids has been different, Foster told MedPage Today.",
      "\"These fluids are widely used as part of treatment for a multitude of illnesses or injuries,\" Foster said in an email. \"A majority of hospitalized patients receive drugs through IV infusions at least at some point during their hospital stay.\"",
      "The shortage was also unique because both the FDA and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response \"acted almost immediately after the hurricane damage to help expedite Baxter's ability to get its plant operational again,\" she said. \"Restoration of the flow of these fluids is faster than it would have been, even if it is not as fast as we would like given that hospitals are adamant about providing the best possible care for patients, and that requires that we have the fluids our patients need.\"",
      "Baxter pointed MedPage Today to updates it has continued to issue on its progress at the North Cove manufacturing site.",
      "In a Dec. 19 update, the company noted that it has restarted eight of the 10 manufacturing lines at the site, representing approximately 85% of total pre-hurricane capacity.\"While the recently restarted lines will require time to ramp up, some of the earlier lines to restart are operating near pre-hurricane levels,\" the company noted. \"We currently expect to be producing at pre-hurricane levels across the plant early in the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "While it will \"take some time for product to flow through the distribution channels,\" Baxter said that \"we currently expect that North Cove's recovery to full production will translate to removal of allocations for the related product groups during the first quarter of 2025.\"",
      "Previously, in a Dec. 5 update, the company noted initial resumption of all of its 3L irrigation manufacturing lines and peritoneal dialysis solutions manufacturing lines. Baxter also previously detailed that the IV solutions manufacturing lines restarted in November produce much of the site's pre-hurricane capacity of 1-liter IV solutions, \"the most commonly used size by hospitals and clinics.\"",
      "\"We anticipate [the shortage] will continue well into January,\" Foster added, \"but are hopeful that we will continue to see improvement along the way such that the magnitude of the problem will diminish week by week as more of Baxter's production lines are operational and the FDA verifies that the fluids they produce are safe for use.\""

      "The Jan. 1 shooting took place in the western town of Cetinje after a bar brawl. A 45-year-old local man killed 12 people in several locations before killing himself. The victims included two children. Four people were wounded, including Dejan Kokotovic, born in 1985, who died on Thursday.",
      "The rampage was the second such mass shooting in less than three years in Cetinje. In August 2022, a man killed 10 people before a passerby gunned him down.",
      "The shootings have fueled concerns about the level of violence in Montenegrin society, which is politically divided.",
      "The Montenegrin government has pledged to adopt measures to curb the widespread illegal possession of weapons in the Balkan country of some 620,000 people.",
      "The Adriatic Sea nation has a deeply-rooted gun culture. State television broadcaster RTCG reported that Montenegro is sixth in the world when it comes to the number of illegal weapons per capita.",
      "Several thousand people have rallied to demand resignations of top security officials over the mass shootings. They have accused the authorities of doing nothing to boost security in between the two shootings in Cetinje.",

      "PARIS -- Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy vigorously denounced a \u201cplot\u201d he said was staged by \u201cliars and crooks\u201d on Thursday at a Paris trial over the alleged illegal financing of his 2007 presidential campaign by the Libyan government led by former leader Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "In his first remarks since the trial started on Monday, Sarkozy, 69, said \"You will never find one Libyan euro, one Libyan cent in my campaign.\u201d",
      "The former French president, who served from 2007 to 2012, is facing charges of passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, concealment of embezzlement of public funds and criminal association, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.",
      "The trial is scheduled to run until April 10, with a verdict expected at a later date.",
      "Sarkozy, a lawyer by training, argued \u201cgroups of liars and crooks\u201d including the \u201cGadhafi clan\" have fed investigators with allegations. Speaking nervously with a strong voice and waving his arms, Sarkozy denounced \u201ca plot.\u201d",
      "The case emerged in March 2011, when a Libyan news agency reported that the Gadhafi government had financed Sarkozy\u2019s 2007 campaign.",
      "\"Revelations (from Libya) about the alleged financing of my campaign came a few hours after my statement that \u2018Gadhafi must go,\u2019 Sarkozy said.",
      "Sarkozy was one of the first Western leaders to push for a military intervention in Libya in 2011, when Arab Spring pro-democracy protests swept the Arab world. Gadhafi was killed by opposition fighters in October that same year, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.",
      "\u201cWhat credibility can be given to such statements marked by the seal of vengeance?\u201d Sarkozy asked.",
      "He also said that a key document said to be a note from the Libyan secret services, mentioning Gadhafi\u2019s agreement to provide Sarkozy\u2019s campaign 50 million euros in financing, was fake.",
      "French investigative magistrates said in 2016 the document has all the characteristics of authenticity, although there is no definitive evidence that such a transaction took place.",
      "\u201cI want you to feel the indignation, sincerity and anger,\u201d Sarkozy told the court. \u201cThere is no corruption money because there was no corruption of the (presidential) candidate.\u201d",
      "The trial involves 11 other defendants, including three former ministers. Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, accused of having played the role of intermediary, has fled in Lebanon and did not appear at the Paris court.",
      "Sarkozy has been convicted in two other scandals, but the Libyan case appears to be the one most likely to significantly affect his legacy.",
      "France\u2019s highest court, the Court of Cassation, last month upheld a conviction against Sarkozy of corruption and influence peddling while he was head of state. He was sentenced to one year under house arrest with an electronic bracelet. The case was revealed as investigative judges were listening to wiretapped phone conversations during the Libya inquiry.",
      "In February last year, an appeals court in Paris found Sarkozy guilty of illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 reelection bid."

      "Police are out in force in the streets of Venezuela\u2019s capital as the opposition calls for major anti-government protests",
      "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Police were out in force in Venezuela 's capital Thursday ahead of what the opposition hoped would be major protests against Friday's swearing-in of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro for a third term following a disputed election.",
      "Protests remained limited as of Thursday morning and the usually busy streets of Caracas were relatively quiet. The scant presence of workers and near-absence of students on sidewalks, subway stations and plazas contrasted with the increasing number of heavily armed state security forces that have been deployed across the country since New Year\u2019s Day.",
      "In the late morning, a handful of opposition demonstrators began walking into the street in one part of the city and others who were on the sidewalk, hesitantly at first, joined them. Together, they began chanting \u201cFreedom! Freedom!\u201d",
      "Empanada vendor Miguel Contreras said he had seen fewer customers than usual Thursday as National Guard soldiers carrying riot shields zoomed by on motorcycles. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s fewer people,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s fear.\u201d",
      "The government has carried out mass arrests and other repressive measures following earlier protests that erupted following the July 28 presidential election.",
      "The ruling party-controlled National Assembly is scheduled to swear in Maduro to another six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the election. Opposition stalwart Maria Corina Machado has called on supporters to demonstrate across Venezuela to try to force him out of office.",
      "The government has responded to Machado\u2019s call by blocking streets, setting stages with loud music in and around areas where her supporters were expected to gather and deploying pro-government armed groups, known in Venezuela as \u201ccolectivos.\u201d",
      "Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council, stacked with ruling party loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the election. But unlike in previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts to back the announced result.",
      "The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from more than 80% of electronic voting machines, posted them online and said they showed its candidate, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez, had won with twice as many votes as Maduro. The U.S.-based Carter Center, invited by Maduro\u2019s government to observe the election, has said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate."

      "LONDON -- Europe\u2019s security \u201cis on a knife-edge\u201d and President-elect Donald Trump is right to say NATO member nations must increase military spending, Britain\u2019s top diplomat said Thursday.",
      "Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that \u201cthe post-Cold War peace is well and truly over.\u201d",
      "\u201cDonald Trump and JD Vance are simply right when they say that Europe needs to do more to defend its own continent. It\u2019s myopia to pretend otherwise with Russia on the march,\u201d Lammy said during a speech in London setting out the center-left Labour government\u2019s approach to foreign policy, which he termed \u201cprogressive realism.\u201d",
      "Lammy said people often ask him when world affairs will get back to normal, and \"my answer is that they will not. Europe\u2019s future security is on a knife edge.\u201d",
      "Trump has for years expressed skepticism about NATO, openly questioning the value of the alliance that has defined American foreign policy for decades and threatening not to defend members that fail to meet defense-spending goals.",
      "This week Trump said NATO countries should spend at least 5% of their GDPs on defense, up from the current 2% target. He also said he would not rule out the use of military force to seize control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark.",
      "Britain spends 2.3% of GDP on defense and says it will increase it to 2.5%.",
      "Lammy said that while Trump\u2019s unpredictability and \u201cintensity of rhetoric\u201d were part of his signature style, \u201cwe can be guided not entirely by the rhetoric and the language, but by (his) actions as president.\u201d",

      "\u201cAnd it turns out it wasn\u2019t at risk. It\u2019s emboldened today, with more members, higher spending on defense,\" Lammy said.",
      "Lammy has spoken of his friendship with Vance, the incoming vice president, and has been at the forefront of British government efforts to forge good relations with Trump\u2019s inner circle.",
      "Those have been undermined by Trump ally Elon Musk, who has sent a torrent of incendiary tweets in recent days attacking Prime Minister Keir Starmer and demanding he be replaced and imprisoned.",
      "Lammy said he had \u201creal concerns about some of what I\u2019ve seen\u201d from Musk. But he said British officials have not asked Trump or members of his incoming administration to rein in the X and Tesla CEO.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not aware that Elon Musk has come up\" in discussions with the Trump team, he said, noting that Musk's role in the administration as an efficiency czar is focused on domestic issues."

      "Iran is reeling from a cratering economy and stinging military setbacks across its sphere of influence in the Middle East",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran is reeling from a cratering economy and stinging military setbacks across its sphere of influence in the Middle East. Its bad times are likely to get worse once President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House with his policy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Iran.",
      "Facing difficulties at home and abroad, Iran last week began an unusual two-month-long military drill. It includes testing air defenses near a key nuclear facility and preparing for exercises in waterways vital to the global oil trade.",
      "The military flexing seems aimed at projecting strength, but doubts about its power are high after the past year's setbacks.",
      "The December overthrow of Syrian President Bashar Assad, who Iran supported for years with money and troops, was a major blow to its self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d across the region. The \u201caxis\u201d had already been hollowed out by Israel\u2019s punishing offensives last year against two militant groups backed by Iran \u2013 Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel also attacked Iran directly on two occasions.",
      "An Iranian Revolutionary Guard general based in Syria offered a blunt assessment this week. \u201cI do not see it as a matter of pride that we lost Syria,\u201d Gen. Behrouz Esbati said, according to an audio recording of a speech he gave that was leaked to the media. \u201cWe lost. We badly lost. We blew it.\u201d",
      "At home, Iran\u2019s economy is in tatters.",
      "The U.S. and its allies have maintained stiff sanctions to deter it from developing nuclear weapons \u2014 and Iran's recent efforts to get them lifted through diplomacy have fallen flat. Pollution chokes the skies in the capital, Tehran, as power plants burn dirty fuel in their struggle to avoid outages during winter. And families are struggling to make ends meet as the Iranian currency, the rial, falls to record lows against the U.S. dollar.",
      "As these burdens rise, so does the likelihood of political protests, which have ignited nationwide in recent years over women's rights and the weak economy.",
      "How Trump chooses to engage with Iran remains to be seen. But on Tuesday he left open the possibility of the U.S. conducting preemptive airstrikes on nuclear sites where Iran is closer than ever to enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a military strategy,\u201d Trump told journalists at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida during a wide-ranging news conference. \u201cI\u2019m not answering questions on military strategy.\u201d",
      "Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, yet officials there increasingly suggest Tehran could pursue an atomic bomb.",
      "It's not just Trump or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a longtime foe of Tehran, that paint Iran's nuclear program as a major threat. French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking Monday to French ambassadors in Paris, described Iran as \u201cthe main strategic and security challenge for France, the Europeans, the entire region and well beyond.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe acceleration of its nuclear program is bringing us very close to the breaking point,\u201d Macron said. \u201cIts ballistic program threatens European soil and our interests.\"",
      "While Europe had previously been seen as more conciliatory toward Iran, its attitude has hardened. That's likely because of what Macron described as Tehran's \u201cassertive and fully identified military support\u201d of Russia since it's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "France, as well as Germany and the United Kingdom, had been part of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Under that deal, Iran limited its enrichment of uranium and drastically reduced its stockpile in exchange for the lifting of crushing, United Nations-backed economic sanctions. Trump unilaterally withdrew America from the accord in 2018, and with those U.N. sanctions lifted, it provided cover for China's to purchase oil from Iran.",
      "But now France, Germany and the United Kingdom call Tehran's advances in its atomic program a \u201dnuclear escalation\" that needs to be addressed. That raises the possibility of Western nations pushing for what's called a \u201csnapback\u201d of those U.N. sanctions on Iran, which could be catastrophic for the Iranian economy. That \u201csnapback\u201d power expires in October.",
      "On Wednesday, Iran released a visiting Italian journalist, Cecilia Sala, after detaining her for three weeks \u2014 even though she had received the government's approval to report from there.",
      "Sala's arrest came days after Italian authorities arrested an Iranian engineer accused by the U.S. of supplying drone technology used in a January 2024 attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three American troops. The engineer remains in Italian custody.",
      "The length of the military drills started by Iran's armed forces and its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard may be unusual, but their intended message to the U.S. and Israel \u2014 and to its domestic audience \u2014 is not. Iran is trying to show itself as capable of defending against any possible attack.",
      "On Tuesday, Iran held air-defense drills around its underground nuclear enrichment facility in the city of Natanz. It claimed it could intercept a so-called \u201cbunker buster\u201d bomb designed to destroy such sites.",
      "However, the drill did not involve any of its four advanced S-300 Russian air defense systems, which Israel targeted in its strikes on Iran. At least two are believed to have been damaged, and Israeli officials claim all have been taken out.",
      "\u201cSome of the U.S. and Israeli reservations about using force to address Iran\u2019s nuclear program have dissipated,\u201d wrote Kenneth Katzman, a longtime Iran analyst for the U.S. government who is now at the New York-based Soufan Center. \u201cIt appears likely that, at the very least, the Trump administration would not assertively dissuade Israel from striking Iranian facilities, even if the United States might decline to join the assault.\u201d",
      "There are other ways Iran could respond. This weekend, naval forces plan exercises in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. Iran for years has threatened to close the strait \u2014 a narrow lane through which a fifth of global oil supplies are transported \u2014 and it has targeted oil tankers and other ships in those waters since 2019.",
      "\u201cHarassment and seizures are likely to remain the main tools of Iranian counteraction,\u201d the private maritime security firm Ambrey warned Thursday.",
      "Its allies may not be much help, though. The tempo of attacks on shipping lanes by Yemen's Houthi rebels, long armed by Iran, have slowed. And Iran has growing reservations about the reliability of Russia.",
      "In the recording of the speech by the Iranian general, Esbati, he alleges that Russia \u201cturned off all radars\u201d in Syria to allow an Israeli airstrike that hit a Guard intelligence center.",
      "Esbati also said Iranian missiles \u201cdon't have so much of an impact\u201d and that the U.S. would retaliate against any attack targeting its bases in the region.",
      "\u201cFor the time being and in this situation, dragging the region into a military operation does not agree (with the) interest of the resistance,\u201d he says.",

      "BANGKOK -- An airstrike by Myanmar\u2019s army on a village under the control of an armed ethnic minority group killed about 40 people and injured at least 20 others, officials of the group and a local charity said Thursday. They said hundreds of houses burned in a fire triggered by the bombing.",
      "The attack occurred Wednesday in Kyauk Ni Maw village on Ramree island, an area controlled by the ethnic Arakan Army in western Rakhine state, they said. The military has not announced any attack in the area.",
      "The situation in the village could not be independently confirmed, with access to the internet and cellphone service in the area mostly cut off.",
      "Myanmar is wracked by violence that began when the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021. After the army used lethal force to suppress peaceful demonstrations, many opponents of military rule took up arms and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict.",
      "Khaing Thukha, a spokesperson for the Arakan Army, told The Associated Press that a jet fighter bombed the village on Wednesday afternoon, killing 40 civilians and injuring more than 20 others.",
      "\u201cAll the dead were civilians. Among the dead and injured are women and children,\u201d Khaing Thukha said. A fire started by the airstrike spread through the village, destroying more than 500 houses, Khaing Thukha added.",
      "It was unclear why the village was targeted. The leader of a local charity group and independent media also reported the airstrike and casualties.",
      "The military government has stepped up airstrikes over the past three years on armed pro-democracy groups collectively known as the People\u2019s Defense Force and on armed ethnic minority groups that have been fighting for decades for greater autonomy. The two groups sometimes carry out joint operations against the army.",
      "Ramree, 340 kilometers (210 miles) northwest of Yangon, the country\u2019s largest city, was captured by the Arakan Army in March last year.",

It is also a member of an alliance of armed ethnic groups that recently gained strategic territory in the country\u2019s northeast on the border with China.",
      "It began its offensive in Rakhine in November 2023 and has now gained control of a strategically important regional army headquarters and 14 of Rakhine\u2019s 17 townships, leaving only the state\u2019s capital, Sittwe, and two important townships near Ramree still in military government hands.",
      "A leader of the charity group, which has been assisting residents of the village, told AP on Thursday that at least 41 people were killed and 50 others were injured in the airstrike, which targeted the village\u2019s market.",
      "The leader, who was away from the town at the time of the airstrike, spoke on condition of anonymity because of security concerns. He said he received the information from members of his group who were in the village and were facing a shortage of medicine to treat the injured people.",

      "\u201cSpaceX allows very delicate information to be communicated securely on a diplomatic and military level,\u201d Meloni told Thursday\u2019s press conference. \u201cRegarding the method, I can say that these are discussions that the government has with many private companies.\u201d",
      "Meloni reiterated that the government is still in an \u201cinvestigative\u201d phase and no contracts have been signed. \u201cThe issue is that there are no public alternatives for these technologies, obviously it\u2019s a question of placing data protection in the hands of a private entity.

      "\u201cIs the problem related to private investments or to the political ideas of the investors?\u201d she asked the press conference\u2019s audience.",

      "Analysts say such rhetoric could embolden America\u2019s enemies by suggesting the U.S. is now OK with countries using force to redraw borders at a time when Russia is pressing forward with its invasion of Ukraine and China is threatening Taiwan, which it claims as its own territory.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve come such a long way that it would honestly be crazy to drop the ball now and not keep building on the defense coalitions we\u2019ve created,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cNo matter what\u2019s going on in the world, everyone wants to feel sure that their country will not just be erased of the map.\u201d",

      "Zelenskyy called the Kursk offensive \u201cone of our biggest wins\u201d that has cost Russia and North Korea, which sent soldiers to help Russia in Kursk, thousands of troops. Zelenskyy said the offensive resulted in North Korea suffering 4,000 casualties, but U.S. estimates put the number lower at about 1,200.",

      "\u201cIf Putin swallows Ukraine, his appetite will only grow,\u201d Austin told the approximately 50 member nations who have been meeting over the last three years to coordinate weapons and military support for Ukraine. \u201cIf autocrats conclude that democracies will lose their nerve, surrender their interests, and forget their principles, we will only see more land grabs. If tyrants learn that aggression pays, we will only invite even more aggression, chaos, and war.\u201d",

      "In the months since Trump's victory, Europe has grappled with what that change will mean in terms of their fight to keep Russia from further advancing, and whether the post-World War II western alliance will hold.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cA time when we will have to cooperate even more, rely even more on one another even more and achieve even greater results together.\u201d",
      "Globally, countries including the U.S. have ramped up domestic weapons production as the Ukraine war exposed that all of those stockpiles were woefully unprepared for a major conventional land war.",

      "Tran Dinh Trien was arrested last June for three Facebook posts that allegedly criticized the actions of then-Chief Justice Nguyen Hoa Binh, according to Human Rights Watch and rights group Project 88. Trien was charged under Article 331 of the Penal Code with \u201cabusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the state,\u201d Project 88 said.",
      "Trien, 65, is a former deputy director of the Hanoi Bar Association who has been involved in many high-profile legal cases. The trial is expected to last two days, with 12 lawyers defending him, according to Vietnamese state media. He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted.",
      "In his postings, Trien wrote that courts prevented family members of defendants from attending trials, barred journalists and lawyers from video recording at open trials, and criticized then-Chief Justice Binh for ruling against a death row inmate, Ho Duy Hai, despite irregularities in the investigation, Human Rights Watch said. The top court accused Trien of fabricating and spreading false information that tarnished Binh and the legal system.",
      "Trien was arrested on the same day as prominent journalist and historian Truong Huy San, a week after Public Security Minister To Lam became the Communist country's new president. Two months after Trien's arrest, Binh was appointed the country\u2019s deputy prime minister.",
      "Project 88 said Trien's prosecution violated international law which provides for open political debate and the right to criticize public officials.",
      "\u201cIf convicted, Trien\u2019s prosecution will set a dangerous precedent for other lawyers in Vietnam.

      "Human Rights Watch said Trien was the latest in a series of prominent lawyers targeted for their social media posts. It said at least four Vietnamese lawyers have sought asylum in the United States in the past two years for fear of arrest.",
      "Vietnamese authorities have also increasingly used Article 331 to silence government critics, with courts convicting and sentencing at least 24 people under the article last year alone, it said. \u201cThe government should immediately drop all charges against Trien and free him and others prosecuted for the peaceful expression of their political views,\u201d it added.",

      "The Kuang Hua VI boats, with a crew of 19, carry indigenously developed Hsiung Feng II anti-ship missiles and displayed their ability to take to the sea in an emergency to intercept enemy ships about to cross the 44-kilometer (24-nautical mile) limit of Taiwan\u2019s contiguous zone, within which governments are permitted to take defensive action.",
      "China routinely sends ships and planes to challenge Taiwan\u2019s willingness and ability to counter intruders, prompting Taiwan to scramble jets, activate missile systems and dispatch warships. Taiwan demanded on Wednesday that China end its ongoing military activity in nearby waters, which it said is undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and disrupting international shipping and trade.",
      "Mountainous Taiwan's strategy is to counter the much larger Chinese military with a relatively flexible defense that can prevent Chinese troops from crossing the strait. Landing sites are few on Taiwan's west coast facing China, forcing Beijing to focus on the east coast.",

      "\u201cI want to fight within this country and I will, until the very end, keep fighting for this country,\u201d Mondlane said. \u201cI\u2019m not willing to accept election results if they are the same as those announced up until now.\u201d",
      "He had left the country in October following an election clouded by allegations of rigging against the long-ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power since Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975.",
      "More than 100 people have been killed by security forces, according to international rights groups, since Mozambique erupted in protests after Frelimo was declared the winner of the Oct. 9 election. Some local groups put the death toll at more than 200. Mondlane had called for people to protest the results.",
      "Mondlane has said he left Mozambique fearing for his life after two senior members of his opposition party were killed in their car by unknown gunmen in a late-night shooting on a street in Maputo in the aftermath of the election. Mondlane's party called the killings political assassinations.",
      "Police on Thursday also blocked roads leading to the airport after Mondlane said on social media earlier this week he would return to the southern African country. Tear gas drifted over the airport and surrounding roads and a helicopter hovered overhead. After arriving, Mondlane traveled by car to a public square in central Maputo, with large crowds following him.",
      "Thousands of Mondlane's supporters were expected to gather in Maputo for his return, prompting the clampdown by security forces, which rights groups have accused of using excessive force against post-election protesters. Authorities have said the protests were violent and needed to be subdued, but rights groups say security forces have fired live bullets at peaceful protesters, and children were among those who were killed.",
      "Mondlane accused authorities of kidnapping and killing some anti-government protesters. But he also said he was willing to enter into negotiations with Frelimo to end months of unrest, which has disrupted the country of 33 million. Mozambique has also been battling a violent insurgency by jihadists in the north.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m here in flesh and blood to say that if you want to negotiate, if you want to talk to me, if you want to come to the conversation table, I\u2019m here,\u201d Mondlane said.",
      "Mondlane and other opposition candidates accused Frelimo of rigging the election and international observers reported irregularities in the vote and the alteration of some results. Mozambique\u2019s Constitutional Council upheld Frelimo\u2019s victory last month, making its candidate, Daniel Chapo, the president-elect. He is due to be inaugurated next week to succeed President Filipe Nyusi, who has served the maximum two terms.",
      "Mondlane was second in the official results.",
      "The post-election unrest has spilled over to neighboring countries, with reports of thousands of Mozambicans fleeing to Malawi. South Africa closed its border with Mozambique for several days last year after vehicles were set on fire near the crossing.",
      "The Southern African Development Community, a regional body, has said it will send a delegation to Mozambique in an attempt to find a solution to end the turmoil.",
      "Frelimo has often been accused of rigging elections since Mozambique held its first democratic vote in 1994 following a bloody 15-year civil war Frelimo fought against rebel group Renamo, which is now an opposition party that Mondlane once belonged to before breaking away.",
      "The street protests in several major cities since October have been the biggest threat to Frelimo's rule since the 1977-1992 civil war.",

      "The attack occurred as the laborers were traveling from Lakki Marwat to a nearby mining project, Ijaz said. He gave no further details.",

      "Hundreds of thousands of Catholic worshippers are marching in an annual procession in the Philippines that venerates a centuries-old black statue of Jesus",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Hundreds of thousands of mostly barefoot Catholic worshippers marched Thursday in an annual procession in the Philippines that venerates a centuries-old black statue of Jesus. Some said they prayed for good health for their families, an end to tensions in the South China Sea, and for incoming U.S. President Donald Trump to be kinder to Filipino immigrants.",
      "The procession marks the feast of Jesus Nazareno and is a major annual Catholic event in Asia. The image was previously called the Black Nazarene, but church officials appealed for a change, saying the former name was not founded in history and evoked a racial slur.",
      "The procession in Manila began before dawn, with organizers putting the early crowd at around 250,000. Their number swelled later in the day, but there was no immediate updated crowd estimate. Last year, at least 2 million devotees joined the 15-hour procession, with some estimates of the crowd as high as over 6 million.",
      "Gaspar Espinocilla, a 56-year-old Manila city employee and a devotee of Jesus Nazareno for the last 20 years, said he is praying for his family, including his sister who has ovarian cancer. He is also praying for an end to tensions in the West Philippines Sea, a part of the South China Sea claimed by the Philippines, where China has been harassing Filipino fishermen and coast guard vessels.",
      "\u201cI hope China will ease up on us, they cannot seize everything as theirs,\u201d said Gaspar, who was wearing a maroon T-shirt printed with face of Jesus Nazareno. \u201cIt is ours, not theirs.\u201d",
      "Renato Reyes, a garbage scavenger who has been a Jesus Nazareno devotee for more than three decades, said he prays for a better life for his family, for the Philippines to be free from calamities, as well as for wars overseas to end. He also said he will include in his prayers Filipinos who may be affected by Trump\u2019s planned mass deportation of illegal immigrants.",
      "\u201cI hope they will not implement that because our countrymen are there just to earn a living for their families,\u201d he added.",
      "Thousands of police and plainclothes officers were deployed, along with drone surveillance and commandos positioned on rooftops along the nearly 6-kilometer (3.7 miles) route of the procession. Many nearby roads were closed and cell phone signals were blocked.",
      "More than a dozen devotees were seen being carried on stretchers as ambulances were on standby for people who would fall ill.",
      "The statue of Jesus carrying the cross was brought to the Philippines from Mexico on a galleon in 1606 by Spanish missionaries. The ship that carried it caught fire, but the charred statue survived, according to some accounts. Church historians, however, said the statue\u2019s color owes to the fact that it was carved out of mesquite wood, which darkens as it ages.",
      "Many devotees believe the statue\u2019s endurance, from fires and earthquakes through the centuries and intense bombings during World War II, is a testament to its miraculous powers."

      "Lebanon\u2019s parliament has convened to elect a president to fill a vacuum that's lasted more than two years",
      "BEIRUT -- Lebanon\u2019s parliament convened Thursday to make yet another effort to elect a president, filling a vacuum that's lasted for more than two years.",
      "A first round of voting showed Lebanese army commander Joseph Aoun as the frontrunner, receiving 71 out of 128 votes but falling short of the two-thirds majority needed to win outright. Of the rest, 37 lawmakers cast blank ballots and 14 voted for \u201csovereignty and the constitution.\"",
      "Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri adjourned the session for two hours, after which legislators are set to return for another round of voting.",
      "While 12 previous attempts have failed to choose a successor to former President Michel Aoun, whose term ended in October 2022, there are indications that Thursday's vote is likely to produce a head of state.",
      "Aoun, no relation to the former president, is widely seen as the preferred candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, whose assistance Lebanon will need as it seeks to rebuild after a 14-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.",
      "Hezbollah \u2014 which has been weakened politically and militarily by the war with Israel \u2014 previously backed another candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, the leader of a small Christian party in northern Lebanon with close ties to former Syrian President Bashar Assad.",
      "However, on Wednesday, Frangieh announced he had withdrawn from the race and endorsed Aoun, apparently clearing the way for the army chief. Also Wednesday, the Lebanese Forces, which leads the main parliamentary bloc opposed to Hezbollah, endorsed Aoun.",
      "All 128 members of the legislature were present for the vote Thursday.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s fractious sectarian power-sharing system is prone to deadlock, both for political and procedural reasons. The small, crisis-battered Mediterranean country has been through several extended presidential vacancies, with the longest lasting nearly 2 1/2 years between May 2014 and October 2016. It ended when former President Michel Aoun was elected.",
      "The president's role in Lebanon is limited under the power-sharing system in which the president is always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament Shiite.",
      "However, only the president has the power to appoint or remove a prime minister and cabinet. The caretaker government that has run Lebanon for the last two years has reduced powers because it was not appointed by a sitting president.",
      "As a sitting army commander, Joseph Aoun is technically barred from becoming president by Lebanon's constitution. The ban has been waived before, but it means that Aoun faces additional procedural hurdles.",
      "Under normal circumstances, a presidential candidate in Lebanon can be elected by a two-thirds majority of the 128-member house in the first round of voting, or by a simple majority in a subsequent round.",
      "But because of the constitutional issues surrounding his election, Aoun would need a two-thirds majority even in the second round.",
      "Other contenders included Jihad Azour, a former finance minister who is now the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund; and Elias al-Baysari, the acting head of Lebanon\u2019s General Security agency. Al-Baisary announced Thursday that he was pulling out of the race.",
      "The next government will face daunting challenges apart from implementing the ceasefire agreement that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war and seeking funds for reconstruction.",
      "Lebanon is six years into an economic and financial crisis that decimated the country's currency and wiped out the savings of many Lebanese. The cash-strapped state electricity company provides only a few hours of power a day.",
      "The country's leaders reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF for a bail-out package in 2022 but have made limited progress on reforms required to clinch the deal."

      "PANAMA CITY -- Days before Venezuela\u2019s presidential inauguration, self-exiled Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez was in Panama Wednesday rallying regional support for the opposition's claims that he won the July election against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Accompanied by a dozen former Latin American leaders, Gonz\u00e1lez met with Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino at the presidential palace, where they were photographed holding what Gonz\u00e1lez said are the original ballot tallies that show his landslide victory in the presidential elections of July 28.",
      "\"Venezuela is facing very complicated times because the regime insists on clinging to power despite having been widely defeated in the elections,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said after thanking Mulino for support. \u201cThe elections were openly stolen.\u201d",
      "The meeting comes after Gonz\u00e1lez left exile in Madrid to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden and leaders of Argentina and Uruguay. After the tour around the region, which included a stop in the Dominican Republic on Thursday, Gonz\u00e1lez said he plans to go to Venezuela to assume office as president on Friday.",
      "He has not explained how he plans to return or wrest power from Maduro, who has put out an order for his arrest and whose party controls all institutions, including the military.",
      "The Venezuelan opposition hailed another victory on Wednesday when Colombian leftist leader Gustavo Petro said he would not attend Maduro's inauguration due to an arrest of a human rights activist in Venezuela. The shift in posture by Petro, who has cozied up to Maduro, represents a key show of support the opposition has been pushing for.",
      "\u201cWe can't recognize elections that were not free,\" Petro wrote on the social media platform X on Wednesday.",
      "Still, the opposition faces almost insurmountable odds after being dealt blow-after-blow by Maduro's crackdowns following the elections, a long way from the roaring popular support they felt ahead of July elections. Maduro's government never released the official ballot tallies, documents which the opposition said it gathered through a massive grassroots effort.",
      "After claims that the tallies showed an overwhelming victory for Gonz\u00e1lez, the Maduro government arrested hundreds of critics and opposition members. On Tuesday, Gonz\u00e1lez said his son-in-law was kidnapped.",
      "The crackdown and Maduro's claim of victory met with sharp criticism across the region. Panama was one of the first Latin American countries to demand from Venezuelan authorities a full review of the presidential electoral results after the country's electoral authority declared Maduro the winner.",
      "Mulino's government said it would suspend relations with Caracas until that happened, and on Wednesday the Central American leader only sharpened his discourse against Maduro.",
      "\u201cWe want to make it clear to you that Panama is with you and with the legitimacy you represent,\u201d Mulino told Gonz\u00e1lez.",

      "Somehow, after each crisis, Maduro emerged stronger, even if the country's problems deepened. By 2022, with his opponents vanquished, he took on a new nickname: Super Bigote, a nod to his thick black mustache. It was also a tribute by supporters to his reputation for defying the odds.",

      "Instead, Trump said he would rely on \u201ceconomic force\u201d as he erroneously cast the U.S. trade deficit with Canada \u2014 a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities like oil \u2014 as a subsidy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s becoming very counterproductive,\u201d LeBlanc said, referring to Trump\u2019s rhetoric about Canada.",
      "LeBlanc has been talking to incoming Trump administration officials about increasing border security in an effort to avoid a sweeping 25% tariff that Trump has threatened to impose on all Canadian products.",
      "LeBlanc, recently appointed to the role after the abrupt resignation of the previous finance minister, also announced he won't run to replace Trudeau so he can focus on the tariff threat. Trudeau announced Monday he will resign as prime minister and will stay on until a new Liberal leader is chosen.",
      "\u201cThe timing is awful for sure,\" said Liberal lawmaker Judy Sgro of the leadership change. \u201cBut we will do what we have to do to ensure that Canada stands strong.\"",
      "Asked about Trump's comments, Sgro said \u201cHe should focus on his own issues in his own country, because he\u2019s got lots of them.\u201d",
      "Canadian Immigration Minister Marc Miller also fired back, dismissing Trump's comments as \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "\"There is no chance of us becoming the 51st state. I think that this is beneath a president of the United States,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI said a few weeks ago that this whole thing was like a South Park episode.\"",
      "Trump refused to rule out acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal by military force and has said the U.S doesn't need anything from Canada, including automobiles, lumber and dairy products.",
      "\"I don\u2019t know who is misinforming him,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said. \u201cRight now we ship 4.3 million barrels of crude oil into the U.S. 60 percent of their energy imports are coming from Canada.\u201d",
      "The U.S. imports approximately 60% of its crude oil from Canada, with Alberta alone supplying 4.3 million barrels per day. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels a day, while domestically producing about 13.2 million barrels a day. This means about quarter of the oil the U.S. consumes every day is from Canada.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "Ford said Canada will retaliate if Trump imposes tariffs, saying that a wide range of U.S. products shipped to Canada will be targeted, but he declined to specify which ones.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",
      "Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said she never takes Trump's threats lightly.",
      "\"At the same time we can\u2019t take the bait,\u201d Joly said. \u201cWe have to show we have a strong economy and we are strong and we are not going to be annexed.\u201d"

      "Two hundred Utah ski patrollers returned to work Thursday after voting to accept a new labor contract and end a nearly two-week strike that closed many trails and caused long lift lines at the ones that remained open during a busy time of year at the country's biggest ski resort.",
      "The Park City Ski Professional Ski Patrol Association claimed victory, saying in a statement that Colorado-based Vail Resorts, which owns Park City Mountain Resort, acceded to its key demands including a $2-an-hour base-pay increase and raises for senior ski patrollers.",
      "\"This contract is more than just a win for our team \u2014 it\u2019s a groundbreaking success in the ski and mountain worker industry. This effort demonstrates what can be achieved when workers stand together and fight for what they deserve,\u201d ski patroller and union lead negotiator Seth Dromgoole said in a statement.",
      "Union negotiators and Vail Resorts announced Tuesday that they had reached a tentative deal. The full union voted Wednesday to accept the agreement.",
      "The strike began Dec. 27 after negotiations that started in March bogged down and the union accused Vail Resorts of bargaining unfairly. The strike coincided with the busy holiday season and a period of more than 2 feet (61 centimeters) of fresh but difficult-to-access snowfall at the resort.",
      "Despite the closed trails and long lift lines, some skiers expressed support for the strikers, chanting \u201cPay your employees!\u201d in videos posted on social media.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to welcoming back the Park City Mountain patrollers in the coming days and moving forward together as one team. We apologize to our guests who were impacted by this strike and are incredibly grateful to our team who worked hard to keep the mountain open and operating safely over the past two weeks,\" Bill Rock, Vail Resorts' mountain division president, said in a statement.",
      "Pointing to steep inflation since 2022, the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association sought a pay increase from $21 to $23 an hour. It said $27 is a livable wage in Park City, which is also home to Deer Valley Resort.",
      "Park City, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Salt Lake City, is a resort town of about 8,000 people where the average home price tops $1.5 million and living costs are well above average.",
      "The raises include a $4-an-hour average increase for senior ski patrollers, with some specialized long-time workers getting an average of $7.75 more, according to the union.",
      "The union also sought higher pay for the longest-serving patrollers. The current scale tops out after five years on the job.",
      "Vail Resorts, which with 42 properties on three continents calls itself the world\u2019s largest mountain resort operator, said it already had been generous with the Park City Mountain Resort ski patrollers, pointing to a 50% base-pay increase from $13 to $21 an hour in 2022. It had been offering a 4% pay increase for most patrollers and $1,600 each year for their equipment.",
      "Ski labor negotiations aren\u2019t rare, but this strike happened after talks went much longer than usual, drawing attention during a busy time, observed Alex Kaufman, a former ski resort marketing executive and podcaster.",
      "\u201cThe issue was probably never really about the money or benefits. It was a conscious decision by Vail Resorts to let it bleed into the holidays,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cThey overplayed their hand and paid the price.\u201d",
      "Ski patrollers maintain safety by monitoring terrain, responding to accidents, hauling injured skiers downhill and reducing avalanche risk, such as by releasing built-up snow with explosives when nobody is nearby. Many work other jobs in the summer, including as fly-fishing, mountain biking and whitewater rafting guides.",
      "Labor unions have secured meaningful employer concessions in recent months following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip."

      "LAS VEGAS -- When Russell Maichel started growing almonds, walnuts and pistachios in the 1980s, he didn't own a cellphone. Now, a fully autonomous tractor drives through his expansive orchard, spraying pesticides and fertilizer to protect the trees that have for decades filled him with an immense sense of pride.",
      "\u201cThe sustainability of doing things perfectly the first time makes a lot of sense,\u201d the first-generation farmer told The Associated Press at CES 2025, where John Deere unveiled a fleet of fully autonomous heavy equipment, including the tractor Maichel has been testing on his northern California farm.",
      "Sustainability is a key theme this year at the annual tech trade show in Las Vegas. From Volvo CEO Martin Lundstedt announcing their commitment to net-zero emissions by 2040 to Wisconsin-based OshKosh Corporation showing off its electric fire engines and garbage trucks, companies big and small are showcasing their green innovations and initiatives.",
      "\u201cWe absolutely need more climate-smart technologies,\u201d said Jacqueline Heard, CEO and co-founder of Enko Chem, which researches climate tech solutions in agriculture \u2014 an industry Heard says is \u201cunder a lot of pressure right now.\u201d",
      "That much is clear on the CES show floor, where farming is on full display and company leaders are highlighting the impacts of climate change and labor shortages on farmers.",
      "Not far from John Deere's booth where autonomous tractors and dump trucks are towering over conference attendees, Kubota, another equipment manufacturing company, is showcasing its AI technology that detects diseases in crops and sprays where pests have been identified.",

      "Stucke himself grew up on a potato farm in Ohio. Each night after dinner, his father would scour the field for bugs and then send Stucke out to spray the crops with insecticides.",
      "\u201cWe sprayed the whole field, but we might've only needed to spray a part of the field or a plant,\u201d he said. \u201cTake that analogy into vineyards, orchards and so forth, you don\u2019t have to spray everything.\u201d",
      "This is known as \u201cprecision agriculture,\u201d Heard said. \u201cIt allows farmers to really optimize their land.\"",
      "The idea, Heard said, is that farmers can expand the lifespan and improve the quality of their crops while using fewer chemicals, like pesticides and fertilizer.",
      "\u201cIt's good for the environment. It's good for farmers,\" she said.",
      "Heard said she wouldn't be surprised if AI can one day help farmers map out their land, showing them the different soil types and what kinds of crops would grow best there.",
      "\u201cIt could be that with climate change, they should move to a crop that's much more adapted to this new world,\" she said.",
      "Back at the John Deere booth, Maichel, a tree nut farmer, said he's hopeful that advancements in AI will help him better manage the unpredictability of farming. Each year on his orchard is different from the last.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no sliding scale, per se, that we have to deal with as far as climate change goes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really bend to the climate that we\u2019re dealt with. It\u2019s not something I can predict. It\u2019s really something we have to adapt to every growing season.\u201d",
      "If someone had told him just 10 years ago that a tractor would one day be driving itself through his orchard, he said he wouldn't have believed it. But now, he says, he sees how this evolving technology can help him adapt to the changing industry and climate.",

      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "\u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts,\u201d the late New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan memorably wrote four decades ago.",
      "That seems like a simpler time \u2014 especially when you consider Meta's decision to end a fact-checking program on social media apps Facebook, Instagram and Threads and what the ramifications might be for an industry built to bring clarity and to seek truth itself.",
      "Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg's announcement this week was widely seen in news verification circles as a genuflection to president-elect Donald Trump, whose first term in office popularized the phrase \u201calternative facts.\u201d",
      "Meta is replacing its fact-checking with a \u201ccommunity notes\u201d system reminiscent of X, where it depends on users to correct misinformation on its platforms. In a way, that hearkens back to \u201che said-she said\u201d journalism, or the view of some political debate moderators that it should be the role of opponents, not journalists, to point out falsehoods. It also hints at something else: the notion that the loudest voices and the best-told stories can win the day.",
      "The moment is a crossroads for the fact-checking industry, which will see its influence sharply curtailed when Trump takes office for his second term.",
      "\u201cIn the short term, this is bad news for people who want to go on social media to find trustworthy and accurate information,\u201d said Angie Drobnic Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network. Her organization started in 2015 with about 50 members and now has 170, some of whom face staff cuts and potential closure because of Meta's move.",
      "\u201cIn the long term,\" she said, \"I think it\u2019s very uncertain what this will all mean.\u201d",
      "Fact-checking is an odd industry, particularly when you consider that it's a function of all journalism. The concept bubbled up about three decades ago in part to counter \u201che said-she said\u201d stories and monitor claims in political ads. The organization FactCheck.org, whose primary aim was to help reporters, started in 2003 and the more public-facing PolitiFact four years later.",
      "PolitiFact, started by then-Tampa Bay Times Washington bureau chief Bill Adair in 2007, won a Pulitzer Prize for its 2008 campaign coverage. It called out politicians for bending or breaking the truth in ways often difficult for reporters who were protective of the sources whose voices populated their stories.",
      "By 2012, fact-checkers were under attack, primarily by Republicans convinced many were biased and researched voting records to try and prove the point, said Adair, now a Duke University professor. Trump, he said, \u201csped up a trend that had already begun.\u201d",
      "Some conservative suspicion of fact-checkers has been warranted because of mistakes that have been made, although there were some Republicans who uttered falsehoods and just didn\u2019t like being called out for it, said Steve Hayes, CEO and editor of the center-right site The Dispatch.",
      "\u201cThe people who practice fact-checking are in some ways saying, \u2019We are the arbiter of truth, period,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cAnd anytime you do this, it invites scrutiny on the work that you do.\u201d",
      "Labeling systems largely didn't help, either. Giving a misstatement the label of \u201cpants on fire,\u201d as some fact-checkers have, may be a catchy way of attracting attention but also fostered resentment.",
      "Holan resists the view that fact-checkers have been biased in their work: \u201cThat attack line comes from those who feel they should be able to exaggerate and lie without rebuttal or contradiction.\"",
      "GOP suspicion still quickly took root. Journalism's Poynter Institute, in a survey taken in 2019, found that 70% of Republicans thought the work of fact-checkers was one-sided. Roughly the same percentage of Democrats thought they were fair. Poynter hasn't asked the same question since. Yet last year, Poynter found that 52% of Americans say they generally find it difficult to determine whether what they're reading about elections is true or not.",
      "In a column Wednesday on the conservative watchdog site NewsBusters.org, Tim Graham wrote that during the first nine months of 2024, PolitiFact criticized Republican officials for delivering \u201cmostly false\u201d facts 88 times compared to 31 times for Democrats. To Graham, this proves that the idea the site is independent or nonpartisan is laughable.",
      "But is that bias? Or is it checking facts?",
      "Adair used to be reluctant to say what is now the title of his new book: \u201cBeyond the Big Lie: The Epidemic of Political Lying, Why Republicans Do it More, and How it Could Burn Down Our Democracy.\u201d He's not hesitant anymore.",
      "\u201cTrump is unmatched as a liar in American politics,\u201d Adair said. \u201cI'm not the first to say that. I think he has capitalized on the fact that there has been this pushback on fact-checkers, and showed other politicians that you can get away with lying, so go ahead and do that.\u201d",
      "Tension about fact-checking played out during the recent presidential campaign, when Trump's team was furious with ABC News for calling attention to false statements by the former president during his only debate with Democrat Kamala Harris.",
      "Trump's second victory has changed the equation at Meta. Already, X has curtailed its independent fact-checking under owner Elon Musk, a Trump ally. The moves are significant because it removes fact-checking from venues where many users might not otherwise be exposed to it.",
      "On its own, fact-checking \u201cdoesn't reach those exposed to misinformation,\u201d said Kathleen Hall Jamieson of the University of Pennsylvania, who started FactCheck.org. \u201cIt tends to reach audiences that were already knowledgeable and wary.\u201d",
      "On social media, fact-checking also became part of the algorithms that drove information to people, or away from them. Material labeled as false would often be downgraded so it received less exposure. To Republicans who have criticized Big Tech, that amounted to censorship. Yet to Jamieson, successful fact-checking is not censorship \u2014 \u201cit's the process of arguing.\"",
      "Jamieson expressed some optimism that other smart social media users will step up to prevent the dangerous spread of falsehoods. But for fact-checking as it is today to continue to thrive and, even, exist as a journalistic endeavor, Adair said it will likely take influential Republican figures to publicly stand up for the importance of truth.",
      "NewsBuster columnist Graham, in an interview, had a more pointed piece of advice. \u201cMy remedy in all arguments about media trust,\" he said, \u201cis that humility is required.\u201d",

      "The benefit of this approach is that it really does provide you with a blank slate. You'll have no more mental anxiety if you don't have any more messages to worry about. The drawback, of course, is that you might lose any messages that might be important or precious.",

      "Electric vehicle demand is expected to keep rising this year, but uncertainty over policy changes and tariffs is clouding the forecast",
      "NEW YORK -- Electric vehicle demand is expected to keep rising this year, but uncertainty over policy changes and tariffs is clouding the forecast.",
      "S&P Global Mobility expects global sales of 15.1 million battery electric vehicles in 2025, which would mark a 30% jump. Battery electric vehicles are expected to make up 16.7% of the market share for light vehicles.",
      "Tesla, BYD of China, and other manufacturers face big unknowns in 2025. Donald Trump's presidency could mean big policy shifts in tax and other incentives for both electric vehicle makers and consumers. The threat of tariffs on imports and retaliatory tariffs globally, could further complicate production and sales for electric vehicles.",
      "\u201cThere's just a lot of uncertainty in the air,\u201d said Stephanie Brinley, associate director of auto intelligence at S&P Global Mobility. \u201cIt's not an environment where you want to necessarily go gangbusters.\u201d",
      "In the U.S., consumers can currently claim a federal tax benefit of up to $7,500 for certain new electric vehicles. Carmakers also benefitted from some federal support for electric vehicle production and infrastructure. It's possible for all of that to get cut under President Trump.",
      "Trump condemned the federal tax credit for electric vehicles while campaigning for the presidency. He called it part of a \u201cgreen new scam\u201d that would would hurt the auto industry. Still, the incoming administration is expected push for broader deregulation of industries, which could potentially help carmakers.",
      "Some of the larger electric vehicle makers had a mixed 2024 even with benefits for consumers and manufacturers. Tesla sales slipped 1.1%, its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years. Rivian's deliveries rose 2.9%.",
      "Tariffs are another threat to the industry. Production takes place globally, with parts getting imported and exported throughout the process. Trump has threatened to tax imports from Mexico, Canada, China and elsewhere, which would likely result in retaliatory tariffs.",
      "China is the largest market for electric vehicles, followed by the U.S. Within the U.S., Tesla is the dominant electric vehicle maker, with about 50% of the market share.",
      "Automakers are in a wait-and-see position along with many other industries to see whether Trump carries out the threat of rescinding tax credits and implementing tariffs.",
      "The broader auto industry is proceeding with caution. Overall, S&P Global Mobility expects that light vehicle production will have slid 1.6% in 2024 and will fall another 0.4% in 2025.",
      "That's a result of automakers better matching production and demand. Overall light vehicle sales are still expected to rise 1.7% in 2025.",
      "The ongoing transition to electric vehicles also plays a role in more tempered production. Companies like Ford and General Motors are shifting production capacity to electric vehicles in some cases instead of adding more capacity."

      "What is going on with aviation security?",
      "People have been found dead hiding in the wheel wells of planes twice in the past month. Two stowaways were arrested on different flights in November and December. Then a passenger opened an emergency door while a plane was taxiing in Boston Tuesday night.",
      "These incidents are being investigated, so we don't know yet exactly where security failed. But clearly there were gaps in security. So it's natural to wonder: is my flight safe?",
      "Passengers panicked when a man onboard a JetBlue plane taxiing for takeoff at Boston's Logan International Airport opened an exit door over a wing, trigging an emergency slide to inflate Tuesday. Other passengers quickly restrained the man, and the plane never took off, but clearly it was a scary moment.",
      "On Monday, two dead bodies were found inside the landing gear compartment of a different JetBlue plane after it landed in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.",
      "In late December, a body was found in the wheel well of a United Airlines plane after it landed in Maui from Chicago.",
      "Also in December, a passenger without a ticket was discovered aboard a Delta Air Lines flight as that plane was rolling across the tarmac in Seattle before it took off for Honolulu.",
      "A separate stowaway was arrested in November after a Delta Air Lines flight from New York landed in Paris. That Russian national had somehow bypassed security to board the flight.",
      "If a stowaway can get inside a plane's wheel well or sneak aboard the cabin, what would prevent someone with malicious intent from getting access?",

      "The Transportation Security Administration, the airlines and the airports are all trying to find where those gaps are and plug them. But Price said that by design there are gaps in the system.",
      "The fact that people are getting access to these planes makes pilots worried about the system.",
      "\u201cRight now we\u2019re seeing some fissure cracks. They\u2019re unacceptable. And we\u2019ve been lucky that it hasn\u2019t been somebody with broader nefarious intent,\u201d said Dennis Tajer, a longtime airline pilot and spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association union.",

      "The National Safety Council estimates that Americans have a 1-in-93 chance of dying in a motor vehicle crash, while deaths on airplanes are too rare to calculate the odds. Figures from the U.S. Department of Transportation tell a similar story.",
      "The last deadly crash involving a U.S. airliner occurred in February 2009, an unprecedented streak of safety. But planes have crashed elsewhere around the world. And there are other concerns.",
      "Safety regulators are worried about a number of close calls at airports in the past couple years.",
      "This is not the first time that a passenger has opened an emergency door on a plane on the ground. In one incident in Australia last year, a man opened a door and walked out onto the wing of a stationary plane and was arrested after he climbed down to the ground.",
      "Emergency doors are supposed to be able to be opened when a plane is on the ground so passengers can quickly escape if there is a problem.",
      "Passengers can take comfort in the fact that emergency doors are extremely difficult to open during a flight. There are locks that keep a door in place in flight that are armed after takeoff. And once a plane is above 10,000 feet, the air pressure inside the plane holds the door in place. Most of them are designed so that they must be pulled inward before they can be opened.",
      "But in January 2024, a panel plugging the space reserved for an unused emergency door blew off an Alaska Airlines jetliner 16,000 feet above Oregon. Pilots landed the Boeing 737 Max safely, but videos from passengers showed the terrifying scene. The rapid loss of cabin pressure caused oxygen masks to drop from the ceiling, and suction as air rushed from the hole exerted force on people inside the plane.",
      "Investigators have said it appears that four bolts used to help secure the panel were missing after the plane was worked on at a Boeing factory in Renton, Washington.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Interior Department says that no bids were submitted for this week\u2019s oil and gas lease sale in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The U.S. Interior Department on Wednesday said no bids were submitted for this week's oil and gas lease sale in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \u2014 a sale the state has challenged as too restrictive and at odds with a 2017 law aimed at opening the refuge's sweeping coastal plan to exploration and development.",
      "Monday was the deadline for companies to submit bids, the agency said.",
      "Interior Acting Deputy Secretary Laura Daniel-Davis said the lack of interest by oil companies in pursuing leases in the refuge's coastal plain \u201creflects what we and they have known all along \u2013 there are some places too special and sacred to put at risk with oil and gas drilling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe oil and gas industry is sitting on millions of acres of undeveloped leases elsewhere; we\u2019d suggest that\u2019s a prudent place to start, rather than engage further in speculative leasing in one of the most spectacular places in the world,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "But this is unlikely to be the last word. The state this week sued the Interior Department and federal officials over the sale, alleging among other things that the terms were too restrictive. The state also is seeking to have the environmental review underpinning the sale thrown out. Litigation around the first lease sale \u2014 held in the waning days of the Trump administration in early 2021 \u2014 also is still pending.",
      "A 2017 law that President-elect Donald Trump has often highlighted called for offering two lease sales in the refuge\u2019s coastal plain by late 2024. Major oil companies sat out the first sale, which saw a state corporation as the main bidder. One of President Joe Biden\u2019s first acts as president was to order a review of the leasing program, which ultimately led to the cancelation of seven remaining leases. Smaller companies had previously given up two other leases they'd held from that sale.",
      "The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which falls under the Interior Department, has said that it offered for lease as part of the smaller, second sale 400,000 acres (162,000 hectares), the minimum acreage required by the 2017 law. The agency said its proposal avoided important polar bear denning and caribou calving areas and had the smallest footprint of potential surface disturbance.",
      "Leaders in Gwich'in communities near the refuge consider the coastal plain sacred, citing its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon, and oppose drilling there. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling and see responsible oil development as critical to the economic wellbeing of communities in the region.",
      "Drilling advocates \u2014 including state political leaders \u2014 are hopeful Trump will pursue drilling in the refuge, seeing a potential to create jobs, generate additional revenue and spur U.S. oil production. But while the Bureau of Land Management has said the coastal plain could contain 4.25 billion to 11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil, there is limited information about the amount and quality of oil there. And environmentalists contend the lack of interest by oil companies so far should speak volumes.",
      "\u201cThey seem to understand that drilling in this remote landscape is\u202ftoo risky, too complicated and just plain wrong,\u201d Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, said in a statement. \"The incoming Trump administration still hasn\u2019t gotten the memo and has vowed to keep trying to sell the refuge for oil. We\u2019ll continue to use the power of the law to defend this cherished place, as we have for decades.\u201d"

      "Federal Reserve officials at their meeting Dec. 17-18 expected to dial back the pace of interest rate cuts this year in the face of persistently elevated inflation and the threat of widespread tariffs and other potential policy changes",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials at their meeting Dec. 17-18 expected to dial back the pace of interest rate cuts this year in the face of persistently elevated inflation and the threat of widespread tariffs and other potential policy changes.",
      "Minutes from the meeting, released after the typical three-week lag, also showed clear division among the Fed's 19 policymakers. Some officials expressed support for keeping the central bank's key rate unchanged, the minutes said. And a majority of the officials said the decision to cut rates was a close call.",
      "Ultimately, the Fed choose to cut its key rate by a quarter-point to about 4.3%. One official, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged.",
      "Still, there was widespread agreement in the minutes that after reducing rates for three straight meetings, Fed officials felt it was time to undertake a more deliberate approach to their key rate.",
      "Fewer rate cuts will likely mean that borrowing costs for consumers and businesses \u2014 including for homes, cars, and credit cards \u2014 will remain elevated this year.",
      "Policymakers said that the Fed \u201cwas at or near the point at which it would be appropriate to slow the pace of policy easing,\u201d the minutes said. In projections released after the meeting, Fed officials said they expect just two cuts next year, down from an earlier projection of four.",
      "Fed officials sent stock markets plummeting Dec. 18 after they reduced their outlook for rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the meeting that the decision to reduce rates had been a \u201cclose call.\"",
      "Powell also said that recent signs of stubborn inflation have caused many Fed officials to pare back their expectations for rate cuts. Inflation, according to the Fed's preferred measure, ticked up to 2.4% in November, compared with a year ago, above the Fed's target. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, it was 2.8%.",
      "In addition, some officials have started to consider the potential impact of President-elect Trump's proposals, such as widespread tariffs, on the economy and inflation next year, the minutes said.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs, for example, have estimated that Trump's tariff proposals could push inflation by nearly a half-percentage point later this year.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Fed governor Christopher Waller said that he still supported rate reductions this year, in part because he expects inflation to steadily head down to the Fed's 2% target. He also said he didn't expect tariffs would worsen inflation and wouldn't change his preference for lowering borrowing costs.",
      "Waller also said, in a question and answer session, that he didn't think Trump would ultimately impose the universal tariffs he promised in the campaign."

      "Ski patrollers at the biggest U.S. ski resort reached a tentative deal with the corporate owner of Utah's Park City Mountain Resort to end a strike and resume normal operations after almost two weeks of closed terrain and long lift lines at the busiest time of year.",
      "Neither the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association nor Colorado-based Vail Resorts released details about the agreement ahead of a planned ratification vote Wednesday.",
      "Whatever happens, the strike brought attention \u2014 and judging from the many supportive car honks for strikers, sympathy \u2014 to the struggle of ski patrollers to make ends meet in pricey mountain communities.",
      "A union win could produce better pay for other ski workers, predicted one industry watcher.",
      "\u201cGenerally when one group of employees successfully bargains for a contract they think is fair, it does tend to create the \u2018rising tide lifts all boats\u2019 dynamic,\u201d said Alex Kaufman, a former ski resort marketing executive and podcaster.",
      "Park City, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of Salt Lake City, is a resort town of about 8,000 people where the average home price tops $1.5 million and the cost of living is well above average.",
      "The 200 ski patrollers at Park City Mountain Resort went on strike on Dec. 27 alleging unfair bargaining in negotiations since March. The tentative deal to be in effect through April 2027 had the unanimous approval of ski patrol negotiators, according to a joint statement from the union and the resort.",
      "\u201cEveryone looks forward to restoring normal resort operations and moving forward together as one team,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Ski patrollers maintain safety by monitoring terrain, responding to accidents, hauling hurt skiers downhill and reducing avalanche risk, such as by releasing built-up snow with explosives when nobody\u2019s nearby. It\u2019s specialized work where familiarity with a resort\u2019s terrain and how to respond to a variety of injuries and situations can be valuable.",
      "It's also a seasonal job. Many ski patrollers work as fly-fishing, mountain biking and whitewater rafting guides in warmer months.",
      "Pointing to steep inflation since 2022, the Park City Professional Ski Patrollers Association sought a pay increase from $21 to $23 an hour. The union said $27 is a livable wage in Park City, which is also home to Deer Valley Resort.",
      "It also sought higher pay for the longest-serving patrollers. The current scale tops out after five years on the job.",
      "Vail Resorts, which with 42 properties on three continents calls itself the world\u2019s largest mountain resort operator, said it already had been generous with the Park City Mountain Resort ski patrollers, pointing to a 50% base-pay increase from $13 to $21 an hour in 2022. It was offering a 4% pay increase for most patrollers and $1,600 each year for their equipment.",
      "Ski labor negotiations aren't unusual, but this strike happened after talks went much longer into the year than usual, drawing attention during a busy time, observed Kaufman.",
      "\"The issue was probably never really about the money or benefits. It was a conscious decision by Vail Resorts to let it bleed into the holidays,\" Kaufman said. \u201cThey overplayed their hand and paid the price.\u201d",
      "Despite long waits, even some Park City Mountain Resort skiers have been sympathetic to the workers. \u201cPay your employees!\u201d they chanted from lift lines in videos posted on social media.",
      "Labor unions have secured meaningful employer concessions in recent months following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "The 45,000 dockworkers\u2019 ongoing threats to resume their strike over automation would shut down ports and could damage the economy as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House."

      "WASHINGTON -- The IRS boosted taxpayer services through Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act but still faces processing claims from a coronavirus pandemic-era tax credit program and is slow to resolve certain identity theft cases, according to an independent watchdog report released Wednesday.",
      "\u201cFor the first time since I became the National Taxpayer Advocate in 2020, I can begin this report with good news: The taxpayer experience has noticeably improved,\u201d Erin M. Collins wrote in her 2024 annual report to Congress.",
      "She said \u201cthe IRS has made major strides\u201d with the help of the billions of dollars in multiyear funding, though she notes that \u201cIRS service remains far from perfect.\u201d",
      "Remaining service gaps include prolonged delays in resolving claims from the nearly half a million taxpayers whose identities were stolen by fraudsters who received a refund on their behalf. The delays have increased from 19 months in 2023 to 22 months in 2024, according to the report.",
      "In addition, the report says there have been lengthy delays in the resolution of eligible Employee Retention Credit claims submitted by employers who rely on those refunds to stay in business.",
      "The Employee Retention Credit, or ERC, was designed to help businesses retain employees during pandemic-era shutdowns, but it quickly became a magnet for fraud. Its complex eligibility rules allowed scammers to target small businesses, offering help applying for it for a fee \u2014 even if they didn\u2019t qualify.",
      "In September 2023, the IRS announced a pause in accepting claims for the tax credit until 2024 because of rising concerns that an influx of applications were fraudulent.",
      "\u201cAlthough the IRS has processed several hundred thousand claims in recent months, it was still sitting on a backlog of about 1.2 million claims as of October 26, 2024,\" Collins said in her Wednesday report. \u201cMany claims have been pending for more than a year.\u201d",
      "IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel said \u201cthings are trending in a very positive direction in terms of our performance in taxpayer service,\u201d but still, \u201cI view the identity theft issue as our largest current service gap.\u201d He said the agency is seeing higher numbers of theft victims overall since before the pandemic, in part because scammers are increasingly moving to online schemes.",
      "Werfel said the agency is adding more resources to the issue and streamlining identity theft cases by distinguishing between complex and simpler cases to resolve taxpayer issues faster.",
      "Among other recommendations, the taxpayer advocate is calling on Congress to expand the U.S. Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear refund cases, give the Low Income Taxpayer Clinic program more financial leeway to help taxpayers and require the IRS to process claims for refund or credits in a timely manner.",
      "Collins said many IRS improvements, including faster service and quicker phone response times, have been made possible by multiyear funding provided by Congress. However, that funding is at risk of being cut.",
      "The federal tax collection agency originally received an $80 billion infusion of funds under the Inflation Reduction Act, though a 2023 debt ceiling and budget cut deal between Republicans and the Democratic White House resulted in $1.4 billion rescinded from the agency and a separate agreement to take $20 billion from the IRS over the next two years and divert those funds to other nondefense programs.",
      "Now, Treasury Department officials are calling on Congress to unlock another $20 billion in IRS enforcement money that is tied up in legislative language that has effectively rendered the money frozen.",
      "Werfel said the boost in the IRS budget \u201chas played an absolutely critical role\" in improvements to taxpayer services. \u201cWe\u2019ve put the money to good use,\" he said.",
      "If Congress does slash Inflation Reduction Act enforcement funding, Collins recommends that it not make cuts to taxpayer services and information technology. Congress should not, Collins said, \u201cinadvertently throw out the baby with the bathwater.\u201d"

      "Not necessarily. New research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago. And tuition increases at private colleges have finally slowed after years of hefty rises.",
      "Figures compiled by the nonprofit College Board indicate the average student attending an in-state public university this year faces a tuition bill of $11,610, which is down 4% from a decade earlier when taking inflation into account. But the real savings come in what the average student actually pays after getting grants and financial aid. That's down 40% over the decade, from $4,140 to $2,480 annually, according to the data.",
      "That reduced cost means less borrowing. Just under half of students attending in-state public universities are graduating with some debt, down from 59% a decade earlier, according to the College Board figures. And among those who do borrow, the average loan balance has fallen by 17%, to $27,100.",
      "Meanwhile, at private colleges, tuition continues to rise, but at a much slower rate. It has increased 4% over the past decade, when taking inflation into account, to an average $43,350, according to the College Board. That's a big change from the two decades prior, when tuition increased 68%.",
      "Costs are coming down as Americans question whether college is worth the price. Surveys find that Americans are increasingly skeptical about the value of a degree, and the percentage of high school graduates heading to college has fallen to levels not seen in decades, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Yet research still finds that, over time, a degree pays off. Americans with a bachelor\u2019s degree earn a median of $2.8 million during their careers, 75% more than if they had only a high school diploma, according to research from Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic has been a big factor in the cost reductions, said Jennifer Ma, an executive research scientist at the College Board and lead author of the study.",
      "\u201cWe know that during COVID, a lot of institutions \u2014 public and private \u2014 froze tuition,\u201d Ma said.",
      "As states and the federal government responded to the pandemic, Ma said, they increased higher education funding, allowing colleges to reduce the cost of attendance. Some of that money has since expired, however, including an infusion of federal pandemic aid that was mostly used up by the end of 2022.",
      "Cost was a major consideration in Kai Mattinson's decision to attend Northern Arizona University. It would have cost her about $39,000 annually to attend the public university but discounts and scholarships bring that down to between $15,000 and $20,000 for the 22-year-old senior from Nevada.",
      "\u201cI originally wanted to go to the University of Arizona, but when it came down to tuition and other cost, Northern Arizona University was the best option,\u201d said Mattinson, a physical education major who also works as a long-term substitute at a local elementary school.",
      "Many institutions have tried to limit cost increases. Purdue University in Indiana, for example, has frozen its annual in-state tuition at $9,992 for the past 13 years.",
      "Mark Becker, the president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said he was pleased to see the new data.",
      "\u201cInstitutional efforts to control costs, combined with many states\u2019 efforts to increase investments in public universities and federal investment in the Pell Grant, have increased college affordability and enabled significant progress on tackling student debt,\u201d Becker said in a statement.",
      "Costs for those attending public two-year community colleges have fallen even more, by 9% over the past decade, according to the College Board data, which is broadly in line with federal figures collected by the National Center for Education Statistics.",
      "Still, for parents paying for their children to attend out-of-state public universities or private colleges, the costs remain daunting \u2014 as much as $95,000 annually, in some cases. However, many institutions offer significant discounts to the sticker price for middle- and lower-income students.",
      "Some private colleges have been expanding their financial aid, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which in November announced undergraduates with a family income below $200,000 would no longer need to pay any tuition at all starting in the fall.",
      "Other private colleges are discounting tuition as a marketing move in an increasingly difficult environment. They face a dwindling pool of young adults, and students who are more wary of signing up for giant loans. Recruiting students is crucial for staying afloat as operational costs rise. After temporary relief thanks to federal money during the pandemic, many colleges have cut programs to try to keep costs under control.",

      "The Labor Department on Wednesday said that applications for jobless benefits fell to 201,000 for the week ending January 4, down from the previous week's 211,000. This week's figure is the lowest since February of last year.",

      "When the Labor Department releases hiring numbers for December on Friday, they\u2019re expected to show that employers added 160,000 jobs last month.",
      "On Tuesday, the government reported that U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in November, showing companies are still looking for workers even as the labor market has loosened. Openings rose to 8.1 million in November, the most since February and up from 7.8 million in October,",

      "A top policymaker at the US Federal Reserve says that he still supports reducing interest rates this year, despite elevated inflation and the prospect of widespread tariffs",
      "WASHINGTON -- A top policymaker at the U.S. Federal Reserve said Wednesday that he still supports cutting interest rates this year, despite elevated inflation and the prospect of widespread tariffs under the incoming Trump administration.",
      "Christopher Waller, an influential member of the Fed's board of governors, said he expects inflation will move closer to the Fed's 2% target in the coming months. And in some of the first comments by a Fed official specifically about tariffs, he said that greater import duties likely won't push up inflation this year.",
      "\u201cMy bottom-line message is that I believe more cuts will be appropriate,\u201d Waller said in Paris at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "\u201cIf, as I expect, tariffs do not have a significant or persistent effect on inflation, they are unlikely to affect my view,\u201d Waller added.",
      "His remarks are noteworthy because the impact of tariffs is a key wild card for the economy this year. Waller also suggested he is more optimistic about inflation than many Wall Street investors, who increasingly expect the Fed to keep its rate steady this year as elevated prices continue to linger.",
      "\u201cI believe that inflation will continue to make progress toward our 2% goal over the medium term and that further (rate) reductions will be appropriate,\u201d Waller said. While inflation has been persistent in recent months \u2014 it ticked up to 2.4% in November, according to the Fed's preferred measure \u2014 Waller argued that outside of housing, which is difficult to measure, prices are cooling.",
      "Waller\u2019s remarks run counter to increasing expectations on Wall Street that the Fed may not cut its key rate much, if at all, this year. It is currently about 4.3% after several reductions last year from a two-decade high of 5.3%. Financial markets are expecting just one rate reduction in 2025, according to futures pricing tracked by CME Fedwatch.",
      "Waller did not say how many cuts he specifically supports. Instead he said that Fed officials projected two reductions this year, as a group, in December. But he also noted that policymakers supported a wide range of outcomes, from no cuts to as many as five. The number of reductions will depend on progress towards reducing inflation, he added."

    "summary": "This week&rsquo;s winter wallop across the U.S. means different things to farmers in different places",
    "story": [
      "This week\u2019s winter wallop across the U.S. means different things to farmers in different places",
      "A nasty dose of winter weather has pummeled much of the U.S. from Kansas to the East Coast, leaving many Americans to dig out of the blizzard \u2014 including farmers And more is on the way, with the polar air expected to continue to grip some places until at least Friday.",
      "Farmers always watch the weather, but depending on where they're located and what they produce, winter always presents mental challenges for growers, said Carolyn Olson, an organic farmer in southwestern Minnesota who is also vice president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation Board of Directors.",
      "Producers know that the timing and amount of winter moisture affect farming conditions for the rest of the year. It's also a time for planning ahead \u2014 something becoming increasingly difficult as climate change ramps up variability in snowfall, rainfall and other weather conditions that can make or break an operation.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re doing that stressful part of making those decisions on how they\u2019re going to farm this year, what they\u2019re going to grow,\u201d Olson said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of pressure on agriculture at this time of the year.\"",
      "Biting wind and big drifts from almost a whole year's average snowfall in a single storm are hitting farmers in some parts of Kansas \u201cin ways that we haven\u2019t seen in this area for a very, very long time, potentially a lifetime,\u201d said Chip Redmond, a meteorologist at Kansas State University who developed an animal comfort tool. It includes an index of heat and cold that a farmer can use \u2014 along with their knowledge of their animals' age, coat, overall health and so forth \u2014 to watch for situations when they may need to get animals out of dangerous areas.",
      "The risk is real: Calves, especially, can die when temperatures slip below zero. And so much snow in rural areas can keep farmers from reaching herds with food and water, Redmond said.",
      "That means preparing by moving animals and having a plan to care for them ahead of time is key \u2014 which is harder due to the unpredictability of climate change. And not having the right experience or infrastructure to prepare is \u201creally, really stressful on producers,\u201d Redmond said.",
      "The storm missed some states further north like Iowa and Minnesota that are generally more accustomed to snow. Stu Swanson, president of the Iowa Corn Growers Association, said that eases tasks like moving grain and working with livestock.",
      "He added that without snow cover, the ground is more likely to freeze and thaw in a way that could benefit soils. Two years of drought followed by torrential rains last spring created tire ruts and compaction from farm machinery in some places, he said. He hopes that without as much snow, the freeze-thaw cycle will loosen up the soil and farmers may get the added bonus of some pests dying off before the spring.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any growing crop now, so really temperature doesn\u2019t matter. We look forward to a good freeze,\u201d Swanson said.",
      "The lack of snow is a greater concern farther north in some parts of Minnesota, where producers do have winter crops like alfalfa or winter wheat.",
      "Reliable snow cover is important in those areas because it insulates soil from cold. A few of inches of snow on top of a field can keep winter wheat\u2019s crown (which is still underground this time of year to withstand the winter) at 28 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2 Celsius) even if the air temperature is as low as minus 40 Fahrenheit (minus 40 Celsius), said Jochum Wiersma, an extension professor at the University of Minnesota.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot you can do, unfortunately,\u201d when ice breaks a plant's crown, said Martin Larsen, who grows alfalfa in addition to other crops like corn in southeastern Minnesota. He's concerned about the long-term trends, too \u2014 he pointed out last year's likely record warmth \u2014 and said he noticed the lack of snow cover in his region then, too.",
      "\u201cWe were so dry going into last spring and we were in the field almost a month before we normally do. I would say that concern exists this year as well,\" Larsen said.",
      "Gary Prescher, who has been farming a small grain operation for about 50 years in south-central Minnesota, said he's noticed more variability over the past six to 10 years. That's changing his long-term philosophy on the farm. He said he wants to make sure his operation can handle more extreme weather events, and that excess heat, cold, dryness, wetness or wind have \u201cforced some changes out here for me and my neighbors.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re just looking at averages, it\u2019s very deceiving,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's either all or none.\u201d",

      "All-wheel drive might not be a must-have, but it sure is nice to have if you live in any of the large swaths of America that regularly see snow. Certainly a good set of winter tires will get the job done much of the time, but if you want ultimate peace of mind, there\u2019s no substitute for all-wheel drive. Combine the two and you\u2019re virtually unstoppable.",
      "All-wheel drive was once rare in cars, but over the last 20 years it\u2019s become a much more common feature. Especially in the last 10 years, carmakers have added all-wheel drive to existing models as well as producing new all-wheel-drive models, helping to make this feature as affordable as it is ubiquitous.",

      "BMW\u2019s 3 Series sedans and 4 Series coupes are sport-luxury cars recognized for their engaging handling. With the exception of one generation of cars, the 3 Series has offered all-wheel drive in the U.S. since the mid-1980s when it debuted in the 325ix. And 4 Series coupes, introduced for the 2014 model year, have offered all-wheel drive since their inception. The most common 3 Series and 4 Series models on the used market today are contemporary trims fitted with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making in the mid-200-horsepower range.",
      "Look for: If you want more power, you can find BMW\u2019s 3.0-liter six-cylinder good for as much as 320 horsepower in upper trims. But you\u2019ll be trading power for condition or higher miles in this price range.",

All-wheel-drive trims have been available since the 2018 model year.",

Imprezas from the last decade are available in both sedan and hatchback body styles with either a 2.0-liter or a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, both of which made modest power. But every Impreza sold in the U.S. since 1997 is all-wheel-drive. There\u2019s nothing luxurious about the Impreza, but its combination of all-wheel drive and priced-right utility makes it great for winter driving.",

The upgrade engine is turbocharged and produces 250 horsepower (starting in 2021), but the base engine is fine. The Mazda 3 is an overachiever inside with premium materials that verge into luxury territory. It\u2019s also one of the most fun-to-drive cars in its class and its stunning good looks are hard to ignore. But it\u2019s smaller inside than many competitors.",

      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and other Republicans will push to limit lawsuits when the legislative session starts this month",
      "ATLANTA -- After years of stalled efforts to limit civil lawsuits, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Republican lawmakers are doubling down with a new push.",
      "Supporters, most prominently business groups, call the state a \u201cjudicial hellhole,\u201d and argue that businesses are being crushed by rising insurance costs driven by excessive lawsuits that have helped plaintiffs get big payouts.",
      "\u201cThis issue is not about business,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Steve Gooch, a Dahlonega Republican. \u201cIt\u2019s about every Georgian paying more and more premiums for their insurance. Whatever we can do to make it more affordable to own a home, operate your vehicle and protect your family with insurance, we need to do it.\u201d",
      "But opponents say there's no proof that lawsuits are closely linked to rising insurance rates and that limits will make it harder for injured parties to win justice in court.",
      "\u201cThis is about trying to do some favors for people who hopefully will line your political pockets,\u201d said Jen Jordan, an attorney and former Democratic state senator. \u201cAt the end of the day, Georgians are going to be hurt.\u201d",
      "Kemp in 2022 promised the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, one of his top allies, that he would seek to limit lawsuit costs, a push that many call \u201ctort reform.\u201d But he admitted in 2023 that the effort was complicated, and instead signed a law to gather data on lawsuit verdicts.",
      "Even as Kemp held events to build public support ahead of the legislative session, which begins Monday, the Republican governor is having to contend with GOP lawyers in the General Assembly who make a living by filing lawsuits, Democrats who mostly oppose changes, and a state Supreme Court that has voided earlier limits.",
      "One key issue is lawsuits against stores, apartment complexes and other businesses over crimes or injuries on their property. In one such lawsuit, Georgia mother Sheila Brooks sued Family Dollar and Dollar Tree last year after her son Lem Johnny Johnson IV was fatally shot at one of their south Atlanta stores.",
      "Police say the shooter wasn't a Family Dollar employee, but the lawsuit alleges that Family Dollar knew about earlier incidents \u201cinvolving gunshots, gunplay, assault, violent threats with weapons, and disturbing acts of violence\" at and near the location. The store should have taken more security measures to protect their customers, the complaint said.",
      "Supporters of lawsuit limits say property owners shouldn't be held responsible for the wrongdoing of customers and trespassers.",
      "\u201cIf we fix this problem, Georgia could be a much easier, well-perceived place for businesses and their insurers,\u201d said attorney Bill Custer. \u201cIt will fix our reputation as a bad-boy state.\u201d",
      "Nancy Palmer, a spokesperson for the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, said Georgia\u2019s legal landscape has driven insurance companies out, making it difficult for businesses to get adequate coverage. She said insurance costs have become \u201cuntenable\u201d across industries, affecting day care centers, grocery store owners, pharmacies, low-income housing providers and others in urban and rural areas alike.",
      "Darion Dunn, a managing partner at Atlantic Strategies, which develops affordable housing and is behind a micro community for previously unsheltered people known as \u201cThe Melody,\u201d said insurance companies are raising premiums or denying coverage in areas they label as \u201chigh crime\" due to concerns about litigation.",
      "\u201cBecause of these rising insurance costs, we\u2019ve had to walk away from projects that would otherwise have brought much-needed affordable housing,\" Dunn said.",
      "Dunn wants to see lawmakers limit the amount of compensation people can seek for non-economic damages such as emotional pain and suffering. Georgia\u2019s legislature capped such verdicts in 2005, but the state Supreme Court overturned the law in 2010 as unconstitutional.",
      "The Georgia Trial Lawyers Association disputes the idea that insurance costs are rising because of jury verdicts, and said in a statement that \u201cinsurance companies have continued to raise premiums despite making record profits.\u201d",
      "To limit a property owner's liability, lawmakers could limit the kind of evidence lawyers can use to prove property owners knew about the risk of incidents like Johnson's killing.",
      "Lawmakers could also instruct juries to assign a minimum amount of blame to the person who committed the crime. In an oft-cited 2023 case, a man was awarded almost $43 million in a lawsuit against CVS after he was shot in a CVS parking lot during an armed robbery. The jury found CVS 95% responsible for the shooting, the victim 5% responsible and assigned no responsibility to the shooter.",
      "These kinds of large verdicts are rare, said Madeline Summerville, an Atlanta attorney and political consultant for Democrats. She said large verdicts often result when insurers refuse to settle cases they should, and while some cases are \u201cfrivolous,\u201d most aren't.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t make legislation based on the fact that there\u2019s a minority of folks that are trying to game the system and then convince all of the people of Georgia that that\u2019s the majority of the cases that are coming through,\" Summerville said.",
      "Summerville is particularly worried about changes to medical malpractice lawsuits, where people sue medical providers for botched work. If medical practitioners aren't held accountable, the level of care will decline, she said.",
      "In a roundtable hosted by Kemp last fall, medical executives said insurance costs are rising and doctors fear working in Georgia because they might get sued. Van Loskoski, CEO of Stephens County Hospital in Toccoa, said the hospital couldn't recruit obstetricians because of the fear of lawsuits and stopped delivering babies in 2021. The hospital\u2019s medical malpractice premiums then fell by 13%, Loskoski said.",
      "Lawmakers also could consider other measures, including some similar to laws passed in Florida in 2023. For example, they could require attorneys to show jurors how much plaintiffs actually paid in medical bills, as opposed to \u201cphantom damages\u201d based on the amounts they were originally charged. Legislators could also order separate trials to determine who is at fault for medical damages and what those damages are.",

So have worries about other possible Trump policies, such as tax cuts, which could swell the U.S. government\u2019s debt and likewise push yields higher.",
      "Those higher yields make Treasury bonds more attractive to investors who might otherwise buy stocks, which in turn puts downward pressure on stock prices, and the super-safe bonds are paying notably more. The yield on a 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.69% from 4.63% shortly before the release of Tuesday\u2019s reports and from just 4.15% in early December.",

      "The U.S. Justice Department is suing several large landlords for allegedly coordinating to keep Americans\u2019 rents high",
      "DENVER -- The U.S. Justice Department is suing several large landlords for allegedly coordinating to keep Americans\u2019 rents high by using both an algorithm to help set rents and privately sharing sensitive information with their competitors to boost profits.",
      "The lawsuit arrives as U.S. renters continue to struggle under a merciless housing market, with incomes failing to keep up with rent increases. The latest figures show that half of American renters spent more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities in 2022, an all-time high.",
      "That means exhausting, day-to-day decisions between medications, groceries, school supplies and rent. It means eviction notices and protracted court cases in which children face the highest eviction rates, with 1.5 million evicted each year, according to Princeton University's Eviction Lab.",
      "While the housing crisis has been assigned several causes, including a slump in homes built over the last decade, the Justice Department's lawsuit claims major landlords are playing a part.",
      "The department, along with 10 states including North Carolina, Tennessee, Colorado and California, is accusing six landlords that collectively operate more than 1.3 million units in 43 states and the District of Columbia of scheming to avoid lowering rents.",
      "The landlord Greystar Real Estate Partners LLC, a defendant in the case, declined a request for comment from The Associated Press, but published an unsigned statement on its website.",
      "\u201cGreystar has and will conduct its business with the utmost integrity. At no time did Greystar engage in any anti-competitive practices,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe will vigorously defend ourselves in this lawsuit.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit accuses the landlords of sharing sensitive data on rents and occupancy with competing firms via email, phone calls or in groups. The information shared allegedly included renewal rates, how often they accept an algorithm's price recommendation, the use of concessions such as offering one month free, and even their approach to pricing for the next quarter.",
      "The Justice Department said one of the six landlords agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. The proposed settlement would restrict how the company can use their competitors' data and algorithms to set rents.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s action against RealPage and six major landlords seeks to end their practice of putting profits over people and make housing more affordable for millions of people across the country,\u201d said Doha Mekki, the acting assistant attorney general for the department\u2019s antitrust division in Tuesday\u2019s press release.",
      "Those landlords were added to an existing lawsuit against RealPage, which runs an algorithm that recommends rental prices to landlords. Prosecutors say the algorithm uses sensitive competitive information, allowing landlords to align their prices and avoid competition that would otherwise push down rents.",
      "Jennifer Bowcock, RealPage's senior vice president for communications, said in a statement to the AP that their software is used on fewer than 10% of rental units in the U.S., and that their price recommendations are used less than half the time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s past time to stop scapegoating RealPage \u2014 and now our customers -- for housing affordability problems when the root cause of high housing costs is the under-supply of housing,\u201d Bowcock said.",

      "Many European politicians have been left concerned by the attention. Musk\u2019s feed on his social network X is dotted with abusive language \u2014 labeling politicians \u201cstupid cretin\u201d and \u201csniveling cowards\u201d \u2014 as well as retweets of far-right and anti-immigrant accounts.",
      "Andrew Chadwick, professor of political communication at Loughborough University, said Musk is using X \u201ca bit like an old-style newspaper mogul,\u201d to promulgate his political views.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Musk start to align himself much more obviously with an international movement of the far right,\u201d Chadwick said. \u201dIf you look at the kinds of people who Musk himself is boosting on his platform \u2026 he\u2019s increasingly started to assemble a group of different right-wing influencers, many of them with large followings, and presenting their evidence as a basis for his interventions into European politics.\u201d",
      "Musk has inserted himself into politics in Germany, which is headed for a Feb. 23 election after center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz\u2019s fractious three-party coalition government collapsed.",
      "On Dec. 20, Musk wrote on X: \u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d a reference to the Alternative for Germany party, which is under observation by the domestic intelligence agency for suspected extremism.",

      "Scholz\u2019s response embodies the dilemma faced by European politicians \u2014 should they ignore and let Musk\u2019s comments go unchallenged, or engage and risk amplifying them?",
      "Scholz has said it\u2019s important to \u201cstay cool\u201d over personal attacks, but called Musk\u2019s involvement in German politics worrying. In a new year message, Scholz pointedly noted that Germany\u2019s way forward \u201cwill not be decided by the owners of social media channels\u201d but by German voters.",

      "\u201cSomeone cannot simply use their platform, wealth and connections to try to dictate how governments are formed in each nation,\u201d he told Parapolitika Radio. \u201cThis is becoming increasingly dangerous.\u201d",
      "Musk has increasingly focused on British politics since the center-left Labour Party was elected in July, calling Starmer an \u201cevil\u201d leader presiding over a \u201ctyrannical police state.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s recent focus is on child sexual abuse, particularly a series of cases that rocked northern England towns several years ago, in which groups of men, largely from Pakistani backgrounds, were tried for grooming and abusing dozens of mostly white girls. The cases have been used by far-right activists to link child abuse to immigration and Islam.",
      "Musk has accused Starmer of failing to bring perpetrators to justice when he was England\u2019s director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013 \u2014 a charge Starmer strongly denies.",
      "\u201cStarmer must go and he must face charges for his complicity in the worst mass crime in the history of Britain,\u201d Musk tweeted.",
      "Chadwick said \u201cthere\u2019s been a hesitancy on the part of the political elite in the U.K. to engage\u201d with Musk\u2019s \u201cincredibly inflammatory remarks.\u201d But Starmer changed tack Monday, condemning \u201clies and misinformation\u201d and accusing U.K. Conservative politicians who have echoed some of Musk\u2019s points of \u201camplifying what the far right are saying.\u201d",
      "\u201cI enjoy the cut and thrust of politics, the robust debate that we must have, but that\u2019s got to be based on facts and truth, not on lies,\u201d the prime minister said.",

      "Musk\u2019s X is under investigation by European authorities attempting to curb hatred, disinformation and other toxic content on social media. The European Union has launched infringement proceedings against X under the bloc\u2019s Digital Services Act, and EU spokesman Thomas Regnier said it will look at whether Musk's livestream interview Thursday with the AfD's Weidel gives inappropriate \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d to the party during a preelection period.",
      "Musk, a self-styled free-speech advocate, is critical of efforts to regulate social media. He has compared British attempts to weed out online misinformation through the Online Safety Act to censorship in the Soviet Union.",
      "Musk clearly enjoys baiting mainstream politicians on social media, but Chadwick said it \u201cremains to be seen\u201d whether his posting changes public attitudes or helps the causes he champions.",
      "And the political interventions carry risk for him. His comments are being watched closely by Tesla investors for signs he could be turning off car buyers who don\u2019t agree with his politics.",
      "Tesla is already struggling in Europe, where new registrations for Musk\u2019s electronic vehicles fell 13% in the first nine months of 2023, according to auto researcher Jato Dynamics. In Germany, Tesla registrations dropped 44%.",

      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to reject a bid by Nippon Steel to acquire U.S. Steel on national security grounds isn\u2019t the first time friction over trade and investment has irked Washington\u2019s closest ally in Asia.",
      "There have been plenty of scraps over trade in the past few decades, and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken sought to smooth ruffled feathers in a visit to Tokyo on Tuesday.",
      "Nippon Steel Chief Executive Eiji Hashimoto said the top Japanese steelmaker was standing firm on its proposed $15 billion friendly acquisition. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration\u2019s decision.",
      "But the assertion that the proposed deal could threaten U.S. national security has stung.",
      "Many in Japan see the decision as a betrayal by Washington after decades of U.S. pressure to lift barriers to investment and trade. The timing doesn\u2019t help, with Japanese businesses already bracing for potentially damaging tariff hikes once President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba was blunt in warning that spoiling the deal might hurt Japanese investment in the U.S.",
      "Here are some key issues at stake:",
      "While in Tokyo in a farewell tour before Biden leaves office, Blinken told reporters he believes that during the past four years the alliance with Japan has \u201cgrown stronger than it's ever been before.\u201d Japan and the U.S. are mutually the largest investors in each other's economies, he noted, \u201cstrengthening the foundation for many years to come.\u201d Japan's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the U.S. Steel decision came up during Blinken's meeting with Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya. But it said only that the two sides had \u201creaffirmed the importance of Japan-U.S. economic relations, including investment in the U.S. by Japanese companies.\u201d",
      "Before Blinken's visit, Ishiba, who has struggled to build support and momentum since he took office in October, was emphatic.",
      "\u201cAs for why national security was cited as an issue, it must be clearly explained. Otherwise, future discussions on the matter will come to naught,\u201d he said Monday. \"No matter how much we are an ally, I believe that the points I have just made are extremely important for our future relations.\u201d",
      "He said, \u201cIt is an unfortunate fact that Japanese industry has voiced concerns about future investment between the U.S. and Japan. We have to take this very seriously.\u201d",
      "Japan's Trade Minister Yoji Muto said the decision was \u201cvery regrettable.\u201d Headlines in Japanese newspapers mainly focused on Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel's plan to fight the ruling in court.",
      "Japan is the biggest and most important U.S. ally in Asia, a relationship forged during the U.S. occupation following Japan's 1945 defeat in World War II. Nearly 63,000 troops are stationed at dozens of facilities across the country and Washington has urged Japan to build up its own defense capabilities as a counterweight to China's growing influence and military power.",
      "Japan counts on the U.S. to provide an umbrella of defense against its neighbors China, Russia and North Korea. Some critics have chafed at the decision to reject Nippon Steel's bid for U.S. Steel, saying Washington was treating Japan like it does China, a potential adversary.",
      "\u201cWhen is an ally not a partner? Apparently when a Japanese company seeks to purchase an iconic U.S. corporation,\u201d The newspaper The Japan Times said in an editorial. It described the concerns over national security as \u201cincomprehensible,\u201d adding \u201cTrust has been greatly damaged and it is unclear what will be required to undo the harm.\u201d",
      "Biden and Trump have both supported higher tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum from China, saying they are needed to insulate American producers from unfair trade practices and a flood of cheap imports. In 2018, Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imports of Japanese steel on \u201cnational security\u201d grounds. The Biden administration agreed to a deal in 2022 to allow a certain quota of some steel products to be imported tariff-free. Any above that amount is subject to the 25% tariff.",
      "Today's trade frictions follow decades of negotiations that have led Japan to open its markets much more widely to foreign goods and services, transforming its retailing from mostly old-style department stores and mom-and-pop shops into outlet malls and big discount stores. Such \u201cgai-atsu,\u201d or foreign pressure, led Japanese automakers and other manufacturers chose to invest in U.S. factories, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel contend their deal would save American jobs, and business groups on both sides have objected to seeing the deal fall through as part of a broad shift in recent years away from greater openness."

      "Since the lightning rebel offensive that unseated Assad a month ago, Arab and Western countries that had cut off relations with the former government have been reopening diplomatic relations with Syria\u2019s new de facto authorities, headed by the Islamist former insurgent group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS.",
      "Syria\u2019s new foreign minister, Asaad al-Shibani, has traveled to Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in recent days. The Gulf countries are likely to be key to funding Syria\u2019s reconstruction after nearly 14 years of civil war that preceded Assad's ouster.",
      "On Tuesday, al-Shibani traveled to Jordan to meet with his counterpart in Amman. Jordan's foreign ministry said the officials were set to discuss \u201cmechanisms of cooperation in many areas including borders, security, energy, transportation, water, trade and other vital sectors.\u201d",
      "Under Assad's rule, Jordan had been a main conduit for smuggling highly addictive Captagon amphetamines produced in Syria into Gulf states, which was a point of tension between the two countries.",
      "Syria's new authorities have made a show of cracking down on the Captagon trade, dismantling former factories in locations including the Mazzeh air base in Damascus, a car trading company in Latakia and a factory that once made snack chips in the Damascus suburb of Douma.",
      "\u201cThe new situation in Syria has also ended the threats that previously threatened the security of the Kingdom (of Jordan), with regard to drugs and Captagon, and we pledge that this thing has ended and will not return again,\" al-Shibani said in a joint news conference with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi.",
      "Al-Safadi said that his country supports the Syrian people as they work to \u201crebuild their homeland on the foundations that preserve its security, stability, sovereignty and unity and fulfill the rights of its people,\u201d adding that Jordan is \u201cready to provide electricity to our brothers immediately, and we are also ready to work together to provide gas.\u201d",
      "Syria, targeted by stringent Western sanctions, has been in a prolonged economic crisis and Syrians receive only a few hours of state-provided electricity per day.",

      "Anything to get the ball into Mims' hands more, so he can show off those fast feet.",
      "The speedy returner/receiver/runner has become a dynamic, multifaceted threat for the playoff-bound Broncos \u2014 a game-changer on special teams and as part of the Bo Nix-led offense.",
      "\u201cIt puts a lot of stress on (the defense),\u201d offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said of Mims\u2019 versatility as the Broncos (10-7) prepare for their AFC wild-card round game Sunday at Buffalo (13-4). \u201cHe\u2019s a talented player, and you have to get creative sometimes to get him the ball. It\u2019s been working out well.\u201d",
      "The second-year player out of Oklahoma recently was named to the Pro Bowl squad as a return specialist for the second straight season. That's elite territory, with the only other player in Broncos history to be named to the Pro Bowl in each of his first two seasons being Von Miller, the talented pass rusher who\u2019s now tormenting quarterbacks for the Bills.",
      "\u201cAny time I can be recognized in the same stat as him, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d Mims said.",
      "The Broncos view Mims as their version of Cordarrelle Patterson, the longtime do-everything player now with the Pittsburgh Steelers. A facsimile, too, of San Francisco 49ers wideout Deebo Samuel.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been great to see the growth that you hope you see in a player in his second year,\u201d coach Sean Payton said of Mims. \u201cWe saw it right away as a returner a year ago, and we saw spurts. So it always just takes me back to, \u2018Are we doing things? Can we find a role?\u2019\u201d",
      "They've been patient not to heap too much on Mims too fast. Although, he's ready for any wrinkle in the playbook.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s just memorization for the most part,\u201d Mims said. \u201cIt\u2019s really just being a playmaker and making plays (in) a certain situation. It\u2019s never just picture perfect. At the end of the day, you just have to take what\u2019s there.\u201d",
      "As a receiver this season, Mims has 39 catches for 503 yards and six touchdowns. That includes two each in the last two games of the season, one of them a spectacular grab between two defenders on fourth down that sent Denver's game at Cincinnati into overtime two weeks ago.",
      "In the backfield, he\u2019s carried the ball 13 times for 42 yards.",
      "But his real specialty remains punt returns, where he had a league-leading 15.7-yard average, marking the first time a Broncos player has led the NFL in that category since Rick Upchurch averaged 16.1 yards in 1982.",
      "\u201cI love being a punt returner. I feel like there are so many plays to be made at punt return,\u201d said Mims, who's also returned seven kicks for a 27.7-yard average. \u201cThat\u2019s probably my favorite thing that I get to do.\u201d",
      "He nearly broke a punt return this season against Indianapolis, cutting across the field and sprinting along the sideline for 61 yards in the fourth quarter of a game the Broncos trailed. It set up a go-ahead touchdown in a must-win game that propelled Denver toward its first playoff berth in nine seasons.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been such an asset for us,\u201d special teams coordinator Ben Kotwica said. \u201cThe punt return element, he\u2019s been exceptional again this year.\u201d",
      "Mims knows the uplifting power that a punt return has on the team because receiver Courtland Sutton reminds him all the time.",
      "\u201cEven if it\u2019s 10 yards, it\u2019s such a big momentum change for us,\u201d Sutton said. \u201cJust to see him running with the ball \u2014 he\u2019s an exciting guy with the ball in his hands \u2014 and watching him go down the sidelines a couple times, it\u2019s exciting because at any moment you know that he could take it to the crib.\u201d",
      "Mims' big receiving games this season include not only an eight-catch, two-touchdown performance at Cincinnati, but a 93-yard TD reception from Nix in a win over Cleveland.",
      "\u201cIt was one of those awesome plays that you don\u2019t get often,\u201d Nix said. \u201cBut they\u2019re pretty fun.\u201d",

      "It was some combination of religion, a grudge involving Knute Rockne and a rival, and maybe the simple time-honored notion that some people just don\u2019t like Notre Dame",
      "DANIA BEACH, Fla. -- It was some combination of religion, a grudge involving Knute Rockne and maybe the simple notion that some people just don't like Notre Dame.",
      "Back in the 1920s, the Fighting Irish made what might have been their biggest push to join what would become the Big Ten but the athletic director at Michigan blocked it. Ever since, Notre Dame has been an independent \u2014 an increasingly rare iconoclast as college athletics becomes more controlled by mega-conferences almost by the day.",
      "How's that working out for the Irish?",
      "Well, instead of splitting the $14 million they've earned by reaching the semifinals of the College Football Playoff \u2014 the way Thursday's opponent Penn State of the Big Ten must \u2014 they've pocketed every penny.",
      "Notre Dame might not have the voice of the Southeastern Conference or Big Ten when it comes to the big-time decisions guiding this sport, but it has a seat at the table, along with another $12 million starting in 2026 \u2014 also unsplit with a league \u2014 simply for being part of this arrangement.",
      "\u201cFor people at Notre Dame, it's a point of differentiation,\u201d said John Heisler, the longtime sports information guru who has written 10 books on the Irish. \u201cAnd it's just not something that anybody in South Bend really wants to give up on.\u201d",
      "It wasn't always that way. As far back as 1899, Notre Dame was looking to be admitted into what was about to become the Big Nine. That time, it essentially got passed over in favor of Iowa and Indiana.",
      "A generation later, in 1926, Rockne, then coaching the Fighting Irish, tried again to bring Notre Dame into the Big Ten.",
      "Michigan's athletic director, Fielding Yost, led the move to block the Irish \u2014 a move that, depending on what you read, came because he was anti-Catholic or involved in a feud with the Notre Dame legend that dated back more than a decade.",
      "Either way, Notre Dame was left out and the Fighting Irish and Michigan, just a three-hour drive apart, didn't play from 1910-1941.",
      "Michigan and other schools' refusal to play the team in South Bend, Indiana, opened opportunities Notre Dame still takes advantage of to this day.",
      "The Fighting Irish have played USC every year since 1926. They have annual meetings with Army and Navy, and have played Stanford most years since 1988. More recently, they signed a deal that fills out their schedule with five games against Atlantic Coast Conference teams each season.",
      "In today's world, where cable, streaming and social media allow for every team to market themselves as a national product, that might not sound revolutionary. Decades ago, it was.",
      "\u201cI think the feeling was, if Notre Dame would have just wanted to be a Midwest institution, they would've joined the Big Ten a long time ago,\u201d Heisler said. \u201cBut that's not just the aspiration in terms of where their students in general come from, or where they recruit. They've always been very comfortable recruiting from all over the place.\u201d",
      "For decades, Notre Dame lived in a world where the big-name independent was not an anomaly. Miami, Pitt, Florida State and Syracuse were among them, as was this week's opponent, Penn State.",
      "In that atmosphere, the Fighting Irish went along with others in the 1970s and joined the College Football Association, which was established to maximize value for TV rights.",
      "By 1990, with the CFA's effectiveness as a TV market-maker in decline and Notre Dame football reaching a new golden era under Lou Holtz, the Fighting Irish in 1991 cut their own deal with NBC that, in many ways, was the first domino to fall on the multibillion-dollar road this sport is on today.",
      "The SEC expanded to 12 teams in 1992 and added what was then a revolutionary title game to cap off its season. Over the next three-plus decades, virtually every program got caught up in the mix of mega-conferences that, in turn, have helped shape the 12-team college playoff that debuted this season.",
      "Holding steady throughout, in part thanks to the NBC deal that runs through the 2029 season, has been Notre Dame. Even though the Irish haven't won the national title since 1988, their brand stayed strong enough to demand a spot in that playoff mix.",
      "One drawback is that, without a conference championship available to win, the Fighting Irish could not find an easier path to the title by earning a bye that goes to those league's champions.",
      "Another is that because the big conferences have generated such massive media rights, Notre Dame needs every penny it can get to stay competitive. Its football program has one of the nation's biggest budgets, at about $72 million a year, according to Sportico.",
      "\u201cWe view being independent as a positive thing,\" coach Marcus Freeman said. \"We sell it to our recruits as a positive thing. We know we can't play in a championship game and we can't have a first-round bye. But we continue to use not playing in Week 13 as our bye. In terms of the finances and the TV deals, I'd say that's another positive.\u201d",
      "More change is destined for college football, its playoff system and the conferences themselves.",
      "At the joint pregame news conference Wednesday, Penn State coach James Franklin opined about the need for more uniformity across all of college football \u2014 for one, to give the playoff selection committee a more \u201capples to apples\u201d comparison when sorting through teams to fill the bracket.",
      "\u201cThis is no knock at coach or Notre Dame, but I think everyone should be in a conference,\" Franklin said, before almost apologetically looking at Freeman on the other end of the table.",
      "Freeman said he doesn't have opinions as strong as Franklin's on the state of college football, and doesn't see the need for Notre Dame to someday be like everybody else.",
      "\u201cWe pride ourselves and our independence,\u201d the Fighting Irish coach said. \u201cIf they come out with a decision where they tell us we can't be independent, we'll make it work.\u201d",

      "MIAMI -- Hockey. Outdoors. In Florida.",
      "Next season, the NHL is making it happen \u2014 twice.",
      "The NHL announced Wednesday that the Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers will play host to the New York Rangers at loanDepot Park in Miami \u2014 home of baseball\u2019s Marlins \u2014 on Jan. 2, 2026, in the Winter Classic, with the Tampa Bay Lightning playing host to the Boston Bruins at Raymond James Stadium on Feb. 1, 2026, in a Stadium Series game.",
      "\u201cStanley Cups, strings of sellouts and the exponential growth of youth and high school hockey throughout the state have demonstrated that Florida is a hockey hotbed,\u201d NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said. \u201cOutdoor NHL games in the Sunshine State? Never let it be said that our league isn\u2019t willing to accept a challenge.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a long time coming, but the Panthers and Lightning have represented the Eastern Conference in each of the last five Stanley Cup Finals and they've built heavily engaged fan bases. And both franchises have asked the NHL to bring an outdoor game \u2014 or two, in this case \u2014 to the Sunshine State for many years.",
      "The league listened.",
      "\u201cTo be able to celebrate these two franchises against great Original Six teams, I think, is phenomenal,\u201d Panthers President Matthew Caldwell said. \u201cAnd I think our time has come. We deserve that outdoor game and we\u2019re fired up to have it right here locally.\u201d",
      "The Marlins\u2019 ballpark, located about a 45-minute drive south of the Panthers' home arena in Sunrise, can hold about 37,000 fans. Raymond James Stadium \u2014 home of the NFL\u2019s Tampa Bay Buccaneers \u2014 can hold about 65,000 for most events, and capacity can be increased a bit if necessary.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t be more excited for this landmark event to finally arrive for Bolts Nation and the Tampa Bay community,\u201d Lightning CEO Steve Griggs said. \u201cThis moment has been a long time coming, and we\u2019re thrilled to see this dream become a reality.\u201d",
      "These will not be ordinary outdoor games.",
      "The high in Miami on Jan. 2 this year was 78. The high in Tampa last year on Feb. 1 was 66. Those temperatures aren't conducive to finding ice outside. And the high game-time temperature for any of the previous outdoor games in NHL history, the league said, was 65 for a game in Denver in 2016.",
      "\u201cWe understand it\u2019s risky,\" said Steve Mayer, the NHL's president of content and events. \"I think we like it. And it\u2019s not a challenge. It\u2019s actually an opportunity for us.\u201d",
      "The Marlins' loanDepot Park has a retractable roof and that will play a big role in getting that stadium ready for hockey. The air conditioning will be cranked up \u2014 way up \u2014 and the Panthers-Rangers game will be played at night with the roof open. For the Lightning-Bruins game inside the open-air stadium in Tampa, the NHL will build a temporary roof over the ice surface and remove it just a few hours before game time.",
      "\u201cWe want to bring a little bit of a winter wonderland to Florida,\u201d Mayer said.",
      "The games in 2026 will be the 44th and 45th regular-season outdoor contests in NHL history. The Rangers are 5-0-0 in their previous outdoor games, Boston has won four of its five outdoor games and the Lightning prevailed in their only outdoor contest. The Panthers have never played such a game.",
      "\u201cWe get to expand our great sport,\" Panthers general manager and hockey operations president Bill Zito said. \"We have a chance to have 100,000 people watching hockey live, outside, in Florida. That's unthinkable. And the exciting part and the fun part is it\u2019s growing. It\u2019s getting bigger. More and more people are becoming hockey fans in Florida.\"",

      "Actually, for tennis, 2025 began while the calendar still read 2024.",
      "\u201cI do, obviously, wish that the offseason was longer, 100%,\u201d said 2023 U.S. Open champion Coco Gauff, who began her \u201cyear\u201d by helping the American team win the United Cup title in Sydney, more than a week after that competition began on Dec. 27. \u201cBut it is what it is.\u201d",
      "When the Australian Open gets going Sunday morning in Melbourne (Saturday night EST), players will have tuned up by playing in various events that followed a period of practice and work in the gym that was longer for some than others.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say there is even an offseason anymore,\u201d 2021 Wimbledon semifinalist Denis Shapovalov said. \u201cThe season is never-ending.\u201d",
      "For the record, last season officially and finally wrapped up for good on Dec. 22, when Brazil's Jo\u00e3o Fonseca won the ATP Next Gen Finals in Saudi Arabia. He was back on a court later in December for the Challenger Tour stop in Canberra, Australia \u2014 which he also won.",
      "The golf season is similar, essentially running non-stop, without the multiple months off offered by team sports.",
      "\u201cFor a long time, we (have been) fighting to have a longer offseason. To be healthy \u2026 you at least need a two-month offseason. So it would be great to finish a little bit earlier,\u201d said Conchita Martinez, a former player who won the 1994 Wimbledon championship and is now the coach of Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva.",
      "\u201cFor the health of the tour, for the health of the players,\" Martinez said, \"maybe (the season) should be a little bit shorter.\u201d",
      "This is, to be sure, not a new concern.",
      "Yet nothing seems to have changed. If anything, the problem is becoming more pronounced.",
      "And to Martinez's point, the opening week of this season included two singles finals in which one player stopped playing \u2014 Naomi Osaka in Auckland, New Zealand, and Reilly Opelka in Brisbane, Australia \u2014 because of an injury concern (it's also likely they wanted to make sure not to push themselves too hard with the year's first Grand Slam tournament on the horizon).",
      "That's why, as much as possible, the athletes try to find some down time before getting ready to ramp up for what's to come.",
      "\u201cI had 1\u00bd weeks that I didn\u2019t touch the tennis racket. I just threw it in my room. I didn\u2019t want to see it again,\u201d four-time major champ Carlos Alcaraz joked. \u201cIt was really helpful to disconnect a little bit.\u201d",
      "They say they view the time between seasons, however brief it might be, as an opportunity for a combination of rest and relaxation \u2014 the Maldives is a popular vacation spot, as a glance at player' social media makes clear \u2014 along with training and preparation, with an eye on trying to improve in some way.",
      "\u201cYou take a bit of a break. But you need to get right back on the court and in the gym to get ready for Australia,\u201d said Jasmine Paolini, the runner-up at the French Open and Wimbledon in 2024. \u201cAs soon as you can, you need to practice, but there isn\u2019t a lot of time, so you have to figure out how to schedule things.\"",
      "Ben Shelton, a big server who was a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open and U.S. Open two years ago, spent time on his return game this offseason. He was representing the United States at the Davis Cup in Spain in late November, then playing an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden in early December, before heading to his new home, Orlando, Florida, to get ready for January.",
      "Unlike many players, he skipped any competition in the first week of 2025, instead opting to enter an event in Auckland this week before heading to Melbourne.",
      "The mind-set, Shelton explains, amounts to: \u201cOh, I\u2019m six weeks off; I\u2019m not really \u2018match tough\u2019 right now.\"",
      "Some fans wonder why he and others opt to participate in exhibitions at all, but players say those don't take the same sort of toll that a day-after-day tournament, or even every-other-day Slam event, does. Hard to argue with someone choosing to make a little extra money on the side, too.",
      "And players make the case that no matter how much they can switch off in November or December, part of the issue is there are not many chances to do that during other months.",
      "\u201cIdeally we\u2019d have a little bit more time. It\u2019s such a short turnaround ... after such a long season. There\u2019s not enough days to recover,\u201d said Alexei Popyrin, an Australian who upset Novak Djokovic at last year's U.S. Open. \u201cTaking time off to let your body rest might hinder the preparation, but at the end of the day, you need your body to be ready. The schedule is just so hectic throughout the year.\u201d",

      "\u201cAt the end of the day we are a team and we are all tied together, we're all accountable for the results of each night how our season ends up,\" Curry said. \u201cIt's not just a me and Draymond thing, it's not just a me thing, it's a we thing. So what we all need to do is play with confidence, play with assertiveness, play with a belief that when you step on the floor you can beat anybody. Whether it happens or not that has to be the mindset.\u201d",
      "The Warriors missed the playoffs last year then began this season a promising 12-3 and with championship aspirations as Curry and Draymond Green try to add to the four titles they've captured together.",
      "\u201cWhen you experience winning you hate losing even more,\u201d Curry said.",
      "Now, Golden State is 18-18 and tied for ninth place with San Antonio in the jammed-up Western Conference. The Warriors were a 10th seed last season and were eliminated by the Kings in the play-in tournament.",

      "Frustrated fans flocked for the exits early for a second straight game at Chase Center, where the blowout by the Kings still stung.",
      "\u201cI expected better energy. I think we're suffering from a crisis of confidence right now frankly,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cYou can see it, you can feel it. I don't mind missed shots but I mind when missed shots affect the defense and the attitude. We feel deflated right now and there's no room for feeling sorry for ourselves in the NBA. In life in general. We can't let disappointment dictate our approach to a game, we have to do the opposite. We have to bring more fire, we have to outcompete our opponents when things aren't going our way.\u201d",

At Oklahoma State last year he averaged 15 points and four assists on a team that went 12-20.",
      "He chose West Virginia because he was familiar with DeVries\u2019 system at Drake and knew Chester Frazier, who spent the last three seasons as an assistant at Illinois and is now West Virginia\u2019s associate head coach. Frazier brought current WVU players Sencire Harris and Amani Hansberry with him.",
      "\u201cI just do what the team needs me to do,\u201d Small said.",
      "Small and the Mountaineers will be challenged to keep up the pace.",
      "Small has logged the most minutes in the league. Upper body injuries have sidelined standout teammates Tucker DeVries and Jayden Stone. DeVries, a two-time Missouri Valley Conference player of the year at Drake, has missed six games while Stone, a prolific scorer at Detroit Mercy last season, has yet to play this season. Hansberry missed a game last week with an ankle injury.",
      "They'll also have to continue leaning hard on their defense, which had held four opponents to 50 or fewer points.",
      "\u201cDefense is all about communication,\u201d Small said. \u201cWe all understand our spots as far as where we\u2019re supposed to be. But if there\u2019s no communication, something might slip up or break down, then we won\u2019t know what to do. So you\u2019ve always got to talk.\u201d",
      "The depleted lineup took a hit Tuesday night. Small scored 17 points but no other Mountaineers were in double figures in a 75-56 loss to Arizona that snapped West Virginia's seven-game winning streak.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fine. Injuries happen, foul trouble happens,\u201d Darian DeVries said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to play. That\u2019s just part of it.\u201d",
      "Instead, he said his players weren't as physical and aggressive as in previous games.",
      "\u201cOur formula is the same,\u201d he said. \"We have to play a certain way to be successful. We understand our margin for error is not very big. If we deviate from that at all, these are the results that we get.\u201d",
      "Still, midway through the season, West Virginia has beaten three ranked teams, including a nonconference win against Arizona in November, and has already surpassed last year's win total.",
      "Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said he's impressed with how Darian DeVries has turned West Virginia around with an entirely new roster, especially considering the injuries.",
      "\u201cI mean, you win some of these close games, you beat an Arizona, you beat a Gonzaga, you beat Kansas. Are you kidding me?\" Lloyd said. \"If I was that guy\u2019s agent, I would have two more years in that contract right now.\u201d",

      "___",
      "The impressive feats from the 2024 rookie quarterback class will carry over into the postseason.",
      "Washington's Jayden Daniels and Denver's Bo Nix are expected to make their playoff debuts on Sunday in a rare case of two rookie starting quarterbacks in the same postseason.",
      "While there are a few examples of fill-in rookies getting the nod in the playoffs, this will be just the fourth time that two rookie quarterbacks start in the same postseason after making at least six starts during the regular season.",
      "It last happened in 2012 when Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III and Russell Wilson all got playoff starts. The other times came in 2008 with Matt Ryan and Joe Flacco, and 1983 with Hall of Famers John Elway and Dan Marino.",
      "Only seven rookie quarterbacks have won playoff starts and there's never been a year when more than one did it. A rookie quarterback has never started in the Super Bowl with Brock Purdy (2022), Mark Sanchez (2009), Flacco (2008), Ben Roethlisberger (2004) and Shaun King (1999) all losing in the conference title game.",
      "Daniels and Nix have already had barrier-breaking seasons with both QBs winning at least 10 starts, producing at least 30 touchdowns rushing and passing, and accounting for at least 4,000 yards of offense on the ground and through the air.",
      "Before this season, no rookie QB had ever hit all those marks in a season.",
      "Daniels and Nix have some company when it comes to young quarterbacks with a record-tying 11 of the 14 projected starters in the postseason in their 20s.",
      "That includes four members of the 2018 draft class with Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold, Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson all having made the playoffs. This is the fifth time four QBs from the same draft class started in the same postseason with the 2018 class also doing it last season with Mason Rudolph getting the nod instead of Darnold.",
      "This year\u2019s version of the playoffs will have a familiar look.",
      "Ten of the teams that made the postseason are back after getting there last season with only Denver, Minnesota, Washington and the Chargers breaking through after missing out in 2023.",
      "The four newcomers are tied for the fewest since the NFL expanded to 12 playoff teams in 1990 with that last happening in 2015. The four previous seasons with 14 playoff teams featured at least six newcomers each season with seven new teams qualifying in 2022 and eight in 2020.",
      "All four division winners in the AFC are repeat champions with Kansas City (nine straight), Buffalo (five), Baltimore (two) and Houston (two) all going back-to-back. The only other times since the 2002 realignment that all four division winners in a conference repeated came in the 2019 AFC and the 2012 AFC.",
      "Tampa Bay won its fourth straight NFC South title and Detroit won its second straight in the NFC North, marking the third time there were six repeat division winners. It previously happened in 2012 and 2014.",
      "When it came to individual accomplishments, few teams fared better than the Cincinnati Bengals. It just didn't lead to success on the field.",
      "Ja'Marr Chase became the fifth player since the 1970 merger to win a receiving Triple Crown, leading the NFL in catches, yards receiving and TD receptions.",
      "Joe Burrow led the league in yards passing and TD passes, while Trey Hendrickson had the most sacks.",
      "No team had ever had the individual leaders in all of those categories but it didn't help the Bengals, who finished 9-8 and missed the playoffs.",
      "Posting a winning record once again wasn't good enough for the Seattle Seahawks to make the playoffs.",
      "A year after going 9-8 but missing out on the final wild-card spot to Green Bay on the strength of victory tiebreaker, the Seahawks were done in again by that seldom used tiebreaker.",
      "Seattle tied the Rams for first in the NFC West at 10-7 after splitting the season series. The teams also had identical records in the division, against common opponents and in conference games. The Rams came out ahead because the teams they beat combined for two more wins than the teams the Seahawks beat.",
      "Seattle became just the second 10-win team to miss the playoffs since the seventh team was added in each conference in 2020, with Miami also falling short after going 10-6 in 2020. Twelve other teams that won at least 10 games missed the postseason from 1990-2019, when there were six playoff teams per conference.",
      "The Seahawks became the fourth team to miss the playoffs in back-to-back seasons with winning records since 2000, with Cincinnati also falling short after going 9-8 for the second straight season. Miami came up short twice in back-to-back winning seasons, missing out on the postseason in 2002-03 and 2020-21.",
      "The Pittsburgh Steelers are stumbling into the postseason.",
      "The Steelers lost their final four games to go from being a team fighting for the top seed to a team that is the second wild-card and a heavy underdog Saturday night at AFC North champion Baltimore.",
      "Pittsburgh is just the third team to enter the playoffs on a losing streak of at least four games and the first to do it since Detroit in 1999. The Lions snuck in as a wild-card team at 8-8 that season and then lost 27-13 to Washington.",
      "The 1986 New York Jets were more similar to the Steelers, getting off to a 10-1 start before losing their final five games. New York recovered to beat Kansas City in the wild-card game before losing in double overtime at Cleveland in the divisional round.",
      "Pittsburgh has another losing streak to worry about, having lost five straight playoff games starting with the 2016 AFC title game at New England. A loss to the Ravens would leave the Steelers tied with the fourth longest playoff losing streak ever, trailing only Detroit (nine), Cincinnati (eight) and Kansas City (eight).",

      "PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- Ludvig Aberg will be the answer to a trivia question: He made the first birdie in TGL history.",
      "And with that, the indoor golf competition that Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy had envisioned for years was finally underway.",
      "TGL had its debut match Tuesday night, with Rickie Fowler, Matt Fitzpatrick and Xander Schauffele of New York Golf Club taking on Shane Lowry, Wyndham Clark and Aberg of The Bay Golf Club in the opener. The 15-hole match took just under two hours, which is exactly how TGL envisioned this to work. Final score: The Bay 9, New York 2.",
      "\u201cThe last time I've had that much fun was probably last September,\u201d Lowry said, turning toward Clark as he said that \u2014 the obvious reference being how he and Aberg were part of the European Ryder Cup team that beat Clark and the United States in the fall of 2023.",
      "Yes, trash talk is part of TGL as well \u2014 even among teammates.",
      "\u201cLook, I had an amazing two hours,\u201d Lowry said.",
      "Lowry struck the first shot at 9:15 p.m. Four minutes later, the first hole in TGL history was complete when Aberg rolled in a 9-footer for the first point in league play. Yes, it moves that quickly.",
      "\u201cThis was just a dream conjured up,\u201d Woods said on the ESPN broadcast. \u201cRory and I were talking about it; it's hard to believe that dream came into reality and we were able to take golf into another stratosphere, really.\u201d",
      "Woods and McIlroy \u2014 part of the brain trust that put together this venture \u2014 were there, as expected. DJ Khaled was there too, milling about while players were warming up, showing off his swing with an imaginary club.",
      "The venue is a 250,000-square-foot facility at Palm Beach State College. Players hit some shots into a video screen, some off real grass, some off turf, and the bunkers are not just real sand \u2014 it's sand from Augusta National Golf Club, the same sand Woods has at his home practice facility. It's super-high-tech, with data collected off every shot.",
      "\u201cNobody had more fun than us,\u201d Clark said.",
      "Players wore microphones, there were betting options and fans surrounded the \u201ccourse\u201d in an intimate arena where music blared and noise was welcomed.",
      "\u201cA glorified man cave in a way,\u201d Fowler said.",
      "Once teams moved within 50 yards of the pin, they headed to a short-game complex \u2014 with a green that sits on a 41-yard-wide turntable and has about 600 devices underneath to change the contours. Players said it was difficult to make putts, which might be understandable.",
      "Fans cheered. And they booed \u2014 a little, anyway. Schauffele heard those after he botched a chip, part of a night where not much went right for his team.",
      "\u201cI probably would have booed me too,\u201d Schauffele said.",
      "The players seemed to love it. Lowry had one-liner after one-liner. A couple of examples:",
      "\u2014 \u201cI'm going to be the Scottie Scheffler of indoor golf.\u201d",
      "\u2014 \u201cA bit like myself. A bit chunky,\u201d he said after one shot came up a touch short.",
      "It ended with a 729-yard par-5 \u2014 a reachable 729-yard par-5, if that makes any sense. Handshakes and cheers all around when it was over, Lowry gave a big wave to the fans and the night was done.",
      "\u201cSo much fun,\" Aberg said.",
      "Woods loved it when some fans were, let's say, not exactly quiet as Clark lined up a putt on one of the early holes.",
      "\u201cYou don't normally hear that at events,\u201d Woods said. \u201cYou're going to hear that here.\u201d",
      "Woods is expected to debut for his Jupiter Links club on Jan. 14. McIlroy's debut could be Jan. 27 when Boston Common plays Jupiter Links. The regular season goes until March 4. There are 24 players \u2014 six teams of four \u2014 and the top four teams advance to the playoffs with a best-of-three championship series two weeks before the Masters.",
      "Each team activates three players for a match, and the 15-hole competitions will be done in about two hours. It'll all be shown on ESPN platforms, often in prime time. The league has been in the works for a few years; the original plan was for it to start last year, but a storm slowed construction and organizers pushed the debut back to 2025.",
      "\u201cIt's not traditional golf, yes,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBut it is golf. And that's the main thing.\u201d",
      "And, as Fowler pointed out, the crowd in the arena is one thing, but how television viewers accept it will be the big test.",
      "\u201cIf it does well there, the sky\u2019s the limit with what you can do,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cYou can put up arenas in different places. This is just the start.\u201d",

      "The wife of late San Diego Padres owner Peter Seidler, Sheel Seidler, sued brothers-in-law Matthew and Robert on Monday, attempting to prevent another brother, John, from taking control of the team rather than her.",
      "The suit comes at a time when the Padres are among the teams recruiting Japanese pitcher Roki Sasaki.",
      "In a petition filed in Travis County Probate Court in Austin, Texas, Sheel Seidler sued Matthew, who became executor of Peter Seidler's estate last year, and Robert, the prior executor. She claimed fiduciary breaches of trust, fraud, conversion and egregious acts of self-dealing.",
      "The petition accused Robert\u2019s wife Alecia of making \u201cmultiple racist, profane and hateful communications directed at Sheel \u2014 a woman of lndian descent.\u201d",
      "\u201cDefendants\u2019 actions to wrest control of the Padres were undertaken to force Sheel \u2014 a women, an interloper and an Indian-American woman not of O\u2019Malley descent \u2014 from what Bob and Matt saw as their family business and ancestral right,\u201d the petition claimed.",
      "Sheel asked that Matthew be enjoined from acting on behalf of the Seidler trusts and be removed as trustee. She asked the court to void any actions to appoint anyone other than Sheel as the Padres\u2019 control person.",
      "\u201cI made this decision as a very last resort, but I am confident it is the right one and the best way to protect the Padres franchise and ensure the vision that Peter and I shared for the team will continue,\u201d Sheel said in a statement.",
      "The Peter Seidler Trust issued a statement calling the suit \u201centirely without merit.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeter had a clear estate plan,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe plan specifically named three of his nine siblings, with whom he had worked closely for many decades, as successor trustees of his trust and Peter himself prohibited Sheel from ever serving as trustee.\u201d",
      "Peter Seidler, a grandson of late Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley, was an investor in the group that took over the Padres in 2012. He replaced Ron Fowler as the team's control person on Nov. 18, 2020, and died at age 63 on Nov. 14, 2023. Three days later, the team appointed Eric Kutsenda, a Peter Seidler business partner, as interim control person.",
      "San Diego said on Dec. 21 that John will become the control person, a move that Major League Baseball owners have not yet approved.",
      "\u201cMatt has attempted to intimidate Sheel into silence, threatening her if she were to make public her opposition to John\u2019s unwarranted nomination as control person,\u201d the petition said.",
      "San Diego, which has never won a World Series title, reduced major league player payroll from a team record $257 million in 2023 to $166 million at the start of the 2024 season.",
      "\u201cThe emphasis in the press reports on the Padres cutting salary, lowering their expectations, and implicitly abandoning their all-out pursuit of a World Series championship would have been a gut-punch to Peter,\u201d the petition said.",
      "The petition included a piece of paper purported to be in Peter Seidler's handwriting listing Sheel followed by their children as his preference for future control person. The petition quotes Matthew as telling Sheel in a letter last Oct. 15 that she lacks \u201cthe experience, skills and financial acumen necessary to fulfill the responsibilities of this important role.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than appoint Sheel as Padres control person \u2014 consistent with Peter\u2019s noted preference and as the person whose interests are best aligned with the Seidler trusts \u2014 defendants are attempting to force the appointment of their brother John as the Padres control person,\" the petition alleged.",
      "\u201cBy doing so, they are placing control of the Padres and the Seidler trusts\u2019 substantial interests in the hands of a third party and enjoying the appearance and benefits of being principal owners. Meanwhile, defendants have frozen Sheel out of the Padres organization and deprived her of the benefits of being the largest beneficial owner of the baseball team, while themselves enjoying those benefits.\u201d",
      "The trust statement said \u201cthe trustee is exclusively responsible for designating the San Diego Padres\u2019 next control person\u201d and added \u201cin 2020, in connection with Peter\u2019s appointment as control person, Sheel agreed in a sworn document that she had no right to be or to designate the control person and that she would not interfere with the designated control person.\u201d",
      "She accused Matthew and Robert of attempting to sell the trusts' interests in Seidler Kutsenda Management Co. at below market value and then rescinding the sale when the attempt became known.",
      "\"Alecia made clear that Sheel was an outsider unworthy of being part of the Seidler family and that she was foolish to believe that the Seidler family would ever act in her best interests,\u201d the petition alleged.",
      "The petition also said Robert and Matthew \u201cmade clear that Sheel and her children are not welcome in the owners' box at the Padres' stadium, Petco Park.\u201d",

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- After some uncertainty, the Tampa Bay Rays now support a $55.7 million city plan to repair hurricane-shredded Tropicana Field in time for the 2026 season opener, while the team prepares to play this year at the New York Yankees' spring training home in nearby Tampa.",
      "Matt Silverman, the Rays' co-president, said in an email to the St. Petersburg chief administrator that the team wants to \u201cclear up\u201d any questions about its support for the reconstruction. The city must pay for the work under its current contract with the Rays.",
      "\u201cWhile we had been open to considering a scenario in which the city bought out of its obligation to rebuild the ballpark, the Rays support and expect the city to rebuild Tropicana Field in accordance with the terms of the current use agreement,\u201d Silverman wrote.",
      "Hurricane Milton tore the Trop's fabric roof to pieces when it came ashore Oct. 9, causing water and other damage to interior parts of the now-exposed ballpark. Work has been ongoing to ensure no further damage is caused by weather but there had been questions about the full repair in part because it would eventually be torn down to make way for a new, $1.3 billion ballpark under current plans to keep the Rays in St. Petersburg another 30 years.",
      "Time is of the essence, Silverman said in his Dec. 30 email to the city, which released it Monday. Even a partial 2026 season at Tropicana Field \u201cwould present massive logistical and revenue challenges for the team,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cIt is therefore critical that the rebuild start in earnest as soon as possible\" with a realistic construction schedule to be ready by opening day 2026, he added.",
      "The city had no immediate comment on the email. Its own architect presented the repair proposal initially on Dec. 12 but it has not yet been fully approved. Members of the city council have balked at the cost, especially with residents and businesses still recovering from Milton and Hurricane Helene before that.",
      "St. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch has said that insurance and Federal Emergency Management Agency funds should cover the bulk of the cost. Silverman said Major League Baseball has told the team it will hire its own advisor to monitor the repair work and timeline.",
      "The planned new downtown Rays ballpark is part of a $6.5 billion project that will include affordable housing, a Black history museum, retail and office space, restaurants and bars. The project is known as the Historic Gas Plant District, which was once a thriving Black community displaced by the construction of the ballpark and an interstate highway.",
      "The Rays are preparing to play 2025 home games at Steinbrenner Field, the Yankees' 11,000-seat spring training location in Tampa. Once Tropicana Field is repaired, Silverman acknowledged the Rays are obligated to play there three more seasons under the contract with St. Petersburg.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to a grand reopening,\u201d Silverman said.",

      "Novak Djokovic says he still feels a bit of trauma when he travels to Australia",
      "Novak Djokovic said he still feels \u201ca bit of trauma\u201d when he travels to Australia, stemming from his deportation in 2022 because he was not vaccinated against COVID-19.",
      "\u201cThe last couple of times that I landed in Australia, to go through passport control and immigration, I had a bit of trauma from three years ago,\" Djokovic said in an interview with Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper published Monday, ahead of the Australian Open. \u201cAnd some traces still stay there when I\u2019m passing passport control, just checking out if someone from immigration zone is approaching.\u201d",
      "Djokovic, who has won 10 of his 24 Grand Slam championships at Melbourne Park, continued: \u201cThe person checking my passport \u2014 are they going to take me, detain me again or let me go? I must admit I have that feeling.\u201d",
      "Back in 2022, Djokovic sought, and initially obtained, an exemption that would allow him into the Australian Open \u2014 and the country \u2014 even though there were strict rules requiring shots to protect against the coronavirus. But after his flight landed, he was detained at the airport, his visa was canceled and he was sent to an immigration hotel.",
      "A judge later reinstated the visa and ordered Djokovic\u2019s release, ruling he wasn\u2019t given enough time to speak to his lawyers. Australia\u2019s immigration minister then took away the visa again, based on \u201cpublic interest.\u201d Djokovic\u2019s appeal of that ruling was denied by a three-judge panel, and he was deported. He faced a possible three-year ban from the country as someone whose visa was revoked, but Australia had a change of government, its pandemic border rules changed and a new immigration minister granted Djokovic a visa in 2023 \u2014 when he went on to claim the trophy.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hold any resentment, to be honest,\u201d Djokovic told the Herald Sun about the saga. \u201cI don\u2019t hold a grudge.\u201d",
      "The Australian Open begins Sunday (Saturday EST), and Djokovic will be pursuing his 11th trophy in Melbourne to add to his men's record and an unprecedented 25th major singles title overall.",
      "A year ago, Djokovic lost in the semifinals to eventual champion Jannik Sinner.",
      "\u201cI just hope to, before I retire, get at least one more title there,\" said the 37-year-old Djokovic, whose only triumph at a tournament in 2024 was his singles gold medal for Serbia at the Paris Olympics in August.",
      "Djokovic opened 2025 at the Brisbane International last week, losing in the quarterfinals to Reilly Opelka.",
      "At the Australian Open, Djokovic will be playing in his first event alongside new coach Andy Murray, his former on-court rival and a three-time major champion who retired as a player after the Summer Games. Murray and Djokovic have said they will partner up through the year's initial Grand Slam tournament.",

      "Doug Pederson is out as Jacksonville\u2019s head coach after the franchise\u2019s \u201cbest team assembled\u201d won just four games",
      "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Jacksonville Jaguars coach Doug Pederson and general manager Trent Baalke never developed enough synergy, if any at all.",
      "Pederson thought talent was Jacksonville's bigger issue as losses mounted; Baalke believed coaching was the problem. Regardless, the pairing wasn't working in Year 3 \u2014 and everyone inside the building knew it.",
      "Jaguars owner Shad Khan could have justified a complete overhaul. Instead, the billionaire businessman settled for choosing between the duo. He opted for Baalke, a questionable decision that could affect who becomes Jacksonville\u2019s next head coach.",
      "Khan fired Pederson on Monday, a day after a 26-23 overtime loss at Indianapolis. It was the team\u2019s 18th loss in its last 23 games. More surprising, he kept Baalke.",
      "Khan made the move with one year remaining on Pederson\u2019s contract and more than five months after the owner stood in front of coaches and players and declared this the \u201cbest team assembled by the Jacksonville Jaguars ever.\"",
      "\u201cWinning now\u201d was Khan\u2019s edict as training camp opened and after he committed nearly half a billion dollars to signing quarterback Trevor Lawrence, pass rusher Josh Hines-Allen and cornerback Tyson Campbell to long-term deals in the offseason. It was the most expensive stretch of roster building in franchise history.",
      "And Khan has gotten little return on his investment.",
      "\u201cAs much as Doug and I both wish his experience here in Jacksonville would have ended better, I have an obligation first and foremost to serve the best interests of our team and especially our fans, who faithfully support our team and are overdue to be rewarded,\u201d Khan said in a statement. \"In that spirit, the time to summon new leadership is now.",
      "\u201cI strongly believe it is possible next season to restore the winning environment we had here not long ago.\"",
      "Pederson, who led the Eagles to their first Super Bowl title in 2018, finished 9-8 in his first two campaigns in Jacksonville and made the playoffs in his first year. He became the first coach in franchise history to start with back-to-back winning seasons and was a welcome relief following Urban Meyer\u2019s 13-game tenure that was filled with dysfunction.",
      "But Pederson\u2019s injury-riddled team went 1-5 down the stretch in 2023 and missed the postseason after spending nearly two months atop the AFC South. He thought getting Lawrence healthy and revamping his defensive staff would change the team\u2019s fortunes. Neither made a difference.",
      "\u201cIt's unfortunate because at the end of the day we all had a hand in it,\u201d receiver Christian Kirk said. \u201cI have a ton of respect for Doug. He\u2019s made me a better football player, better man. I think he\u2019s one of the better coaches to have coached in this league, and it\u2019s just unfortunate the way that things went.\u201d",
      "More damning: Pederson failed to develop Lawrence or create a team identity, handed play-calling duties to Press Taylor despite Khan making his wishes known and showed no urgency to try to fix a defense that regressed under new coordinator Ryan Nielsen.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of factors that have gone into our season,\u201d tight end Evan Engram said Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the coaching. It's not just one part of it. It's everybody. I\u2019ve been in this league for a while. I try not to get into the whole that side of it, so definitely it\u2019s always unfortunate when most changes do come.\u201d",
      "The Jaguars (4-13) finished with their 10th losing season in Khan\u2019s 13 years as owner. Now, Khan will hire his sixth head coach; current NFL offensive coordinators Ben Johnson (Detroit) and Liam Coen (Tampa Bay) should top the list. But would they even agree to work with Baalke, whose draft picks have been mostly suspect and his latest free-agent class is among the worst in franchise history?",
      "The 56-year-old Pederson went 23-30 with Jacksonville, a far cry from the Super Bowl-winning coach Khan thought he hired in February 2021.",
      "His tenure with Jacksonville was mostly forgettable. Sure, there was the come-from-behind stunner over the Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC wild-card round in January 2023 in which Lawrence rallied the Jaguars from a 27-0 deficit and won 31-30. Otherwise, Pederson was fairly pedestrian.",
      "His ultimate undoing came in close games, with Jacksonville going 3-10 in one-score contests this season. Whether that\u2019s talent or coaching is debatable. Regardless, Pederson got little public support from players down the stretch, a clear sign that the locker room was ready for a different direction.",
      "Now Khan has to find the right coach to get Lawrence \u2014 and the rest of the team \u2014 to another level. It also will have to be someone amenable to working with Baalke, whose coaching list includes Jim Harbaugh (2011-14), Jim Tomsula (2015), Chip Kelly (2022), Meyer (2021) and Pederson (2022-24).",

      "In a collision between free speech and national security, the Supreme Court will hear arguments over the fate of TikTok, a digital age cultural phenomenon that roughly half the U.S. population uses for entertainment and information",
      "WASHINGTON -- In one of the most important cases of the social media age, free speech and national security collide at the Supreme Court on Friday in arguments over the fate of TikTok, a wildly popular digital platform that roughly half the people in the United States use for entertainment and information.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the social media site in the U.S. by Jan. 19 unless the Supreme Court strikes down or otherwise delays the effective date of a law aimed at forcing TikTok's sale by its Chinese parent company.",
      "Working on a tight deadline, the justices also have before them a plea from President-elect Donald Trump, who has dropped his earlier support for a ban, to give him and his new administration time to reach a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d and avoid deciding the case. It's unclear if the court will take the Republican president-elect's views \u2014 a highly unusual attempt to influence a case \u2014 into account.",
      "TikTok and China-based ByteDance, as well as content creators and users, argue the law is a dramatic violation of the Constitution's free speech guarantee.",
      "\u201cRarely if ever has the court confronted a free-speech case that matters to so many people,\u201d lawyers for the users and content creators wrote. Content creators are anxiously awaiting a decision that could upend their livelihoods and are eyeing other platforms.",
      "The case represents another example of the court being asked to rule about a medium with which the justices have acknowledged they have little familiarity or expertise, though they often weigh in on meaty issues involving restrictions on speech.",
      "The Biden administration, defending the law that President Joe Biden signed in April after it was approved by wide bipartisan majorities in Congress, contends that \u201cno one can seriously dispute that (China's) control of TikTok through ByteDance represents a grave threat to national security.\u201d",
      "Officials say Chinese authorities can compel ByteDance to hand over information on TikTok\u2019s U.S. patrons or use the platform to spread or suppress information.",
      "But the government \u201cconcedes that it has no evidence China has ever attempted to do so,\u201d TikTok told the justices, adding that limits on speech should not be sustained when they stem from fears that are predicated on future risks.",
      "In December, a panel of three appellate judges, two appointed by Republicans and one by a Democrat, unanimously upheld the law and rejected the First Amendment speech claims.",
      "Adding to the tension, the court is hearing arguments just nine days before the law is supposed to take effect and 10 days before a new administration takes office.",
      "In language typically seen in a campaign ad rather than a legal brief, lawyers for Trump have called on the court to temporarily prevent the TikTok ban from going into effect but refrain from a definitive resolution.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government \u2014 concerns which President Trump himself has acknowledged,\u201d D. John Sauer, Trump\u2019s choice to be his administration\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, wrote in a legal brief filed with the court.",
      "Trump took no position on the underlying merits of the case, Sauer wrote. Trump's campaign team used TikTok to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, and Trump met with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, in December. He has 14.7 million followers on TikTok.",
      "The justices have set aside two hours for arguments, and the session likely will extend well beyond that. Three highly experienced Supreme Court lawyers will be making arguments. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar will present the Biden administration's defense of the law, while Trump\u2019s solicitor general in his first administration, Noel Francisco, will argue on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance. Stanford Law professor Jeffrey Fisher, representing content creators and users, will be making his 50th high court argument.",
      "If the law takes effect, Trump's Justice Department will be charged with enforcing it. Lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that the new administration could seek to mitigate the law\u2019s most severe consequences.",
      "But they also said that a shutdown of just a month would cause TikTok to lose about one-third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "As it weighs the case, the court will have to decide what level of review it applies to the law. Under the most searching review, strict scrutiny, laws almost always fail. But two judges on the appellate court that upheld the law said it would be the rare exception that could withstand strict scrutiny.",
      "TikTok, the app's users and many briefs supporting them urge the court to apply strict scrutiny to strike down the law.",
      "But the Democratic administration and some of its supporters cite restrictions on foreign ownership of radio stations and other sectors of the economy to justify the effort to counter Chinese influence in the TikTok ban.",
      "A decision could come within days.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- So much of the technology showcased at CES includes gadgets made to improve consumers' lives \u2014 whether by leveraging AI to make devices that help people become more efficient, by creating companions to cure loneliness or by providing tools that help people with mental and physical health.",
      "But not all innovation is good, according to a panel of self-described dystopia experts that has judged some products as \u201cWorst in Show.\" The award that no company wants to win calls out the \u201cleast repairable, least private, and least sustainable products on display.\"",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more of these things that have basically surveillance technology built into them, and it enables some cool things,\u201d Liz Chamberlain, director of sustainability at the e-commerce site iFixit told The Associated Press. \u201cBut it also means that now we\u2019ve got microphones and cameras in our washing machines, refrigerators and that really is an industry-wide problem.\u201d",
      "The fourth annual contest announced its decisions Thursday.",
      "Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, awarded the Ultrahuman Rare Luxury Smart Ring the title of \u201cleast repairable.\u201d",
      "The rings, which come in colors like dune and desert sand, cost $2,200. Wiens said the jewelry \u201clooks sleek but hides a major flaw: its battery only lasts 500 charges.\u201d Worse, he said, is the fact that replacing the battery is impossible without destroying the device entirely.",
      "\u201cLuxury items may be fleeting, but two years of use for $2,200 is a new low,\u201d he said.",
      "Bosch\u2019s \u201cRevol\u201d crib uses sensors, cameras and AI that the company says can help monitor vital signs like how an infant is sleeping, their heart and respiratory rates and more. The crib can also rock gently if the baby needs help falling asleep and signal to parents if a blanket or other object is interfering with breathing.",
      "The company says users can how and where their data is stored. Bosch also says the crib can be transformed into a desk as children get older.",
      "But EFF Executive Director Cindy Cohn said the crib preys on parents' fears and \u201ccollects excessive data about babies via a camera, microphone, and even a radar sensor.\u201d",
      "\u201cParents expect safety and comfort \u2014 not surveillance and privacy risks \u2014 in their children\u2019s cribs,\u201d she said in the report.",
      "Although AI is everywhere at CES, Stacey Higginbotham, a policy Fellow at Consumer Reports, felt that SoundHound AI\u2019s In-Car Commerce Ecosystem, powered by its Automotive AI, pushes it to unnecessary extremes.",
      "The feature \u201cincreases energy consumption, encourages wasteful takeout consumption and distracts drivers\u2014all while adding little value,\u201d Higginbotham said. That landed the in-car system as \u201cleast sustainable\u201d on the list.",
      "TP-Link's Archer BE900 router won for \u201cleast secure\u201d of CES. The company is a top-selling router brand in the U.S. But its products are vulnerable to hacking, said Paul Roberts, founder of The Security Ledger.",
      "\"By Chinese law, TP-Link must report security flaws to the government before alerting the public, creating a significant national security risk,\" he said. \u201cYet TP-Link showcased its Archer BE900 router at CES without addressing these vulnerabilities.\u201d",
      "The awards also feature a category called \u201cwho asked for this?\u201d Top of that list was Samsung's Bespoke AI Washing Machine, which Nathan Proctor, senior director of U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, said is filled \u201cwith features no one needs,\u201d including the ability to make phone calls.",
      "\u201cThese add-ons only make the appliance more expensive, fragile, and harder to repair,\u201d he said.",

      "An international team of scientists say they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice that's at least 1.2 million years old",
      "An international team of scientists announced Thursday they\u2019ve successfully drilled one of the oldest ice cores yet, penetrating nearly 2 miles (2.8 kilometers) to Antarctic bedrock to reach ice they say is at least 1.2 million years old.",
      "Analysis of the ancient ice is expected to show how Earth's atmosphere and climate have evolved. That should provide insight into how Ice Age cycles have changed, and may help in understanding how atmospheric carbon changed climate, they said.",
      "\u201cThanks to the ice core we will understand what has changed in terms of greenhouse gases, chemicals and dusts in the atmosphere,\u201d said Carlo Barbante, an Italian glaciologist and coordinator of Beyond EPICA, the project to obtain the core. Barbante also directs the Polar Science Institute at Italy's National Research Council.",
      "The same team previously drilled a core about 800,000 years old. The latest drilling went 2.8 kilometers (about 1.7 miles) deep, with a team of 16 scientists and support personnel drilling each summer over four years in average temperatures of about minus-35 Celsius (minus-25.6 Fahrenheit).",
      "Italian researcher Federico Scoto was among the glaciologists and technicians who completed the drilling at the beginning of January at a location called Little Dome C, near Concordia Research Station.",
      "\u201cIt was a great a moment for us when we reached the bedrock,\u201d Scoto said. Isotope analysis gave the ice's age as at least 1.2 million years old, he said.",
      "Both Barbante and Scoto said that thanks to the analysis of the ice core of the previous Epica campaign they have assessed that concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, even during the warmest periods of the last 800,000 years, have never exceeded the levels seen since the Industrial Revolution began.",
      "\u201cToday we are seeing carbon dioxide levels that are 50% above the highest levels we\u2019ve had over the last 800,000 years,\" Barbante said.",
      "The European Union funded Beyond EPICA (European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica) with support from nations across the continent. Italy is coordinating the project.",
      "The announcement was exciting to Richard Alley, a climate scientist at Penn State who was not involved with the project and who was recently awarded the National Medal of Science for his career studying ice sheets.",
      "Alley said advancements in studying ice cores are important because they help scientists better understand the climate conditions of the past and inform their understanding of humans\u2019 contributions to climate change in the present. He added that reaching the bedrock holds added promise because scientists may learn more about Earth\u2019s history not directly related to the ice record itself.",

      "\u201cHuge rivers like the Amazon can appear mighty, but at the same time freshwater environments are very fragile,\u201d said study co-author Patricia Charvet, a biologist at Brazil's Federal University of Cear\u00e1.",
      "Freshwater habitats \u2013 including rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, bogs and wetlands \u2013 cover less than 1% of the planet\u2019s surface, but support 10% of its animal species, said Catherine Sayer, a zoologist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature in England.",
      "The researchers examined around 23,500 species of dragonflies, fish, crabs and other animals that depend exclusively on freshwater ecosystems.

Hyundai Mobis unveiled a full-windshield holographic technology, while BMW spotlighted its new \u201ciDrive\u201d panoramic display. And Honda and Sony Honda Mobility showed what consumers can expect with their upcoming electric vehicles.",
      "Many of these driving enhancements aim to \u201cmake life on board more comfortable,\u201d explains Axel Maschka, executive vice president and head of the business division at Hyundai Mobis. And for some consumers today, he adds, \u201cthis \u2018living space\u2019\" of a car's interior has become a dominant part of a vehicle's appeal.",
      "Hyundai Mobis' holographic windshield display provides a glimpse into that. The technology, which won't be on the market for at least several more years, projects information ranging from driving speed to safety alerts across the entire windshield, and also provides some entertainment options for those who aren\u2019t behind the wheel. To keep the driver's eyes on the road, the panoramic display looks different depending on where you sit. A demo from the South Korean company show the front row passenger can watch a movie or play a video game projected ahead of them, for example, but it's not visible to the driver.",
      "Maschka claims the holographic windshield gives drivers an easier view of key information in their line of sight and keeps other distractions in the car out of sight.",

      "The Afeela 1, scheduled to go on sale later this year with deliveries anticipated for mid-2026, also touts a panoramic screen and infotainment system filled with a variety of entertainment apps. Online reservations for the car opened in California this week.",

      "While there's ample excitement around the latest bells and whistles announced from car companies like those on display at CES this week, questions also emerged about how many new features are too many features.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely easy to get a little bit overwhelmed by the amount of technology in cars ... especially when you have cars that have three, four, five (or) six different touchscreens that offer different interfaces,\u201d said Tim Stevens, an automotive analyst and freelance journalist who attended CES this week.",
      "But, Stevens added, this also shows how promising the integration of technology like AI can be \u2014 such as with in-car voice assistants. If you can \u201chave a conversation with your car\u201d to ask for detailed directions or restaurant suggestions, he explains, that can reduce distractions like trying to reach for your phone.",
      "In addition to in-vehicle experiences, EVs showcased at CES this week also put a spotlight on the state of sustainable energy in the car industry today \u2014 and the need to expand access sources for consumers. In addition to a previously-announced venture with seven other automakers to create the \u201cIONNA\u201d charging network in North America, Honda on Tuesday said it plans to expand such efforts \u201cto ensure that Honda 0 Series owners will have access to more than 100,000 charging stations by 2030.\u201d",
      "Honda is also exploring ways to provide \u201cpersonalized\u201d charging experiences for its EV customers down the road.

      "Hearing a lot about Lemon8 lately? You\u2019re not the only one.",
      "Amid a looming U.S. ban on TikTok, content creators have been pushing the platform's sister app. Lemon8 resembles an amalgamation of the types of short-form videos found on TikTok and the picture-perfect aesthetic of Instagram and Pinterest.",
      "Like its popular relation, Lemon8 is owned by China-based ByteDance, whose collection of internationally available apps also includes the video editing app CapCut and the photo and art editing app Hypic. In addition, the company operates Douyin, the Chinese sibling of TikTok that follows Beijing\u2019s strict censorship rules.",
      "Lemon8 launched in the U.S. in 2023, a few years after it first popped up in Asian markets. Though it garnered some media and user interest in its early days, the app hasn\u2019t taken off as much as TikTok, which has more than 170 million U.S. users.",
      "But more people have downloaded the app in the past month, making it one of the top-ranking free apps on Apple\u2019s app store. Lemon8's popularity could potentially soar further depending on the outcome of a U.S. Supreme Court hearing Friday over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. ban.",
      "TikTok says it plans to shut down the platform in the U.S. by Jan. 19 if the government prevails, as it did in a lower court.",
      "Influencers previously partnered with Lemon8 to promote the lesser-known app on TikTok. In recent weeks, many of them have hailed Lemon8 as the place to go if TikTok is banned under federal law. Some have also been recommending it through paid sponsored posts tagged #lemon8partner, showing a recent corporate push to generate more users.",
      "But there's a hitch. The law, which would wipe out TikTok\u2019s U.S. operation if it\u2019s not sold to an approved buyer, states the divest-or-ban requirement applies generally to apps that are owned or operated by ByteDance, TikTok or any of their subsidiaries. That means even though Lemon8 and CapCut are not explicitly named in the statute, their futures in the U.S. also are in jeopardy.",
      "Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at market research company Emarketer, noted that the creators recommending Lemon8 may not be aware of the possible implications for the other ByteDance apps because the law does not identify them.",
      "The recent Lemon8 ads on TikTok also may be a sign that ByteDance is \u201choping or betting\u201d Lemon8 slips through the cracks as lawmakers and regulators focus their attention on TikTok, Enberg said. Representatives for the companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "To boost Lemon8\u2019s user base, TikTok announced in November that creators would be able to access a Lemon8 account with the same account they use on TikTok, a feature the company says will enhance their ability to cross-post content. TikTok said the integration was designed to expand creators \u201creach and engagement potential.\u201d",
      "Like TikTok, Lemon8\u2019s main feed features both a \u201cfollowing\u201d section that lets users look at content from the creators they follow and a \u201cFor You\u201d section that recommends other posts. The newer platform also sorts posts into different categories, like relationships, wellness and skincare.",
      "ByteDance has not disclosed the number of global or U.S. users on Lemon8, which is believed to be miniscule compared to its trend-setting sister app. Data from the research firm SimilarWeb indicates Lemon8 has a little over 1 million daily active users.",
      "Market intelligence company Sensor Tower estimates the app saw a significant jump in global downloads in December \u2014 a 150% increase \u2014 compared to an average 2% month-over-month decline last year. The U.S. accounted for 70% of the month's downloads.",
      "The largest number of U.S. downloads were performed on Dec. 19, according to Sensor Tower. That was the day after the Supreme Court said it would hear this week's oral arguments over the constitutionality of the federal law that could ban TikTok.",
      "The law passed with bipartisan support last year after lawmakers and Biden administration officials expressed concerns that Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data or sway public opinion towards Beijing\u2019s interests by manipulating the algorithm that populates users\u2019 feeds.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Dec. 27 to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until he is inaugurated and his administration can pursue a \u201cpolitical resolution\u201d to the issue."

      "A renowned Israeli TV journalist who lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS is returning to the air using artificial-intelligence software that recreates his widely recognized gravelly voice",
      "JERUSALEM -- When a renowned Israeli TV journalist lost his ability to speak clearly because of ALS, he thought his career might be over. But now, using artificial-intelligence software that can recreate his widely recognized gravelly voice, Moshe Nussbaum \u2014 known to generations of viewers simply as \u201cNussi\u201d \u2014 is making a comeback.",
      "Nussbaum, 71, was diagnosed two years ago with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive disease also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease that attacks nerve cells that control muscles throughout the body.",
      "At the time, he vowed to viewers of Israel's Channel 12 News to continue working as long as he was physically able. But, gradually, it became more and more difficult.",
      "It was a devastating blow to the career of a leading, no-nonsense reporter who for more than 40 years had covered many of Israel\u2019s most important stories from the field. He had appeared from the scenes of suicide bombing attacks and the front lines of wars in Gaza and Lebanon, and had covered scandals in Israel\u2019s parliament and high-profile court cases.",
      "After Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war in Gaza, Nussbaum was unable to report from the field. It was the first war of his career he had ever sat out, he noted in a recent interview with colleagues at Channel 12, the country's largest station.",
      "Even though he was having trouble moving and speaking, he launched a segment interviewing injured soldiers from Israeli hospitals. His questions were slow and halting, but he kept it up for the first half of the war. Then, as it became increasingly difficult to speak, and to be understood, his interviews became less frequent.",
      "On Monday, Channel 12 made the surprising announcement that it would bring Nussbaum back to the air in the coming weeks as a commentator\u2014 with the help of AI.",
      "\u201cIt took me a few moments to absorb it and to understand that it is me speaking now,\u201d Nussbaum told The Associated Press via text message. \u201cSlowly, slowly, I\u2019m understanding the incredible meaning of this device for everyone with disabilities, including me.\u201d",
      "Nussbaum will report his stories, and then write them up, using an AI program that has been trained to speak using Nussbaum\u2019s voice. He will be filmed as if he were presenting, and his lips will be \u201ctechnologically adjusted\u201d to match the words.",
      "People with speech disorders have used traditional text-to-speech technology for years, but those voices sound robotic and flat, and lack emotion. In contrast, AI technology is trained using recordings of a person\u2019s voice \u2014 there are thousands of hours of Nussbaum speaking thanks to his lengthy career in TV and radio \u2014 and it can mimic their intonations and phrasing.",
      "Thrilled by the possibilities the technology affords him, Nussbaum said he is also worried about the ease with which the technology could be used by bad actors to spread fake news and falsehoods.",
      "In its current form, the technology will not work for live broadcasts, so Nussbaum won't be able to go out into the field, which is his favorite part of the job, he said. Instead, he will focus on commentary and analysis about crime and national security, his areas of expertise for decades.",
      "Ahead of the broadcasts, Channel 12 released a preview showing snippets of Nussbaum speaking naturally \u2014 garbled and difficult to understand \u2014 followed by the new \u201cNussi AI.\u201d The new version sounds strikingly like the old Nussbaum, speaking quickly and emphatically. Nussbaum was filmed as if he was presenting the report, sitting straight with his trademark bushy eyebrows moving up and down for emphasis.",
      "\u201cHonestly, this is my first time sitting here in the studio after more than a year,\u201d AI Nussbaum says in the preview. \u201cIt feels a bit strange, and mostly, it tugs my heart.\u201d",
      "AI-powered voice cloning has grown exponentially in recent years. Experts have warned that the technology can amplify phone scams, disrupt democratic elections and violate the dignity of people \u2014 living or dead \u2014 who never consented to having their voice recreated to say things they never said.",
      "It\u2019s been used to produce deepfake robocalls mimicking President Joe Biden. In the U.S., authorities recently charged a high school athletic director with using AI to generate a fake audio clip of the school\u2019s principal making racist remarks.",
      "But the technology also has tremendous potential to help people who have lost their ability to speak clearly. A U.S. congresswoman who cannot speak due to complications from Parkinson\u2019s and a related palsy has used a similar AI program to give a speech on the House floor, and the technology has also helped a young woman who lost her voice due to a tumor.",
      "Channel 12 declined to say which AI program it was using.",
      "Nussbaum had worried that ALS would rob him of the career he loved. In an interview with Channel 12, he recounted telling his managers \u201cdon\u2019t feel like you\u2019re pitying me, doing me a favor,\" he said. \"The day you come to the conclusion that this is it \u2014 tell me. I\u2019ll know how to accept it without a problem.\u201d",
      "He calls his new AI-enabled persona a \u201cmagic trick\u201d that enabled his comeback, and believes it will raise awareness in Israel of ways that people with disabilities \u2014 especially progressive disabilities \u2014 can continue to work.",
      "\u201cThe fact that Channel 12 and my news managers are allowing me to reinvent myself anew, that is one of the most important medicines I can get in my fight with this disease,\u201d he said."

      "Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region are searching for more survivors and victims, one day after a strong earthquake leveled thousands of houses and killed at least 126 people near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists",
      "BEIJING -- Rescue workers in the freezing, high-altitude Tibet region in western China searched Wednesday for more survivors and victims of a strong earthquake that struck a day earlier near a holy city for Tibetan Buddhists, killing at least 126 people and leveling thousands of houses.",
      "Tents, quilts and other relief items were being delivered to people whose homes were uninhabitable or unsafe. Temperatures fell well below freezing overnight in an area with an average altitude of about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet).",
      "The confirmed death toll stood at 126 with another 188 injured as of Tuesday evening. The earthquake struck the city of Xigaze, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, the second-highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism. It was not immediately known whether he was in his Tashi Lhunpo Monastery at the time of the quake or how much damage the city sustained. The quake's distance from Xigaze, which sprawls across a high altitude plain, was about 25 kilometers (15 miles).",
      "The Chinese government and followers of the Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhism's highest figure, have feuded over who should hold the position of Panchen Lama since a boy appointed by the Dalai Lama disappeared in the mid-1990s and a Chinese-backed candidate was approved for the position. The Dalai Lama, viewed by the Chinese government as a dangerous separatist, denounced the move and has refused to recognize the current Panchen Lama.",
      "China's government says Tibet has been part of its territory for centuries, but many Tibetans say they were functionally independent for most of that time. China's People's Liberation Army invaded the territory in 1950 and the Dalai Lama fled to India nine years later during an uprising against Chinese rule, seen as eroding Tibet's unique Buddhist culture.",
      "More than 500 aftershocks were recorded after the earthquake, which the U.S. Geological Survey said measured magnitude 7.1. China\u2019s earthquake center recorded a magnitude of 6.8.",
      "The quake was also about 75 kilometers (50 miles) from Mount Everest and the border with Nepal, where the shaking sent people running out of their homes in the capital.",
      "The dead included at least 22 of the 222 residents of Gurum, the official Xinhua News Agency cited the village's Communist Party chief, Tsering Phuntsog, as saying. The victims included his 74-year-old mother, and several other of his relatives remained buried in the debris.",
      "\u201cEven young people couldn\u2019t run out of the houses when the earthquake hit, let alone old people and children,\u201d Tsering Phuntsog said.",
      "More than 3,600 houses collapsed, according to a preliminary survey, and 30,000 residents have been relocated, Xinhua said, citing the city government in Xi, also known by its Tibetan spelling, Shigatse.",
      "The Ministry of Emergency Management has 1,850 rescuers on the ground along with firefighters and others, state broadcaster CCTV said.",
      "Tibet is generally closed to foreign journalists over reports about the ill treatment of the native population by Chinese authorities.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping ordered \u201call-out rescue efforts to save lives and minimize casualties,\u201d Xinhua reported. Communications in the area have also been restored, allowing smoother delivery of emergency goods, it said.",
      "A candlelight vigil was planned in Dharamsala, India, home of the Dalai Lama and a large Tibetan population, on Wednesday night, and an announcement on the Dalai Lama\u2019s website said he would lead a prayer ceremony in memory of the victims on Thursday.",
      "Asked about the prayer ceremony, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said, \u201cWe are very clear about the separatist nature and political schemes of the Dalai Lama and remain highly vigilant.\u201d",
      "Guo expressed confidence that the people in the earthquake zone would be able to rebuild under \u201cthe strong leadership\u201d of the Communist Party.",

      "When he was still a boy making the long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- When he was still a boy making long, tedious trips between his school and his woodsy home in the mountains during the 1980s, JoeBen Bevirt began fantasizing about flying cars that could whisk him to his destination in a matter of minutes.",
      "As CEO of Joby Aviation, Bevirt is getting closer to turning his boyhood flights of fancy into a dream come true as he and latter-day versions of the Wright Brothers launch a new class of electric-powered aircraft vying to become taxis in the sky.",
      "The aircraft \u2014 known as \"electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle, or eVTOL \u2014 lift off the ground like a helicopter before flying at speeds up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour) with a range of about 100 miles (161 kilometers). And these craft do it without filling the air with excessive noise caused by fuel-powered helicopters and small airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe are just a few steps from the finish line. We want to turn what are now one- and two-hour trips into five-minute trips,\u201d Bevirt, 51, told The Associated Press before a Joby air taxi took off on a test flight in Marina, California \u2014 located about 40 miles south from where he grew up in the mountains.",
      "Archer Aviation, a Silicon Valley a Silicon Valley company backed by automaker Stellantis and United Airlines, has been testing its own eVTOLs over farmland in Salinas, California, where a prototype called \u201cMidnight\u201d could be seen gliding above a tractor plowing fields last November.",
      "The tests are part of the journey that Joby Aviation and other ambitious companies that collectively have raised billions of dollars are taking to turn flying cars into more than just pie-in-the-sky concepts popularized in 1960s-era cartoon series, \u201cThe Jetsons,\u201d and the 1982 science fiction film, \u201cBlade Runner.\u201d",
      "Archer Aviation and nearby Wisk Aero, with ties to aerospace giant Boeing Co. and Google co-founder Larry Page, are also at the forefront in the race to bring air taxis to market in the United States. Joby has already formed a partnership to connect its air taxis with Delta Air Lines passengers while Archer Aviation has lined up a deal to sell up to 200 of its aircraft to United Airlines.",
      "Flying taxis have made enough regulatory inroads with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to result in the recent creation of a new aircraft category called \u201cpowered lift,\u201d a step that the agency hadn't taken since helicopters were introduced for civilian use in the 1940s.",
      "But there are more regulatory hurdles to be cleared before air taxis will be allowed to carry passengers in the U.S., making Dubai the most likely place where eVTOLs will take commercial flight \u2014 perhaps by the end of this year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky business to develop a whole new class of vehicles,\u201d said Alan Lim, director of Alton Aviation Consultancy, a firm tracking the industry's evolution. \u201cIt is going to be like a crawl, walk, run situation. Right now, I think we are still crawling. We are not going to have the Jetsons-type reality where everyone will be flying around everywhere in the next two to three years.\u201d",
      "China is also vying to make flying cars a reality, a quest that has piqued President-elect Donald Trump's interest in making the vehicles a priority for his incoming administration during the next four years.",
      "If the ambitions of eVTOL pioneers are realized in the U.S., people will be able to hop in an air taxi to get to and from airports serving New York and Los Angeles within the next few years.",
      "Because its electric taxis can fly unimpeded at high speeds, Joby envisions transporting up to four Delta Air Lines passengers at a time from New York area airports to Manhattan in about 10 minutes or less. To start, air taxi prices almost certainly will be significantly more that the cost of taking a cab or Uber ride from JFK airport to Manhattan, but the difference could narrow over time because eVTOLs should be able to transport a higher volume of passengers than ground vehicles stuck in traffic going each way.",
      "\u201cYou will see highways in the sky,\u201d Archer Aviation CEO Adam Goldstein predicted during an interview at the company's San Jose, California, headquarters. \u201cThere will be hundreds, maybe thousands of these aircraft flying in these individual cities and it will truly change the way cities are being built.\u201d",
      "Investors are betting Goldstein is right, helping Archer raise an additional $430 million late last year from a group that included Stellantis and United Airlines. The infusion came shortly after a Japanese automaker poured another $500 million into Joby to bring its total investment in that company to nearly $900 million.",
      "Those investments were part of the $13 billion that eVTOL companies have raised during the past five years, according to Alton Aviation.",
      "Both Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation went public in 2021 through reverse mergers, opening up another fundraising avenue and making it easier to recruit engineers with the allure of stock options. Both companies have been able to attract workers away from electric automaker Tesla and rocket maker SpaceX and, in Archer's instance, raiding the ranks of Wisk Aero.",
      "The Wisk defections triggered a lawsuit accusing Archer of intellectual property theft in a dispute that was resolved with a 2023 settlement that included an agreement for the two sides to collaborate on some facets of eVTOL technology.",
      "Before going public, Joby also acquired eVTOL technology developed by ride-hailing service Uber in an $83 million deal that also brought those two companies together as partners.",
      "But none of the deals or technological advances have stopped the losses from piling up at the companies building flying cars. Joby, whose roots date back to 2009 when Bevirt founded the company, has sustained $1.6 billion in losses since its inception while Archer has amassed nearly $1.5 billion in losses since its founding in 2018.",
      "While they moved to commercial air taxi services, both Joby and Archer are trying to bring in revenue by negotiating contracts to use their eVTOLs in the U.S. military for deliveries and other other short-range missions. Archer has forged a partnership with Anduril Industries, a military defense technology specialist founded by Oculus headset inventor Palmer Luckey, to help it win deals.",
      "The uncertain prospects have left both companies with relatively low market values by tech industry standards, with Joby's hovering around $7 billion and Archer's $6 billion.",
      "But Bevirt sees blue skies ahead. \u201ceVTOLs are going to transform the way we move,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a dramatically better way to get around. Seeing the world from the air is better than being stuck in the traffic on the interstate.\u201d"

He watched as a dark-haired woman walked through ornate gilded double doors and took in the rays of light that poured in through stained glass windows.",
      "\u201cThe amount of geometry that you saw was absolutely insane,\u201d Huang told an audience of thousands at CES 2025 Monday night. \u201cIt would have been impossible without artificial intelligence.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "At a time when North American bird populations are declining dramatically, the number of people watching them is increasing",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Marin Plank truly had no interest in birds when she gave her husband a camera-equipped bird feeder for his birthday. But by Christmas, she had become so obsessed with birds that most of the gifts she received this year \u2014 books, stickers, notecards \u2014 were related.",
      "\u201cThis is who I am now,\u201d she said.",
      "Acquaintances have stopped Plank on the street to discuss the bird photos she shares on Facebook. From copious amounts of research, she now knows the best birdseed blend and has a premium membership to a store that delivers giant bags of it to her Delaware home.",
      "It all started when she got her first postcard from the Bird Buddy app, which provides photos and video clips that can be downloaded or shared.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to click, and then the bird is in your face looking at you and mugging for you, and it\u2019s like your own little private show,\u201d she said. \u201cSomething about their little eyes and their goofy little faces just drew me in, and now I\u2019m a bird enthusiast.\u201d",
      "While North American bird populations decline dramatically, paradoxically, the number of people watching them has increased. While the coronavirus pandemic spurred many people to head outside in search of birds, for others, smart feeders that snap photos and video of backyard visitors have brought the hobby inside.",
      "\u201cIt really delivers value with very little input,\u201d said Franci Zidar, founder and CEO of Bird Buddy, which has sold 350,000 smart bird feeders since 2022. \u201cIf you\u2019re actually kind of a hardcore bird watcher, that can be a very demanding hobby. There are, however, 20 to 30 species of birds in most U.S. backyards that people either don\u2019t really know or appreciate.\u201d",
      "Several other companies, including Birdfy, make similar bird feeders that are mounted with cameras. And while standard bird feeders tap into people\u2019s altruistic sides by allowing users to take care of animals, smart feeders take it a step further, Zidar said.",
      "\u201cUltimately, I think it marries two really beautiful things. One is your need to nurture and to give back and to connect with nature, and the other one is to kind of see it and appreciate it,\u201d he said.",
      "Bird Buddy has proven so successful that the company is expanding its portfolio to include a tiny flower-shaped camera called Petal, and Wonder Blocks, which can be assembled to provide habitats for butterflies and other insects. Details were announced Monday at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics show, in Las Vegas, with a Kickstarter campaign this spring.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s not ask people to do crazy things, because they won\u2019t. Let\u2019s just give them value by just pointing a camera into this beautiful natural space,\u201d Zidar said. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you the drama, the happenings, the life that\u2019s happening in that corner of your home.\u201d",
      "In Ipswich, Massachusetts, Judy Ashley already had 11 bird feeders in her yard when she got a Bird Buddy last year. She has taken down some of the older feeders in hopes of attracting more birds to the camera to capture photos of those hanging out lately in her yard, especially a yellow-throated warbler, which is rarely seen in New England. She finally succeeded on Monday.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is how close you can see the details of backyard birds that you just wouldn\u2019t see if you just stood there for hours with binoculars,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just realize how amazing nature is.\u201d",
      "Rachel Matthews in Austin, Texas, has three camera-equipped feeders, including one specifically for hummingbirds. While she grew up with bird feeders, the smart feeders have increased her interest, she said.",
      "\u201cI love having the camera, and I see detail that even with my binoculars I\u2019d never seen,\" she said. \"The female cardinals with their red eyebrows and little feathers \u2014 it\u2019s just phenomenal.\u201d",
      "In November, the National Audubon Society announced a partnership with Bird Buddy to increase awareness about bird conservation. The arrangement could provide a pathway to get data from the company\u2019s community science platform to scientists, said Nicolas Gonzalez, a spokesperson for the Audubon Society.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re eager to see how smart feeders and kind of just the whole bird-feeding industry can continue fostering this appreciation for birds and nature,\u201d he said.",
      "In Delaware, Plank has grown attached to specific visitors to her feeder \u2014 a \u201cbadass\u201d female Red-winged blackbird, a tufted titmouse who she said seems to know he\u2019s handsome and blue jays who act like \u201cdrunk uncles.\u201d",
      "\u201cI give them these personalities in my mind, and it\u2019s about having them right in front of my face, doing their little silly things,\u201d she said. \u201cThat really has drawn me in.\u201d",
      "So, too, have the frequent alerts and notifications she gets on her phone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just like a little spark of joy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about being interrupted to remind you about this little part of the world that is just really lovely.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify the age of its visitors was largely blocked in court before taking effect Jan. 1",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A Tennessee law requiring pornographic websites to verify their visitors' age was largely blocked in court before it was to take effect Jan. 1, even as similar laws kicked in for Florida and South Carolina and remained in effect for more than a dozen other states.",
      "On Dec. 30, U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman in Memphis ruled that Tennessee's law would likely suppress the First Amendment free speech rights of adults without actually preventing children from accessing the harmful material in question. The state attorney general's office is appealing the decision.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition, an adult entertainment trade group, is suing over Tennessee's law and those in a half-dozen other states. The coalition lists some 19 states that have passed similar laws. One prominent adult website has cut off access in several states due to their laws.",
      "The issue will hit the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments regarding Texas' law next week.",
      "No one voted against Tennessee's law last year when it passed the Republican-supermajority legislature, and GOP Gov. Bill Lee signed off on it.",
      "The law would require porn websites to verify visitors are at least 18 years old, threatening felony penalties and civil liability possible for violators running the sites. They could match a photo to someone's ID, or use certain \u201cpublic or private transactional data\u201d to prove someone\u2019s age. Website leaders could not retain personally identifying information and would have to keep anonymized data.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition and other plaintiffs sued, winning a preliminary injunction that blocks the attorney general from enforcement while court proceedings continue. However, the coalition expressed concern that private lawsuits or actions by individual district attorneys could be possible.",
      "In her ruling, Judge Lipman wrote that parental controls on minors' devices are more effective and less restrictive.",
      "She wrote that under Tennessee's law, minors still could access adult sites using VPNs, or virtual private networks, that mask a user's location. Or, they could view pornographic material on social media sites, which are unlikely to reach the law's threshold of one-third of its content considered harmful to minors.",
      "The judge also said the impact could be overly broad, potentially affecting other plaintiffs such as an online educational platform focused on sexual wellness.",
      "She noted that Tennessee's definition of \u201ccontent harmful to minors\u201d extends to include text. She specifically mentioned that the phrase \u201cthe human nipple,\u201d or crude combinations of keyboard characters, would be considered harmful as long as they lack \u201cserious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.\"",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti's office is asking the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to let the law take effect as the lawsuit proceeds. His spokesperson, Chad Kubis, noted that other appeals courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, allowed similar laws to take effect.",
      "\u201cThe Protect Tennessee Minors Act institutes common sense age verification to stop kids from accessing explicit obscene content while protecting the privacy of adults who choose to do so,\" Kubis said.",
      "The Free Speech Coalition has argued the law would be ineffective, unconstitutional and force people to transfer sensitive information.",
      "\u201cThis is a deeply flawed law that put website operators at risk of criminal prosecution for something as trivial as a mention of the human nipple,\" said Free Speech Coalition Executive Director Alison Boden.",
      "As verification laws took effect in Florida and South Carolina last week, website PornHub cut off access there and posted a message encouraging people to contact political decision-makers. They've acted similarly in other states that passed verification requirements.",
      "Judges had paused the laws in Indiana and Texas. But circuit appeals courts stepped in to allow enforcement.",
      "The Supreme Court declined to halt Texas' law in April while the court action continues. The next step is Supreme Court oral arguments on Jan. 15.",
      "Another age verification law is set to begin in July in Georgia."

      "CES, the annual trade show of all-things tech, is upon us",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 CES, the annual trade show of all things tech, is upon us.",
      "The multi-day event, organized by the Consumer Technology Association, kicks off this week in Las Vegas \u2014 where swaths of the latest gadgets and advances across industries like personal tech, transportation, health care, sustainability and more are set to be on display. And, like last year, artificial intelligence is everywhere you look.",
      "CES 2024 saw more than 138,000 attendees, according to the CTA, and organizers expect to see at least that amount again for this year's show. Over 4,500 exhibitors, including 1,400 startups, are also anticipated across 2.5 million net square feet of floor space this week.",
      "\u201cThese are the people getting together, focusing on solving some of the world\u2019s biggest problems \u2014 and magic occurs.\u201d Gary Shapiro, CEO and vice chair of the CTA, told The Associated Press ahead of this week's show.",
      "Formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, CES brings attendees and exhibitors from around the globe, with Shapiro noting that organizers expect some 50,000 attendees to come from outside the U.S. Beyond an array of startups, big-name companies set to make appearances this year include Nvidia, Delta Air Lines, Honda, Volvo, Panasonic and L\u2019Or\u00e9al.",
      "There may be some increased security this year. CES 2025 arrives less than one week after a highly decorated Army soldier fatally shot himself in a Tesla Cybertruck packed with explosives before it burst into flames outside of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s hotel in Las Vegas \u2014 not far from much of the trade show's planned event space. Shapiro said that organizers regularly work with officials for event safety and that \u201cmodest\u201d changes were made in response to recent events, but couldn't go into further detail.",
      "The AP spoke with Shapiro about what to expect for CES 2025. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.",
      "CES 2025 will be an exceptional leap forward in terms of innovation and technology, with a focus on a variety of themes important to the future of humanity. Over 4,000 companies will be here, on literally miles and miles of exhibit space. And they\u2019ll be showing solutions to fundamental human problems \u2014 like access to food, clean air, clean water and mobility, as well as health care technology.",
      "We also have newer categories. We\u2019re seeing more technology for the disability community, for example. Products that can serve people with disabilities had a large presence last year, and we expect that to be even bigger this year. Overall, the show is serving humanity and using technology and innovation to fill in gaps where we need a lot more work.",
      "Generative AI is affecting virtually every area. Just about every major exhibitor will be talking about AI in one form or another at CES this week. For businesses, the focus is more on enterprise and productivity. But for individuals, it\u2019s about personalization.",
      "We\u2019ll see exhibitors, such as PC companies, focusing on personalization in new products for the PC and laptop marketplace. And then there\u2019s AI being used in mobility \u2014 and not just in features for cars and self-driving. It\u2019s for all sorts of vehicles, including agricultural products from companies like Caterpillar and John Deere.",
      "The industry representing the companies involved welcomes government regulation. The government\u2019s job is to say this is what is unsafe. And so the companies know what is legal and what is not. At the same time, a big challenge is if government stops innovation \u2014 so the question is for every country is finding that balance.",
      "We expect the Trump administration to take a much more pro-business approach that favors innovation, including a focus on all sorts of energy sources, which is very important important. But tariffs are taxes. And we know that they are inflationary and paid for by consumers.",
      "If we go forward with the proposals that the President-elect has indicated he may put in place, there would be severe impacts on the prosperity of the U.S. It depends on how exactly these tariffs are adopted but under some of the proposals, we estimate a range of a 30 to 50% price increases for basic products like PCs, cell phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches and all sorts of different products that consumers get a great value on today. That means that fewer people will be able to access these products. And, of course, other countries may then retaliate against U.S. exports. We don\u2019t want to go in that direction.",
      "CES has always focused on safety. There\u2019s a lot of things we can\u2019t talk about, but suffice it to say, we work with federal, state, local and facility officials for lots of planning. We\u2019ve made some modest changes given the recent events, but we\u2019re always trying to do it better.",
      "I think companies are excited to come here. And any requests we\u2019ve gotten have been extremely isolated.",
      "Having top executives here, especially after COVID, is very special. People are focused on coming to Las Vegas and having this opportunity to meet face-to-face and finding the serendipity and discovery that happens when you\u2019re making these business connections in person. That\u2019s why trade shows like CES and others are such important events for the world."

      "The FBI says the New Orleans truck attacker who killed 14 people had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses",
      "NEW YORK -- The man who drove a truck into a crowd of people in New Orleans on New Year's Day, killing 14, had previously scouted the French Quarter and recorded video with his Meta smart glasses, the FBI said.",
      "On Oct. 31, Shamsud-Din Jabbar recorded video with the glasses as he cycled through the French Quarter and plotted the attack, said Lyonel Myrthil, FBI special agent in charge of the New Orleans field office. Jabbar also wore the glasses, which are capable of livestreaming, during the attack, but did not activate them.",
      "A spokesperson for Meta, the parent company of Facebook, declined to comment.",
      "Here's what the glasses are capable of:",
      "Meta glasses, made in partnership with Ray-Ban, are frames with a built-in camera, speakers and artificial intelligence that can be controlled with your voice, buttons and some simple gestures. Some functions, such as listening to music or interacting with Meta's AI assistant, require the device to be either paired with a phone or able to access the internet.",
      "The wearable does not have a display built into the lens, unlike some past industry attempts at building augmented-reality smart glasses. However, Meta has said it is working on a pair of glasses that will give users a fully holographic experience.",
      "One of the glasses' main selling points is the ability to capture images and video using the onboard camera, then upload those files to Instagram or Facebook. You can also livestream, but only to Meta's compatible social platforms.",
      "You can also use the glasses to make audio and video calls, message people or listen to music.",
      "The camera also allows Meta's AI assistant to see what you\u2019re seeing, allowing it to translate text into multiple languages (spoken back to you, or shown on a paired phone app), and answer simple questions, such as searching the nearest landmark to your location. The glasses are largely a hands-free experience so you will be talking to your device \u2014 and it will reply.",
      "The glasses currently cannot perform complex tasks that other digital assistants might be able to, like booking you a reservation at a restaurant or giving you turn-by-turn directions while you're on the move. And there's no display in the lens, so there isn't a viewfinder for framing photos or video.",
      "There are also visual indicators built into the system that allow bystanders to know when you're shooting video or taking photos. This LED privacy indicator stays on while you use the camera functions. According to Meta, you can't disable this light to be more discreet in your actions."

    "story": [
      "The fate of TikTok is keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision from the Supreme Court that could upheld their livelihoods",
      "Will TikTok be banned this month?",
      "That\u2019s the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban.",
      "At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not.",
      "For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter.",
      "If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures.",
      "\u201cA lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,\u201d said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok\u2019s live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films \u201cGambit\u201d and \u201cAwaken! My Neighbor.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is \u201chard to accept.\u201d",
      "Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they\u2019ve invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content.",
      "For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down.",
      "\u201cI believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,\" said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands.",
      "It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional.",
      "Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief \u2014 written by his pick for solicitor general \u2014 Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban \u201csweeping and troubling\" and said he wants a \u201cnegotiated resolution\u201d to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail.",
      "While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content.",
      "Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn\u2019t found a place quite like TikTok, she\u2019s begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes.",
      "According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform \u2014 and its algorithm \u2014 with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups.",
      "Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,\" said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth.",
      "A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he\u2019d struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom.",
      "\"For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,\" Hurst said.",
      "Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency\u2019s founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said.",
      "But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences.",
      "If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions \u2014 which will prevent them from updating the app \u2014 will eventually make the app \"unworkable,\u201d the Justice Department has said.",
      "TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.",

      "NEW YORK -- Your car is spying on you.",
      "That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk\u2019s company was impressive, but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like computers on wheels.",
      "Is your car company violating your privacy rights?",
      "\u201cYou might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals, but can anyone have access to it?\u201d said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors. \u201cWhere is the line?\u201d",
      "Many of the latest cars not only know where you\u2019ve been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone syncing.",
      "The data collected by Musk\u2019s electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track the driver\u2019s movements.",
      "Within hours of the New Year\u2019s Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger\u2019s movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas, and also confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software -- and to great acclaim.",
      "\u201cI have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,\u201d said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. \u201cHe gave us quite a bit of additional information.\u201c",
      "Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic.",
      "\u201cIt reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,\u201d said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. \u201cWhen something bad happens, it\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s a double edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.\u201d",
      "General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent.",
      "Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers\u2019 sensitive videos and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents and, in one case, nudity.",
      "Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy. On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and information private.",
      "\u201cNo one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you\u2019ve been,\u201d according to a statement. \"Your information is kept private and secure.\u201d",
      "Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn't think Tesla is \u201cespecially worse\u201d than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned.",
      "\u201cThis is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They're connected,\u201d he said. \u201cConsumers need to have control over their data.\u201d",
      "Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump\u2019s hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New Orleans in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist attack.",
      "Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were investigating a second incident.",

      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to pers...",
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "WHAT WAS THE LAWSUIT ABOUT?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \u201cHey, Siri,\u201d but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company\u2019s technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COVERED BY THE SETTLEMENT?",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "HOW MUCH MONEY WILL EACH ELIGIBLE CONSUMER RECEIVE?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors: the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "DID APPLE BREAK ANY LAWS?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial. Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \u201cfundamental human right.\u201d",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "DO I NEED TO BE WORRIED ABOUT THE MICROPHONES ON OTHER DEVICES SPYING ON ME?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "JUST IN CASE, HOW DO I DISABLE SIRI?",
      "You can turn Apple\u2019s virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for \u2018Hey Siri\u2019 and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone."

      "Attorney General Merrick Garland informed Congress in a letter Wednesday that special counsel Jack Smith has concluded his investigations into Donald Trump.",
      "Garland informed members of Congress -- as required by internal department regulations -- that at no time did he interfere in to overrule Smith during the process of his probes, according to the letter released by the Department of Justice.",
      "Garland also acknowledged in the letter that at this time he is currently barred by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon from releasing the report outside of the Justice Department, but that he intends to make Volume One of the report, regarding Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election, available to the public once he is \"permitted to do so\" by the courts.",
      "The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals is weighing whether to block the release of the report after Cannon, the judge who dismissed Trump's classified documents case, temporarily blocked the report's release in order to prevent \"irreparable harm,\" while the matter is considered by the Eleventh Circuit.",
      "Trump's lawyers filed an amicus brief with the Eleventh Circuit late Wednesday, arguing that the release of the report would harm the transition to his presidency.",
      "\"The report is nothing less than another attempted political hit job whose sole purpose is to disrupt the presidential transition and undermine President Trump's exercise of executive power,\" Trump's lawyers wrote.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued that the release of the report would be \"worse\" than the four indictments Smith brought against the former president, by offering a \"one-sided\" view of the evidence without giving Trump the ability to defend himself.",
      "\"The Final Report goes into more detail about the alleged crimes President Trump and others supposedly committed and involves evidence that was never released to the public--indeed, evidence that could not be released, such as those involving official acts,\" the filing said.",
      "Trump's lawyers claimed that Cannon's decision deeming Smith's appointment unconstitutional taints the report -- which they described as an \"extension of the unlawful acts of an unconstitutionally appointed and funded officer\" -- which should prohibit Garland from releasing it.",
      "\"Garland simply functions as a mouthpiece for the unconstitutionally-appointed Smith,\" the filing said.",
      "Garland, in his letter to Congress, confirmed that he plans to make available Volume Two of the report, pertaining to Trump's classified documents case, available to leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees for closed-door review as soon as the Eleventh Circuit permits him to do so.",
      "\"Consistent with local court rules and Department policy, and to avoid any risk of prejudice to defendants Waltine Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, whose criminal cases remain pending, I have determined, at the recommendation of the Special Counsel, that Volume Two should not be made public so long as those defendants' criminal proceedings are ongoing,\" Garland wrote.",
      "\"I have determined that once those criminal proceedings have concluded, releasing Volume Two of the Report to you and to the public would also be in the public interest, consistent with law and Department policy,\" he wrote.",

      "\"The water is cut off upstate, up in the north, you know that, and the water in order to protect a certain little tiny fish called a smelt. They send millions and millions of gallons of water out to the Pacific Ocean way up north -- never even gets close to here,\" Trump said during a press conference at his golf course in Los Angeles in September.",
      "\"You have no water down here. And the reason you have no water, you have the canals -- the reason you have no water is because Gavin Newsom didn't want to do it,\" he added.",

      "After meeting on the Hill, senators appear unmoved by Trump's argument.",
      "After meeting with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump appeared ambivalent about the debate over whether to craft two legislative attempts to reshape fiscal policy for his agenda or settle on one sweeping package in an \u201call-in\u201d approach.",
      "Trump told reporters that he had \u201ca great meeting\u201d with the senators, although it appeared that the closed-door meeting that lasted more than 90 minutes did not lock down an agreement on how to proceed.",
      "\u201cThere's great unity,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think there's a lot of talk about two [bills], and there's a lot of talk about one, but it doesn't matter. The end result is the same. We're going to get something done that's going to be reducing taxes and creating a lot of jobs and all of the other things that you know about.\u201d",

      "But just because senators heard him doesn't mean they agree with him.",
      "There was hope going into tonight's meeting with Trump, the Senate's first since he won the presidential race in November, that it could bring the Senate, which has largely favored a two-bill approach, and the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson prefers a one-bill approach, into one line of thinking on the matter.",
      "Senators leaving the room Wednesday night seemed unmoved.",
      "\"It's no mystery we're advocating for two,\" Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said as he departed.",
      "There were a number of senators, including Trump allies like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who forcefully made the case for a two-bill solution while in the room with Trump. Cruz and his allies want one bill to address border security, military spending and energy. A second bill addressing tax policy could come later, they said.",
      "With little to no support expected from Democrats, Republicans plan to push forward through \"reconciliation\" -- a fast-track process limited to spending and revenue legislation that needs only a majority rather than the 60-vote threshold in the Senate needed to pass legislation.",
      "While the debate might seem in the weeds, it could have serious implications for Trump's agenda. Bills passed through reconciliation give Republicans more wiggle room to pass certain measures that Democrats oppose. But these bills are cumbersome, bound by a number of rules about what may and may not be included, and will require the near-unanimous support of Republicans.",
      "Senate Republicans continue to break with Trump and Johnson on the issue because they believe they can notch a win early in Trump's presidency by breaking the package into two chunks.",
      "\"I expressed vigorously, as did numerous other people that the best path to success is winning two major victories rather than putting all the eggs in one basket and risking -- a very real risk -- of it not getting the votes to pass,\" Cruz said. \"I strongly believe the path that makes sense is to take up two bills. Why? Because that unifies Republicans. We can get that passed. We could have a major victory early on, and then to move to extending the tax cuts.\"",
      "Cruz said there was \"complete consensus\" among the senators on a two-part solution. \"Not a single senator disagreed.\"",
      "Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W. Va., who told reporters she served as the moderator for the meeting, said Trump was listening intently to their suggestions but she believes two bills provide the most viable path to victory.",
      "\u201cThe two-bill approach that [Senate Majority Leader John] Thune had liked, I think is generally the direction the Senate has been wanting to go to get that quick victory,\u201d Capito said. \u201cI think there's a lot of discussion that's going to go on. What can the House pass? What does the Speaker think? So he [Trump] heard from us and from our leader that a two-bill strategy is very much alive over here and something we're still very interested in. So no decisions were made.\".",
      "Capito seemed uncertain if there would be cohesion with Trump moving forward.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know -- we\u2019ll see,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI think, you know, the leaders will get together with the president and they'll make those decisions.\u201d",
      "Republican Whip John Barrasso will be a key part of rounding up votes for whatever package is ultimately advanced and he also sees two bills as the right direction to go.",
      "\"We think there's a lot of advantages to get an early win and to focus immediately on the border, on energy and on the strong military,\" Barrasso said.",
      "Barrasso said he was there when the Senate used this same fast-track budget tool to implement the Trump tax cuts in 2017. That took time, he said.",
      "\"There's a lot of detail to be done with that, and so that's going to take awhile\" he said. \"I think we can much more quickly deal with the border, energy, and military funding.\"",
      "Still, Trump continues to prefer the one-bill approach backed by Johnson, senators said.",
      "\"I think he's still open to whatever can work. I think there seems to be movement from the House to do one, and so I think that's the way he leans,\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said.",
      "Another option that was floated was holding a \"horse race\" which would see the House originating a sweeping proposal that includes tax policy as its base while the Senate originates a more narrowly tailored bill that just includes border and energy reform then see which package gains more momentum.",
      "\"I said, 'Well, Mister President, you love a horse race, why don't you set it up as a horse race? And then whatever works best is great,'\" said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D. \"HIs preference is one bill, but I think he's open to it.\"",
      "Trump reiterated his preference for one bill when he spoke to reporters on Tuesday, but said he could live with two.",
      "\"Well, I like one big, beautiful bill, and I always have, I always will, he said. But if two is more certain [to pass], it does go a little bit quicker because you can do the immigration stuff early,\" he said.",
      "Johnson said he hopes to have a bill ready by the first week in April, but it remains to be seen if he can get fiscal conservatives in his conference, who have long opposed all-in-one bills like the one Johnson is proposing, on board.",
      "The speaker pushed back on Wednesday about the one-bill approach being a kitchen sink approach.",
      "\u201cThis is not an omnibus spending bill, but appropriation,\" Johnson said. \"This is reducing spending, which is an objective we talked about. I'll keep reiterating this: that just because the debt limit is raised, to give stability the bond markets and to send a message around the world that we will pay the nation's debt. We are doggedly determined to decrease the size of scope of government and to limit spending, cut spending so you can you'll see both of those things happen simultaneously.\"",
      "Johnson also intends to handle the debt limit in the reconciliation bill -- without Democratic support.",
      "\"That way, as the Republican Party, the party in charge of both chambers, we again get to determine the details of that. If it runs through the regular order, regular process\u2026 then you have to have both parties negotiating. And we feel like we are in better stead to do it ourselves,\" he said Tuesday.",
      "But it remains to be seen whether Johnson can sell the fiscal conservatives in his conference on that idea. They nearly derailed the short-term government funding bill to avert a shutdown last month after Trump demanded that it dealt with the debt ceiling.",
      "Trump will meet with groups of House Republicans at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida this weekend.",
      "\"He's bringing in big groups of House Republicans to Mar-a-Lago over the weekend three days in a row to meet with and talk with all of our team members about what's ahead of us and the challenges and how we can accomplish all this together,\" Johnson said, though the speaker is not expected to attend.",

    "story": [
      "Judge Aileen Cannon temporarily blocked the release of the report Tuesday.",
      "Attorneys for President-elect Donald Trump and his allies have unleashed a legal blitz this week to prevent the release of special counsel Jack Smith's final report on his classified documents and election interference investigations, successfully convincing the federal judge who dismissed Trump's documents case to issue an emergency injunction temporarily blocking the report's release.",
      "While Smith has released many of his findings already -- through four indictments and a lengthy filing outlining the evidence against Trump -- recent disclosures made by attorneys for Trump and his co-defendants suggest that the special counsel's final report could contain previously undisclosed details that are potentially damaging to the president elect.",
      "According to a court filing from Trump's defense lawyers Monday, a draft version of the report asserts that Trump \"engaged in an unprecedented criminal effort,\" violated multiple federal laws, and served as the \"head\" of multiple criminal conspiracies.",
      "Trump's lawyers, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who reviewed a draft version of the report over the weekend, argued in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland Monday that the report's release would be a \"partisan weapon\" and \"lawless political stunt, designed to politically harm\" President-elect Trump and his allies.",
      "According to Trump's lawyers, a draft of the report included multiple \"baseless attacks\" on members of Trump's incoming presidential administration that could \"interfere with upcoming confirmation hearings.\"",
      "The letter did not provide any additional information about which, if any, of Trump's nominees or appointees were mentioned in the report.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty in 2023 to charges of unlawfully retaining classified materials after leaving the White House, and, in a separate case, pleaded not guilty to charges of undertaking a \"criminal scheme\" to overturn the results of the 2020 election. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the classified documents case this past July after deeming Smith's appointment unconstitutional, leading Smith to appeal that decision.",
      "Smith, who is now winding down both his cases against the president-elect due to a longstanding Department of Justice policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president, has not provided any details about the contents of his report. Smith's team has accused Trump's attorneys of violating a confidentiality agreement by making portions of their findings public in their filings.",
      "Special counsels are mandated by internal Justice Department regulations to prepare confidential reports at the conclusion of their investigations to summarize their findings, and the attorney general can determine whether to release the report publicly. Smith's report includes two volumes, covering his investigation into Trump's alleged retention of classified documents and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued that the report's release would disrupt the ongoing presidential transition process and \"exacerbate stigma and public opprobrium surrounding the Chief Executive,\" suggesting that the report -- which is being prepared by a prosecutor independent from the president -- contradicts the Biden administration's vow to \"facilitate an orderly and collegial transition process.\"",
      "\"It'll be a fake report, just like it was a fake investigation,\" Trump said at a news conference Tuesday at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Trump's lawyers also suggested that the report included a \"pathetically transparent tirade\" about social media platform X's effort to \"protect civil liberties.\"",
      "ABC News previously reported that X -- then known as Twitter -- was held in contempt and fined $350,000 for failing to comply with a search warrant for records and data from former President Trump's social media account. X's owner, Elon Musk, is now one of Trump's most vocal supporters and advisers, and spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump.",
      "Blanche and Bove -- both of whom Trump has picked for top Justice Department posts in the incoming administration -- have argued that the report's release would only offer a single-sided view of the case and give \"rise to a media storm of false and unfair criticism\" that Trump would need to address during the transition period.",
      "While Trump is no longer being prosecuted by Smith, his two former co-defendants in the classified documents case have argued they would be unable to have a fair trial if the findings are released publicly. Lawyers for Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira have claimed that the report would reveal sensitive grand jury material -- such as communications obtained via a subpoena -- and support the finding that \"everyone Smith charged is guilty of the crimes charged.\"",
      "Describing Smith as a \"rogue actor with a personal and political vendetta,\" lawyers for Trump's co-defendants argued in a filing that the report would irreparably bias the public by amplifying the government's \"narrative\" without providing Trump and his co-defendants the ability to respond.",
      "\"Smith's planned Final Report -- now that he is unshackled from due process requirements that restrained him as a government actor -- would engender the very prejudice, passion, and excitement and be an exercise of the tyrannical power that our court system is designed to insulate against,\" the filing said.",
      "In a brief filing Tuesday, a lawyer on Smith's staff confirmed that the special counsel's office is \"working to finalize\" its report, and said that Garland will have the final say over what material will be made public.",

      "Alito spoke to Trump to recommend an ex-clerk for a job in his administration.",
      "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito spoke to President-elect Donald Trump by phone Tuesday to recommend one of his former law clerks for a job in the new administration, ABC News has learned.",
      "\"William Levi, one of my former law clerks, asked me to take a call from President-elect Trump regarding his qualifications to serve in a government position,\" Justice Alito confirmed to ABC News Wednesday. \"I agreed to discuss this matter with President-elect Trump, and he called me yesterday afternoon.\"",
      "The call occurred just hours before Trump's lawyers on Wednesday morning filed an emergency request with the justices asking them to block a New York judge from moving forward with sentencing Trump on Friday in his criminal hush money case.",
      "Alito said that he and Trump did not discuss that matter.",
      "\"We did not discuss the emergency application he filed today, and indeed, I was not even aware at the time of our conversation that such an application would be filed,\" Alito said. \"We also did not discuss any other matter that is pending or might in the future come before the Supreme Court or any past Supreme Court decisions involving the President-elect.\"",
      "It is not unusual for a sitting justice to offer a job recommendation for a former clerk, but it is rare, court analysts said, for a justice to have such a conversation directly with a sitting president or president-elect, especially one with an active stake in business pending before the court.",
      "Late last month, Trump waded into a momentous case over the future of the video-sharing app TikTok, asking the justices to delay an impending ban on the extraordinary grounds that he \"alone possesses the consummate dealmaking expertise, the electoral mandate, and the political will to negotiate a resolution to save the platform while addressing the national security concerns expressed by the Government.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Trump asked the justices to immediately halt all criminal proceedings against him in New York, including Friday's sentencing, warning that failing to do so during a presidential transition would \"damage\" the presidency and disrupt \"national security and America's vital interests.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has asked for a response from prosecutors in New York by Thursday at 10 a.m. ET. It's expected to weigh in on Trump's request by Friday morning.",
      "Levi is being considered for various legal jobs in the incoming administration, including general counsel of the Department of Defense, sources said. Levi, who clerked for Justice Alito from 2011-2012, served in the first Trump administration as chief of staff to then-Attorney General Bill Barr.",
      "\"The justices of the Supreme Court are, among other things, employers to their law clerks,\" said ABC News contributor Kate Shaw, who clerked for former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens. \"So providing a reference for a former employee is not atypical, whatever job a former clerk may be applying for -- an academic job, private sector job, or even a government job.\"",
      "But Shaw said such a call between a justice and a president-elect is highly unusual, especially when the president-elect is engaged in multiple legal actions with the potential to go before the Supreme Court.",
      "A spokesperson for Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Alito has previously faced calls to recuse himself from cases related to the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and the 2020 election. Last year he rejected Democrats' calls for his recusal from those cases after flags flown at his personal residences sparked controversy. Chief Justice John Roberts subsequently declined an invitation by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee for a meeting to discuss the court's ethical practices in light of the flags controversy involving Alito.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), in a May 23 letter requesting Alito's recusal over the displays, wrote that Alito \"actively engaged in political activity, failed to avoid the appearance of impropriety, and failed to act in a manner that promotes public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary.\"",
      "\"He also created reasonable doubt about his impartiality and his ability to fairly discharge his duties in cases related to the 2020 presidential election and January 6th attack on the Capitol,\" the two wrote.",
      "Trump is due to be sentenced Friday after he was found guilty in May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels in order to boost his electoral prospects in the 2016 presidential election.",

    "story": [
      "AG Garland said he intends to release the report to some members of Congress.",
      "The judge who dismissed former President Donald Trump's classified documents case should have the final say about the release of special counsel Jack Smith's final report on the case, lawyers for Trump's former co-defendants told a federal appeals court Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The attorneys asked the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to defer their decision to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who could hold a hearing over whether to release the report.",
      "\"This reflects an improper attempt to remove from the district court the responsibility to oversee and control the flow of information related to a criminal trial over which it presides, and to place that role instead in the hands of the prosecuting authority -- who unlike the trial court has a vested interest in furthering its own narrative of culpability,\" lawyers for Trump aide Walt Nauta and staffer Carlos De Oliveria argued.",
      "The arguments came a day after Cannon temporarily blocked the release of Smith's final report in order to prevent \"irreparable harm,\" while the matter is considered by the Eleventh Circuit.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, attorneys in the U.S. attorney general's office said in a filing that Attorney General Merrick Garland does not intend to publicly release the portion of the report related to the classified documents case, though the volume will be available to the ranking members and chairs of the House and Senate Judiciary committees.",
      "Defense lawyers argued in their afternoon filing that the limited disclosure of the full report to the chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees would imperil the case through possible leaks, calling the prosecution a \"political case.\"",
      "\"The functioning of the political press depends on leaks, and if such leaks occur here, there will be no recourse for the defendants whose due process rights are at stake,\" the filing said. \"The concern about leaks cannot be overlooked; Congress is a political body; its individual members have political aims; and this is a political case.\"",
      "Though the defense lawyers acknowledged the politics related to the report in their filing, they accused prosecutors of creating \"fake urgency\" related to the timing of the report's release.",
      "\"The only counsel in this case now claiming urgency is the Attorney General, but the government's brief does not explain this urgency,\" lawyers wrote in papers filed less than two weeks from Trump's inauguration. \"The Attorney General is an office and not an individual: It will continue in perpetuity. The urgency of political activity is a fake urgency.\"",
      "Prosecutors in their filing also indicted that Garland intends to publicly release the portion of the report related to his federal election interference case against Trump.",
      "They argued in their filing that Garland has the \"inherent\" authority to release the report, and they asked the Eleventh Circuit to vacate Judge Cannon's order and deny the request from Trump's former co-defendants, Nauta and De Oliveira, to block the release of the report.",
      "Prosecutors argued that because Smith already transmitted his report to Garland, the argument made by Trump's former co-defendants about the legitimacy of Smith's appointment is \"moot.\"",
      "\"The Attorney General is the Senate-confirmed head of the Department of Justice and is vested with the authority to supervise all officers and employees of the Department. The Attorney General thus has authority to decide whether to release an investigative report prepared by his subordinates,\" prosecutors said in their filing.",
      "\"That authority is inherent in the office of Attorney General; it does not depend on the lawfulness of the Special Counsel's appointment to take actions as an inferior officer of the United States or on the Department's specific regulations authorizing the Attorney General to approve the public release of Special Counsel reports,\" the filing said.",
      "While defense attorneys had sought to block the release of Volume Two of the report related to the classified documents case -- and not Volume One, which covers Trump's election interference case -- Judge Cannon's order referred only to the \"final report,\" and not the two volumes within, suggesting that the entire report was blocked from release.",
      "Prosecutors asked the appeals court to \"make clear that there is no impediment to the Attorney General allowing for limited congressional review of Volume Two as described above and the publicly release of Volume One.\"",
      "The filing makes clear that the decision by Garland to not release the volume of the report involving the classified documents investigation was recommended by Smith himself when it was transmitted to Garland Tuesday evening.",
      "\"Because Volume Two discusses the roles of defendants Nauta and De Oliveira, and because those matters remain pending appeal before this Court, the Special Counsel explained in his cover letter to the Attorney General that, \u201cconsistent with Department policy, Volume Two should not be publicly released while their case remains pending,\u201d\" the filing says.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty in June 2023 to 37 criminal counts related to his handling of classified materials, after prosecutors said he repeatedly refused to return hundreds of documents containing classified information ranging from U.S. nuclear secrets to the nation's defense capabilities, and took steps to thwart the government's efforts to get the documents back.",
      "The former president, along with Nauta and De Oliveira, also pleaded not guilty in a superseding indictment to allegedly attempting to delete surveillance footage at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.",

      "ATLANTA -- Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has asked Georgia's highest court to review a lower appeals court's ruling that removed her from the Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others.",
      "The Georgia Court of Appeals last month ruled that Willis and her office could not continue to prosecute the case because of an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d created by a romantic relationship she had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade, whom she had hired to lead the case. In a petition filed late Wednesday, Willis asked the Georgia Supreme Court to review and reverse that decision.",
      "The filing argues that the 2-1 ruling \u201coverreached the Court of Appeals' authority,\u201d creating a new standard for disqualification of a prosecutor and disregarding decades of precedent.",
      "Even if the high court eventually rules in Willis\u2019 favor, it seems unlikely that she will be able to prosecute Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20. But there are 14 other defendants who still face charges in the case.",
      "A grand jury in Atlanta indicted Trump and 18 others in August 2023, using the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law to accuse them of participating in a wide-ranging scheme to illegally try to overturn Trump\u2019s narrow 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia. The alleged scheme included Trump\u2019s call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger urging him to help find enough votes to beat Biden. Four people have pleaded guilty. Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.",
      "The Georgia case was one of four criminal cases brought last year against Trump.

    "story": [
      "Evacuating a wildfire area can be scary, but experts say people can significantly improve their own safety with a little preparation and situational awareness",
      "Evacuating a wildfire area can be scary, but experts say people can significantly improve their own safety with a little preparation and common sense.",
      "Creating a wildfire action plan, packing a \u201cgo bag\u201d and maintaining basic situational awareness during evacuations can make a big difference when escaping a disaster, Jesse Torres, a battalion chief for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said",
      "But the most important tip? Don't wait around for an evacuation order, Torres said.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing is to get out early, before the notifications come out. It\u2019s so important to avoid the congestion,\u201d he said. That\u2019s especially true in areas that have narrow roadways or limited routes, Torres said, because traffic jams can form quickly: \u201cEveryone\u2019s doing the same thing \u2014 they\u2019re all trying to get out.\u201d",
      "Here are some safety tips on what to do before and during a wildfire evacuation, and what to do if you get trapped.",
      "Many communities, including several in California, have warning alert systems that allow residents to sign up for push notifications to their mobile phones or email accounts.",
      "FEMA has a downloadable app that provides real-time alerts on mobile phones, and public safety agencies can also push alerts to television, radio and wireless devices through the Integrated Public Alert & Warning System. The NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards is a nationwide network of radio stations that broadcast continuous weather information as well as official Weather Service warnings, forecasts and other hazard information.",
      "A battery- or crank-operated portable radio can also be a critical tool for receiving emergency alerts, especially in areas where cellular service is unreliable or when regional cellular towers might be threatened by wind, fire or other hazards.",
      "Household emergency action plans help ensure that all members of a family know exactly what to do and where to go during a wildfire. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says emergency plans should be tailored for a household's unique circumstances, taking into account things like special medical needs or whether a family has livestock.",
      "Strong wildfire action plans typically include: A pre-arranged meeting point well outside the area of danger where household members can meet to determine who has evacuated; multiple escape routes out of the area so people know which way to go if one pathway to safety is blocked; arrangements for any family members with disabilities or medical conditions; arrangements for pets and livestock; and a communication plan that identifies someone outside the area to be the main contact point in case household members get separated.",
      "When it's time to evacuate, having a pre-packed \u201cgo bag\u201d or emergency supply kit can save valuable minutes, Torres said.",
      "Cal Fire says a \u201cgo bag\u201d should include a map with at least two evacuation routes; necessary prescriptions or medical items like eyeglasses; extra car keys, cash or credit cards; a basic first aid kit; a flashlight and battery-powered radio with extra batteries; and copies of important documents like passports or birth certificates. It should also include a three-day supply of non-perishable food and water per person, as well as food and water for any pets. N95 masks can help filter out many of the particles in wildfire smoke, and an extra cellphone battery or charger can also be helpful.",
      "\u201cGo bags\u201d should be accessible and easy to grab in an emergency, Torres said.",
      "\u201cPlan like you're going on a trip for seven days. Have clothes, toilet paper, toothbrush, soap, a towel in there,\u201d Torres said. \u201cYou might end up in an evacuation center, or you might end up with family, so be prepared.\u201d",
      "If time allows, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends connecting water hoses and filling garbage cans, tubs, pools and the like with water to help firefighters if they end up on your property.",
      "\u201cClose all your windows, and if you\u2019re able to and aware of how to do it safely, shut off the gas and power to your home,\" he said. Closing doors, windows and vents will help prevent embers from blowing inside and catching the interior on fire, Torres said.",
      "Even if you don't have a \u201cgo bag\u201d or a wildfire action plan set up, don't dally if you feel like danger is near, Torres said.",
      "Fires can move faster than humans, especially when they are driven by high winds. And all sorts of things, including downed power lines, thick smoke, abandoned cars, blowing debris and heavy traffic can impede escape routes during emergencies.",
      "\u201cJust get out of those warning- and evacuation order-zones. If you have family on the other side of the county, go to the other side of the county,\" Torres said. \u201cGet out and get off the roadways as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "If you can't evacuate, your car breaks down or you get stuck for some other reason, don't panic, Torres said. Instead, take a look around and call 911.",
      "\u201cRealize where you are, what street you are at. Can you see an address sign? Call 911, so we can get resources out to you to try to find you,\u201d Torres said.",
      "Sometimes people lose sight of the fire during an evacuation, and it can be hard to tell where they are in all the smoke. An intersection or landmark can help emergency responders identify someone's location and determine if they are in immediate danger, he said. Again, it's crucial not to delay \u2014 go ahead and call 911 to \u201cget that process started,\u201d said Torres.",
      "If someone can walk to a safe spot, they should do that, Torres said. In that scenario, stay on a main route if possible, because that increases the chances of being spotted by a passing car or emergency responder, he said."

      "Sept. 11 survivors and victims\u2019 relatives have mixed feelings about a planned plea deal for accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed",
      "NEW YORK -- After his only child was killed on 9/11, Ken Fairben looked for justice in a far-off military courtroom on the Guant\u00e1namo Bay naval base in Cuba.",
      "He traveled there multiple times to observe hearings for accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and co-defendants, and Fairben has watched other proceedings via closed-circuit video at a military facility near his Long Island home.",
      "He has gotten to know other victims' families on these journeys and taken pained note of the plaque on a wall of a Guantanamo trailer where relatives take court breaks. The sign bears the names of several loved ones who have died while the case has ground on.",
      "And now, after nearly two decades of turns, delays and emotionally exhausting flux, Fairben and his wife, Diane, are waiting to see whether Mohammed pleads guilty as scheduled in the hijacked-plane attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people, including paramedic Keith Fairben, at New York's World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field.",
      "It's unclear whether the pleas will happen.",
      "The federal government negotiated but then disavowed the deals and now is asking a court to block them, while defense lawyers want the plan to go forward. So does Ken Fairben, who planned to be at a Long Island military site Friday to watch if the hearing goes forward.",
      "\u201cI honestly felt that there was progress being made. Whether you agree with a plea deal or not, it wasn\u2019t like we were in limbo and no light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Fairben said, emphasizing that he speaks only for himself.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s never closure,\u201d he added, but he sees some meaning in a guilty plea and life sentence without the possibility of parole.",
      "Among Sept. 11 survivors and victims' relatives, the potential end to the drawn-out, debated and fraught case stirs a range of feelings: uncertainty, hope, anger, gratification, resignation, and a thirst for more answers about how the attacks were arranged and financed.",
      "Some families are dismayed by the plea agreements. The deals would take death sentences off the table and guilty pleas would short-circuit the possibility of a trial and the information it could bring to light \u2014 a prospect that's particularly upsetting to some relatives.",
      "\u201cDoesn\u2019t the American public, as well as the victims\u2019 families, deserve to hear the evidence we have against these individuals?\u201d asks Gordon Haberman, who has traveled to multiple Guantanamo hearings from his Wisconsin home but finds travel physically difficult now. His daughter, Andrea, was in New York for the first time, on a business trip, when she died in the World Trade Center attack.",
      "Congressional intelligence committees and, later, an independent, bipartisan commission, investigated the attacks and released findings in the early 2000s. In recent years, a secret chapter of the congressional inquiry and some FBI documents have been declassified and released.",
      "Some survivors and victims' relatives believe a Guantanamo trial could shake loose more information, particularly about whether the Saudi Arabian government backed the hijackers. That's the question at the heart of a lawsuit some families are pursuing in a federal court in New York. The kingdom denies involvement, and information the U.S. has released doesn't provide proof that senior Saudi officials were complicit.",
      "Brett Eagleson, a son of Sept. 11 victim John Bruce Eagleson, sees the potential Guantanamo plea deals as a betrayal and part of a \u201clong and epic trail of failure\u201d by the U.S. government to provide evidence to 9/11 families who are pursuing the Saudi claims.",
      "\"It\u2019s a sad day for America. It\u2019s a sad day for justice,\u201d said Eagleson, a plaintiff in the lawsuit and the president of a victims\u2019 and survivors\u2019 advocacy group called 9/11 Justice. He was a teenager when his father, a Connecticut mall manager who went by Bruce, was killed while at the World Trade Center on business.",
      "Any potential trial before a military commission at Guantanamo would likely be complicated by the torture of the defendants while in CIA custody in the first years after they were apprehended. The pretrial hearings have focused largely on how the abuse may taint the overall evidence in the case.",
      "To Eagleson, it's infuriating that the issue has affected the viability of a trial. What happened to the defendants in custody is \u201cnot my mom\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not my brother\u2019s fault. It\u2019s not the lives of 3,000 dead Americans\u2019 fault,\u201d he said.",
      "Elizabeth Miller drove 5 1/2 hours in a looming winter storm to catch a military flight to Guantanamo in hopes of seeing Mohammed's scheduled plea in person.",
      "After several previous journeys to the arid, isolated military base to see him and other aging defendants sit through one pretrial hearing after another, she came to expect dysfunction and disappointment from the military commission. But she was excited to make the trip this time.",
      "\u201cHaving KSM say that he\u2019s guilty on record is important for me. And I think it\u2019s important for the American people,\" said Miller, who was 6 when her firefighter father, Douglas Miller, was killed at the World Trade Center.",
      "She now leads a group of 9/11 families who support the plea deal and oppose any death penalty for the accused.",
      "Robert Reeg, a now-retired firefighter who was seriously wounded responding to 9/11, went over the years to Guantanamo to watch a pretrial hearing and to Washington to talk to lawmakers about the slow pace of the case. He wanted to see it go to trial and views the prospective plea deals as \u201csurrender.\u201d",
      "\"These enemies think we\u2019re weak and irresolute, and this kind of proves it,\u201d he said.",
      "But he won\u2019t be following the news from Guantanamo moment to moment if it goes forward Friday. He will be too busy caring for his toddler granddaughter, and \u201cI\u2019ve had enough salt in my wounds,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cAt a certain point in time, you just have to be resigned,\u201d he said. \u201cAll you can do is give your best effort, and I did. And I can live with that.\u201d",

      "Businessman, Navy officer, evangelist, politician, negotiator, author, woodworker, citizen of the world \u2014 Carter forged a path that still challenges political assumptions and stands out among the 45 men who reached the nation\u2019s highest office.

      "Lawyers for the accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed are urging a federal appeals panel to let his scheduled guilty plea in the attacks go forward",
      "WASHINGTON -- Lawyers for accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed are urging a federal appeals panel to let his scheduled guilty plea Friday n Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, go forward in a plea agreement that would spare him and two co-defendants the risk of the death penalty in al-Qaida's notorious Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.",
      "Defense lawyers in a filing late Wednesday described Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's attempts to throw out a plea deal that his own military had negotiated and approved as the latest in two decades of \u201cfitful\" and \u201cnegligent\u201d mishandling of the case by the U.S. military and successive administrations.",
      "Mohammed is due to enter his plea Friday morning in the attacks, in which 19 al-Qaida hijackers smashed airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and another crashed into a Pennsylvania field, killing nearly 3,000 people. Family members of some of the victims are gathered at Guantanamo for the moment.",
      "Austin unexpectedly renounced the plea agreement after it was announced this summer, and the Biden administration's Justice Department is seeking to block Mohammed's plea from going forward at a U.S. military commission courtroom.",
      "\u201cAn 11th-hour stay will accomplish nothing but more delay and it will reward the government for its \u2014 at best \u2014 negligent handling\u201d of the 9/11 prosecutions, Mohammed's lawyers argued in a filing to a District of Columbia federal appeals panel just before midnight.",
      "The federal appeals panel appears on track to possibly rule Thursday on the request by the Democratic Biden administration.",
      "Legal and logistical challenges have bogged down the 9/11 case in the 17 years since Mohammed, who prosecutors say conceived the idea of using hijacked planes in the attacks, was first charged. The case remains in pre-trial hearings, with no trial date set.",
      "Years of defense and prosecution testimony are ongoing about how much the sustained torture of Mohammed and other defendants in CIA custody renders their later statements legally inadmissible.",
      "With the prosecution in the Sept. 11 attacks dragging on for decades and no conclusion in sight, military prosecutors this summer notified families of the victims that the senior Pentagon official overseeing Guantanamo had approved a plea deal after more than two years of negotiations.",
      "The deal was \u201cthe best path to finality and justice,\u201d military prosecutors told families then. In it, Mohammed and co-defendants Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi agreed to plead guilty to 2,976 murder charges in exchange for life sentences.",
      "Austin unexpectedly announced Aug. 2 that he was nullifying the plea deal, and he has fought since then to scrap it. He argues that a decision on death penalties in an attack as grave as Sept. 11 should only be made by the defense secretary.",
      "Defense attorneys say that the plea agreement is already in effect and that Austin has no legal standing to throw it out after the fact. The Biden administration went to the federal appeals court Tuesday after the Guantanamo judge and a military review panel sided against Austin's request.",
      "Mohammed's attorneys argued in the new filing that Austin's \u201cextraordinary intervention in this case is solely a product of his lack of oversight over his own duly appointed delegate,\u201d meaning the senior Pentagon official overseeing Guantanamo.",
      "The Justice Department's brief earlier this week said that the government would be irreparably harmed if the guilty pleas were accepted for Mohammed and the two co-defendants in the Sept. 11 attacks.",
      "It said the government would be denied a chance for a public trial and the opportunity to \u201cseek capital punishment against three men charged with a heinous act of mass murder that caused the death of thousands of people and shocked the nation and the world.\u201d",

      "An annual U.S. government report on \u201cnotorious markets\u201d known for counterfeiting and other violations of intellectual property says that nearly all 35,000 online pharmacies around the world are being run illegally",
      "BANGKOK -- Nearly all of the world\u2019s 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s annual report on \u201c notorious markets.\u201d The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products.",
      "The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities.",
      "The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings.",
      "Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources.",
      "It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies\u2019 Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines.",
      "Last year, Federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said.",
      "Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed.",
      "The USTR\u2019s annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S.",
      "The \u201cNotorious Markets List\u201d did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods.",
      "In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August.",
      "The report said the world\u2019s then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024.",
      "In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property.",
      "The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait.",
      "But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called \u201cbulletproof\u201d internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said.",
      "One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products.",
      "Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China\u2019s largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection.",
      "The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods.",
      "It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others.",
      "IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said.",
      "While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam\u2019s Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "The report said Bangkok\u2019s MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there."

      "Nearly a decade ago, intense protests over racial injustice rocked the University of Missouri\u2019s flagship campus, leading to the resignation of two top administrators. The university then hired its first-ever vice chancellor for inclusion, diversity and equity. Tensions were so high that football players were threatening a boycott and a graduate student went on hunger strike.",
      "Today, the entire diversity office is gone, an example of changes sweeping universities in states led by conservatives, and a possible harbinger of things to come nationwide.",
      "\u201cI feel like that is the future, especially for the next four years of Trump\u2019s presidency,\u201d said Kenny Douglas, a history and Black studies major on the campus in Columbia, Missouri.",
      "As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, both conservative and liberal politicians say higher education changes in red parts of America could be a road map for the rest of the country.",
      "Dozens of diversity, equity and inclusion programs have already closed in states including Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, Iowa, Nebraska and Texas. In some cases, lessons about racial and gender identity have been phased out. Supports and resources for underrepresented students have disappeared. Some students say changes in campus climate have led them to consider dropping out.",
      "During his campaign, Trump vowed to end \u201cwokeness\u201d and \u201cleftist indoctrination\u201d in education. He pledged to dismantle diversity programs that he says amount to discrimination, and to impose fines on colleges \"up to the entire amount of their endowment.\u201d",
      "Many conservatives have taken a similar view. Erec Smith, a research fellow at the free-market Cato Institute whose scholarship examines anti-racist activism and Black conservatism, said DEI sends the message that \u201cwhiteness is oppression.\" Diversity efforts are \"thoroughly robbing Black people and other minorities of a sense of agency,\" he said.",
      "The New College of Florida, a tiny liberal arts institution once known as the most progressive of Florida\u2019s public campuses and a refuge for LGBTQ+ students, became a centerpiece for Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 \u201cwar on woke.\u201d DeSantis overhauled the school\u2019s Board of Trustees in 2023, appointing a new majority of conservative allies, including culture war strategist Christopher Rufo.",
      "Many faculty departed last year, leaving vacancies that the new leadership has filled with a variety of conservative academics \u2014 and non-academics, including British comedian and conservative commentator Andrew Doyle, who will be teaching a new course this January called \u201cThe Woke Movement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is only the beginning,\u201d Rufo wrote in the forward to school President Richard Corcoran\u2019s new book, \u201cStorming the Ivory Tower.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s opponents dismiss his depictions of liberal indoctrination on campuses as a fiction. But conservatives point to diversity programs and the student debt crisis as evidence colleges are out of touch.",
      "\u201cWhat happens if you are an institution that\u2019s trying to change society?\u201d asked Adam Kissel of the conservative Heritage Foundation \u2014 the group behind Project 2025, a sweeping anti-DEI blueprint for a new GOP administration that Trump has disavowed while nominating some of its authors for administrative roles. \u201cSociety will push back on you.\u201d",
      "Pushback is exactly what DEI programs have faced.",
      "Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican, in March signed into law a bill barring state funding for public colleges that advocate for \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d including that someone should feel guilty because of their race or gender. The law also states people at schools and colleges must use the bathroom that matches their gender assigned at birth.",
      "The effects of the anti-DEI law rippled through campuses including the University of Alabama and Auburn University, the state\u2019s two largest four-year colleges. DEI offices and designated areas for LGBTQ+ and Black students closed when classes started in late August  \u2014 just before the law took effect.",
      "Dakota Grimes, a graduate student in chemistry, was disappointed when Auburn University closed the campus\u2019 Pride Center, a designated safe space for LGBTQ+ people and allies. Grimes' organization, Sexuality and Gender Alliance, still meets regularly in the library, she said, but LGBTQ+ students don\u2019t feel as welcome on campus. Students are subjected to homophobic and transphobic slurs, Grimes said.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t feel safe just sitting in the student center because of the kind of environment that a lot of students and even teachers create on campus,\u201d Grimes said.",
      "Julia Dominguez, a political science senior at the University of Alabama and president of the Hispanic-Latino Association, said funding for the group\u2019s annual Hispanic Heritage Month festival was pulled two weeks before the event in September. Students who were once excited about being at a school that celebrates Latino culture, she said, are now feeling dejected and disillusioned.",

      "In Idaho, DEI programs have been under attack for years, with Republican lawmakers blasting efforts to build an inclusive culture as \"divisive and exclusionary.\" In recent sessions, the Legislature has blocked colleges and universities from using taxpayer dollars on campus DEI programs. A 2024 law banned written \u201cdiversity statements\u201d in higher education hiring and student admissions.",
      "In December, the State Board of Education scrapped DEI offices, causing shockwaves at the University of Idaho. Doctoral student Nick Koenig is considering leaving the state.",
      "\u201cWhere do your true values lie?\u201d asked Koenig, who decided to move to Idaho to research climate change after a Zoom call with the then-director of the school\u2019s LGBT center. \u201cIt\u2019s not with the students that are most marginalized.\u201d",
      "So far, nearly all of the threats to DEI have come from state legislatures, said Jeremy Young, of the free-expression group PEN America.",
      "\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been much support at the federal level to do anything,\" he said. \"Now, of course, that\u2019s going to change.\u201d",
      "Young anticipates that diversity considerations will be eliminated for research grants and possibly for accreditation. The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights typically investigates discrimination against people of color, but under Trump, that office could start investigating diversity programs that conservatives argue are discriminatory.",
      "Republicans also may have more leeway to take action at the state level, thanks to an administration that's \u201cgoing to get out of the way of red states and let them pursue these policies,\" said Preston Cooper, a senior fellow who studies higher education policy at the American Enterprise Institute.",
      "Colleges are also cutting some programs or majors seen as unprofitable. Whether politics plays into decisions to eliminate certain courses of student remains to be seen.",
      "Douglas, the University of Missouri student, is concerned. He said the promise of change that followed the earlier protests on the Columbia campus has dissipated.",
      "This fall, a student group he is part of had to rename its Welcome Black BBQ because the university wanted it to be \u201cwelcoming to all.\u201d The Legion of Black Collegians, which started in 1968 after students waved a Confederate flag at a football game, complained the change was erasing its visibility on campus.",
      "For Douglas and many others, the struggle for civil rights that prompted diversity efforts isn\u2019t a thing of the past. \u201cWhite people might have moved past it, but Black people are still experiencing it,\u201d he said.",

      "A fast-moving fire has broken out in the Hollywood Hills about a mile from the Hollywood Walk of Fame",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A fast-moving fire broke out in the hills above Hollywood Boulevard and threatened some of the most popular Los Angeles tourist spots as firefighters battled to get control on two other major blazes that killed five people, put 130,000 people under evacuation orders and ravaged communities from the Pacific Coast to inland Pasadena.",
      "The Sunset Fire started around 5:45 p.m. Wednesday as officials were holding a news conference to update residents on efforts to fight massive blazes in Pacific Palisades and Altadena and to warn that fire danger remained high. Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley made a hasty exit after announcing the new fire and soon after an evacuation order was issued.",
      "The Hollywood Walk of Fame was bustling and the streets around the TCL Chinese Theatre and Madame Tussauds were packed with stop-and-go traffic as sirens blared and low-flying helicopters flew overhead to dump water on the flames, which were only about a mile away. People toting suitcases left hotels while some onlookers walked toward the flames, recording the fire on their phones.",
      "Within a few hours firefighters had made major progress. Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Erik Scott said they were able to keep the fire in check because \u201cwe hit it hard and fast and mother nature was a little nicer to us today than she was yesterday.\u201d",
      "A day earlier, hurricane-force winds blew embers through the air, igniting block after block in the Los Angeles coastline neighborhood of Pacific Palisades and about 25 miles (40 kilometers) to the east in Altadena, an unincorporated community near Pasadena.",
      "Nearly 2,000 homes, businesses and other structures have been destroyed in the Eaton and Palisades fires, and the number is expected to increase. The five deaths recorded so far were from the Eaton Fire.",
      "The Palisades Fire already is the most destructive in Los Angeles history, with at least 1,000 structures burned.",
      "More than half a dozen schools in the area were either damaged or destroyed, including Palisades Charter High School, which has been featured in many Hollywood productions, including the 1976 horror movie \u201cCarrie\u201d and the TV series \u201cTeen Wolf,\u201d officials said. UCLA has canceled classes for the week.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said air operations were dousing flames. She warned they still faced \u201cerratic winds,\u201d though not like Tuesday evening, when aircraft had to be grounded and much of the destruction occurred.",
      "In Pasadena, Fire Chief Chad Augustin said the city's water system was stretched and was further hampered by power outages, but even without those issues, firefighters would not have been able to stop the fire due to the intense winds fanning the flames.",
      "\u201cThose erratic wind gusts were throwing embers for multiple miles ahead of the fire,\u201d he said.",
      "As flames moved through his neighborhood, Jose Velasquez sprayed down his family\u2019s Altadena home with water as embers rained down on the roof. He managed to save their home, which also houses their family business selling churros, a Mexican pastry. Others weren\u2019t so lucky. Many of his neighbors were at work when they lost their homes.",
      "\u201cSo we had to call a few people and then we had people messaging, asking if their house was still standing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had to tell them that it\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "In Pacific Palisades, a hillside area along the coast dotted with celebrity homes, the scope of the destruction was just becoming clear:",
      "Block after block of California Mission Style homes and bungalows were reduced to charred remains. Ornate iron railing wrapped around the smoldering frame of one house Swimming pools were blackened with soot, and sports cars slumped on melted tires.",
      "The apocalyptic scenes spread for miles.",
      "The flames marched toward highly populated and affluent neighborhoods, including Calabasas and Santa Monica, home to California\u2019s rich and famous.",
      "Mandy Moore, Cary Elwes and Paris Hilton were among the stars who lost homes. Billy Crystal and his wife Janice lost their home of 45 years in the Palisades Fire.",
      "\u201cWe raised our children and grandchildren here. Every inch of our house was filled with love. Beautiful memories that can\u2019t be taken away,\" the Crystals wrote in the statement.",
      "In Palisades Village, the public library, two major grocery stores, a pair of banks and several boutiques were destroyed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just really weird coming back to somewhere that doesn\u2019t really exist anymore,\u201d said Dylan Vincent, who returned to the neighborhood to retrieve some items and saw that his elementary school had burned down and that whole blocks had been flattened.",
      "The fires have consumed a total of about 42 square miles (108 square kilometers) \u2014 nearly the size of the entire city of San Francisco.",
      "Flames moved so quickly that many barely had time to escape. Police sought shelter inside their patrol cars, and residents at a senior living center were pushed in wheelchairs and hospital beds down a street to safety.",
      "In the race to get away in Pacific Palisades, roadways became impassable when scores of people abandoned their vehicles and set out on foot.",
      "California\u2019s wildfire season is beginning earlier and ending later due to rising temperatures and decreased rainfall tied to climate change, according to recent data. Rains that usually end fire season are often delayed, meaning fires can burn through the winter months, according to the Western Fire Chiefs Association.",
      "Dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, which has not seen more than 0.1 inches (2.5 millimeters) of rain since early May.",
      "The winds increased to 80 mph (129 kph) Wednesday, according to reports received by the National Weather Service. Forecasters predicted wind gusts of 35-55 mph (56 to 88 kph) that could rise higher in the mountains and foothills. Fire conditions could last through Friday.",
      "President Joe Biden signed a federal emergency declaration after arriving at a Santa Monica fire station for a briefing with Gov. Gavin Newsom, who dispatched National Guard troops to help.",
      "Several Hollywood studios suspended production, and Universal Studios closed its theme park between Pasadena and Pacific Palisades.",
      "As of Wednesday evening, more than 456,000 people were without power in southern California, according to the tracking website PowerOutage.us.",
      "Several Southern California landmarks were heavily damaged, including the Reel Inn in Malibu, a seafood restaurant. Owner Teddy Leonard and her husband hope to rebuild.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Wednesday cancelled the final overseas trip of his presidency just hours before he was set to depart for Rome and the Vatican, choosing to remain in Washington to monitor the response to devastating fires raging in California.",
      "Biden was scheduled to leave Thursday afternoon, after eulogizing former President Jimmy Carter at a memorial service in Washington, for the three-day trip to meet with Pope Francis and Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The trip was meant as a coda to the second Catholic U.S. president\u2019s time in the White House and a final opportunity to showcase the strength of American alliances before he leaves office on Jan. 20.",
      "The announcement of the trip\u2019s cancellation comes just hours after Biden departed Los Angeles after meeting his first great-grandchild, who was born Wednesday at an area hospital. He received a briefing from local fire officials before returning to Washington, as smoke and ash from blazes raging in the area clouded the daytime sky.",

      "New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick says she has hired former New York Police Commissioner William J",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said she had hired former New York Police Commissioner William J. Bratton as a consultant during a tense city council meeting Wednesday as officials and residents sought answers over security lapses after a terror attack that killed 14 people in the French Quarter.",
      "Kirkpatrick also told councilmembers she won't step down.",
      "\u201cI will not resign,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cI believe I can be that person to lead us forward.\u201d",
      "Kirkpatrick assumed a defensive stance as the city council prepares to launch its own investigation into the street barrier systems within and around Bourbon Street, where on New Year's Day an Islamic State group-inspired attacker drove his F-150 truck around a police car blockading the street and rampaged down the city's most famous thoroughfare.",
      "Bollards, protective columns designed to block vehicle traffic, had been removed from the entrance of Bourbon Street because the city was in the process of replacing them. However, the replacement barriers being installed are not designed to stop a fast-moving truck, according to a Nola.com report.",
      "Mayor LaToya Cantrell has acknowledged she could not confirm if the new bollard system is sufficient to stop a similar vehicle attack. And on Monday, state Attorney General Liz Murrill ordered a review of security measures that were in place for New Year\u2019s celebrations and the Sugar Bowl.",
      "One group of law firms announced Wednesday that they have secured nearly two dozen victims of the attack as clients and are conducting their own investigation, stating that \u201cofficials were tragically aware and did not protect the public.\u201d One of the firms, Romanucci & Blandin, helped George Floyd\u2019s family secure a $27 million settlement against the city of Minneapolis after he was killed by a police officer.",
      "Kirkpatrick has been praised for helping lead the city's troubled police department to the brink of ending more than a decade of federal oversight that was ordered after a history of mistreatment of African Americans and corruption. She took over the department in late 2023.",
      "She told the city council that she lacked clarity about the inventory and condition of security systems around Bourbon Street. She had said the day of the attack that the city did not deploy wedge barriers because they \u201chad malfunction problems\" and that the attacker had \u201cdefeated\u201d the city's security plans.",
      "She also told NBC last week that she hadn't known the city had portable Archer barriers which could have been placed on sidewalks.",
      "Bratton specializes in risk assessment and response with the New York-based firm Teneo. Bratton's contract is being paid for by the nonprofit New Orleans Police and Justice Foundation, Kirkpatrick said.",
      "Bratton and the foundation did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThere will be a time and a place for reflective review of our actions -- that is not today,\u201d Kirkpatrick said, noting she was focused on her officers' wellbeing after many responded to the traumatic incident.",
      "Several councilmembers expressed concern over whether Bratton would work closely with the city council and complained that they had not been involved in his hiring. Councilmember J.P. Morrell urged the police department to engage the public as it evaluates security measures with Bratton.",
      "\u201cRight now, people are scared,\u201d Morrell said.",
      "Council President Helena Moreno observed that representatives of the city's Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness were absent from the meeting and \u201cmay have the answers that we\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d",
      "Collin Arnold, the department's director, told The Associated Press he had not been invited to participate but would have done so if asked. The councilmember chairing the meeting, Oliver Thomas, told the AP that his staff had reached out to Arnold.",
      "Arnold said his department helped install the retractable bollards purchased by the city in 2017, though he said it became clear that they were \u201cnot made for Bourbon Street.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bollards would become clogged almost nightly with debris, and then they could either not be opened or not be closed. It became a real problem,\u201d Arnold said.",
      "He said his department was not involved in selecting or installing the new bollards.",
      "Councilmember Joe Giarrusso warned that finger-pointing would persist \u201cuntil we get a better handle on what governance looks like and who is responsible\u201d for Bourbon Street security measures.",
      "Members of the public expressed their frustrations with city officials at the meeting for failing to stop the attack from happening, with some saying it was the outcome of the city's longstanding failure to bolster its ailing infrastructure.",
      "\u201cThe response (to the attack) was very well executed but the preparedness was absolutely an atrocity,\u201d said Nellie Catzen, who leads a street improvement advocacy group.",
      "Earl Hagans, a city resident, criticized officials for the lack of answers.",

      "The Barrow County Sheriff's Office said school resource officers arrested the boy \u201cwithout incident\u201d Wednesday afternoon at the school in Winder, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) northeast of Atlanta. Deputies said the student was \u201ccooperative and compliant when encountered by law enforcement officers and there have been no reports of the student threatening anyone with the gun.\u201d",
      "The student, who wasn't named because of his age, was taken to a juvenile detention center in Gainesville. He's charged with two counts of possessing a weapon on school grounds, theft and being a minor in possession of a gun. Deputies didn't say what kind of gun was seized. Authorities said the student was arrested shortly after 2 p.m. at school, but they did not say when he arrived or release details of the circumstances of the arrest.",
      "The Barrow County school district canceled classes on Thursday at the high school with nearly 2,000 students, located about 45 miles (70 kilometers) northeast of downtown Atlanta.",

      "Colt Gray, who was 14 at the time, was charged as an adult after the September shooting and was indicted on 55 counts, including murder and 25 counts of aggravated assault at the high school. He has pleaded not guilty. His father, Colin Gray, was indicted on 29 counts, including two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of involuntary manslaughter, based on prosecutors' contention that Colin Gray let his son access guns and ammunition \u201cafter receiving sufficient warning\u201d that the boy would harm others. Colin Gray has also pleaded not guilty.",
      "The district told parents that students and staff should not report to school Thursday and that on-campus extracurricular activities were canceled. The district also canceled an open house to view new portable classrooms that were erected on campus to replace classrooms in the now closed-off hallway where the shooting took place",
      "Wednesday's arrest came after some students, teachers and parents attended a Barrow County school board meeting on Tuesday to demand that the district take additional visible measures to enhance security at Apalachee. They suggested even more school resource officers, mandating clear backpacks and buying a computerized camera system that the maker says can detect guns using artificial intelligence.",
      "Superintendent Dallas LeDuff said at the meeting that the district will present results from a security survey later this month and has met with school resource officers to discuss what security measures they recommend.",
      "\u201cIt has been a very intentional process,\u201d LeDuff said. \u201cI think I am proud of the work our staff has done.\u201d",

      "The purported leader of a Japan-based crime syndicate has pleaded guilty to charges alleging that he conspired to traffic uranium and plutonium from Myanmar in the belief that Iran would use it for nuclear weapons",
      "NEW YORK -- The purported leader of a Japan-based crime syndicate pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges alleging that he conspired to traffic uranium and plutonium from Myanmar in the belief that Iran would use it for nuclear weapons.",
      "Takeshi Ebisawa, 60, of Japan, entered the plea in Manhattan federal court to weapons and narcotics trafficking charges that carry a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison and the possibility of life behind bars. Sentencing was set for April 9.",
      "Prosecutors say Ebisawa didn\u2019t know he was communicating in 2021 and 2022 with a confidential source for the Drug Enforcement Administration along with the source\u2019s associate, who posed as an Iranian general. Ebisawa was arrested in April 2022 in Manhattan during a DEA sting.",
      "DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a release that the prosecution demonstrated the DEA's \u201cunparalleled ability to dismantle the world's most dangerous criminal networks.\u201d",
      "She said the investigation \u201cexposed the shocking depths of international organized crime from trafficking nuclear materials to fueling the narcotics trade and arming violent insurgents.\u201d",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim said Ebisawa admitted at his plea that he \u201cbrazenly trafficked nuclear material, including weapons-grade plutonium, out of Burma.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the same time, he worked to send massive quantities of heroin and methamphetamine to the United States in exchange for heavy-duty weaponry such as surface-to-air missiles to be used on battlefields in Burma,\" he added.",
      "Court papers said Ebisawa told the DEA's confidential source in 2020 that he had access to a large quantity of nuclear materials that he wanted to sell. To support his claim, he sent the source photographs depicting rocky substances with Geiger counters measuring radiation, claiming they contained thorium and uranium, the papers said.",
      "The nuclear material came from an unidentified leader of an \u201cethnic insurgent group\u201d in Myanmar who had been mining uranium in the country, prosecutors said. Ebisawa had proposed that the leader sell uranium through him in order to fund a weapons purchase from the general, court documents allege.",
      "Prosecutors said samples of the alleged nuclear materials were obtained and a U.S. federal lab found they contained uranium, thorium and plutonium, and that the \u201cthe isotope composition of the plutonium\u201d was weapons-grade, meaning enough of it would be suitable for use in a nuclear weapon.",
      "An email seeking comment was sent to Ebisawa\u2019s attorneys."

    "story": [
      "Some Los Angeles fire hydrants ran dry in recent days as demand soared for water to quell fast-moving wildfires",
      "The water system used to fight the Palisades fire in Los Angeles buckled under the demands of what turned out to be the most destructive fire in city history, with some hydrants running dry as they were overstressed without assistance from firefighting aircraft for hours early Wednesday.",
      "The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power was pumping from aqueducts and groundwater into the system, but demand was so high that it wasn\u2019t enough to refill three 1-million gallon tanks in hilly Pacific Palisades that help pressurize hydrants for the neighborhood. Many went dry as at least 1,000 buildings were engulfed in flames.",
      "The dry hydrants prompted a swirl of criticism on social media, including from President-elect Donald Trump, against Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s water management policies.",
      "But state and local officials and experts forcefully hit back, saying critics were connecting unrelated issues and spreading false information during a crisis. State water distribution choices were not behind the hydrant problems, they said, nor was a lack of overall supply in the region.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social media network, Trump connected it to criticism of the state\u2019s approach to balancing the distribution of water to farms and cities with the need to protect endangered species including the Delta smelt. Trump has sided with farmers over environmentalists in a long-running dispute over California\u2019s scarce water resources.",
      "Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said later at a news conference that 3 million gallons of water were available when the Palisades fire started but the demand was four times greater than \u201cwe\u2019ve ever seen in the system.\u201d",
      "Hydrants are designed for fighting fires at one or two houses at a time, not hundreds, Qui\u00f1ones said, and refilling the tanks also requires asking fire departments to pause firefighting efforts. Mayor Bass said 20% of hydrants went dry.",
      "\u201cPeople are literally fleeing. People have lost their lives. Kids lost their schools. Families completely torn asunder. Churches burned down. And this guy wanted to politicize it,\u201d Newsom said of Trump on CNN. He contrasted the former president's accusations with President Joe Biden standing by the devastated communities.",
      "Peter Gleick, senior fellow at the Pacific Institute, a nonprofit that focuses on global water sustainability, dismissed Trump's criticism as well.",
      "\u201cThose fights have been going on for a long time, and they have not affected in any way water supply for firefighting in southern California,\u201d Gleick said.",
      "About 40 percent of Los Angeles city water comes from state-controlled projects connected to northern California, where the Delta smelt live, and the state has limited the water it delivers this year. Yet the southern California reservoirs these canals help feed are at above-average levels for this time of year.",
      "Rick Caruso, a real estate developer and former Los Angeles Department of Water and Power commissioner who lost to Bass in the last mayoral race, said officials needed to answer for the system's failures.",
      "\u201cYou got thousands of homes destroyed, families destroyed, businesses destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you can figure out a way to get more water in the hydrants. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s room for excuses here.\u201d",
      "Los Angeles isn't the only city to see its public water system stressed by firefighting demand as human-caused climate change makes wildfires worse, experts say.",
      "Large urban fires can also melt or otherwise damage pipes, causing them to leak large amounts of water, draining pressure from the system, said Andrew Whelton, an engineering professor at Purdue University. Individual homes with water meters that have a remote shutoff can help utilities quickly stem such losses, Whelton said.",
      "In Hawaii the 2023 fire that ripped through the historic town of Lahaina and killed more than 100 people burned so quickly in a dense area that pipes burst, making it hard to maintain enough water pressure for firefighting efforts. In the 2021 Marshall Fire in Colorado, the city of Louisville\u2019s water department had workers manually open valves to let untreated water from the Colorado River and Boulder Creek into pipes to restore pressure. That helped firefighters but also led to water contamination.",
      "Greg Pierce, professor of urban environmental policy at the University of California who had a family member lose a house in one of the blazes, pushed back on Caruso\u2019s assertion that the loss of water pressure was a clear sign of mismanagement.",
      "Providing enough water could amount to a subsidy for very high-income areas, he said. \u201cI think the conversation has to be more about whether these areas are habitable.\u201d",
      "John Fisher, a retired battalion chief with San Diego Fire-Rescue, said California is among the best in the world at ensuring communities share resources and staffing to put out big fires.",
      "\u201cWe get it done. We pre-position resources, we staff up reserve engines,\u201d he said. \u201cYesterday, there (was) a lot more fire than there is firefighters. That will start to change as the wind dies out and additional firefighters arrive and we\u2019ll get the upper hand on it.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Department of Justice says a Vermont school district failed to adequately respond to serious and widespread harassment of Black and biracial students",
      "MORRISTOWN, Vt. -- A Vermont school district\u2019s inadequate response to serious and widespread harassment of Black and biracial students has led to a settlement agreement with the federal government, the U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday.",
      "The department\u2019s Civil Rights Division and the Vermont U.S. attorney\u2019s office began investigating the Elmore-Morristown Unified Union School District in December 2023 and reviewed records and complaints from the previous three school years. Investigators concluded that students, primarily at the middle school level, faced frequent slurs and racist imagery, including the use of the N-word and displays of confederate flags and Nazi symbols.",
      "\u201cRacial harassment makes students feel unsafe, deprives them of a supportive educational environment and violates the Constitution\u2019s most basic promise of equal protection,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to the district demonstrating to its students that racial bullying and harassment have no place in its schools.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen students returned from the pandemic, we saw a significant increase in behavior at the middle level, which was deeply concerning,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIn response, we have taken many intentional actions to address this behavior, which the DOJ recognized in its review.\u201d",
      "In a letter to parents and other community members Tuesday, Heraty said the district stands firmly against any acts of racism and responds immediately to reported incidents. In the current academic year, there have been no reported incidents of race-based harassment at the district\u2019s elementary school and a \u201cvery limited\u201d number at the middle and high schools, he said.",
      "The Justice Department said the district cooperated fully with the investigation and has already implemented some improvements, including adopting a central reporting system to track incidents. The district also agreed to revise anti-harassment policies and procedures, hold listening sessions with student groups and conduct formal training and education programs for students and staff."

    "summary": "Donald Trump's planned tariffs are expected to greatly impact international trade in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a \"stable yet underwhelming\" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us?",
      "Exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row.",
      "However, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues.",
      "\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.",
      "Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.",
      "However, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.",
      "Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "\"The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,\" says Mr Oganes.",
      "\"And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US.\"",
      "New tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.",
      "He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".",
      "That has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains.",
      "Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"",
      "The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.",
      "In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".",
      "Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.",
      "Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.",
      "Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.",
      "\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.",
      "Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.",
      "Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.",
      "However, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"",
      "One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.",
      "Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.",
      "However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU.",
      "\"Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,\" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. \"[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary.\"",
      "Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead.",
      "That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments.",
      "In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey.",
      "One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further.",
      "It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm.",
      "\"In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that.",
      "\"I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.\"",
      "Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation.",
      "A slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of \"dynamism\" from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that, he says.",
      "\"If the economy is doing well, businesses are growing, they start hiring. People see interesting opportunities, and you just start seeing people moving around\".",
      "One person starting a new role in 2025 is Donald Trump, and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the US economy to continue to thrive.",
      "Whilst much won't be revealed before he's back in the White House on 20 January,  \"everything points to continued US exceptionalism at the expense of the rest of the world,\" says JP Morgan's Mr Oganes.",
      "He's hopeful that inflation and interest rates can continue to come down around the world, but warns that \"a lot of it will depend on what are the policies that get deployed, particularly from the US.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 13:33:31 GMT",
    "summary": "The Chancellor may face the prospect of breaking her own Budget rules",
    "story": [
      "Economists have warned that the government is \"on course\" to miss its own Budget borrowing targets after interest rates for UK long-term borrowing rose to their highest levels this century.",
      "The official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), will start the process of updating its forecast next month to be presented to parliament in late March.",
      "The rising cost of borrowing means \"there is a significant chance that the OBR will judge that the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is on course to miss her main fiscal rule\", according to Ruth Gregory from Capital Economics.",
      "The yield on the 30-year gilt reached 5.35% on Wednesday, surpassing a previous high in August 1998.",
      "Meanwhile, the yield on a 10 year bond surged on Wednesday to its highest since October 2008, to reach 4.784%.",
      "The government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest.",
      "One of the ways it can borrow money is by selling financial products called bonds.",
      "A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",
      "Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.",
      "How does the government borrow money?",
      "Servicing the current national debt in the UK is forecast to take up 7% of total public spending, but that forecast was based on lower government borrowing rates.",
      "No.10 said there was \"no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability\" and \"meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable\" saying that only the OBR's forecast is an accurate predication of the government's room for manoeuvre.",
      "The clear indication from the government is that although they will not hold another Budget in March, any necessary adjustment would have to come in terms of some new spending cuts.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a \u00a32bn auction of 30 year UK government debt sold at an effective interest rate of 5.18%.",
      "The Debt Management Office, a part of Treasury, effectively paid the highest interest rates for these very long term loans that have been since 1998.",
      "Eyebrows raised over issuance",
      "The markets are raising their eyebrows about debts around the world, and in particular the level of issuance of bonds from countries such as the UK and the US, and additionally, the likelihood of sticky, above target inflation.",
      "Thirty-year debt such as this does not have a direct pass through into borrowing rates for households and companies. This type of debt is more of a specialist instrument used by pension funds. But today's auction shines a light on an uptick of borrowing rates over the past month.",
      "The more general gilt market move, has not yet significantly changed fixed mortgage rates for example. But if it continues, as is plausible, for the next month or so it will impact the OBR's new forecast.",
      "The rise in rates has affected the US and the UK more, and less so continental Europe. The tick-up in UK market rates after the Budget, initially faded by early December. But now British borrowing rates are moving up alongside US ones.",
      "Stagnant growth and sticky inflation have raised concerns about so-called \"stagflation\". Markets are starting to question the inflationary impacts of incoming President Donald Trump's trade and tax policies.",
      "So while this is not a crisis, it is a new reality. Markets are questioning if the UK really can sustain higher growth and restrained inflation. And those questions are now occurring against the backdrop of the Trump trade tumult affecting global markets for borrowing. It's a bumpy start to 2025."

      "The posters for Wahed Invest, seen between September and November on Transport for London (TfL) services last year, featured US dollar and euro banknotes on fire.",
      "The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 75 complaints that the ads were offensive.",
      "Wahed Invest said its intention was to \"spark thought and awareness\" and acknowledged the ASA's feedback on the use of international currency.",

      "Three of the posters showed Mr Menk holding an open briefcase filled with US dollar and euro banknotes on fire, with two of them stating \"Withdraw from Exploitation\" and \"Withdraw from Riba\".",
      "Wahed said the burning of banknotes within the adverts was designed to show money \"going up in flames\" when inflation grew faster than the rate of savings.",
      "Symbol of national identity",
      "Wahed describes itself as an investment platform allowing consumers who are predominantly Muslim to invest in a manner which aligns with their faith and values.",
      "It said it often used the term \"Riba\", an Arabic word meaning \"excess\" and commonly used to describe the prohibition of interest under Islamic law.",
      "Wahed told the ASA that it acknowledged that currencies were a symbol of national identity but believed the burning of banknotes was not offensive and was portrayed in popular culture, such as film and TV.",
      "The ASA said the adverts would have been seen by many people, including people from the United States and eurozone countries, who \"would have viewed their nation's currency as being culturally significant\".",
      "\"Although we acknowledged Wahed Invest's view that they had not directly criticised a specific group, and that depictions of burning banknotes were commonly encountered, we considered the burning of banknotes would have caused serious offence to some viewers,\" the regulator said.",
      "\"We therefore concluded that the ads were likely to cause serious offence.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Wahed Invest said: \"We understand that visuals like those included in our campaign can elicit strong reactions.",
      "\"While our intention was to spark thought and awareness, we recognise the importance of ensuring that messaging resonates positively with the diverse audiences that may consume them.",
      "\"We acknowledge and appreciate the ASA's feedback on the use of international currency.\"",
      "TfL, which had paused all campaigns from Wahed Invest pending the outcome of the investigation, said it would apply the regulator's findings \"when considering any future campaigns\".",

    "story": [
      "Meta is abandoning the use of independent fact checkers on Facebook and Instagram, replacing them with X-style \"community notes\" where commenting on the accuracy of posts is left to users.",
      "In a video posted alongside a blog post by the company on Tuesday, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said third-party moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".",
      "The move comes as Zuckerberg and other tech executives seek to improve relations with US President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office later this month.",

      "\"Zuckerberg's announcement is a blatant attempt to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration \u2013 with harmful implications\", said Ava Lee, from Global Witness, a campaign group which describes itself as seeking to hold big tech to account.",

      "\"It means we're going to catch less bad stuff, but we'll also reduce the number of innocent people's posts and accounts that we accidentally take down,\" he said.",
      "The approach is also at odds with recent regulation in both the UK and Europe, where big tech firms are being forced to take more responsibility for the content they carry or face steep penalties.",

      "'A radical swing'",

      "But with growth for the last three months of 2024 being only 0.4% higher than the previous year, it finishes a weak 12 months for retailers overall, and the BRC warned that 2025 would be \"challenging\" due to rising taxes and wage costs.",
      "Although many firms are yet to report on their performance over the Christmas period, the BRC said the new year would see retailers grapple with rising National Insurance Contributions, a higher National Living Wage, as well as new packaging levies.",

      "Budget supermarket Lidl said it had the most successful Christmas in its history, boosted by people buying festive food such as pigs in blankets and turkey.",
      "But the BRC's figures showed people spent less on other things - sales for non-food items over the year fell by 1.5%.",
      "Overall, the last three months of last year \"failed to give 2024 the send-off retailers were hoping for\", in a \"challenging year marked by weak consumer confidence and difficult economic conditions\", Ms Dickinson said.",

      "Schools say that means they will struggle to fund the government's proposed pay rise for teachers, as well as the support needed for children with special educational needs.",
      "The Department for Education (DfE) said it would work with schools and local authorities to provide a \"fair funding system that directs public money to where it is needed\".",
      "The IFS estimates that school funding will rise by 2.8% in the 2025-26 financial year. But Wednesday's report warns that costs are likely to rise by 3.6%, leaving schools facing tough choices.",

      "Additional funding to support pupils with Send often takes a long time to materialise, he says.",

      "In the past, this money would go to \"cherry-on-top\" activities like play equipment. But now, it has to fund basic curriculum resources like buying paper, Mr Hitchcock says.",
      "Staff costs take up 85% of the school's budget. Mr Hitchcock says pay rises are \"very important\" to recruit and retain staff, and to make sure it's a competitive profession.",

      "Bandleader and drummer Femi Koleoso has a room-filling smile and a zest for life that infuses his music.",
      "\"We're just trying to bring something positive and joyful to whoever will listen,\" he says. \"So anything that exposes us to more people is always gratefully received.\"",
      "Today, that means the honour of being named runner-up in the BBC's Sound Of 2025.",
      "The annual poll, which has been running since 2003, has tipped everyone from 50 Cent and Adele, to Raye and Dua Lipa for success.",
      "Ezra Collective's addition to the list comes relatively late in their career. They've already won the Mercury Prize, for their second album Where I'm Meant To Be, and last November, they became the first jazz act to sell out Wembley Arena.",
      "But to their minds, the band are still newcomers.",
      "Koleoso recalls the thrumming intensity of making his Wembley debut.",
      "\"Fifteen minutes before the gig, I made the horrific mistake of reading the wall backstage,\" he says.",
      "\"They'd put up the names of everyone who'd played there before us. So it was like, 'OK, Beyonc\u00e9 played here, and Jay-Z and Stormzy and Madonna\u2026 And now it's Ezra Collective's turn'.\"",
      "If they were intimidated, it didn't show. The quintet turn audience participation into an artform, venturing out into the crowd and making fans part of their ensemble, almost like a New Orleans parade.",
      "Reviews were ecstatic, calling the show a \"masterclass in musicianship\" that left \"every single person with a smile on their face.\"",
      "As a result, Ezra Collective's name will be added to the Wembley Wall \u2013 but Koleoso wants it to have a radically different effect.",

      "Community and musical kinship is Ezra Collective's foundation stone; one that can be traced back to the youth club Tomorrow's Warriors, where they first met in central London in 2012.",
      "The charity offers training to musicians who can't afford private tuition, with a special focus on \"those with a background from the African Diaspora and girls, who are often under-represented in the music industry\".",

      "When Koleoso first visited Tomorrow's Warriors with his brother TJ, they'd already formed a tight rhythm section in their church band. In fact, Femi had been playing drums since he was four.",
      "\"Maybe I'm slightly biased, but I think the drums are the best instrument, because you can see what's going on,\" he says.",
      "\"When I watch our horn section, I'm hearing thousands of notes, but I'm only seeing three valves. It doesn't quite make sense. But with the drums, you hit them and they make a sound.",
      "\"I wish everything was as simple as that.\"",
      "Tomorrow's Warriors introduced Koleoso to jazz, a genre he'd previously considered elite and inaccessible, and to his future bandmates James Mollison (sax), Ife Ogunjobi (trumpet) and Joe Armon-Jones (keyboards).",
      "Together, they ripped the genre rulebook to shreds, magpie-ing elements of Afrobeat, hip-hop, grime, reggae, Latin, R&B, highlife and jazz to create a sound that bulges with possibility.",
      "\"We're the shuffle generation,\" explains Koleoso. \"We listen to Beethoven and 50 Cent comes on straight after. That influences the way we approach music: We love jazz but at the same time I love salsa too, so why not try and get that in there?\"",
      "After playing their first gig in a Foyles bookshop, they released their debut EP, Chapter 7, in 2016, and a debut album, You Can't Steal My Joy in 2019.",
      "Then Covid hit.",
      "\"We were meant to do a world tour but shortly after we arrived in New Zealand, we were told get back to London because the world was collapsing,\" says Koleoso.",
      "Lockdown inspired their second album, but instead of introspection and gloom, it's an immensely energetic record, fuelled by the promise of post-pandemic reconnection.",
      "\"What we found was we had each other,\" says Koleoso. \"It felt like we were meant to be together, and we made as many tracks as we could that articulate that.\"",
      "When it won the Mercury Prize, the follow-up was already in the bag.",
      "Dance, No-One's Watching was recorded over three days (\"one was just setting up\") at Abbey Road Studios, with the band still slightly worse-for-wear after a weekend at the Notting Hill Carnival.",
      "The idea was to capture the excitement of their live show direct to tape \u2013 with an audience of family and friends to stop them obsessing over the technicalities of recording.",
      "\"What you're hearing is very, very real. We just played it and then had a listen back, and were like, 'Yeah, put it on a vinyl'.\"",
      "That's why the album features a short, aborted performance of Ajala, with Koleoso ordering his bandmates to play harder on the next take.",
      "\"A lot of people think that's a skit, but it was a very real moment,\" he says. \"I wanted the song to go off, but it didn't, so we stopped and tried again.",
      "\"Those things are precious, because they will never happen again.",
      "\"There's a lot of things in the world that don't feel real enough, but music shouldn't be one of them.\"",
      "In contrast to its predecessor, the album is immersed in the real world. Themed around a night out in London, it celebrates the sacred power of dancing and losing yourself in music with other people.",
      "There's even a song titled N29, after the night bus Koleso used to catch home from nights out in London.",
      "Anyone who's braved one of those 3am rides home will recognise the song's mixture of post-club euphoria, random conversations and the backdrop of potential violence.",
      "Koleoso says his first experience of that liminal reality came after his high school prom.",
      "\"Our school got one of those fancy little boats on the Thames and everyone paid their \u00a320, which, for a state school in Enfield, was an impressive night out,\" he recalls.",
      "\"This was at the height of grime and funky house, so I'm just having the best time in my life, dancing on this boat in a suit\u2026 then I missed the last tube home.\"",

      "Having adopted the drag name The Vivienne because of a love for wearing Vivienne Westwood clothing, her weekly outfits on the catwalk were second to none.",
      "On the show, she described her drag style as being \"like a Scouse wife who has come into money, she moved to LA and blew it all and then she's had to move back to Liverpool\".",

    "summary": "An outbreak of the flu-like virus in China is causing concern, but experts say a Covid-like pandemic is unlikely.",
    "story": [
      "A surge in cases of the flu-like human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China has raised fears of another Covid-style pandemic.",
      "Images of hospitals overrun with masked patients have circulated widely on social media, but health experts say HMPV is not like Covid, and point out it has been around for many years.",
      "They say China and other countries are simply experiencing the seasonal increase in HMPV typically seen in winter.",
      "What is HMPV, what are the symptoms, and how does it spread?",
      "First identified in the Netherlands in 2001, HMPV spreads through direct contact between people, or when someone touches a contaminated surface.",
      "The virus leads to a mild upper respiratory tract infection for most people.",
      "It is usually almost indistinguishable from flu.",
      "Symptoms for most people include a cough, a fever and blocked nose.",
      "The very young, including children under two, are most vulnerable to the virus.",
      "It also poses a greater risk to those with weakened immune systems, including the elderly and those with advanced cancer, according to Hsu Li Yang, an infectious diseases specialist in Singapore.",

      "\"Many will require hospital care, with a smaller proportion at risk of dying from the infection,\" Dr Hsu said.",
      "Why are HMPV cases rising in China?",
      "Like many respiratory infections, HMPV is most active during late winter and spring.",
      "This is because viruses survive better in the cold, and can pass more easily from one person to another as people spend more time indoors with closed windows.",
      "In northern China, the current HMPV spike coincides with low temperatures that are expected to last until March.",
      "Many other countries in the northern hemisphere - including the US - are also experiencing a growth in rates of HMPV, said Jacqueline Stephens, an epidemiologist at Flinders University in Australia.",
      "\"While this is concerning, the increased prevalence is likely the normal seasonal increase seen in winter,\" she said.",

      "It said Chinese authorities have confirmed that the health care system is not overwhelmed and there have been no emergency declarations or responses to date.",

      "The incidence of HMPV in the UK has risen steadily since October 2024.",
      "The UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA)  does not publish the number of cases recorded.",
      "However its latest data shows the percentage of people testing positive for the disease rose sharply in the third week of December and remained at that higher level the following week.",
      "But the UKHSA says this is completely in line with normal seasonal trends, and the level of the disease being seen in GP surgeries and hospitals is as expected.",
      "Is there any chance of another Covid-like pandemic?",
      "Fears of a Covid-style pandemic are overblown, experts say, noting that such events are typically caused by new viruses, which is not the case with HMPV.",
      "The disease is already globally present and has been around for decades. This means people across the world have \"some degree of existing immunity due to previous exposure\", Dr Hsu said.",
      "\"Almost every child will have at least one infection with HMPV by their fifth birthday and we can expect to go onto to have multiple reinfections throughout life,\" said Paul Hunter, a medical professor at University of East Anglia in England.",

      "She overhauled her diet, cutting out chocolate and sweets but allowing for anything with naturally occurring sugar, like fruit and honey.",
      "Sophie also made all her meals at home and tracked her protein and water consumption using an app.",
      "She found it useful to give herself small rewards like getting her nails done or buying a new book, but the hardest part was socialising for her, as this would revolve around eating out and drinking alcohol.",
      "To solve this, she explains: \"I was very vocal about what I was doing, so there was no pressure when I got there [to social events] but there was still real self-discipline to do it.\"",

      "\"I definitely think there are elements people can implement, committing to 45 minutes of daily movement, being conscious of drinking more water and reducing screen time, but you need to be aware of what's involved,\" Tana adds.",
      "Another aspect is motivation. \"There is so much pressure for people to transform their lives at this time of year,\" she says.",
      "She suggests finding a way to \"challenge yourself while also being kind\", so that you add fun and value to every day, without exercise and food feeling like a punishment.",
      "From a medical perspective, it is difficult to determine whether 75 Hard is beneficial.",
      "NHS GP Sam Whiteman points out that, because \"it has not been studied\" in a clinical setting, it cannot claim to change your life in any way.",

    "title": "Starmer's NHS waiting list plan - will it work?",
    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 13:29:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Lack of staff and money could make it difficult for government to achieve its aims.",
    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

    "summary": "The surge in mental health referrals among young people has prompted debate among experts about the cause - and the most effective solution",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article",
      "Listen to this article",
      "Jane Graham has been a school nurse for nearly 20 years \u2013 and during this time the nature of her work has completely changed. \"When I started, the majority of the support we provided was for physical health, like asthma, allergic reactions and injuries,\" she says. \"Now it's mental health.\"",
      "She has seen a surge in schoolchildren struggling. \"It really impacts pupils at secondary school, but some are as young as seven,\" she explains.",
      "\"We're seeing children with depression, anxiety and stress \u2013 and that's leading to panic attacks, self-harm and eating disorders. They're not making it to school or are so anxious they cannot attend classes.\"",
      "GPs, youth workers and social workers I have spoken to shared similar stories, with many pointing out that mental health cases in the young are rising in ever greater numbers.",
      "One in five children and young people between the ages of eight and 25 in England are now thought to have a mental health disorder, according to official figures. Unsurprisingly, the NHS is struggling to keep up.",
      "In 2024 Dame Rachel de Souza, the children's commissioner for England, described the situation as \"shocking\" and said the system was in \"crisis\".",
      "But it is not just a crisis that is placing demands on the health service. It's also depriving the economy of workers with rising numbers of young people being left unable to work.",
      "What's less clear is why this is happening now.",
      "Plenty of explanations have been offered by experts: the pandemic, the cost of living and the advent of social media have all placed additional pressures on the generation now starting out.",
      "But some experts in the field of mental health have raised another question: that is, is there really a mental health crisis or are young people simply not resilient enough?",
      "In other words, are they lacking the capacity to withstand or recover quickly from day-to-day difficulties that generations before them faced too?",
      "A polarising debate",
      "This question is a polarising one. The word resilience could be interpreted by some as disparaging, or even toxic, in a similar vein as the term \"snowflake generation\".",
      "But one of the country's leading experts in child and adolescent psychiatry, Prof Andrea Danese, from King\u2019s College London, believes that resilience needs to be taken seriously.",
      "While greater awareness of mental health \"has generally been a positive thing\", according to Prof Danese, who is general secretary for the European Society of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, he says that he is concerned that it may also have \"inadvertently contributed to over-pathologising distress in young people\".",
      "Distress should not automatically be seen as a sign of mental ill-health, he continues.",
      "\"Facing challenges and distress is normal and important in terms of individual growth,\" he says. \"That's how young people develop emotional resilience \u2013 they learn coping skills in the face of many small challenges and build self-confidence about their ability to cope. The narratives we build matter.\"",
      "Ms Graham, the school nurse, is also of the opinion that many children who she has seen struggling - particularly those with more low level mental health problems - would benefit from becoming more resilient.",
      "She believes that if they were equipped with better coping skills, young people would likely be better placed to deal with the challenges they may be facing before they develop into a full-blown crisis \u2013 and this in turn would help ease the pressure on services to focus on those who are at high risk of harm.",
      "\"We need to do much better at teaching resilience in schools and how to stay mentally healthy,\" she says. \"But the way we treat children, such as primary school sports days where everyone is declared a winner, doesn't help.\"",
      "Resilience in popular culture",
      "In popular culture, the concept of resilience was popularised in the 1970s, in the wake of research by psychologist Emmy Werner, who studied children in Hawaii from lower-income backgrounds.",
      "More recently it has been the subject of several bestselling books, including Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience and Finding Joy, co-authored by Sheryl Sandberg, who was previously chief operating officer at Meta.",
      "Research by academics carried out in Poland suggests that higher levels of resilience improve life satisfaction and act as a buffer against mental health problems among young people.",
      "Two studies involving young people aged between 13 and 18 found those with greater resilience were more able to develop their own coping strategies when dealing with stress, including seeking support and advice from others, and were less likely to dwell on negative emotions or turn to drugs, alcohol or smoking.",
      "However not everyone is in agreement on the issue of resilience - or the questions around the potential downsides of greater mental health awareness.",
      "Dr Shari McDaid, head of policy and evidence (Scotland and Northern Ireland) at the Mental Health Foundation, argues that any suggestion that increased awareness is to blame for rising rates of mental health problems is \"misleading\".",
      "She points out that for someone to qualify for treatment for mental ill-health, they must meet a clinical threshold and the support they receive must have been judged to be of benefit.",
      "Rather, greater awareness has led to better \"mental health literacy\", in her view, which in turn has given people the tools to recognise and manage day-to-day emotions.",
      "\"What we need to do is work harder at preventing young people's mental distress from escalating into disorder - and we can do this through a whole-of-society approach that creates mentally healthy communities, schools and workplaces, as well as by fostering young people's personal resilience,\" she says.",
      "\"The two approaches go hand in hand.\"",
      "From Covid to the great rewiring",
      "Dr McDaid argues that the current generation of children and young adults face a unique set of challenges, pointing out they were the toddlers and infants of the 2008 financial crisis and have also lived through the divides around Brexit as well as the Covid-19 pandemic during their formative years.",
      "\"We know adverse events are cumulative - the more you experience the more likely you are to struggle,\" she says.",
      "Social media also plays a part. While it has benefits, Dr McDaid points out that cyber-bullying and body image pressures, which can be exacerbated on social media, cause additional stress.",
      "\"There has always been unrealistic images\u2026 but social media has complicated things further,\" she adds.",
      "How have social media algorithms changed the way we interact?",
      "Can we change how our brains age? These scientists think it\u2019s possible",
      "How many of us will end up being diagnosed with ADHD?",
      "Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues that advents in the digital world have led to a \"great rewiring of childhood\", in which children are spending less time socialising in person and more time glued to their screens. In his book The Anxious Generation, he suggests that this affects self-esteem and personal connections, which are crucial to good mental health.",
      "But Prof Danese says that social media usage alone cannot \"wholly explain\" why mental health problems have become widespread.",
      "It is, he argues, more likely to \"amplify\" problems rather than cause them. \"The causes [of the rise in mental health problems] are complex and I'm not sure we fully understand them.\"",
      "And it is the cumulative effect of a great many challenges, rather than one in isolation, that creates a perfect storm.",
      "As one young person puts it: \"From social media platforms that make us more isolated and anxious, to underfunded mental health services that are on the brink of collapse and a global climate crisis that puts our future at risk - it's no wonder that young people are struggling to stay positive.\"",
      "'Like putting a plaster on a wound'",
      "Adele Zeynep Walton is 25 years old and has written extensively about the negative impact of the online era on her generation's mental health, including in her book, Logging Off: The Human Cost of Our Digital World.",
      "\"While individual resilience can be a great tool to protect us from the severity of the challenges we face and help us bounce back from the struggles of everyday life, to say it can fix the problems facing young people today is like putting a plaster on a gaping wound,\" she argues.",
      "Instead, she believes the answer lies in tackling the addictive and toxic nature of social media platforms and investing in community spaces - as well as listening to young people themselves.",
      "\"What young people need is the recognition that the world we live in today makes it difficult to thrive as a young person and a genuine effort from those in power to tackle those barriers to wellbeing at the root.\"",
      "Adam Jones, a policy and public affairs manager at mental health charity Young Minds, is also wary of the term resilience, which he argues can be used in a \"stigmatising\" way.",
      "But he does share concerns that the current approach is \"over-medicalised\".",
      "More than 600,000 young people aged 15 to 25 in England were prescribed anti-depressants in 2023-24, according to NHS England, and thousands more are believed to have been prescribed other drugs to treat conditions such as anxiety.",
      "\"Drug treatment can be useful for some, but clinical guidelines are clear that it should not be the first-line treatment for most,\" says Mr Jones.",
      "Hamza Dar, a 26-year-old wellness influencer from Manchester who shares mental health advice with his followers on TikTok and Instagram under the name Humz D, agrees there needs to be changes in the way support is provided. He suggests, among other things, that children in schools should be taught strategies like meditation from year one.",
      "Nonetheless, he argues, young people are already well aware of the importance of resilience.",
      "\"[It] has become a vital characteristic that every young person has had to embody just to navigate and survive in a world like this.\"",
      "The role of others: social resilience",
      "Prof Danese is quick to stress that he is not arguing young people do not need support. Instead, he suggests they perhaps just need a different sort of help to that which is currently on offer \u2013 alongside earlier identification of those at risk of developing the most serious mental health problems.",
      "For Prof Danese, the true meaning of resilience isn't what it may at first appear. Emotional resilience, he says, isn't just about the individual coping by themselves, but about the backing they receive from friends, family and community too, whether through community centres, sporting opportunities and social events.",
      "But some of these opportunities have been lost, he says, nodding to a withdrawal of funding in the past and the closure of some networks that can provide support to young people.",
      "Mr Jones agrees, arguing young people should be offered greater access to activities that connect them with their community and build friendships. He also says there needs to be non-clinical support for issues such as housing and employment as well as more personalised therapies.",
      "There are examples of projects offering this kind of joined-up help, often in partnerships between councils, charities and, sometimes, the NHS.",
      "Mr Jones points to The Nest in south London and the Young Person's Advisory Service in Merseyside as two schemes that take a flexible approach, offering a diverse range of support, including employment training, budget and benefits advice.",
      "The problem is that more generally, the current prevailing approach embedded across most of the NHS is not conducive to bringing networks together in this way.",
      "\"We need to rethink the mental health system for young people in its entirety,\" argues Mr Jones.",
      "So, perhaps the question at the heart of the mental health crisis is less about whether young people are resilient enough - but whether they can access sufficient support to become so.",

      "Over the last decade, six extreme right wing groups have been banned \u2013 or proscribed -  by the Home Office as terrorist organisations, the first being National Action in December 2016. The list also includes Atomwaffen Division, Feuerkrieg Division, Sonnenkrieg Division, The Base and The Terrorgram collective.",
      "But this action against Blood and Honour and its affiliates is led by the Treasury and seeks to limit the group by strictly limiting its financial capabilities.",
      "Therefore, Blood and Honour has not been proscribed but is the first extreme-right wing organisation to face an asset freeze under the Treasury's sanctions regime."

      "Social housing tenants creating \"mayhem and misery\" must be stopped, MPs have agreed.",
      "Reform UK MP Lee Anderson called for a crackdown on \"feral families\" with a \"three strikes and you're out\" policy if neighbours were affected by antisocial behaviour.",
      "In a surprise twist, Labour MP Steve Yemm labelled the plan \"too liberal and lenient\" and demanded a zero tolerance policy.",
      "Responding in the Westminster Hall debate, Labour housing minister Alex Norris admitted current eviction laws \"don't always work\" and said tougher action was being worked on by the government.",
      "Aim for no-fault eviction ban to be in place by summer",
      "'I had panic attacks after my eviction notice'",
      "'Anti-social behaviour makes me scared all the time'",
      "MPs debate issues they are concerned about in Westminster Hall, a room next to the House of Commons, but it does not lead to a change in the law.",
      "Anderson said he set up the debate on antisocial behaviour because it \"destroys and ruins lives\" and was blighting \"every constituency throughout our great country\".",
      "Claiming the threat of eviction could transform offenders into good tenants, the Ashfield MP said: \"We need a deterrent.... I believe in a 'three strikes and out' rule.\"",
      "Responding to questions about where evicted tenants would live, he said: \"I'm not bothered about where they go.",
      "\"I've got two options for these people - they can either behave themselves and become good tenants, good neighbours, and integrate.",
      "\"Or they could do what other people do, normal people - go and get a job, stop committing crime, save some money up, work hard, save a deposit... and then go and private rent somewhere.\"",
      "However, neighbouring MP for Mansfield in the East Midlands, Steve Yemm, said asking victims of antisocial behaviour to spend years collecting and providing evidence of three breaches was too much.",
      "The Labour MP said: \"I would argue that this proposition is somewhat too liberal and lenient and doesn't go far enough to address the issues.\"",
      "Intervening, Anderson responded he was \"astounded\" and asked Yemm to agree to a \"one-strike and you're out\" rule instead.",
      "Yemm answered \"that's exactly what I'm saying\", adding victims - the majority of them women - had to \"endure... many, many years of suffering under this type of abuse\" and too many were then told no action could be taken.",
      "\"This should be a zero tolerance policy,\" Yemm said, adding council powers should be bolstered so upstanding citizens could enjoy \"peace and security\" in their homes.",
      "Another Labour MP, Andrew Cooper, said the authorities also needed to stop dumping tenants \"grappling with addiction\" into social housing without adequate support and called for more preventative action.",
      "Liberal Democrat housing spokesman Gideon Amos said the best deterrent would be better funding for police and councils to use the powers they already have.",
      "He set out how existing powers already allowed for \"one strike\" eviction in the worst cases, so Anderson's plan would only \"make the law weaker and give comfort to the most antisocial culprits\".",
      "The MP for Taunton and Wellington, who is also a social housing landlord, added: \"Simply evicting tenants onto the streets won't reduce antisocial behaviour, it will move the antisocial behaviour from the house to the street where all the evidence suggest it will only get worse.\"",
      "Shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said social housing should be \"a privilege not a right\" and the public only wanted \"decent and hardworking people that have contributed to this country\" to be given social housing.",
      "The Conservative MP said: \"It's good to see across the House today we seem to be in violent agreement about the three strikes policy, which seems to be a maximum not a minimum.\"",
      "Housing minister Alex Norris called attention to the Labour government's Safer Streets focus on boosting police numbers to tackle antisocial behaviour and the new Respect Orders, which he said should be toughened up.",
      "He said: \"Crucially I think there is a significant gap at the moment for those who make persistent offences, that those penalties [should] grow and are serious ones.\"",
      "Norris said there was also ongoing work on the Renters' Rights Bill, with new powers for social landlords to seek evictions \"immediately in the most serious cases\" and for judges to take the offenders' engagement with efforts to support them into account.",
      "However, he also highlighted how a home could be \"a real foundation\" for families and said there should still be a focus on supporting those, particularly single mums, who were struggling."

      "The Competition and Markets Authority concluded in February 2024  \"private developers produce houses at a rate at which they can be sold without needing to reduce their prices\".",
      "A sharp decline in residential planning permissions in England in the year to June 2024 - hitting a new record low - was due to a collapse in applications from private builders, not a decline in the share of applications being approved by local authorities.",
      "This collapse in applications probably reflected the impact of still-high mortgage interest rates and high house prices relative to average incomes, undermining the ability of people to afford newly built houses.",
      "That's why some argue meeting the government's targets will also require a major increase in Whitehall grants to not-for-profit local housing associations, enabling them to build tens of thousands of new social and affordable homes, mainly to be rented out, in the coming years.",

      "The planning data for England is at local authority level. Applications decided by special authorities, such as those in charge of national parks, are not included.",

    "story": [
      "Economists have warned that the government is \"on course\" to miss its own Budget borrowing targets after interest rates for UK long-term borrowing rose to their highest levels this century.",
      "The official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), will start the process of updating its forecast next month to be presented to parliament in late March.",
      "The rising cost of borrowing means \"there is a significant chance that the OBR will judge that the Chancellor Rachel Reeves is on course to miss her main fiscal rule\", according to Ruth Gregory from Capital Economics.",
      "The yield on the 30-year gilt reached 5.35% on Wednesday, surpassing a previous high in August 1998.",
      "Meanwhile, the yield on a 10 year bond surged on Wednesday to its highest since October 2008, to reach 4.784%.",
      "The government generally spends more than it raises in tax. To fill this gap it borrows money, but that has to be paid back - with interest.",
      "One of the ways it can borrow money is by selling financial products called bonds.",
      "A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments.",
      "UK government bonds - known as \"gilts\" - are normally considered very safe, with little risk the money will not be repaid.",
      "Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.",
      "How does the government borrow money?",
      "Servicing the current national debt in the UK is forecast to take up 7% of total public spending, but that forecast was based on lower government borrowing rates.",
      "No.10 said there was \"no doubt about the government's commitment to economic stability\" and \"meeting our fiscal rules is non-negotiable\" saying that only the OBR's forecast is an accurate predication of the government's room for manoeuvre.",

      "Eyebrows raised over issuance",
      "The markets are raising their eyebrows about debts around the world, and in particular the level of issuance of bonds from countries such as the UK and the US, and additionally, the likelihood of sticky, above target inflation.",
      "Thirty-year debt such as this does not have a direct pass through into borrowing rates for households and companies. This type of debt is more of a specialist instrument used by pension funds. But today's auction shines a light on an uptick of borrowing rates over the past month.",
      "The more general gilt market move, has not yet significantly changed fixed mortgage rates for example. But if it continues, as is plausible, for the next month or so it will impact the OBR's new forecast.",

    "published": "Mon, 06 Jan 2025 13:29:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Lack of staff and money could make it difficult for government to achieve its aims.",
    "story": [
      "Tackling the NHS backlog is one of the government's key six missions - and now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer says he has the plan to end it.",
      "But what's remarkable from this new year waiting list announcement is just how few levers ministers seem to have to pull.",
      "Much of this plan is about building on work that is already under way in England \u2013 and there are reasons why these policies have only had limited impact so far.",
      "More surgical and diagnostic hubs are being promised in the community \u2013 this builds on a network that started being rolled out before the pandemic.",
      "They allow more care to be provided outside of hospitals and the government wants to see not just more of them but longer opening hours too. But, of course, the key limiting factor is having the staff available to deliver the treatment \u2013 something the British Medical Association is pointing out.",
      "Sir Keir also wants to make it easier for patients to exercise choice over where they go for treatment \u2013 the idea is that this allows them to shop around and go where waiting lists are shortest.",
      "This policy dates back even further as it was introduced by the Blair government and subsequently championed by the Tories when they were in power. Despite that only around a quarter of patients report being offered a choice. And even if this was to change, questions remain about how many patients will be prepared to travel to get treatment elsewhere.",
      "Another initiative, which has been pursued for more than two decades, is getting the independent sector to ease the burden on the NHS. The private sector says it has capacity to see 30% more NHS patients than it currently does.",
      "But this policy comes with costs \u2013 the private sector tends to only take on the most straightforward procedures, which can deprive NHS hospitals of vital income as well as doctors and nurses of vital training opportunities.",
      "Hitting 18-week target a key goal",
      "This is not to say that the backlog will not be reduced. It would be a surprise if it did not start to fall in the coming months \u2013 most forecasts have pinpointed this spring as the potential turning point.",
      "But the ultimate goal of getting the NHS back to hitting the 18-week target by the end of this parliament still remains a big ask.",
      "That would mean 92% of patients being seen within 18 weeks \u2013 something that has not been achieved since 2015. Currently fewer than 60% are.",
      "The Blair government made big strides in the early 2000s, but that was underpinned by significant increases in the NHS budget \u2013 between 6-7% a year on top of inflation.",
      "Increases on that scale seem very unlikely given the state of public finances \u2013 although we will have to wait until the spring for the spending review to find out what budget will be set aside for the NHS in the coming years.",
      "Another concern, being voiced by some, is that with so much emphasis placed on waiting lists there is a risk other areas may end up neglected as health chiefs focus so much of their attention on this.",
      "\"The 18-week target should not be taken as the sole measure of how the NHS is faring,\" says Sarah Woolnough, head of the King's Fund think tank. \"Equally important to people are how long they are waiting for a GP appointment or an ambulance, for mental health care and other services.\"",
      "In short, any progress that is made on the waiting list could easily get lost if the wheels come off elsewhere."

    "summary": "With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK seems to have momentum, but will it last?",
    "story": [
      "Find yourself in a marquee on a Saturday afternoon where there's a bar with wine and beer, gags being cracked, and speeches being made and you might think it's a wedding.",
      "But the marquee at Chelmsford City Racecourse on Saturday was packed with more than 1,000 people who had turned up to a Reform UK rally, where the best man's speech and jokes were provided by the MP Lee Anderson, the crowd sang 'Here We Go' as he took the stage and the star turn who arrived to his own thumping sound track was Nigel Farage.",
      "The crowd seemed to be having fun, even though it is plain some of those gathered there have been drawn in because they are deeply disgruntled with the status quo in the UK.",
      "One grandfather told me he felt \"emotionally angry even talking to you and keeping my composure\", citing illegal immigration and the grooming scandal as the reason for his unhappiness.",
      "A newly joined party member said he was there because Farage \"is a breath of fresh air\" and current politicians were failing to give younger generations a chance to get on.",
      "And a Reform councillor from Suffolk said people were cross about the idea of pylons going everywhere as the government plans more green energy. They might have listed different reasons. But that obvious unhappiness is what seems to be driving the rapid growth of Reform UK.",
      "As if by magic, when Farage was on stage the party's membership passed 170,000, and two hours later the party told me they had added another 1,000.",
      "With new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK does, at this moment, seem to have what they brag is the big momentum. Farage claims he's putting the party on the path to win the next election.",
      "The Reform leader has never been short on ambition \u2013 it goes far beyond his obvious desire to be a political celebrity, which he achieved long ago, and beyond the UK leaving the EU, in which his decades of agitating played a huge part.",
      "The mood in a packed room in Chelmsford made it clear Farage and his growing party reckon they can shake everything up.",
      "And he's not hanging around in 2025. He has made two big speeches over the past few days, is the first UK political leader of the year to appear on a public platform \u2013 and he'll be appearing on our Sunday programme this week.",
      "But how realistic is that ambition to win power \u2013 and when will we know whether Reform's growing support is here to stay?",
      "Tactics and controversy",
      "Since the election, Labour's sagging popularity and the Tories' doldrums have made space that Farage, and his four fellow Reform MPs, have stepped into. The party has used his tried and tested techniques, talking about issues in a way that other politicians just won't. He would say those politicians are too cautious or politically correct \u2013 they'd say they have a responsibility not to stir up tensions.",
      "I'll always remember intakes of breath around Westminster when he unveiled his poster depicting refugees on the continent and claiming immigration was at \"breaking point\" during the EU referendum in 2016. Some other Leave campaigners said it made them \"shudder\" and it was even reported to the police. But did it stir up a conversation about the EU that Farage wanted? It certainly did.",
      "Years later, now with a perch in Parliament, Mr Farage was met with howls of criticism when he questioned the police's assessment of what had gone on in the Southport attacks. His willingness to jump into controversy is part of the brand - and for his backers, part of the appeal.",
      "Trump and Musk",
      "Who'd know a thing or two about that? Enter Farage's two pals across the Atlantic \u2013 one of them, Donald Trump, will in two weeks again be the most powerful man in the Western world, and the other is a tech billionaire, Elon Musk.",
      "From the outside it's hard to tell how deep these friendships are \u2013 whether the Reform gang lurk on the fringes waiting to be invited for brief chats, or whether over time Musk and Trump will donate political fire power (or even cash through Musk's UK business).",
      "But without question, these unusual bromances give more oxygen to Reform UK, and for the leader of a small UK party to have a direct line to the White House and the richest man in the world is hard to ignore. Can you imagine Ed Davey hanging out with Jeff Bezos? Or John Swinney spending time with Mark Zuckerberg?",
      "Making headlines is not, of course, the same as getting people on side, and while these high-wattage friendships are a draw for some voters, they risk hurting Reform with others.",
      "Musk, who appears to have a fixation with the UK, on Friday accused PM Sir Keir Starmer of being complicit in the \"rape of Britain\" by not going after gangs grooming and abusing vulnerable young girls \u2013 it's hard to think of a more offensive charge, and Labour's Wes Streeting branded it \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\".",
      "Musk also suggested safeguarding minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\" after she rejected a request for the Home Office to order a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. Phillips had said the council should commission a local inquiry instead, as happened in Rotherham and Telford. In a further post on X on Saturday, Musk said \"what an evil human\" in response to a video showing a previous appearance by Phillips on Question Time.",
      "And in the last couple of days Musk has been tweeting support for right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, a man with criminal convictions who Nigel Farage tried incredibly hard to distance himself from. Farage described Musk as a \"hero\" for buying Twitter, but conceded he has \"a whole range of opinions, some of which I agree with very strongly, and others of which I am more reticent about\".",
      "Cash and growth",
      "So Farage has new friends and new energy \u2013 and what has also changed since the election is Reform's potentially bulging bank balance.",
      "Whether you like it or not, money matters in politics. It's needed to pay for a lot of the unglamorous but vital work, such as hiring political organisers, opening local branches, and managing Farage's burgeoning social media accounts. Since the recruitment of Nick Candy, a billionaire and former Conservative donor, as the party's new treasurer, Farage has an ally who can write big cheques to support all that \u2013 he has promised to give Reform a seven-figure sum.",
      "The latest recorded donation figures show donations of only \u00a370,000 for the third quarter of 2024, but that seems set to change. The party's website is advertising jobs, and Reform is putting on regular events and building its membership around the country, which it says is now bigger than the Conservatives' rank and file.",
      "Over the next week Farage is appearing in Leicester, Chelmsford, Esher, and Chester. The party is yet to make a huge amount of noise in the Commons with their tiny band of MPs, but their whole persona is to do politics in a new way, outside Parliament.",
      "As they grow, so too will the scrutiny they face.",
      "There is likely to be more checking back over what they branded their \"contract with the people\" in the general election. They promised to cut \u00a35 out of every \u00a3100 in government spending within a hundred days, end shortages of doctors and nurses over the same time and give tax breaks to anyone who wanted to pay to go private in the NHS. They promised a freeze on non-essential immigration, more police, big changes to education, massive changes to the benefit system, and cutting tax while increasing spending on defence.",
      "To some voters their plans might sound like an appealing pick and mix, but there are big questions over whether many of the plans are remotely workable.",
      "And it's not just their policies they need people to get behind \u2013 it's their personnel, too. In the general election, as we revealed, candidates who wanted to stand for the party had expressed offensive views Reform found hard to defend. As they seek to expand, have they come up with a cast of characters the general public could get behind?",
      "Success - a distant prospect?",
      "Voters attracted to Reform don't come from any one political tribe, but ask pollsters and they share a sentiment \u2013 they're pretty peeved with the UK in 2025.",
      "Luke Tryl from the research group More In Common says the party has prospered because of dissatisfaction with the Conservatives and disappointment with the early signs from Labour.",
      "He says their ratings have bumped up from around 15 to 20% thanks to people who previously would have said they liked Farage but were worried about him as PM, but are now saying, \"well we've tried the Tories they didn't work, Labour have taken away my mum's winter fuel allowance, so we may as well try Reform\".",
      "Their current polling suggests they could, theoretically, nab dozens of seats from Labour, although their actual backers are mainly former Conservative voters - and a general election is years away.",
      "And unlike the other main political parties the chance someone would vote Reform does not change that much on the age you are. Their average voter is a Gen X man \u2013 born between the mid-sixties and 1980. It's only among older pensioners that research suggests the level of support falls away. The pattern doesn't seem to follow the clich\u00e9 that parties on the right grab elderly traditional 'small c' conservatives.",
      "In other words, the environment is ripe for Farage to thrive. But as his own political career demonstrates very vividly, political fashions come and go.",
      "Labour hopes desperately that doing the hard yards will pay off, restore their popularity, and they will be able to improve the country in at least some of the ways they promised you back in July. The Conservatives fervently hope that before too long their new leader Badenoch can make some progress.",
      "In 2025, the public will decide whether the party continues its march - or mucks up the opportunity it has. There will be tests during important elections in Wales, and contests for local mayors and local councils in May.",
      "A senior government figure told me \"we shouldn't over think\" the threat from Reform. But not to think hard about the party could prove foolish indeed.",
      "Farage's dream of a general election victory is years away and politically distant too. But he hopes in 2025 to prove that by the end of this year, it's an ambition that will look less far-fetched.",

      "He is also keen to emphasise the importance of political debate being grounded in verifiable facts and that Musk is making claims that are \"blatantly untrue\" as one source put it.",
      "Sources point, for instance, to those defending the Prime Minister's record as DPP, including another former senior prosecutor who took to X - the social media platform Musk owns - to say Sir Keir oversaw a record number of child abuse convictions.",

      "The Conservatives, Reform and Elon Musk have each expressed varying degrees of outrage in recent days that the government has said no to a public inquiry into the scandal.",
      "But few expected this weekend's twist: that within hours of the Reform leader Nigel Farage describing Musk as a \"hero\" who \"makes us look cool,\" the X owner said Reform needed a new leader as Farage \"doesn't have what it takes\".",
      "\"It's not been the perfect day,\" said one Reform figure with a splash of understatement and a smile. \"We probably do look a bit silly.\"",
      "Farage's repeated statements distancing himself from the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley Lennon, who calls himself Tommy Robinson, appear to be at the heart of the spat.",

      "\"Nigel is not for sale,\" is how one senior party figure put it to me, saying this showed that the Reform leader was willing to stand up to anybody, including the richest man in the world.",
      "Another said that if Reform were to be treated as a serious political outfit - and remember, Nigel Farage has said he wants to win the next general election - that means robustly and consistently rejecting any association with Robinson, whatever the consequences.",
      "The one politician to attract some praise from Elon Musk, for now at least, is the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, for her calls for a public inquiry into child sexual abuse.",
      "Badenoch sees the scandal as a case study in what she sees as our broken politics.",
      "For Badenoch, 2025 will be a crucial year as she fights to rebuild her party and fights for attention \u2013 not easy, when Nigel Farage is around.",
      "She got yet another taste of that over Christmas in a very public row with him over party membership numbers: Badenoch suggested Reform's claim on Boxing Day to have overtaken the Tories' membership numbers were \"fake\" as their tally was automatically rising.",

    "title": "How Trump and Musk's interventions prompt fresh diplomatic challenge",
    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 19:17:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Politicians are navigating how to deal with the social media presence of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.",
    "story": [
      "In Donald Trump's first term, governments around the world braced for his morning social media posts. What policy would be reversed, what insult thrown? Four years on, diplomats are once more getting twitchy when the sun rises on America's east coast.",
      "Back then, they learned to take Trump - as the adage had it - \"seriously but not literally\". Despite many campaign promises, he did not take the US out of Nato or lock up Hilary Clinton. But can ministers stay so sanguine a second time around?",
      "Trump's latest morning salvo criticised the UK government's decision to increase taxes on oil and gas firms working in the North Sea, in part to help fund renewable energy.",
      "On his platform, Truth Social, Trump responded to a report about a US oil firm leaving the region, saying: \"The U.K. is making a very big mistake. Open up the North Sea. Get rid of Windmills!\"",
      "Was this merely a familiar defence of a US firm by Trump and a repetition of his pro-fossil fuel instincts? Or was it evidence of a greater willingness by the president-elect to intervene in an ally's own domestic policies?",
      "The main difference - four years on - is that Trump is no longer alone at the keyboard; his increasingly powerful fellow traveller, Elon Musk, is even more prolific, using his own platform, X, to attack the British government across the board. He has criticised its handling of last summer's riots, the running of the economy and now especially its attitude towards child abuse scandals.",
      "Musk has issued a torrent of tweets attacking Sir Keir Starmer personally, accusing the prime minister of not doing enough to prosecute child grooming gangs while he was the director of public prosecutions.",
      "British politicians cannot stem these posts from across the Atlantic. But they can control their reaction. During Trump's first term, governments - and news desks - learned to pause and take a moment before responding to - or reporting - the latest electronic missives from the White House.",
      "Thus far the Conservatives have chosen to engage with and echo Musk's agenda. The party leader, Kemi Badenoch, said a full national inquiry into organised grooming gangs was \"long overdue\".",
      "But the Conservatives balked at Musk's apparent support for the jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson.",
      "Musk has shared several posts on X calling for the release of Yaxley-Lennon, who was jailed in October after admitting contempt of court by repeating false claims against a Syrian refugee.",
      "Alicia Kearns, the Conservative shadow safeguarding minister, said it was \"frankly dangerous\" of Musk to be \"lionising people like Tommy Robinson\".",
      "As for Labour, it seems keen to avoid picking a fight with one of the world's richest men who could one day fund a rival political party. Nigel Farage's Reform Party has said Musk is among \"a number of billionaires\" interested in donating money for their campaigns.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said Musk's comments about child grooming scandals were \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\" but asked the billionaire to work with the UK government to tackle online child abuse.",
      "UK politicians are not alone in being the target of Musk's increasingly eccentric interventions. He has described Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany as a \"fool\" and the country's head of state, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, as \"an anti-democratic tyrant\". He has also called Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada \"an insufferable tool\" who \"won't be in power for much longer\".",
      "Monitoring closely",
      "So the challenge once again for politicians in Britain and around the world is to work out which, if any, of these social media outbursts and interventions merit a response.",
      "In Whitehall, there is some hope the arrival of Lord Mandelson as the new British ambassador might help stem the flow of personal vituperation across the Atlantic.",
      "There is also weight being placed on Trump's affection for the UK and the Royal Family; he had a good meeting with the Prince of Wales in Paris in December after the opening of Notre Dame.",
      "Other officials are even musing that the relationship between Trump and Musk might prove too combustible in office.",
      "But for now officials are monitoring their timelines closely. US social media diplomacy is back and some of it is heading our way.",

      "What is probably the world's oldest ice, dating back 1.2m years ago, has been dug out from deep within Antarctica.",

      "The European scientists worked over four Antarctic summers, racing against seven nations to be first to reach the rock under the frozen continent.",
      "Their work could help unravel one of the major mysteries in our planet's climate history - what happened 900,000-1.2 million years ago when glacial cycles were disrupted and some researchers say our ancestors came close to extinction.",
      "\"It's an amazing achievement,\" says Prof Carlo Barbante at Ca' Foscari University of Venice who co-ordinated the research.",
      "\"You have in your hands a piece of ice that is a million years old. Sometimes you see ash layers coming from volcanic eruptions. You see the tiny bubbles inside, some bubbles of air that our ancestors breathed a million years ago,\" he says.",
      "The team was led by the Italian Institute of Polar Sciences and included 10 European nations.",
      "It had to transport the drilling equipment, laboratories and camp 40km by snow mobiles from the nearest research base.",
      "The drilling site, called Little Dome C, is on the Antarctic plateau on the east of the continent, at almost 3000m elevation.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "Ice cores are a vital to scientists' understanding of how our climate is changing.",
      "They trap bubbles of air and particles that reveal levels of greenhouse gas emissions and temperature variation that help scientists plot how climatic conditions have altered over time.",
      "Data from other ice cores, including one called Epica, helped scientists conclude that the current rise in temperature linked to greenhouse gas emissions is caused by humans burning fossil fuels.",
      "But scientists wanted to go further back in time.",
      "Now with this project Beyond Epica: Oldest Ice they have gained potentially another 400,000 years of history.",
      "\"There is a lot of the past in our future. We look at the past to understand better how the climate works and how can we project it into the future,\" says Prof Barbante.",
      "The team had a \"nail-biting last few days\" as they were able to drill even deeper than anticipated from radar data, says Dr Robert Mulvaney, an ice core scientist at British Antarctic Survey.",
      "The core was slowly pulled from the ice sheet using a drill machinery and scientists carefully cleaned the ice using cloths.",
      "It is now being cut into one metre pieces for transportation at -50C from Antarctica by boat.",
      "The pieces will eventually reach the freezers of numerous European institutions, including the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, where scientists will begin their analysis.",
      "Experts want to understand what happened in a period 900,000 to 1.2 million years ago called the Mid-Pleistocene Transition.",
      "At this time, the length of the cycle between cold glacial and warm interglacials switched from being 41,000 years to 100,000 years. But scientists have never understood why.",
      "This is the same period when, according to some theories, the ancestors of present-day humans almost died out, perhaps dropping to around just 1000 individuals.",
      "Scientists do not know if there is a link between this near-extinction and the climate, explains Prof Barbante, but it demonstrates it is an unusual period that it is important to better understand.",
      "\"What they will find is anybody's guess but it will undoubtedly enlarge our window on our planet's past,\"  Professor Joeri Rogelj from Imperial College in London, who was not involved in the project, told BBC News.",

      "Bumblebees have been found to be starting nests in the depths of winter due to climate change, say conservationists.",
      "The charity Buglife said active worker bumblebees, which do most of the work in a nest, were spotted in Aberdeen during mild weather over the Christmas break.",
      "It said a previous survey had recorded bumblebees and honeybees between Christmas and New Year at locations across the UK, including the Highlands.",

      "\"This year one of my colleagues based in Aberdeen spotted active worker bumblebees over the Christmas break.",
      "\"The fact that there are active workers means not only have the queens awakened from hibernation but they have gone to the extent of starting new nests.\"",

    "summary": "Wind provided more electricity than ever last year across England, Wales and Scotland.",
    "story": [
      "Wind provided more electricity than ever last year as the UK moved further away from planet-warming fossil fuels to power the nation, new data shows.",
      "Wind generated nearly 83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), up from nearly 79TWh in 2023, show figures from the National Energy System Operator (Neso), which coordinates electricity distribution.",
      "Electricity generation from major fossil fuel power stations fell to just over a quarter of the total last year as other renewable sources, such as solar, also rose, along with electricity imports.",
      "The government wants less than 5% of electricity to come from polluting fossil fuels by 2030.",
      "Neso - the government's independent system planner and operator for the energy transition - has previously described the government's 'Clean Power 2030 Action Plan' as \"achievable\" but \"at the limit of what is feasible\".",
      "The government considers clean electricity to include renewables, such as wind, solar, hydropower and bioenergy, as well as nuclear power.",
      "Together, these sources generated around 56% of Great Britain's electricity in 2024 - a new high, according to preliminary Neso data that will be confirmed this week.",
      "Major fossil fuel generation (mainly gas) fell to 26%, while a further 16% came from imported electricity.",
      "Neso data does not cover Northern Ireland, which has its own electricity transmission system operator, SONI.",
      "The figures only include fossil fuel and biomass generation from major power stations connected to the main transmission network. For these sources, Neso does not include smaller-scale operators that feed in electricity at a local level, although typically these contribute a relatively small fraction of fossil fuel power.",
      "Will Keir Starmer be able to meet his new pledges?",
      "UK to finish with coal power after 142 years",
      "What does net zero mean?",
      "As a result, government figures for 2024 due in March, which will take into account all power sources, may differ slightly from Neso's data. But the direction of travel is clear.",
      "Back in 2014, wind and solar accounted for around 10% of Great Britain's electricity. That has now risen to about a third, according to Neso's figures.",
      "Over the same period, fossil fuel generation has fallen by more than half.",
      "That is mainly thanks to a sharp fall in coal generation - the dirtiest fossil fuel - with the UK's final coal power station closing in 2024. Gas generation has also begun to decline.",
      "This has helped to significantly clean up Britain's power generation.",
      "In 2024, each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated 124g of planet-warming carbon dioxide on average - a new low, and down from 419g/kWh in 2014, according to Neso.",
      "But gas remains a crucial part of the UK's electricity mix, helping to maintain power supply when output from weather-dependent wind and solar sources drops.",
      "Britain's wind turbines can generate huge amounts of electricity when weather conditions are right, as shown by the darkest blue in the chart below.",
      "On around 10 days in December alone, more than 50% of Great Britain's electricity generation came from wind.",
      "However, there are of course less windy periods when electricity generation from wind drops. In the longer term, these gaps could be filled using emerging green technologies, such as batteries, to store energy during windier times.",
      "There could also be extra incentives for people to use electricity during windy periods, for example by offering cheaper prices.",
      "But for now, gas power stations, a ready source of on-demand energy, need to be fired up to fill the gaps. For three consecutive days between 11-13 December, for example, more than 60% of electricity generation came from gas as wind output dropped.",
      "In its plan for meeting the 2030 clean energy target published last month, the government committed to keeping a reserve capacity of gas power stations for this purpose.",
      "Last month Claire Coutinho, Conservative shadow secretary of state for energy security, said Labour's \"rush\" to decarbonise the electricity system by 2030 would push up electricity prices and cause more hardship for people across Britain.",

    "story": [
      "With his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap.",
      "Just short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago.",
      "\"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal.",
      "At the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age.",
      "\"The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago.\"",
      "The decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food.",
      "Wild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number.",
      "By 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity.",
      "It took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve.",
      "Here they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold \u2013 to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction.",
      "Serra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept.",
      "Sometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need.",
      "\"When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,\" says Serra. \"We're training them not to get close to people in the wild.\"",
      "That's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. \"A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat.\"",
      "So the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre.",
      "Then, when the time comes, they are released into the wild.",
      "Genetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain.",
      "Pedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years.",
      "\"As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare.\"",
      "The breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too.",
      "As lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first.",
      "Where the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many.",
      "\"This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed.\"",
      "He recounts the story of L\u00edtio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal.",
      "For six months L\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him.",
      "He eventually made his way to Do\u00f1ana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally.",
      "As L\u00edtio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve.",
      "Within days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Do\u00f1ana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain.",
      "For a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve.",
      "When he was released for a third time, L\u00edtio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again.",
      "\"He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,\" says Sarmento.",
      "Three decades after Spain decided to save the lynx, the species is no longer endangered, and Sarmento hopes it'll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035.",
      "For that to happen, the numbers need to reach 5,000-6,000 in the wild.",
      "\"I saw the species disappearing. It's surreal that we're in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily,\" says Sarmento.",
      "The reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work. Last year 80% of lynx deaths took place on the roads.",
      "For now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.",

    "story": [
      "It's dawn on Darwin Harbour and government ranger Kelly Ewin - whose job is to catch and remove crocodiles - is balancing precariously on a floating trap.",
      "Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent \u2013 that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap.",
      "\"You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,\" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile.",
      "We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world.",
      "The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands.",
      "And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.",
      "Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago.",
      "After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000.",
      "But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast.",
      "They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened.",
      "The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.",
      "\"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb.",
      "\"And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem.\"",
      "Living with predators",
      "The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant.",
      "There also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia.",
      "While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive.",
      "Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen.",

      "The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers.",
      "The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour.",
      "\"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,\" says Ewin, who's been doing his \"dream job\" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman.",
      "\"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.\"",
      "Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education.",
      "The NT government goes into schools with its programme \"Be Crocwise\" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.",
      "It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.",
      "\"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?\" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.",
      "\"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.\"",
      "In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species.",
      "Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.",
      "This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.",
      "Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people.",
      "In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT.",
      "Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.",
      "It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT.",
      "Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.",
      "Big business",
      "The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT \u2013 for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.",
      "Visitors can head to the Adelaide River to watch \"croc jumping\" -  which involves salties being fed bits of meat on the end of a stick if they can leap out of the water for their audience.",

      "\"It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,\" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region.",
      "Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver.",
      "It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT.",
      "Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; \u00a3398,000) - have all invested in the industry.",
      "\"The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,\" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands.",
      "His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres.",
      "Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry.",
      "One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry.",
      "For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods.",
      "\"My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,\" the  Balngarra man says.",
      "\"Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles.\"",
      "But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation.",
      "The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity.",
      "Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity.",
      "Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved.",
      "But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined.",

      "Heavy snow blends into white thick clouds in Skellefte\u00e5, a riverside city in northern Sweden that is home to 78,000 residents.",
      "It's also the location of what was supposed to become Europe's biggest and greenest electric battery factory, powered by the region's abundance of renewable energy.",
      "Swedish start-up Northvolt opened its flagship production plant here in 2022, after signing multi-billion euro contracts with carmakers including BMV, Volkswagen and Nordic truck manufacturer Scania.",
      "But it ran into major financial troubles last year, reporting debts of $5.8bn (\u00a34.6bn) in November, and filing for bankruptcy in the US, where it had been hoping to expand its operations.",
      "Since September it's laid off around a quarter of its global workforce including more than 1,000 staff in Skellefte\u00e5.",
      "\"A lot of people have moved out already,\" says 43-year-old Ghanaian Justice Dey-Seshie, who relocated to Skellefte\u00e5 for a job at Northvolt, after previously studying and working in southern Sweden.",
      "\"I need to secure a job in order to extend my work permit. Otherwise, I have to exit the country, sadly.\"",
      "Many researchers and journalists tracking Northvolt's downfall share the view that it was at least partly caused by a global dip in demand for electric vehicles (EVs).",
      "In September Volvo abandoned its target to only produce EVs by 2030, arguing that \"customers and markets are moving at different speeds\". Meanwhile China, the market leader in electric batteries, has been able to undercut Northvolt's prices.",
      "Missing production targets (a key factor in BMW pulling out of a \u20ac2bn deal in June), expanding too quickly, and the company's leadership have also been widely cited as factors fuelling the crisis.",
      "\"To build batteries is a very complex process. It takes a lot of capital, it takes time, and they obviously just didn't have the right personnel running the company,\" argues Andreas Cervenka, a business author and economics commentator for Swedish daily Aftonbladet.",
      "At Ume\u00e5 university, Madeleine Eriksson, a geographer researching the impact of so-called \"green industries\" says Northvolt presented a \"save the world mentality\" that impressed investors, media and local politicians.",
      "But this \"now-or-never\" approach, she argues, glossed over the fact it was a risk-taking start-up that \"never finished attracting investment\".",
      "Northvolt did not respond to multiple requests from the BBC to respond to comments about its downfall or future plans.",

      "The region is a hub for biotech and renewable energy. Alongside Northvolt, high profile companies include Stegra (formerly called H2 Green Steel) and Hybrit, which are both developing fossil-free steel using hydrogen.",
      "But Mr Cervenka, the economics commentator, argues Northvolt's downfall has damaged Sweden's \"very good brand\" when it comes to green technologies.",
      "\"There was a huge opportunity to build this champion, and to build this Swedish icon, but I think investors that lost money are going to be hesitant to invest again in a similar project in the north of Sweden,\" he says.",
      "Some local businesses say the publicity around Northvolt's crisis is already having a negative impact.",
      "\"I feel it myself when I travel now \u2013 even to the southern parts of Sweden \u2013 and abroad, that people really ask me questions,\" says Joakim Nordin, CEO of Skellefte\u00e5 Kraft, a major hydropower and wind energy provider, which was an early investor in Northvolt.",

      "\"I think it would be presumptuous to say that, okay, now we are doomed here in the Nordics because one company has failed,\" she argues.",
      "Cleantech for Nordics' research suggests there were more than 200 investments in clean tech projects in Sweden in 2023.",
      "Another study by Dealroom, which gathers data on start-ups indicates 74% of all venture capital funding to Swedish start-ups went to so-called impact companies which prioritise environmental or social sustainability, compared to a European average of just 35%.",
      "\"Sweden is still punching above its weight in this sector. And I think we could expect it to continue to do so moving forward as well,\" predicts Anderson.",
      "There are growing calls for increased state support to help Sweden maintain its position. The Swedish government refused to bail out Northvolt, suggesting all startups \u2013 sustainable or not \u2013 should be subject to market forces rather than bailed out by taxpayers. But as other parts of the world ramp up battery production and other carbon-cutting industries, the decision has faced a backlash.",
      "\"The US and China have massive support packages for green industry, and they definitely are catching up and overtaking in some sectors. And so that is definitely a threat to be reckoned with,\" argues Andersson.",
      "Just 3% of global battery cell production\u202fcurrently takes place in Europe - according to research for international consultancy firm McKinsey - with Asian firms leading the market.",
      "Sweden's minister for Energy, Business and Industry Ebba Busch argues more EU support rather than funding from individual governments is the answer.",
      "Last month she told Swedish television the situation at Northvolt was \"not a Swedish crisis\", rather a reflection of a Europe-wide challenge when it comes to competitiveness in the electric battery sector.",
      "But while the government insists it wants Sweden to play a key role in Europe's battery industry, and the wider green transition, it has been accused of sending mixed messages. The right-wing coalition, which came into power in 2022 has cut taxes on petrol and diesel, and abolished subsidies for EVs.",
      "\"This is a very politically sensitive area,\" says journalist Cervenka. \"The Swedish government is being actually criticised internationally for not fulfilling its climate obligations. And that is a stark contrast to the image of Sweden as a pioneer.\"",
      "The BBC approached Busch's media team, but was not granted an interview.",
      "Back in Skellefte\u00e5, where it has been dark since just after lunch, Joachim Nordin is preparing to commute home in the snow.",
      "He says there's a strong industrial will for Sweden to remain a green tech role model, despite policymakers being \"not as ambitious\" as previous administrations.",
      "The criteria that enticed Northvolt to establish its first factory in Skellefte\u00e5 will also attract other big global players to the region, according to the energy company CEO.",
      "\"It's 100% almost renewable energy up here\u2026 and that's that's pretty unique if you compare it to the rest of Europe. But on top of that we are among the cheapest places in the world for the electricity prices. So if you combine those two things, it's a huge opportunity.\"",
      "Skellefe\u00e5 Kraft recently announced a collaboration with Dutch fuel company Sky NRG. Their ambition is to open a large factory by 2030, making fossil-free plane fuel (produced using hydrogen combined with carbon dioxide captured from biogenic sources).",
      "\"The publicity around Northvolt is not helping now, of course. But I hope that that's just something that will be remembered as a little bump in the road, when we look back at this 10 years from now,\" says Mr Nordin.",

    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95m (\u00a377m) to settle a court case alleging some of its devices were listening to people without their permission.",
      "The tech giant was accused of eavesdropping on its customers through its virtual assistant Siri.",
      "The claimants also allege voice recordings were shared with advertisers.",
      "Apple has denied selling Siri data and said it settled to avoid further litigation.",
      "\"Siri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose,\" an Apple spokesperson told BBC News, adding that data collected by the tool is only used to improve it.",
      "\"Apple settled this case to avoid additional litigation so we can move forward from concerns about third-party grading that we already addressed in 2019,\" they added.",
      "They said that its digital assistant technology had been \"engineered to protect user privacy from the beginning\" and it has continually sought to enhance its privacy.",
      "In the preliminary settlement, the tech firm denies any wrongdoing, as well as claims that it \"recorded, disclosed to third parties, or failed to delete, conversations recorded as the result of a Siri activation\" without consent.",
      "Apple's lawyers also say they will confirm they have \"permanently deleted individual Siri audio recordings collected by Apple prior to October 2019\".",
      "But the claimants say the tech firm recorded people who activated the virtual assistant unintentionally - without using the phrase \"Hey, Siri\" to wake it.",
      "They say advertisers who received the recordings could then look for keywords in them to better target ads.",
      "The lead plaintiff Fumiko Lopez claims she and her daughter were both recorded without their consent.",
      "They allege they were served targeted ads after talking about products including Air Jordans.",
      "Class action",
      "Apple has proposed a decision date of 14 February in the court in Northern California.",
      "Class action lawsuits work by a small number of people going to court on behalf of a larger group.",
      "If they are successful, the money won is paid out across all claimants.",
      "According to the court documents, each claimant - who has to be based in the US -could be paid up to $20 per Siri-enabled device they owned between 2014 and 2019.",
      "In this case, the lawyers could take 30% of the fee plus expenses - which comes to just under $30m.",
      "By settling, Apple not only denies wrongdoing, but it also avoids the risk of facing a court case which could potentially mean a much larger pay out.",
      "The California company made $94.9bn in revenue in the three months up to 28 September 2024.",
      "Apple has been involved in a number of class action lawsuits in recent years.",
      "In January 2024, it started paying out in a $500m lawsuit which claimed it deliberately slowed down iPhones in the US.",
      "In March, it agreed to pay $490m in a class action led by Norfolk County Council in the UK.",
      "And in November, consumer group Which? started a class action against Apple, accusing it of ripping off customers through its iCloud service.",
      "The same law firm is suing Google in a similar class action, accusing it of listening to customers using Google devices.",
      "That lawsuit is currently going through the same court in Northern California.",

      "The four-day promotion, which starts this Saturday (4 January), includes discounts of as much as 500 yuan ($68.50, \u00a355.30) on some of the US technology giant's newest handsets.",
      "Chinese phone maker Huawei has also cut prices of its high-end mobile devices by as much as 20%.",
      "The discounts come as consumers in China remain hesitant about spending because of the country's economic challenges.",
      "The offer covers Apple's top models as well as older handsets and some other devices.",
      "The biggest discount of 500 yuan will apply to Apple's flagship iPhone 16 Pro, which has a starting price of 7,999 yuan, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max which currently costs 9,999 yuan.",
      "The firm held a similar promotion in China last year ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. This year, the festival starts at the end of January.",
      "Changing behaviour",
      "\"Apple's strategy has changed to adapt to the change in Chinese consumers' shopping behaviour,\" said Will Wong, a senior research manager for market intelligence firm International Data Corporation (IDC).",
      "\"The value-seeking trend has made price discounts more attractive to consumers. Apple may fall behind other competitors if it doesn't adopt such a pricing strategy.\"",
      "The discounts being offered by Apple and Huawei reflect a wider trend in China.",

      "The plan was expanded on Friday to include mobile phones, tablets, smartwatches and fitness bands.",
      "Local competition",
      "Against this backdrop, Apple's share of the Chinese market has come under increasing pressure from local rivals, such as Vivo and Xiaomi.",
      "The US firm re-entered China's top five smartphone makers in the third quarter of 2024 after briefly dropping off the list.",
      "According to IDC's latest research, Vivo was China's best-selling smartphone maker in the period as its sales jumped by more than 20%.",
      "During the same period, Apple saw sales dip by 0.3%. Huawei's jumped by more than 40%.",
      "\"We've seen market competition increase with almost everyone launching a flagship last quarter,\" said Ivan Lam, a senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.",
      "Huawei has seen demand for its products surge after its return to the premium smartphone market in August last year.",
      "The Shenzhen-based firm has since launched several new devices powered by advanced technology despite the company facing US restrictions."

      "He added that he would spend \"a few months handing over the reins\" and representing Facebook at international gatherings before moving on to \"new adventures\".",
      "Sir Nick's resignation comes just weeks before Donald Trump returns to the White House.",
      "The president-elect has repeatedly accused Meta and other platforms of censorship and silencing conservative speech.",

      "More recently, Trump threatened to imprison Mr Zuckerberg if he interfered in the 2024 election, and even called Facebook an \"enemy of the people\" in March.",
      "However tensions appear to be thawing between the two, with the pair dining at Trump's Florida estate in Mar-a-Lago since the US election.",
      "Mr Zuckerberg also congratulated him on his victory and donated $1m (\u00a3786,000) to an inauguration fund.",

      "He oversaw the creation of the Oversight Board, an independent body set up to oversee Meta's content moderation decisions.",
      "He said recently, however, that the firm's actions had resulted in some people being \"unfairly penalised\" on its platforms too often.",

      "The former Liberal Democrat leader moved to Silicon Valley initially but returned to London in 2022.",
      "He said he was moving on to \"new adventures\" with \"immense gratitude and pride\" at what he had been part of.",
      "\"My time at the company coincided with a significant resetting of the relationship between 'big tech' and the societal pressures manifested in new laws, institutions and norms affecting the sector,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's planned tariffs are expected to greatly impact international trade in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a \"stable yet underwhelming\" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us?",
      "Exactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row.",
      "However, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues.",
      "\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.",
      "In recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.",
      "Despite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.",
      "However, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.",
      "Since Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.",
      "\"The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,\" says Mr Oganes.",
      "\"And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US.\"",
      "New tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.",
      "He cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".",
      "That has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains.",
      "Mr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"",
      "The tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
      "Even though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.",
      "In his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".",
      "Exports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.",
      "Those efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.",
      "Beijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.",
      "\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.",
      "Those domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.",
      "Tensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.",
      "However, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"",
      "One industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.",
      "Beijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.",
      "However, it's the prospect of Donald Trump imposing tariffs that is concerning the EU.",
      "\"Restrictions on trade, protectionist measures, are not conducive to growth, and ultimately have an impact on inflation that is largely uncertain,\" the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, said last month. \"[But] in the short term, it's probably net inflationary.\"",
      "Germany and France are the traditional engines of Europe's economic growth. But their poor performance amid political instability over the past year means that, despite a recent uptick in growth, the eurozone risks losing momentum in the year ahead.",
      "That is, unless consumers spend more and businesses increase their investments.",
      "In the UK higher prices could also come as a result of tax and wage increases, according to one survey.",
      "One barrier to cutting eurozone interest rates is that domestic inflation, which focuses on the prices of items that are less prone to influence from external factors, remains at 4.2%. That's more than double the overall inflation target of 2%, and strong wage pressure has been a barrier getting it down further.",
      "It's been similar in the US according to Sander van 't Noordende, the chief executive of Randstad, the world's biggest recruitment firm.",
      "\"In the US, for instance, [wage inflation] is still going to be around 4% in 2024. In some Western European countries, it's even higher than that.",
      "\"I think there's two factors there. There's the talent scarcity, but there's also, of course, the inflation and people demanding to get more for the work they do.\"",
      "Mr van 't Noordende adds that many companies are passing those extra costs on to their customers, which is adding upward pressure to general inflation.",
      "A slowdown in the global jobs market reflects a lack of \"dynamism\" from companies and economic growth is key to reversing that, he says.",
      "\"If the economy is doing well, businesses are growing, they start hiring. People see interesting opportunities, and you just start seeing people moving around\".",
      "One person starting a new role in 2025 is Donald Trump, and a raft of economic plans including tax cuts and deregulation could help the US economy to continue to thrive.",
      "Whilst much won't be revealed before he's back in the White House on 20 January,  \"everything points to continued US exceptionalism at the expense of the rest of the world,\" says JP Morgan's Mr Oganes.",
      "He's hopeful that inflation and interest rates can continue to come down around the world, but warns that \"a lot of it will depend on what are the policies that get deployed, particularly from the US.\"",

    "summary": "Visa woes and an immigration row are sparking uncertainty for Indians who want to work in the US.",
    "story": [
      "Ashish Chauhan dreams of pursuing an MBA at an American university next year - a goal he describes as being \"stamped in his brain\".",
      "The 29-year-old finance professional from India (whose name has been changed on request) hopes to eventually work in the US, but says he now feels conflicted amid an immigration row sparked by President-elect Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.",
      "The H-1B visa programme, which brings skilled foreign workers to the US, faces criticism for undercutting American workers but is praised for attracting global talent. The president-elect, once a critic, now supports the 34-year-old programme, while tech billionaire Elon Musk defends it as key to securing top engineering talent.",
      "Indian nationals like Mr Chauhan dominate the programme, receiving 72% of H-1B visas, followed by 12% for Chinese citizens. The majority of H-1B visa holders worked in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, with 65% in computer-related jobs, in 2023. Their median annual salary was $118,000 (\u00a394,000).",
      "Concerns over H-1B visas tie into broader immigration debates.",
      "A Pew Research report shows that US immigration rose by 1.6 million in 2023, the largest increase in more than 20 years. Immigrants now comprise over 14% of the population - the highest since 1910. Indians are the second-largest immigrant group - after Mexicans - in the US. Many Americans fear this surge in immigration could harm job prospects or hinder assimilation.",
      "India has also surpassed China as the leading source of international students, with a record 331,602 Indian students in the US in 2023-2024, according to the latest  Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange. Most rely on loans, and any visa freeze could potentially devastate family finances.",
      "\"My worry is that this [resistance to H-1B visas] could also spark animosity towards the Indians living there. But I can't park my ambitions, put my life on hold and wait for the volatility to subside because it's been like this for years now,\" Mr Chauhan says.",
      "Efforts to restrict the H-1B programme peaked under Trump's first term, when he signed a 2017 order increasing application scrutiny and fraud detection. Rejection rates soared to 24% in 2018, compared to 5-8% under President Barack Obama and 2-4% under President Joe Biden. The total number of approved H-1B applicants under Biden remained similar to Trump's first term.",
      "\"The first Trump administration tightened H-1B visas by increasing denial rates and slowing processing times, making it harder for people to get visas in time. It is unclear whether that will happen again in the second Trump administration,\" Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration scholar at Cornell Law School, told the BBC.",
      "\"Some people like Elon Musk want to preserve the H-1B visas, while other officials in the new administration want to restrict all immigration, including H-1Bs. It is too early to tell which side will prevail.\"",
      "Indians have a long relationship with the H-1B visa. The programme is also the reason for the \"rise of Indian-Americans into the highest educated and highest earning group, immigrant or native in the US\", say the authors of The Other One Percent, a study on Indians in America.",
      "US-based researchers Sanjoy Chakravorty, Devesh Kapur and Nirvikar Singh noted that new Indian immigrants spoke different languages and lived in different areas than earlier arrivals. Hindi, Tamil and Telugu speakers grew in number, and Indian-American communities shifted from New York and Michigan to larger clusters in California and New Jersey. The skilled visa programme helped create a \"new map of Indian-Americans\".",
      "The biggest draw of H-1B visas is the opportunity to earn significantly higher salaries, according to Mr Chauhan. The US offers higher pay, and for someone who is the first in their family to achieve professional qualifications, earning that much can be life-changing. \"The fascination with H-1Bs is directly tied to the wage gap between India and the US for the same engineering roles,\" he says.",
      "But not everybody is happy with the programme. For many, the H-1B programme is an aspirational pathway for permanent residency or a US green card. While H-1B itself is a temporary work visa, it allows visa holders to live and work in the US for up to six years. During this time, many H-1B holders apply for a green card through employment-based immigration categories, typically sponsored by their employers. This takes time.",
      "More than a million Indians, including dependents, are currently waiting in employment-based green card categories. \"Getting a green card means signing up for an endless wait for 20-30 years,\" says Atal Agarwal, who runs a firm in India that uses AI to help find visa options globally for education and jobs.",
      "Mr Agarwal moved to the US after graduating in 2017 and worked at a software company for a few years. He says getting the H-1B visa was fairly straightforward, but then it seemed he had \"reached a dead end\". He returned to India.",
      "\"It's an unstable situation. Your employer has to sponsor you and since the pathway to a green card is so long, you are basically tied to them. If you lose your job, you only get 60 days to find a new one. Every person who is going on merit to the US should have a pathway to a green card within three to five years.\"",
      "This could be one reason that the visa programme has got tied up with immigration. \"H-1B is a high-skilled, worker mobility visa. It is not an immigration visa. But it gets clubbed with immigration and illegal immigration and becomes a sensitive issue,\" Shivendra Singh, vice president of global trade development at Nasscom, the Indian technology industry trade group, told the BBC.",
      "Many in the US believe the H-1B visa programme is flawed. They cite widespread fraud and abuse, especially by major Indian IT firms which are top recipients of these visas. In October, a US court found Cognizant guilty of discriminating against over 2,000 non-Indian employees between 2013 and 2022, though the company plans to appeal. Last week, Farah Stockman of The New York Times wrote that \"for more than a decade, Americans working in the tech industry have been systematically laid off and replaced by cheaper H-1B visa holders\".",
      "Mr. Singh of Nasscom argues that H-1B visa workers are not underpaid, as employers must pay them above the prevailing or actual wage of comparable US workers in the area. Companies also invest tens of thousands of dollars in legal and government fees for these costly visas.",
      "Also, it has not been a one-way traffic: Indian tech giants have hired and supported nearly 600,000 American workers and spent over a billion dollars on upskilling nearly three million students across 130 US colleges, according to Mr Singh. The Indian tech industry has prioritised US worker hiring and they bring employees on H-1B visas only when they are unable to find locals with the skills they need, he said.",
      "India is working to ensure the H-1B visa programme remains secure as Trump prepares to take office later this month. \"Our countries share a strong and growing economic and technological partnership, and the mobility of skilled professionals is a vital component of this relationship,\" India's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told journalists last week.",
      "So what should students aspiring for jobs in the US do? \"Any immigration changes in the US will take time to implement. Students should pick the best college for them, wherever that may be. With good immigration counsel, they will be able to figure out what to do,\" says Mr Yale-Loehr.",
      "For now, despite the political turbulence in the US, Indian interest in H-1B visas remains steadfast, with students resolute in pursuing the American dream.",

      "For years, a controversial invader has been gradually taking over Australia's beloved beaches.",
      "Swallowing up the sand, blocking ocean views and turning the shore into an irksome maze, is a sea of large beach tents, called cabanas in Australia.",
      "\"It's chockers [crowded]. They're all over the place,\" Sydneysider Claire, 30, told the BBC.",
      "For her \u2013 and most Australians \u2013 cooling off on a sweltering day means a solid drive to the coast, plus an eternity trying to find a parking space. Now, the cabana craze means there's another battle waiting for them on the beach.",
      "Polyester covers flap in the breeze as far as the eye can see. Some are empty, set up at the crack of dawn and then abandoned for hours on end, until the owners actually want to use them.",
      "\"The sheer amount of space that people are taking up\u2026 [when] you're just trying to find a free square inch of sand to lay your towel, it can just be a little bit frustrating,\" Claire says.",
      "She's not alone in her irritation. Several summers of simmering tension has, in the first days of 2025, exploded into a full-on turf war, sparking debate about Australian culture and beach etiquette.",
      "A row over the acceptable use of cabanas has dominated social media, spawned a wave of opinion pieces and television segments, and even dragged in the prime minister.",
      "Self-described haters say entitled cabana crews are hogging public space and disrespecting other beachgoers.",
      "\"When you're\u2026 polluting the beach with your four cabanas next to each other, where is Guncle [Gay Uncle] Nic going to go,\" anti-cabana crusader and TikToker Nic Salerno said on TV talk show The Project.",

      "No one is discounting the importance of sun safety, the cabana critics counter, but they say that's just a convenient excuse for many of the people using the beach tents.",
      "Half the time they're not even sitting under the shade covers, they claim, and there's no need for two people to whip out an entire tent for an hour or two, when sun cream and a hat will do just fine.",
      "Other cabana devotees are more forward about their motivations. Breakfast television presenter Davina Smith admitted that for her, it is about nabbing \"the prime piece of real estate\" on busy beaches.",
      "She is one of the people who pitch their cabana castles in the early morning to reserve territory for her family later that day.",

      "\"One of the great things about Australia, unlike some parts of the world, you go and you got to pay to go to the beach. Here, everyone owns the beach\u2026 And that's a breach of that principle, really.\"",
      "Even lifeguards have opinions on the matter, with some telling local media the cabana camps can make it hard for them to do their jobs.",
      "Why is this so divisive?",
      "There are a number of cultural quirks which mean Cabanagate has Australians more worked up than a magpie in spring.",
      "Firstly, the country loves to think of itself as an egalitarian society \u2013 the land of a \"fair go\" \u2013 and that extends to the use of one of its most precious national assets.",
      "\"Australian beaches, they always have been seen as shared spaces, democratic spaces where social hierarchies dissolve\u2026. [they're] seen as a great equaliser,\" says Ece Kaya, a researcher at the University of Technology Sydney.",
      "And Australians are \"fiercely\" protective of that ideal: \"They see it as a birthright,\" says Chris Pepin-Neff, who studies Australian beach culture.",
      "They point to the backlash in 1929 when beachgoers at Sydney's Coogee Beach were forced to pay for access to the only part of the water covered by shark nets. More recently, a bid to rent out part of Sydney's famous Bondi Beach to an exclusive beach club was met with a huge outcry.",
      "And while the use of sprawling cabanas is a relatively new phenomenon, there's long been \"enormous class tension\" around the use of the country's coastline, Dr Pepin-Neff adds.",
      "A lack of infrastructure, affordable housing and community attitudes tend to lock ordinary Australians out of waterfront areas, while those natural assets are often monopolised by those lucky enough to live there.",
      "\"And there's a perception that it's encroaching even further, [so] that an average family can't even get a spot at the beach.\"",
      "The year the Australian Dream died",
      "Inside the Australian magpie\u2019s annual reign of terror",
      "But they say there's no real data on who is using cabanas and why. They also argue there's many good reasons people might use them. Maybe they've travelled a long way so they plan to stay at the beach longer, or they may have a disability or young children they need to cater for, he says.",
      "\"There is a balance between a free and open beach that everybody can use, and making sure that you're respectful.\"",
      "They offer no defence for the \"land bankers\" though: \"As a Sydneysider, I think that is abusing the privilege\u2026 that is not a fair go.\"",

      "\"They should only allow set up at the rear of the beach in a line,\" he said. \"Once this is exhausted, then no more of this style of shade should be allowed.\"",
      "Others want authorities to rein it in, like some have in the United States. There are suggestions councils could limit how many cabanas can be set up on their beaches, and where.",
      "But Sydney resident Claire, for all her wrath, worries that this could tip the scales in the other direction and exclude other people from using the beach.",
      "\"You don't want to get too precious about it, obviously\u2026 it's just the beach, first world problems right?",

      "Day's leadership bid was successful, and he set out for Ottawa with Poilievre as his assistant. Some time after, Poilievre walked into his office on a cold winter night to ask his opinion about potentially running for office.",

      "The assassin walks quickly back to his motorbike, appearing to throw something away as he does, and drives off.",
      "The victim was Lim Kimya, a 73-year-old former parliamentarian from the main Cambodian opposition party, the CNRP, which was banned in 2017. He had been hit in the chest by two bullets, according to the Thai police. He had just arrived in Bangkok with his wife on a bus from Cambodia.",

The CNRP \u2013 Cambodia National Rescue Party \u2013 was an amalgamation of two earlier opposition parties, and in 2013 came close to defeating the party of Hun Sen, the self-styled \"strongman\" who ruled Cambodia for nearly 40 years before handing over to his son Hun Manet in 2023.",
      "After his close call in the 2013 election Hun Sen accused the CNRP of treason, shutting it down and subjecting its members to legal and other forms of harassment. In 2023 Kem Sokha, who had already spent six years under house arrest, was sentenced to 27 years in prison.",

    "summary": "Though the president-elect's rhetoric is unusual, for over a century a succession of US presidents have tried to gain control of Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "US President-elect Donald Trump has repeated his intention to take control of Greenland, the Arctic territory controlled by Denmark.",
      "Why is Trump talking about this - and why now?",
      "Where is Greenland?",
      "Greenland, the world's largest island, is located in the Arctic.",
      "It is the world's most sparsely populated territory. About 56,000 people live there, mostly indigenous Inuit people.",
      "About 80% of its territory is covered by ice, meaning most people live on the south-western coast around the capital, Nuuk.",
      "An autonomous territory of Denmark, it is also home to Danish and US military bases.",
      "The economy is mainly based on fishing. Large subsidies from the Danish government account for about a fifth of GDP.",
      "In recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. These may become more accessible as global warming leads to some of the ice covering Greenland to melt.",
      "What is Greenland's status?",
      "Located geographically within North America, Greenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years.",
      "The island was governed as a colony until the mid-20th Century. For much of this time, it remained isolated and poor.",
      "In 1953, it was made part of the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlanders became Danish citizens.",
      "In 1979, a referendum on home rule gave Greenland control of most policies within the territory, with Denmark retaining control over foreign affairs and defence.",
      "Why does Greenland matter to the US?",
      "The US has long maintained a security interest in Greenland. After Nazi Germany occupied mainland Denmark during World War II, the US invaded Greenland, establishing military and radio stations across the territory.",
      "After the war, US forces remained in Greenland. Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US ever since.",
      "In 1951, a defence agreement with Denmark granted the US a significant role in the defence of the territory, including the right to build and maintain military bases.",
      "\"If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland,\" said Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College.",
      "\"That's why the Pituffik Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.\"",
      "China and Russia have begun building up their Arctic military capabilities in recent years, according to an Arctic Institute paper. The paper called for the US to further develop its presence in the Arctic to counter its rivals.",
      "On Wednesday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Denmark was open to discussions with the US, adding that Washington had \"legitimate\" interests in the region.",
      "\"We see a Russia that is arming itself. We see a China that is also starting to take an interest,\" Rasmussen said.",
      "Trump is also likely interested in the mining potential across Greenland's vast landmass, Mr Jacobsen added.",
      "\"Today, of special interest are the rare earth minerals, which have not yet been mined but are in the southern part of Greenland. These are immensely important in all kinds of technologies, from cell phones to wind turbines.\"",
      "Does the US want full control of Greenland?",
      "Trump has claimed that control of Greenland is essential to US national and economic security.",
      "Though the president-elect's rhetoric may seen unusual, for over a century a succession of US presidents have tried to gain control of Greenland.",
      "\"The US has tried a few times to push the Danes out of Greenland and take it over as part of the US, or at least to have full security tutelage of Greenland,\" said Lukas Wahden, the author of 66\u00b0 North, a newsletter on Arctic security.",
      "In 1867, after buying Alaska from Russia, US Secretary of State William H Seward led negotiations to buy Greenland from Denmark, but failed to reach any agreement.",
      "In 1946, the US offered to pay $100m (equivalent to $1.2bn; \u00a3970m today) for the territory, judging that it was vital for national security, but the Danish government refused.",
      "Trump also tried to buy Greenland during his first term. Both Denmark and the Greenlandic government rejected the 2019 proposal, saying: \"Greenland is not for sale.\"",
      "What do the people of Greenland think?",
      "Kuno Fencker, a member of the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament, said on Wednesday that he didn't see Trump's comments as a threat.",
      "Fencker, who supports Greenlandic independence, told  the BBC that a sovereign Greenland could choose to co-operate with the US on defence.",
      "But when Trump first raised the idea of buying Greenland in 2019, many locals told the BBC they were opposed to the proposal.",
      "\"This is a very dangerous idea,\" said Dines Mikaelsen, a tour operator who was born and raised in Tasiilaq, east Greenland.",

    "summary": "At the time, many blamed Carter for not bringing the US hostages in Iran home. But one Marine says he saved his life.",
    "story": [
      "Out of the many mourning former President Jimmy Carter, not everyone can say he saved their life.",
      "Rocky Sickmann was a 22-year-old US Marine stationed at the American embassy in Tehran, Iran, when he and 51 other Americans were taken hostage by Iranian revolutionaries on 4 November, 1979.",
      "It defined his life - as well as much of Carter's presidency.",
      "Jimmy Carter, former US president, dies aged 100",
      "Jimmy Carter, former US president, dies aged 100",
      "\"For the first 30 days I'm sitting in this room handcuffed and blindfolded, thinking the Vietnam war had just ended, and nobody cared about these thousands of  veterans coming home,\" said the 67-year-old. \"Who's going to care about the Iran hostages?\"",
      "He said that at the time, he wasn't even sure how much President Carter cared. It was a sentiment echoed by much of the American public. Many blamed Carter for his failure to bring the hostages home for over a year.",
      "Political historians say part of the reason Carter lost to Ronald Reagan in a landslide - and served only one term as president - was because of his handling of the hostage crisis.",
      "Minutes after Reagan was sworn in, the hostages were released, although the deal had been in the works during Carter's presidency.",
      "Mr Sickmann said that Carter deserves to be forever admired for his relentless attempt to bring them home.",
      "\"He was a good man who wanted diplomacy. I found out after how deeply involved he was. He knew my parents. He took care of them, he would meet them in DC.\"",
      "When Mr Sickmann finally got to meet Carter himself, he wasn't exactly dressed for the occasion.",
      "He laughs: \"We met him in our pyjamas! How do you meet your commander-in-chief dressed like that!\"",
      "Rocky was flown out with the other hostages to Wiesbaden, Germany, a year after they had been taken hostage. The day after they got there, Carter greeted them personally.",
      "\"It was a very exciting day because he used to be in the Marines and he said to meet us was the happiest day of his life.\"",
      "The meeting was captured in a photograph, which Carter would send to Sickmann 10 months after he had been voted out of the White House. It was signed: 'To my friend, Rocky Sickmann\".",
      "But it was not the last time that Mr Sickmann saw him. Just 10 years ago, he ran into Carter at a baseball game in Georgia. He had an usher pass the former president a note.",
      "\"He reads it - all of a sudden he gets up and he stands up and he turns around. I stand up and we waved at each other.\"",
      "Like Carter, Mr Sickmann went on to focus on charitable work. He said he was inspired by the former president to set up Folds of Honor, which provides scholarships to families of America\u02bcs fallen or disabled military and first responders.",
      "\"President Carter was a good Christian man, married to his wonderful wife, and continued his life of service. I don't know if I'll ever be as good as him but I hope to be able to do the same thing.\"",
      "The charity was set up to honor the 8 US service men who were killed trying to rescue the hostages. In 1980, the mission, dubbed Eagle Claw, failed disastrously after three helicopters malfunctioned. It was the last straw for Carter politically - although he won the Democratic nomination, he was wiped out in the election by Ronald Reagan that year.",
      "But while the Iran hostage crisis would be a dark mark on Carter's political legacy, Mr Sickmann said he owes his life to Jimmy Carter.",
      "\"Morning, noon, and night, for 444 days, I never prayed so hard in my life, hoping that God was on our side,\" he said.",
      "\"But also President Carter kept us alive. He kept us in front of the world, making sure that people were praying for us (too).\"",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 15:58:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Antal Rogan is one of the most powerful men in Orban's government and heads his cabinet office.",
    "story": [
      "The US Treasury has imposed sanctions on Antal Rogan, one of the most powerful men in Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz government and the minister in charge of his cabinet office.",
      "It is a rare move between Nato allies, and symbolic of the depth to which US-Hungarian relations have sunk since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost three years ago.",
      "\"Antal Rogan is a primary architect, implementer and beneficiary of this system of corruption,\" read the statement, made by outgoing US Ambassador David Pressman.",
      "Pressman leaves Budapest next week, after two and a half years spent as an unusually active diplomat, travelling the country and frequently criticising the Orban government.",
      "His departure comes days ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House, and the president-elect has a far more positive view of Viktor Orban than the Biden administration, seeing him as a close political ally.",
      "\"While Minister Rogan's media megaphones will try to make this a story about partisan politics or an affront to sovereignty, today's decision is actually the reverse,\" Pressman told reporters in Budapest on Tuesday.",
      "\"It is not the United States that threatens Hungary's sovereignty, but rather the kleptocratic ecosystem Minister Rogan has helped to build and direct and that he has benefited from personally.\"",
      "The ambassador's statement was immediately attacked by Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto.",
      "\"This is the personal revenge of the ambassador who was sent to Hungary by the failed US administration, but left without success and in disgrace,\" Szijjarto wrote on Facebook.",
      "\"How good it is that in a few days' time the United States will be led by people who see our country as a friend and not as an enemy.\"",
      "A former US ambassador to Hungary, David Cornstein, also came to Rogan's defence: \"The move by outgoing ambassador David Pressman is an example of the current US administration's hostile stance towards Hungary, right down to the last hour.\"",
      "The question for the incoming Trump presidency, and its next ambassador to Budapest, is whether they will immediately overturn the sanctions against Antal Rogan.",
      "The answer is not as obvious as might appear.",
      "Rogan also oversees the domestic secret services, and there have been indications from several Nato countries that Hungary is no longer trusted with sensitive information because of the Orban government's close relations with Russia's Vladimir Putin.",
      "And for all the expressions of outrage at the decision to impose sanctions on Orban's head of cabinet, several senior figures in the Fidesz establishment have long been privately upset by the lifestyle of Rogan and others, by the power he wields, and the distance from the conservative and Christian values that the party proclaims so loudly."

      "\"Inside Edition\" correspondent Alison Hall is opening up about her breast cancer journey and how actress Olivia Munn's own cancer diagnosis influenced Hall's decision to seek testing. Hall shared her story on \"CBS Mornings,\" explaining how Munn's advocacy for early detection, along with a breast cancer risk assessment tool, led to her life-saving diagnosis.",
      "Munn credited the risk assessment test, which uses various factors to evaluate lifetime breast cancer risk, for her early diagnosis. After hearing Munn's story, Hall decided to take the same test. To her surprise, a doctor revealed that Hall's lifetime risk for breast cancer was 36%.",
      "\"Wow, OK, that feels high,\" Hall said, after hearing the news.",
      "Hall, whose mother had breast cancer at age 50, had already undergone genetic testing for the BRCA gene in her 20s, which came back negative. She also had never had a mammogram until this year, after taking the risk assessment test.",
      "Following the assessment, Hall was placed on a regular screening schedule, including mammograms and MRIs every six months. After an MRI revealed some abnormalities, Hall underwent biopsies, which confirmed she had breast cancer.",
      "\"This is actually good news,\" her doctor told her. \"It's stage zero, the earliest it could possibly be caught.\"",
      "Hall was preparing to report on Munn's battle with breast cancer when she received her diagnosis. Hall described it as \"surreal\" to become part of the news.",
      "\"I was prepared to do the test in order to promote awareness for breast cancer, especially with it being a subject so close to my heart,\" she said. \"I didn't expect it to happen so soon, especially.\"",
      "Hall has chosen to undergo a double mastectomy next week to remove the current cancer and lower her risk of future diagnoses.",
      "\"I want to do whatever I can to prevent that for my future self and my future family,\" Hall said.",
      "Munn sent \"CBS Mornings\" a statement to deliver to Hall, saying, \"You are now on the path to survival ... By telling your story, you are creating a ripple effect of hope and saving lives.\"",
      "Hall expressed deep gratitude for Munn's words and emphasized how sharing her story could help others.",
      "\"By Olivia sharing her story, she had a direct impact on my life,\" Hall said.",
      "As Hall prepares for her upcoming surgery, she is grateful for the support of her family and friends, including her husband, whom she calls her \"human support person.\"",

    "title": "Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary dies at age 86",
    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 19:35:35 -0500",
    "summary": "Peter Yarrow was a singer-songwriter and a social activist, but he was best known as one-third of the folk-music group Peter, Paul and Mary.",
    "story": [
      "Peter Yarrow, the singer-songwriter best known as one-third of Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk-music trio whose impassioned harmonies transfixed millions as they lifted their voices in favor of civil rights and against war, has died, publicist Ken Sunshine confirmed to CBS News. Yarrow was 86.",
      "Yarrow, who also co-wrote the group's most enduring song, \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" died Tuesday in New York, Sunshine told the Associated Press. Yarrow had been battling bladder cancer for the past four years.",
      "\"Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest,\" his daughter Bethany said in a statement.",
      "During an incredible run of success spanning the 1960s, Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers released six Billboard Top 10 singles, two No. 1 albums and won five Grammys.",
      "They also brought early exposure to Bob Dylan by turning two of his songs, \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" into Billboard Top 10 hits as they helped lead an American renaissance in folk music. They performed \"Blowin' in the Wind\" at the 1963 March on Washington at which the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech.",
      "After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited in 1978 for a \"Survival Sunday,\" an anti-nuclear-power concert that Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until Travers' death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform both separately and together.",
      "Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an upper middle class family he said placed high value on art and scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk-music icons as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger.",
      "Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his senior year.",
      "\"I did it for the money because I wanted to wash dishes less and play guitar more,\" he told the late record company executive Joe Smith. But as he led the class in song, he began to discover the emotional impact music could have on an audience.",
      "\"I saw these young people at Cornell who were basically very conservative in their backgrounds opening their hearts up and singing with an emotionality and a concern through this vehicle called folk music,\" he said. \"It gave me a clue that the world was on its way to a certain kind of movement, and that folk music might play a part in it and that I might play a part in folk music.\"",
      "Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman, who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad \"Tom Dooley.\"",
      "But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic he'd seen named Noel Stookey.",
      "Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group, happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and recorded with Seeger and others. Gripped by stage fright, she was reluctant to join the pair at first, changing her mind after she heard how well her contralto voice melded with Yarrow's tenor and Stookey's baritone.",
      "\"We called Noel up. He was there,\" Yarrow said, recalling the first time the three performed together. \"We mentioned a bunch of folk songs, which he didn't know because he didn't have a real folk-music background, and wound up singing 'Mary Had a Little Lamb.' And it was immediately great, was just as clear as a bell, and we started working.\"",
      "After months of rehearsal the three became an overnight sensation when their first album, 1962's eponymous \"Peter, Paul and Mary,\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, \"In the Wind,\" reached No. 4 and their third, \"Moving,\" put them back at No. 1.",
      "From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and injustice in songs like Seeger's \"If I Had a Hammer\" and \"Where Have all the Flowers Gone,\" Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind\" and \"When the Ship Comes In\" and Yarrow's own \"Day is Done.\"",
      "They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on \"Puff the Magic Dragon,\" which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years with college friend Leonard Lipton.",
      "It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff behind. As Yarrow explains: \"A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.\"",
      "Some insisted they heard drug references in the song, a contention at the heart of a famous scene in the film \"Meet the Parents,\" when Ben Stiller angers his girlfriend's tightly wound father (Robert De Niro) by saying \"puff\" refers to marijuana smoke. Yarrow maintained it reflected the loss of childhood innocence and nothing more.",
      "After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver's \"Leaving on a Jet Plane,\" the trio split up the following year to pursue solo careers.",
      "That same year Yarrow pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981. Over the decades, he apologized repeatedly.",
      "\"I fully support the current movements demanding equal rights for all and refusing to allow continued abuse and injury \u2014 most particularly of a sexual nature, of which I am, with great sorrow, guilty,\" he told The New York Times in 2019 after being disinvited from a festival over the sentence.",

Cohen was legally blind.",

      "Oprah Winfrey selected Eckhart Tolle's \"A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose\" as her latest book club choice. The book encourages readers to find peace and purpose and makes history as the first book to be chosen twice. Read a free excerpt below.",
      "Chapter One",
      "The Flowering of Human Consciousness",
      "EVOCATION Earth, 114 million years ago, one morning just after sunrise: The \ufb01rst \ufb02ower ever to appear on the planet opens up to receive the rays of the sun. Prior to this momentous event that heralds an evolutionary transformation in the life of plants, the planet had already been covered in vegetation for millions of years. The \ufb01rst \ufb02ower probably did not survive for long, and \ufb02owers must have remained rare and isolated phenomena, since conditions were most likely not yet favorable for a widespread \ufb02owering to occur. One day, however, a critical threshold was reached, and suddenly there would have been an explosion of color and scent all over the planet\u2014if a perceiving consciousness had been there to witness it.",
      "Much later, those delicate and fragrant beings we call \ufb02owers would come to play an essential part in the evolution of consciousness of another species. Humans would increasingly be drawn to and fascinated by them. As the consciousness of human beings developed, \ufb02owers were most likely the \ufb01rst thing they came to value that had no utilitarian purpose for them, that is to say, was not linked in some way to survival. They provided inspiration to countless artists, poets, and mystics. Jesus tells us to contemplate the \ufb02owers and learn from them how to live. The Buddha is said to have given a \"silent sermon\" once during which he held up a \ufb02ower and gazed at it. After a while, one of those present, a monk called Mahakasyapa, began to smile. He is said to have been the only one who had understood the sermon. According to legend, that smile (that is to say, realization) was handed down by twenty-eight successive masters and much later became the origin of Zen.",
      "Seeing beauty in a \ufb02ower could awaken humans, however brie\ufb02y, to the beauty that is an essential part of their own innermost being, their true nature. The \ufb01rst recognition of beauty was one of the most signi\ufb01cant events in the evolution of human consciousness. The feelings of joy and love are intrinsically connected to that recognition. Without our fully realizing it, \ufb02owers would become for us an expression in form of that which is most high, most sacred, and ultimately formless within ourselves. Flowers, more \ufb02eeting, more ethereal, and more delicate than the plants out of which they emerged, would become like messengers from another realm, like a bridge between the world of physical forms and the formless. They not only had a scent that was delicate and pleasing to humans, but also brought a fragrance from the realm of spirit. Using the word \"enlightenment\" in a wider sense than the conventionally accepted one, we could look upon \ufb02owers as the enlightenment of plants.",
      "Any life-form in any realm\u2014mineral, vegetable, animal, or human\u2014can be said to undergo \"enlightenment.\" It is, however, an extremely rare occurrence since it is more than an evolutionary progression: It also implies a discontinuity in its development, a leap to an entirely different level of Being and, most important, a lessening of materiality.",
      "What could be heavier and more impenetrable than a rock, the densest of all forms? And yet some rocks undergo a change in their molecular structure, turn into crystals, and so become transparent to the light. Some carbons, under inconceivable heat and pressure, turn into diamonds, and some heavy minerals into other precious stones.",
      "Most crawling reptilians, the most earthbound of all creatures, have remained unchanged for millions of years. Some, however, grew feathers and wings and turned into birds, thus defying the force of gravity that had held them for so long. They didn't become better at crawling or walking, but transcended crawling and walking entirely.",
      "Since time immemorial, \ufb02owers, crystals, precious stones, and birds have held special signi\ufb01cance for the human spirit. Like all life forms, they are, of course, temporary manifestations of the underlying one Life, one Consciousness. Their special signi\ufb01cance and the reason why humans feel such fascination for and af\ufb01nity with them can be attributed to their ethereal quality.",
      "Once there is a certain degree of Presence, of still and alert attention in human beings' perceptions, they can sense the divine life essence, the one indwelling consciousness or spirit in every creature, every life-form, recognize it as one with their own essence and so love it as themselves. Until this happens, however, most humans see only the outer forms, unaware of the inner essence, just as they are unaware of their own essence and identify only with their own physical and psychological form.",
      "In the case of a \ufb02ower, a crystal, precious stone, or bird, however, even someone with little or no Presence can occasionally sense that there is more there than the mere physical existence of that form, without knowing that this is the reason why he or she is drawn toward it, feels an af\ufb01nity with it. Because of its ethereal nature, its form ob- obscures the indwelling spirit to a lesser degree than is the case with other life forms. The exception to this are all newborn life forms\u2014babies, puppies, kittens, lambs, and so on. They are fragile, delicate, not yet \ufb01rmly established in materiality. An innocence, a sweetness and beauty that are not of this world still shine through them. They delight even relatively insensitive humans.",
      "So when you are alert and contemplate a \ufb02ower, crystal, or bird without naming it mentally, it becomes a window for you into the formless. There is an inner opening, however slight, into the realm of spirit. This is why these three \"en-lightened\" life forms have played such an important part in the evolution of human consciousness since ancient times; why, for example, the jewel in the lotus \ufb02ower is a central symbol of Buddhism and a white bird, the dove, signi\ufb01es the Holy Spirit in Christianity. They have been preparing the ground for a more profound shift in planetary consciousness that is destined to take place in the human species. This is the spiritual awakening that we are beginning to witness now.",
      "THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK",
      "Is humanity ready for a transformation of consciousness, an inner \ufb02owering so radical and profound that compared to it the \ufb02owering of plants, no matter how beautiful, is only a pale re\ufb02ection? Can human beings lose the density of their conditioned mind structures and become like crystals or precious stones, so to speak, transparent to the light of consciousness? Can they defy the gravitational pull of material-ism and materiality and rise above identi\ufb01cation with form that keeps the ego in place and condemns them to im- imprisonment within their own personality?",
      "The possibility of such a transformation has been the central message of the great wisdom teachings of humankind. The messengers\u2014Buddha, Jesus, and others, not all of them known\u2014were humanity's early \ufb02owers. They were precursors, rare and precious beings. A widespread \ufb02owering was not yet possible at that time, and their message became largely misunderstood and often greatly distorted. It certainly did not transform human behavior, except in a small minority of people.",
      "Is humanity more ready now than at the time of those early teachers? Why should this be so? What can you do, if anything, to bring about or accelerate this inner shift? What is it that characterizes the old egoic state of consciousness, and by what signs is the new emerging consciousness recognized? These and other essential questions will be addressed in this book. More important, this book itself is a transformational device that has come out of the arising new consciousness. The ideas and concepts presented here may be important, but they are secondary. They are no more than signposts pointing toward awakening. As you read, a shift takes place within you.",

      "\"You need something small, something measurable that will reward your brain and say, 'I am making progress,'\" he said.",
      "Brooks recommended starting with simple resolutions like keeping a gratitude list.",
      "\"The brain is dedicated more to resentment than to gratitude,\" he explained, suggesting people write down five things they're grateful for every Sunday. \"It just takes a minute. You will, within 10 weeks, become 10 to 20% happier and that will become a habit.\"",
      "For those considering bigger changes, like switching careers, Brooks emphasized the need for courage.",
      "\"You have to have a sense of adventure,\" he said. \"You have to know why you are leaving the job you are currently leaving.\"",
      "For those unable to quit their jobs but still seeking happiness, Brooks offered this advice: \"Look for a way to make people happier around you.\"",
      "He gave an example: \"At 2 p.m., you're in your cubicle. The guy next door could use a fresh cup of coffee. You bring it to him, unasked. And look at the look on his face. You'll become that person who brings people things they didn't ask for, and weirdly, you're going to start liking your job more.\"",
      "Brooks also said happiness requires unhappiness.",
      "\"We're never going to avoid or eliminate negative emotions. It's important to learn how to manage them,\" he said. \"You won't know what beautiful and wonderful is, unless you've seen the opposite in your life as well.\"",

      "Glaser, a comedian who gained widespread attention after her performance at Netflix's \"The Roast of Tom Brady\" last year, was tasked with hosting duties for Sunday night's award show. She was the Golden Globes' first solo female host.",
      "Here is what to know about this year's host.",
      "Who is Nikki Glaser?",
      "An Ohio native, Nikki Glaser has worn many hats throughout her career. Primarily she is a stand-up comedian who has also had success as an actress, podcaster, radio and television host.",
      "She began performing stand-up comedy at age 18, working her way up to performances on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,\" \"Conan\" and two seasons of \"Last Comic Standing.\" She is known for her brutally honest comedic style and her raunchy and relatable stand-up specials.",

      "\"It's been a lot of hard work leading up to this point of, like, a 22-year career where some people are suddenly starting to take notice,\" Glaser said. \"I'm at a point in my life where, you know, I'm old enough to kind of handle this kind of attention and not let it go to my head.\"",
      "She has been open about her struggles with self-medicating, eating disorders and alcoholism, telling CBS \"Sunday Morning\" in a recent interview, \"The obsession with work is, like, just not wanting to feel.\"",
      "But she said she was not worried about the pressure of hosting the Golden Globes. \"I thrive on anxiety,\" she said. \"I like feeling like, 'Oh, what's gonna happen?' I like that feeling. I kill it when I'm anxious.\"",

      "She had acting roles in the Amy Schumer comedy flicks \"Trainwreck\" and \"I Feel Pretty\" and took a whirl in competition shows like \"Dancing with the Stars\" and \"The Masked Singer.\"",
      "Glaser has also participated in the roasts of Rob Lowe, Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin and Tom Brady.",
      "The comedian has released four comedy specials, including her most recent, \"Nikky Glaser: Someday You'll Die,\" for which she received a Golden Globe nomination\u00a0for Best Stand-up Comedy Performance.",
      "\"It was really cool to get the nomination on top of preparing for this,\" Glaser told \"CBS Mornings\" about the Globes. \"To me, hosting is No. 1.\"",
      "Despite the pressure, Glaser was excited about the experience and eager for her big night \u2014 whether she brought home a trophy or not.",
      "\"I'll do a bit after my award is given out,\" she said. \"I think it's kind of funnier if I lose.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 10:36:34 -0500",
    "summary": "An increasingly popular symphony orchestra concert is a screening of a movie such as \"Jaws\" accompanied by a live performance of the music\u2014reeling in new audiences to the concert hall.",
    "story": [
      "The worst way to watch \"Jaws\" is without music. A good way is to watch it with John Williams' famous score coming from your speakers. But the best way to watch \"Jaws\" might be with a live orchestra playing that iconic score.",
      "The New York Philharmonic plays for four movies a year at Lincoln Center. Almost every showing is sold out.",
      "\"A live orchestra absolutely reaches people in a way that no recorded sound can even approximate,\" said the Philharmonic's former acting CEO Deborah   Borda. \"It's like you're sitting in the middle of the orchestra.\"",
      "In the silent film days, live music always accompanied movies, and movies were events.",
      "\"Over the years, theaters got smaller,\" said Steve Linder. \"Then, people started watching it on their television. Then they watch it on their computer. Then they watch that on their phone.\"",
      "Linder is the cofounder of Film Concerts Live, one of several companies that rent out the sheet music and equipment that orchestras need to perform one of these movies. \"What we do is we bring moviegoing back to what it was originally intended to be, with live music, and in a communal experience.\"",
      "But for Borda, one of the best features of live movie scores is the way they attract new and younger audiences to the concert hall. \"Almost 50% of the people who come to our film series are first-time attendees of the New York Philharmonic, and the first time in the hall,\" she said.",
      "For the conductor, these shows are tricky. You have to keep one eye on the musicians, one eye on the score, and one eye on a special monitor running the film. But how does the conductor know exactly when to bring in the orchestra in sync with the action? That's the purpose of moving vertical bars called streamers. Those streamers and the bright dots are like countdowns to important musical moments.",
      "Anthony Parnther conducted the Philharmonic's screenings of \"Jaws.\" But his main gig is conducting the actual Hollywood recording sessions for films, such as \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" and \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\"",
      "Asked if there is a feeling among his fellow conductors that such concerts are more crowd-pleasers than art, Parnther replied, \"All I know is that when I turn around from my score to address the audience, every seat is filled.\"",
      "So, how flexible is conducting a score live to a film? \"I have a little bit of license to phrase the orchestra around the streamers,\" Parnther said. \"There could be a little bit of variance. And I think that's what makes these particularly appealing for the musicians to perform and for conductors to conduct.\"",
      "These days, there are over a thousand live-orchestra movie screenings a year. The classic blockbusters usually work best, from \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Superman\" to \"Harry Potter\" and \"The Lord of the Rings.\"",
      "\"It has to be great music that the audience wants to hear, of course,\" said Linder. \"But also it has to be great music that the orchestra is interested in playing.\"",
      "Ryan Roberts is the New York Philharmonic's English horn and oboe player. Unfortunately, during the projection concerts, he sits directly under the screen, so he never gets to see any of the movies, even when he's not playing.",
      "\"But we have a few sneaky ways of watching the movie in the woodwind section,\" Roberts said. His favorite? A rearview mirror he bought on Amazon. \"We tape it right on top of our stand lights.\"",
      "And management approves of this? \"I plead the fifth!\" Roberts laughed.",
      "With the New York Philharmonic performing four performances of four films a year, which all sell out, shouldn't they do 10 performances of each film? Borda said, \"This is a symphony orchestra. We play Mahler. We play Bach. We play Mozart. We have a responsibility to the canon of music. And no, we're not a movie house; we're a symphony orchestra.\"",
      "Well, OK. But even Borda acknowledges that live-orchestra movies have become a popular and important option for American orchestras. \"We should be places that are integrated into the fabric of the community,\" she said. \"And so, we want the New York Philharmonic to be as popular as the New York Yankees or the Mets. And movies can help get us there.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 05 Jan 2025 10:05:29 -0500",
    "summary": "In the sweeping new period drama, Adrien Brody stars as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth, a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and seeks to rebuild his career after emigrating to America.",
    "story": [
      "Last month, on a boat called the Manhattan, Adrien Brody and I sailed into New York Harbor.\u00a0 Destination: The Statue of Liberty. He'd been to the landmark before, spending time there with his mother, an immigrant who came to America in 1958.",
      "\"My mother and my grandparents fled Hungary during the revolution,\" Brody said. \"There was so much unknown, and a lot of loss. And all of those sacrifices have kind of laid the foundation for my own existence and what has been accessible to me.\"",
      "Brody's immigrant roots make his latest film, \"The Brutalist,\" a deeply personal one. It's a sweeping, decades-long tale of love, ambition, and a complicated American Dream, all centered around one man, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Toth. \"He's a Jewish Hungarian architect who survives the horrors of World War II, and is forced to toil through poverty and rebuild,\" Brody said.",
      "Toth is hired by a wealthy industrialist to build a massive community center in his \"brutalist\" style \u2013 a form of architecture that's light on decoration and heavy on concrete.",
      "To get Toth just right, Brody drew on his memories of his Hungarian grandfather. \"I remember my grandfather's accent was very, very heavy,\" he said.",
      "\"So, do you hear your grandfather's voice a little bit in this character of L\u00e1szl\u00f3?\" I asked.",
      "\"Oh definitely, yeah, I conjure it up. I also knew every bad word in Hungarian as a kid. So, I infused some of that in it that's not in the script!\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Brutalist\" click on the video player below:",
      "The film's received seven Golden Globe nominations, and Oscar buzz is high. But at three-and-a-half hours, it requires a commitment.",
      "Asked if he was worried about the film's length, Broday replied, \"This is an event. Generations before us, you could expect to see something like this in a theater. But that's becoming much more rare today. I think we all need to be fed nourishing meals! And this is one of them.\"",
      "At 51, Brody's portrayal of a man rebuilding his life after a war makes for a fascinating counterpoint to a role he played more than two decades ago: his Oscar-winning performance of a man enduring the horrors of war in Roman Polanski's \"The Pianist.\"",
      "To play Wladyslaw Szpilman, the real-life pianist who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland, Brody virtually starved himself, losing 30 pounds, all while learning to play the piano.",
      "Learning to play Chopin, he said, quelled his pangs of hunger. \"'Cause it was a kind of meditative, intensely-focused activity where I was memorizing. And I became quite proficient at playing minutes of Chopin's Nocturne and a ballade. And I don't even read music.\"",
      "At 29, he was the youngest man to ever win the Oscar for best actor. The child of an immigrant was living his own American dream.",
      "Adrien Brody was raised in Queens, N.Y. His father, Elliot, is a retired teacher.\u00a0 His mother, Sylvia Plachy, is a photographer. \"As an only child and the son of a photographer, I was her favorite subject,\" he said. \"And so, I had a lens from a very nurturing and ever-present perspective on me. And I think that also helped as a film actor.\"",
      "\"You were comfortable in front of a camera thanks to Mom?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. Thanks to Mom.\"",
      "He dabbled in magic, calling himself \"The Amazing Adrien,\" but settled on acting by middle school. At 13, he landed a leading role as a rebellious orphan in a made-for-TV movie, \"Home at Last.\" \u00a0\"I remember thinking how I never wanted it to end,\" he said. \"And that sense of joy that I get from it in that immersion, it's never gone away.\"",
      "Brody aged into a mohawked punk rocker in Spike Lee's \"Summer of Sam.\" He's carried a blockbuster like \"King Kong,\" and shown some whimsy in his five films with director Wes Anderson, including \"The Darjeeling Limited\" and \"The French Dispatch.\"",
      "Anderson, said Brody, \"has given me a lot of opportunity to do comedic work, more overtly comedic stuff, which at the time when we started working together, I think people just thought I was a serious actor.\"",
      "\"The Brutalist\" is a return to his serious side, and maybe a reminder that, as an artist, Adrien Brody is up for anything. \"It's a nice moment right now,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"When you're not working, what makes you happy?\"",
      "\"Lots of things. I need to be creatively immersed. So, that may be fulfilled through cooking, through painting, through making music. I'm a pretty good cook.\"",
      "\"What do you make?\"",
      "\"I mean, hot dogs,\" he laughed. \"What do you like? You tell me what would you like? I can whip something up. You can come over one day, come see the artwork. I'll whip up something to eat. I can make some good cocktails.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"I've spent quite a lot of my life over the last 15 years in the really honored, privileged position of being close to people who are reaching the end of their lives,\" said actress Tilda Swinton. \"And then to make a film about it is a blessing on a blessing, really.\"",
      "Drawing on those experiences helped Swinton earn an acting nomination for Sunday's Golden Globes. In \"The Room Next Door,\" she portrays a woman with a terminal cancer diagnosis. Her character, Martha, faces questions about how to live. \"My first 'Martha,' if you like, was Derek Jarman,\" she said. The director, artist and gay activist (who cast Swinton in her first film, \"Caravaggio\"), was diagnosed with HIV in 1986.",
      "The Oscar-winner credits Jarman with finding her a home in cinema, and showing her how collaborative filmmaking could be. They made seven feature films together before his death, in 1994.",
      "She said, \"He modeled a kind of attitude to his dismount that I drew on, like, to my core, for myself, and in fact I have reflected in the portrait of Martha.\"",
      "I asked, \"You think about specific people as you're acting?\"",
      "\"Well, an attitude, yeah, that I've seen played out, that I've witnessed \u2013 my parents, my children's beloved father, John Byrne, who died last year,\" she replied. \"It's been such a privilege to be in that hot seat beside them and seeing them face the inevitable with such dignity and humor and wit, and just power.\"",
      "\"The Room Next Door\" is the first English-language feature film by Spanish director Pedro Almod\u00f3var. Swinton's co-star, Julianne Moore, is another Academy Award-winner. \"He asked me who I wanted,\" said Swinton. \"It was her face that I saw at the end of the bed. It was her listening face that I felt was the right face.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Room Next Door\" click on the video player below:",
      "Swinton has made more than 80 films, winning an Oscar for the 2007 \"Michael Clayton.\" Still, she says the big studio productions are the exception. She veers toward independent films, thriving in the experimental.",
      "Asked about the expressiveness of her eyes, and of how much she can \"say\" without saying anything, Swinton said, \"I suppose I started in silent cinema with Derek Jarman. I actually prefer silent cinema.\"",
      "Why? \"I loved it first,\" she said. \"And then when I started working with Derek, I found my comfort zone in front of a silent camera. I think it's a very rare screenplay that is able to approach what I'm really interested in, which is inarticulacy. Even now, I sort of know what I want to say to you, but I can't pull the words out my ear, and they're coming out a little wrong.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you say it with your eyes?\"",
      "\"That's what I'm really interested in!\" she laughed.",
      "She's played a tortured mother in \"We Need to Talk About Kevin,\" and she's not exactly cuddly in the Almod\u00f2var film. But just before our interview, joking about some fabulous boots she was wearing, we glimpsed another side of Swinton.",
      "I asked, \"You've done a lot of films, but you can seem so serious \u2026 Like this? Not at all. There is a curiosity and a warmth, and you jump out.\"",
      "\"The jumping out, I get. The seriousness, I am a little confused by.\"",
      "\"What do you mean?\"",
      "\"I am always doing comedy,\" she said. \"I feel everything I do is funny. But I think maybe because I'm a shy person and I don't tend to smile with my teeth all over the place, there's has been an assumption that there was more seriousness than nonsense, but there is a hell of a lot of nonsense.\"",
      "\"You're a shy person?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"You picked a tough career for that!\"",
      "\"I know! It's strange, isn't it? But I think what makes me most shy is being singled out.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 10:12:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Lower immunity to the new GII.17 strain could be leading to more infections.",
    "story": [
      "A new strain of norovirus now makes up a majority of outbreaks nationwide, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new strain's emergence, found spreading throughout the country and on cruise ships, offers a possible explanation for the past month's steep wave of infections from the stomach bug.",
      "Scientists call this winter's dominant norovirus strain GII.17[P17]. Samples from patients in nearly 7 in 10 norovirus outbreaks have tested positive for the new strain so far this season, according to data from a network of public health laboratories called CaliciNet.",
      "\"It is too early to tell if this strain is associated with more severe norovirus disease but likely lower population immunity is the reason for the early surge of an otherwise seasonal increase of this virus,\" Jan Vinj\u00e9, head of the CDC's CaliciNet system, told CBS News in an email.",
      "All previous waves of norovirus in the U.S. since 2012 have been dominated by a different strain that scientists call GII.4, said Vinj\u00e9. This season, only around 7% of norovirus outbreaks have been linked to that GII.4 strain.",
      "Vinj\u00e9 said that the GII.17 strain is behind outbreaks \"everywhere\" across the country this season of the highly contagious virus, including on cruise ship outbreaks.",
      "The CDC tracked at least six norovirus outbreaks on vessels last month, marking the most reported in the month for over a decade.",
      "Norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne illness in the U.S. and almost always climbs around the country starting during the winter months.",
      "Many cases resolve on their own without needing to be tested or treated by doctors, making it impossible to know exactly how many Americans are sickened. However, virtually all data tracking the virus suggest norovirus is at peak levels throughout the country.",
      "Rates of positive norovirus tests from a different CDC network of laboratories have reached the highest weekly levels on record in years. Norovirus rates in figures from testing company BioFire Diagnostics are also now above previous seasonal peaks.",
      "In wastewater, samples collected by WastewaterSCAN have been \"high\" for norovirus across nearly all sites monitored by the firm across the country.",
      "While versions of GII.17 have been circulating for several decades, only in recent years has the strain driven large waves of infections. Some parts of Europe last year reported a \"sudden rise\" in GII.17. Japan and China reported their first waves from the strain after 2014.",
      "The CDC reported it had seen a rise in GII.17 cases last season, though it remained a minority of all norovirus outbreaks at the time in the U.S.",
      "Is GII.17 causing more or worse norovirus cases?",
      "Additional studies will also be needed to tease out whether GII.17 is leading to a difference in the severity of norovirus infections. Some previous changes to the virus have emerged without causing new or significantly worse symptoms.",
      "\"What we are seeing has happened before for noroviruses. Noroviruses are very diverse,\" said Marion Koopmans, head of the Erasmus MC Department of Viroscience.",
      "Koopmans, who oversees a global consortium of norovirus researchers, cautioned that data tracking norovirus cases still has gaps around the world. More studies are also needed to prove if there is an actual increase in illnesses being driven by the strain.",
      "\"There is insufficient surveillance (in my view) to really make the case that this is causing an increase in the number of cases, as we have a lot of norovirus infections each winter and the surveillance is rather patchy,\" said Koopmans.",
      "When the latest GII.4 strain, called the Sydney variant, emerged in 2012, initial data suggested it had driven an increase in outbreaks. The CDC later reported data from hospitals suggesting it had not actually led to significantly more or worse norovirus infections.",
      "\"Thus, the observed increase in outbreak activity during the 2012\u201313 season likely represents random seasonal and state variation rather than a direct result of the emergence of GII.4 Sydney,\" CDC scientists concluded at the time.",
      "Health officials in Wisconsin said earlier this month that they had seen a record-high number of norovirus outbreaks, but told CBS News they do not believe it is driving a major difference in symptoms or length of illness.",
      "\"It does not change any recommendations about prevention or spread. It just means we have a robust outbreak season and therefore an opportunity to really emphasize the importance of handwashing, staying home while sick and until at least 48 hours after recovery,\" said Elizabeth Goodsitt, spokesperson for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, in an email.",

    "summary": "The Louisiana patient was hospitalized with a severe case of bird flu in the first death in the U.S. caused by the H5N1 virus.",
    "story": [
      "A Louisiana resident has died after being hospitalized with bird flu, the state's health department announced Monday, marking the first U.S. death from the H5N1 virus.",
      "\"The patient was over the age of 65 and was reported to have underlying medical conditions,\" Louisiana's health department said in a statement, saying that health officials still judge the public health risk from the virus as low for the general public.",
      "The patient tested positive and developed severe illness after being exposed to wild birds and a personal backyard poultry flock that was infected with the virus, according to the health department. No other people were found to have been sickened by the virus in Louisiana.",
      "\"CDC has carefully studied the available information about the person who died in Louisiana and continues to assess that the risk to the general public remains low. Most importantly, no person-to-person transmission spread has been identified,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Monday.",
      "H5N1 has been linked to at least seven other deaths from other countries in recent years. Since 2003, the World Health Organization has counted more than 400 deaths from the virus.",
      "One other U.S. hospital patient tested positive for the virus last year in Missouri, though officials said that the person had not been admitted because of the virus. Instead, the patient was in the hospital being treated for other preexisting medical conditions.",
      "The Louisiana patient was sickened by the D1.1 strain of the bird flu virus, genetic sequencing by the CDC determined last month.",
      "The patient's virus did have some rare and potentially worrying mutations, the sequencing revealed. Those genetic changes to the virus likely arose later during the person's infection, the CDC's investigation concluded, and were not found in the animals that likely infected them.",
      "\"Although concerning, and a reminder that A(H5N1) viruses can develop changes during the clinical course of a human infection, these changes would be more concerning if found in animal hosts or in early stages of infection,\" the CDC said.",
      "The D1.1 strain is the same as the virus behind a severe illness of a 13-year-old girl who was hospitalized late last year in Canada.",
      "Health authorities in the Canadian province of British Columbia said last year that they had been unable to identify the source of the infection, but did find that the virus sequence closely matched wild birds that were flying through the province in October.",
      "This D1.1 strain of H5N1 bird flu is different from the B3.13 genotype which has been fueling this past year's unprecedented outbreak on dairy farms across the U.S.",
      "Including the Louisiana case, the CDC tallies 66 reported human cases in the U.S. since last year from any of the H5 strains of bird flu.",
      "How is bird flu spread?",
      "Most of the human cases have been in workers who got sick with the B3.13 strain after working with infected cattle. None of those human cases have been hospitalized or have died from the virus.",
      "The CDC has said there remains \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human\" spread of H5N1. There are some\u00a0past outbreaks\u00a0overseas where the agency says \"limited\" H5N1 transmission is suspected to have occurred within small clusters of people.",
      "Wild birds or poultry have now tested positive for at least one of the H5N1 strains in every state. In November,\u00a0Hawaii became the 50th state to report detecting an infected bird. Hundreds of cattle herds across at least 16 states have also tested positive for H5N1.",
      "\"While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk. The best way to protect yourself and your family from H5N1 is to avoid sources of exposure,\" Louisiana's health department said.",
      "What are the symptoms of bird flu?",
      "Bird flu has led to a wide variety of\u00a0symptoms\u00a0during recent outbreaks, including common flu symptoms like cough and vomiting. Many have also had conjunctivitis or pink eye as their only symptom, which experts suspect is from contaminated milk from cows infected by bird flu being splashed onto workers.",
      "Most of the U.S. cases have seen their symptoms resolve a median of four days after first getting sick. The majority were also treated with the antiviral oseltamivir, also known by the brand name Tamiflu, which may have helped to speed their recovery.",
      "The hospitalized child in Canada initially had conjunctivitis and fever before later developing cough, vomiting and diarrhea. She was later intubated after respiratory failure.",

      "HMPV infections are reportedly surging in China, drawing interest around the world, but Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, director of infection prevention and control at the Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas, told CBS News this week that there was no concern over a potential new pandemic.",

Preventive measures include covering the mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing, frequent handwashing, and wearing masks in crowded places.",

Unlike other recent IRS tax commissioners, Long doesn't have a depth of experience in the tax industry, nor does he have a degree in accounting or tax law.",
      "\"[Y]our lack of significant management or tax experience \u2014 and your promotion of credits that have been \"magnet[s] for fraud\" \u2014 raise serious questions about your qualifications to lead the IRS,\" Warren wrote in the letter, noting that the Senate Finance Committee will hold his confirmation hearing early this year.",

      "It comes after members of the ILA had ended a three-day walkout in October after reaching a tentative deal with the USMX that initially suspended the strike until Jan. 15. While resolving issues over pay, job security issues remained, with the union looking for guarantees that ports wouldn't use technology to replace workers.",

      "For their part, port operators and shipping companies argued that the U.S. is falling behind automated ports like those in Dubai, Rotterdam and Singapore.",
      "The stakes were high for the U.S. economy. Ports on the East and Gulf coasts handle more than half the nation's traffic in shipping containers, the steel boxes at the center of world trade, which carry everything from smartphones to fresh fruit to automobiles.",
      "Under the existing contract with the Maritime Alliance, the highest-paid dockworkers making $39 an hour, or $81,000 a year. The top hourly wage would rise to more than $60 an hour under the deal tentatively struck in October.",

That didn't include workers' share of royalties on the cargo that moves through the ports, payments that can come to thousands of dollars a year.",
      "The 10 largest U.S. ports all use some kind of automation technology to move cargo, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office\u00a0report. These include automated gates, which let trucks and containers move through cargo terminals with limited worker interaction; so-called port community systems, which are digital platforms that automatically streamline logistics and supply-chain data; and technologies used in \"internet-of-things\" systems, such as RFID, GPS and cameras, to operate equipment and track containers.",

    "summary": "After reaching a tentative deal that suspended a short strike in October, unionized dockworkers and port operators face another crucial test.",
    "story": [
      "Another possible U.S. port strike is looming later this month, which may seem like deja vu given it's only been three months since a\u00a0work stoppage\u00a0stemming from a labor dispute closed every major East and Gulf Coast port in October.",
      "While that strike ended after three days with a tentative deal between the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) and the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) that addressed some key issues, the sides face a January 15 deadline to resolve other concerns.",
      "With the union and USMX resuming negotiations on Tuesday, January 7, the specter of another port shutdown is heightening concerns among economists, businesses and policy experts. To be sure, the dockworkers and port operators could reach an agreement ahead of the deadline, which occurs just days before President-elect Donald Trump will be\u00a0inaugurated for his second term.",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "What do dockworkers do, and which parts of the job are automated?",
      "But if the union and the USMX are unable to reach a deal, more than 20,000 dockworkers could go on strike in mid-January, halting activities at ports from New York to Houston and potentially reducing the nation's economic activity by as much as $7.5 billion each week.",
      "\"[A] failure to reach an agreement and an extended strike similar to the one seen in West Coast ports in 2002 would begin to have a material financial effect on East and Gulf Coast ports,\" David Kamran, assistant vice president at Moody's Ratings, said Monday in an analysis of the simmering labor battle. \"An extended strike would not only have an adverse effect on ports but could also impact the retail sector and shipping companies.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the ongoing negotiations.",
      "Didn't the union and the shipping industry already reach a deal?",
      "Sort of. The ILA and the shipping industry, represented by the USMX, reached a tentative agreement on October 4, three days after the dockworkers went on strike. But that agreement simply delayed some parts of labor negotiations needed to reach a new contract.",
      "In some ways, the tentative contract reached in October is a boon for workers at East and Gulf Coast ports. The deal provides port workers with a 61.5% wage increase over the next six years, although that is lower than the 77% increase the union had originally sought. The negotiated increase will result in the union's highest paid workers earning $63 per hour in the final year of the contract, up from $39.",
      "But the agreement effectively kicked the can on other vital issues for dockworkers, especially related to job security.",
      "What issues remain in dispute?",
      "The key issue is the use of use of automation at ports, with dockworkers seeking to guarantee job security amid fears that technology could lead to their roles being eliminated.",
      "The 10 largest U.S. ports all use some kind of automation technology to move cargo, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office\u00a0report. These include automated gates, which let trucks and containers move through cargo terminals with limited worker interaction; so-called port community systems, which are digital platforms that automatically streamline logistics and supply-chain data; and technologies used in \"internet-of-things\" systems, such as RFID, GPS and cameras, to operate equipment and track containers.",
      "Semi-automated terminals employ people to operate machinery that moves containers from the cargo\u00a0berth\u00a0\u2014 the area where a ship is moored \u2014 to the yard. Equipment used to stack containers on top of one another is fully automated.",
      "But only three domestic ports \u2014 Long Beach Container Terminal in Long Beach, Calif., and TraPac and APM Terminal Pier 400 in Los Angeles \u2014\u00a0are fully automated. At fully automated ports, both horizontal and vertical container movement is handled by machines.

      "\"With unresolved issues around automation and job security, the outcome of these talks could significantly impact global supply chains. Earlier agreements delayed disruptions, but pressure is mounting for a lasting resolution,\" noted John Donigian, senior director of supply chain strategy at Moody's, in a Monday email.",
      "Has Trump weighed in on the issue?",
      "A wild card in the situation is the incoming presidential administration, given that Trump will be inaugurated on Jan. 20, just five days after the deadline for reaching a new labor contract.",
      "In December, Trump wrote on his social media app, Truth Social, that he had met with ILA President Harold Daggett and executive VP Dennis Daggett about automation and the impact on dockworkers, with the president-elect voicing support for the union.",
      "\"I've studied automation, and know just about everything there is to know about it,\" Trump wrote. \"The amount of money saved is nowhere near the distress, hurt and harm it causes for American Workers, in this case, our Longshoremen.\"",
      "Still, Trump could face a major port strike just as he takes office, spurring him to intervene. He could also invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act, a law that would force dockworkers back to their jobs as part of an 80-day cooling off period, although such an action could risk angering workers and some of Trump's supporters.",
      "When could a port strike begin?",
      "A port strike could begin on January, 16, shipping company Maersk is warning its customers.",
      "\"The conditional agreement on wages is set to expire on January 15. If no agreement is reached by that date, a coast-wide strike on January 16 is possible. However, the negotiations have had no new developments since our last communication,\" Maersk wrote in an advisory posted on its website on Dec. 30.",
      "How could another port strike impact the U.S. economy?",
      "The October strike had negligible economic impact because it ended after three days. By contrast, a longer strike could crimp U.S. economic activity by halting shipping at major ports along the East and Gulf Coasts.",
      "For every week a strike continues, it could reduce U.S. economic activity by between $4.5 billion and $7.5 billion, analysts at Oxford Economics said in October. Retailers would face delays in receiving goods, while shipping costs would likely rise due to the need to reroute deliveries to West Coast ports that aren't part of the negotiations.",
      "\"[A] longer strike could hurt retail profitability as there would be delay in future deliveries, with seasonal and fashion goods arriving past their peak selling period, resulting in lower sales and an increase in markdowns to clear these goods,\" noted Christina Boni, Moody's Ratings senior vice president of corporate finance, in an email.",
      "She added, \"Smaller companies with less sophisticated supply chains and planning capabilities to pivot quickly would be most at risk.\"",
      "Still, retailers, manufacturers and other companies have had months to prepare, allowing them to stockpile inventory and rejigger their supply chains to cushion the blow from a modest ports shutdown.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans continue to grapple with IRS delays that are preventing them from getting their tax refunds in a timely manner, according to a new report from the National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent watchdog that's part of the IRS.",
      "The report, published annually to highlight the IRS' most glaring problems, comes after the agency was given billions in new funding through the Inflation Reduction Act to improve its technology and go after wealthy tax cheats. Yet for many taxpayers, dealing with the IRS involves \"delays, frustration and unnecessary costs,\" the taxpayer advocate, Erin M. Collins, wrote in the report.",
      "Problems highlighted in the report echo issues that bedeviled millions of taxpayers during the pandemic, when the IRS shuttered its offices, causing many returns to get caught in a bottleneck, delaying refunds. While the worst of those issues have since been resolved, Collins noted, the IRS continues to struggle in some areas, such as processing paper returns and dealing with taxpayers who have been victims of identity theft, which can lead to lengthy refund delays.",
      "\"Notwithstanding the improvements I have described, taxpayers continue to face challenges in their dealings with the IRS,\" she wrote.",
      "The nearly $80 billion in funding from the IRA has helped the tax agency hire more workers, some of whom have bulked up its customer service support. But almost $6 out of every $10 of the new funding is directed toward enforcement, or boosting audits of wealthy tax cheats and businesses that skirt tax laws, the report noted.",
      "\"I have previously criticized this extreme imbalance in funding priorities,\" Collins wrote in the report, noting that she believes more money should be directed toward taxpayer services, an IRS unit that helps taxpayers with questions, problems and other dilemmas that arise.",
      "The IRS has already made improvements in some of the areas underscored by Collins, IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. The NTA report also acknowledges the progress the IRS has made, which Werfel said demonstrates \"what a well-funded IRS can do.\"",
      "\"It's important to continue that momentum because we recognize the agency's work isn't done \u2014not by a long shot,\" he said. \"It's vital that the IRS continue this progress to better serve taxpayers and the nation.\"",
      "Here's who is facing tax refund delays",
      "Collins reiterated one of her earlier\u00a0criticisms\u00a0of the IRS: That paper returns are the agency's \"kryptonite.\" Unfortunately, she said in her most recent return, the IRS continues to receive more than 10 million income tax returns on paper each year \u2014 while it also gets another 75 million paper forms from taxpayers.",
      "While the IRS has made progress in processing paper returns, it's still not up to snuff, she noted. Processing paper returns can still take months for the IRS to complete, she added.",
      "And many people who e-file also face delays if their 1040s are rejected, an issue that impacted 18 million taxpayers in fiscal year 2024, or 12% percent of returns, her report noted. These rejections can happen for issues like a PIN that doesn't match the prior year's return, or an adjusted gross income number that doesn't match up from the prior year.",
      "\"[M]ost rejected returns are valid, requiring taxpayers to jump through additional hoops to resubmit their returns electronically or submit the returns on paper,\" she wrote. \"Most taxpayers receive refunds, and delays in processing both paper-filed and e-filed returns translate into refund delays.\"",
      "People who have been victims of identity theft are another group that often face delays in getting resolution. About half a million taxpayers are still trying to their their issues fixed, although it took the IRS about 22 months on average to resolve the cases and send refunds to the victims, she added.",
      "That can be stressful for taxpayers waiting for their refunds, but it also creates an additional cost to the federal government, which must pay interest on overpayments it doesn't refund on a timely basis, the report pointed out.",
      "Some businesses, meanwhile, are facing delays due to the Employee Retention Credit, a tax benefit created in the pandemic to help businesses stay afloat. But the IRS has\u00a0flagged the ERC as vulnerable to fraud, leading to delays in processing returns.",
      "The IRS is \"still sitting on a backlog of about 1.2 million claims as of October 26, 2024\" for returns that claimed the Employee Retention Credit, the report said. \"Although its aim was to minimize the payment of ineligible claims, there have been lengthy delays in the payment of eligible claims submitted by employers that, in some cases, are depending on ERC refunds to remain in business.\"",
      "When does tax filing open in 2025?",
      "Tax filing typically begins at the end of January, although the IRS hasn't yet announced when it will start accepting all returns.",
      "Some taxpayers can start filing on Jan. 10, however, the IRS said on Tuesday. That's because its Free File service will start accepting returns on Friday, it noted.",
      "The IRS Free File program, which is offered through tax software companies, is available to taxpayers with adjusted gross income of $84,000 or less in 2024.",
      "It's a different service than the IRS' relatively new Direct File service, which will be available in more than 20 states this tax season, from Alaska to Wyoming.",

    "story": [
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday said the social media company is ending its fact-checking program and replacing it with a community-driven system similar to that of Elon Musk's X.",
      "Zuckerberg cited the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election as underlying the decision, calling it a \"cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritizing speech.\" Zuckerberg made the announcement in a video. \"We're going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X, starting in the U.S.\"",
      "The changes will impact Meta platforms Facebook and Instagram \u2014 which have billions of users \u2014 as well as Threads.",
      "The systems put in place to moderate its platforms make too many mistakes, Zuckerberg stated.",
      "Meta introduced its fact-checking program in\u00a02016\u00a0as part of an effort to curb misinformation. The initiative was launched in response to criticism over Facebook's role in spreading false claims during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. A 2023\u00a0statement\u00a0from Meta said the fact-checking program had \"expanded to include nearly 100 organizations working in more than 60 languages globally.\"",
      "Community trust",
      "Meta does plan to continue to moderate content related to drugs, terrorism, child exploitation, frauds and scams, Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer and Clegg's successor, wrote in a\u00a0statement\u00a0on the Meta site. Facebook's trust and safety content moderation team is also moving from California to Texas and other U.S. locations, according to the note.",
      "Kaplan also said entrusting users to effectively moderate Meta's social media platforms should benefit its content.",
      "\"We've seen this approach work on X \u2014 where they empower their community to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context, and people across a diverse range of perspectives decide what sort of context is helpful for other users to see,\" he wrote. \"We think this could be a better way of achieving our original intention of providing people with information about what they're seeing \u2014 and one that's less prone to bias.\"",
      "Meta said it would roll out its Community Notes approach over the next two month and continue refining it over the rest of the year. That will include no longer demoting content that users have fact-checked and including what Kaplan called \"a much less obtrusive label\" pointing people to additional information.",
      "Preparing for Trump",
      "The announcement came a day after Meta\u00a0said\u00a0former Ultimate Fighting Championship chief executive Dana White, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, would join its board, and shortly after former UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg\u00a0announced\u00a0he was stepping down as president of global affairs.",
      "Musk, a major supporter and financial backer of Trump during his presidential campaign, is thought to have the ear of the president-elect on issues ranging from how to slash federal spending to transportation policy.",
      "Since Trump's November victory at the polls over Kamala Harris, Meta and other major technology companies have also sought to engender goodwill with the incoming administration. In December, for example, Meta donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund, while Zuckerberg dined with him at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Such gestures seemed aimed at repairing Meta's relations with Trump, which soured after Facebook banned him from Facebook following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol in 2021, when the company ruled that his posts on the platform had helped foster the violence that day.",
      "\"Meta is repositioning the company for the incoming Trump administration,\" Jasmine Enberg, principal analyst at research firm Emarketer, said in an an email. \"The move will elate conservatives, who've often criticized Meta for censoring speech, but it will spook many liberals and advertisers, showing just how far Zuckerberg is willing to go to win Trump's approval.\"",

    "story": [
      "Unpaid medical bills will no longer appear on credit reports, where they can block people from getting mortgages, car loans or small business loans, according to a final rule announced Tuesday by the Biden administration.",
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rule will remove $49 billion in medical debt from the credit reports of more than 15 million Americans, according to the bureau, which means lenders will no longer be able to take that into consideration when deciding whether to issue a loan.",
      "The change is estimated to raise the credit scores by an average of 20 points and could lead to 22,000 additional mortgages being approved every year, according to the bureau.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement announcing the rule that it would be \"lifechanging\" for millions of families, \"making it easier for them to be approved for a car loan, a home loan, or a small-business loan. ... Our historic rule will help more Americans save money, build wealth, and thrive.\"",
      "\"No one should be denied economic opportunity because they got sick or experienced a medical emergency,\" she said.",
      "But, the Reuters news agency points out, Tuesday's announcement came despite demands from Republicans in Congress that the Biden administration stop issuing new rules with President-elect Donald Trump set to take office. That means he or his congressional allies may try to reverse the ban.",
      "\"Though Team Trump is likely to try to freeze or reverse these actions, it is not guaranteed,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen Washington Research Group, said in a report. \"Trump 2.0 is more populist than in 2017, which is why undoing a ban on including medical debt on credit reports or dropping an enforcement action against a credit bureau may not be a priority.\"",
      "Harris also announced that states and local governments have used a sweeping 2021 pandemic-era aid package to eliminate more than $1 billion in medical debt for more than 700,000 Americans.",
      "The administration announced plans for the rule in fall 2023.",

      "\"Medical debt burdens millions of families across the country and can unfairly tarnish a person's credit record, making it more difficult to qualify for an affordable loan, get a job, or even rent an apartment,\" Chuck Bell, advocacy program director for Consumer Reports, said in a statement. \"Many consumers have medical debt on their credit reports that is inaccurate or under dispute because our medical billing and insurance reimbursement system is so complex and confusing.\"",

      "The agency is suing the consumer reporting conglomerate for violating the Fair Credit Reporting Act that requires Experian and other companies take steps to ensure the information they compile is accurate and to investigate consumer complaints.",
      "\"When consumers disputed errors on their credit reports, Experian conducted sham investigations rather than properly reviewing the disputes as required by federal law,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. \"Credit reporting errors can have serious consequences for a family's finances, and it is critical that credit reporting giants follow the law.\"",
      "Specifically, the CFPB alleges that Experian is harming people by using faulty procedures in receiving information in handling consumer disputes. The company \"routinely and uncritically accepts the original furnisher's response to the disputed information, even when the response was improbable or illogical on its face, or when Experian has other information available that suggests the furnisher is unreliable.\" Experian then fails to inform consumers of its findings, and instead offers confusing and incorrect information, CFPB stated.",
      "Further, Experian reinserts inaccurate information into credit reports because it fails to match newly reported information with records of previously deleted information. Those who disputed the accuracy of an account and thought their report had been corrected instead see the same false information reappear without explanation, the agency found.",
      "The CFPB's lawsuit, filed in a U.S. District Court in California, seeks to stop the company's unlawful conduct and a civil money penalty, which would be paid into the agency's victims relief fund.",
      "Experian dismissed the agency's lawsuit as \"completely without merit\" and said it would prevail in court.",
      "\"We take great steps to ensure we investigate every consumer dispute thoroughly and go above and beyond the requirements of the law,\" the company stated.",

      "The 162-page report by the Senate Budget Committee comes as Americans continue to express outrage over the role of corporations in the U.S. healthcare system, following the December killing of the CEO of the nation's largest health insurer. And its findings add to a chorus of lawmakers trying to address the detrimental impact of private equity ownership on critical U.S. hospitals \u2014 a subject that has been the focus of a two-year CBS News investigation.",
      "\"Private equity has infected our health care system, putting patients, communities, and providers at risk,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.",
      "\"As our investigation revealed, these financial entities are putting their own profits over patients, leading to health and safety violations, chronic understaffing, and hospital closures,\" Whitehouse said.",
      "In September, another Senate committee took the extraordinary step of voting to hold Ralph de la Torre, the CEO of Steward Health Care, in contempt of Congress when he refused to appear after receiving a subpoena. CBS News has documented how he and private equity investors extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the company prior to it declaring bankruptcy last May.",
      "The Senate's latest investigation unearthed thousands of documents detailing the financial maneuvers of two private equity firms: Leonard Green & Partners and Apollo Global Management. Investigators concluded that the private equity's financial model may pose \"a threat to the nation's health care infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas.\"",
      "\"In the course of its investigation, this Committee obtained over a million pages of new documents that shine light on the business dealings of these PE-owned hospital operators and underscored concerns about the detrimental effects of PE ownership on hospitals and their patients nationwide,\" Senate investigators wrote, noting their findings should serve as a roadmap for reform.",
      "A spokesperson for Leonard Green said they haven't received the report but disagreed with the committee's findings shared by CBS News.",
      "An Apollo spokesperson said the company has invested billions in the hospital companies it's acquired, which has been used to improve facilities, expand services, upgrade technology and hire new staff.",
      "Accusations of financial mismanagement",
      "In 2010, Leonard Green & Partners acquired a California-based hospital company called Prospect Medical Holdings. As executives at Leonard Green and leadership at Prospect Medical sought to drive profits, the Senate committee documented what it said was \"overwhelming evidence of financial mismanagement\" that has led hospitals in five states to cut services or close altogether.",
      "Prospect Medical hospitals that have shut down include Delaware County Memorial in suburban Philadelphia, which closed in 2022, a year after Leonard Green shed its stake in Prospect Medical.",
      "The report noted that same year, Prospect Medical CEO Sam Lee \"invested heavily\" on upgrades to his property in Aspen, Colorado, one of two homes he owns worth a combined $20 million, according to records obtained by Senate investigators.",
      "Investigators said they also obtained documents that showed Leonard Green \"exercised significant control\" over Prospect Medical's finances and operations.",
      "In addition to holding a majority of seats on Prospect Medical's board, executives at Leonard Green granted stock options to officials at Prospect Medical for reaching financial goals, but did not provide similar incentives for \"improvements to patient quality and safety,\" the report noted.",
      "Meanwhile, Prospect Medical issued hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends to its leadership, including a $457 million payout in 2018. CBS News previously reported Lee took home about $90 million while Leonard Green shareholders were paid a total of about $275 million, payments that depleted the company's cash reserves, according to Senate investigators.",
      "\"By 2019, the company faced $2.8 billion in liabilities, underperforming hospitals and the collapse of critical healthcare services in the communities it served,\" Senate investigators wrote.",
      "The company told the Senate Budget Committee that it rejected any implication that Prospect Medical was operated in a financially irresponsible fashion, or that Leonard Green \"has put their financial interests ahead of the interests of the hospital system and the communities they serve.\"",
      "A Leonard Green spokesperson denied Prospect Medical was struggling when it exited its position, writing in a statement the company was \"in strong financial condition with access to over $500 million to support its operations.\"\u00a0 The Leonard Green spokesperson said it enabled Prospect Medical to invest in previously closed or failing hospitals.",
      "\"In the last three years' of Leonard Green's investment alone, over $200 million was invested to improve and expand hospital operations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a statement, a Prospect Medical spokesperson said the report drew false conclusions and omitted key facts.",
      "\"The Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement, noting the company has invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients.",
      "\"Nearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\"",
      "Pennsylvania recently moved to take control of Prospect Medical's hospitals in the state to prevent the company from further shutting down services. In a lawsuit filed in November, the state's attorney general alleged years of the company's mismanagement and neglect have left hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians without care.",
      "And problems at Prospect Medical's hospitals have persisted. The day after Christmas, a water main break at another suburban Philadelphia facility caused a flood, and then a fire, that forced the evacuation of 38 patients.",
      "\"Unfilled promises and underinvestment\"",
      "The Senate report also traced what investigators called \"unfilled promises and underinvestment\"\u00a0 at Ottumwa Regional Health Center, at a facility in rural Iowa operated by a hospital company owned by Apollo Capital Management.",
      "Among their most alarming findings, investigators say \"financial factors\" may have contributed to the continued employment of a male nurse who sexually assaulted at least nine female patients while they were sedated, before he died of a drug overdose.",
      "\"It was uncovered that staff were concerned about [the nurse's] behavior before his death and escalated at least some of these concerns, but no substantive actions were taken in response,\" wrote the Senate investigators, citing the cost of replacing a nurse and the lack of adequate staffing.",
      "\"The Ottumwa community has personally felt the impact of private equity on their health care system,\" said Grassley. \"The diminishing quality of care, service availability and care capacity at the hospital is forcing Ottumwa residents to travel significant distances in order to receive appropriate treatment.\"",
      "According to the report, Apollo told the committee that rural hospitals \"have faced challenges for decades, in part driven by underinvestment,\" and that it planned to do \"the opposite by investing in and supporting companies\" like the one that operates Ottumwa.",
      "In a statement, an Apollo spokesperson told CBS News that as a result of its investments, quality of care has improved and the hospital company it owns has not had to close a single facility.",
      "Yet, the committee said its findings reflected continued underinvestment. The report alleges Apollo and its partners failed to meet certain legally binding commitments since they acquired the hospital in 2015, including maintaining access to services, establishing and implementing an outpatient substance abuse treatment program, and continuing its charity care obligations.",
      "\"Regardless of the challenges in running rural hospitals, Apollo has profited immensely from its ownership of the portfolio of hospitals that contains [Ottumwa], while failing to make committed and necessary investments at [Ottumwa],\" the Senate investigators wrote, noting the hospital was one of about 220 U.S. hospitals operated by hospital companies owned by Apollo.",

      "President Biden on Sunday signed legislation expanding Social Security benefits for millions of retired Americans, including firefighters, police officers and teachers.",
      "\"Americans who have worked hard all their life to make an honest living should be able to retire with economic security and dignity,\" Mr. Biden told a gathering at the White House before signing the Social Security Fairness Act, which he said would mean an average monthly increase of $360 for more than 2.5 million Social Security recipients.",
      "\"That's a big deal in middle-class households like the one I grew up in and many of you did,\" the president added.",
      "Those beneficiaries will also receive a lump sum in the thousands of dollars to make up for the shortfall in benefits they should have received in 2024, the president said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act\u00a0eliminates two federal policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program and that reduced benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "\"Biden is the first president in more than 20 years to expand Social Security benefits,\" a White House spokesperson said in a statement. \"The bill he is signing today will expand benefits by hundreds of dollars per month for more than 2.5 million Americans.\"",
      "Among those who joined Mr. Biden at the signing ceremony was 17-year-old Eliseo Jimenez, who\u00a0walked from his home in Lubbock, Texas, to Washington, D.C. over 40 days during the summer to raise funds for his charity to help those with disabilities and senior citizens.

House lawmakers approved the bill, known as H.R. 82, in November.",

      "The benefits hike under the new law would be retroactive to December 2023. As a result, eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",
      "Specifically, the new Social Security law repeals policies known as the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which together act to reduce Social Security payments to 2.5 million retirees.",

      "The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimated in September that eliminating the WEP would increase monthly payments to affected Social Security recipients by an average of $360 by December 2025, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Scrapping the GPO would increase monthly benefits in December 2025 by an average of $700 for 380,000 recipients getting benefits based on living spouses, the agency found. The increase would amount to an average of $1,190 for 390,000 or surviving spouses getting a widow or widower benefit.",

    "summary": "Only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis within three years, a report found.",
    "story": [
      "When Michael Adams was researching health insurance options in 2023, he had one very specific requirement: coverage for prosthetic limbs.",
      "Adams, 51, lost his right leg to cancer 40 years ago, and he has worn out more legs than he can count. He picked a gold plan on the Colorado health insurance marketplace that covered prosthetics, including microprocessor-controlled knees like the one he has used for many years. That function adds stability and helps prevent falls.",
      "But when his leg needed replacing last January after about five years of everyday use, his new marketplace health plan wouldn't authorize it. The roughly $50,000 leg with the electronically controlled knee wasn't medically necessary, the insurer said, even though Colorado law leaves that determination up to the patient's doctor, and his has prescribed a version of that leg for many years, starting when he had employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "\"The electronic prosthetic knee is life-changing,\" said Adams, who lives in Lafayette, Colorado, with his wife and two kids. Without it, \"it would be like going back to having a wooden leg like I did when I was a kid.\" The microprocessor in the knee responds to different surfaces and inclines, stiffening up if it detects movement that indicates its user is falling.",
      "People who need surgery to replace a joint typically don't encounter similar coverage roadblocks. In 2021, 1.5 million knee or hip joint replacements were performed in United States hospitals and hospital-owned ambulatory facilities, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, or AHRQ. The median price for a total hip or knee replacement without complications at top orthopedic hospitals was just over $68,000 in 2020, according to one analysis, though health plans often negotiate lower rates.",
      "Coverage disparity among plans",
      "To people in the amputee community, the coverage disparity amounts to discrimination.",
      "\"Insurance covers a knee replacement if it's covered with skin, but if it's covered with plastic, it's not going to cover it,\" said Jeffrey Cain, a family physician and former chair of the board of the Amputee Coalition, an advocacy group. Cain wears two prosthetic legs, having lost his after an airplane accident nearly 30 years ago.",
      "AHIP, a trade group for health plans, said health plans generally provide coverage when the prosthetic is determined to be medically necessary, such as to replace a body part or function for walking and day-to-day activity.\u00a0In practice, though, prosthetic coverage by private health plans varies tremendously, said Ashlie White, chief strategy and programs officer at the Amputee Coalition. Even though coverage for basic prostheses may be included in a plan, \"often insurance companies will put caps on the devices and restrictions on the types of devices approved,\" White said.",
      "An estimated\u00a02.3 million\u00a0people are living with limb loss in the U.S., according to an analysis by Avalere, a health care consulting company. That number is expected to as much as\u00a0double\u00a0in coming years as people age and a growing number lose limbs to diabetes, trauma, and other medical problems.",
      "Fewer than half of people with limb loss have been prescribed a prosthesis, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0by the AHRQ. Plans may deny coverage for prosthetic limbs by claiming they aren't medically necessary or are experimental devices, even though microprocessor-controlled knees like Adams' have been in use for decades.",
      "\"Insurance fairness\" laws",
      "Cain was instrumental in getting passed a 2000 Colorado law that requires insurers to cover prosthetic arms and legs at parity with Medicare, which requires coverage with a 20% coinsurance payment. Since that measure was enacted, about\u00a0half\u00a0of states have passed \"insurance fairness\" laws that require prosthetic coverage on par with other covered medical services in a plan or laws that require coverage of prostheses that enable people to do sports. But these laws apply only to plans regulated by the state. Over half of people with private coverage are in plans not governed by state law.",
      "The Medicare program's 80% coverage of prosthetic limbs mirrors its coverage for other services. Still, an October report by the Government Accountability Office found that only 30% of beneficiaries who lost a limb in 2016 received a prosthesis in the following three years.",
      "Cost is a factor for many people.",
      "\"No matter your coverage, most people have to pay something on that device,\" White said. As a result, \"many people will be on a payment plan for their device,\" she said. Some may take out loans.",
      "The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has proposed a rule that would prohibit lenders from repossessing medical devices such as wheelchairs and prosthetic limbs if people can't repay their loans.",
      "\"It is a replacement limb,\" said White, whose organization has heard of several cases in which lenders have repossessed wheelchairs or prostheses. Repossession is \"literally a punishment to the individual.\"",
      "Adams ultimately owed a coinsurance payment of about $4,000 for his new leg, which reflected his portion of the insurer's negotiated rate for the knee and foot portion of the leg but did not include the costly part that fits around his stump, which didn't need replacing. The insurer approved the prosthetic leg on appeal, claiming it had made an administrative error, Adams said.",
      "\"We're fortunate that we're able to afford that 20%,\" said Adams, who is a self-employed leadership consultant.",
      "Leah Kaplan doesn't have that financial flexibility. Born without a left hand, she did not have a prosthetic limb until a few years ago.",
      "Growing up, \"I didn't want more reasons to be stared at,\" said Kaplan, 32, of her decision not to use a prosthesis. A few years ago, the cycling enthusiast got a prosthetic hand specially designed for use with her bike. That device was covered under the health plan she has through her county government job in Spokane, Washington, helping developmentally disabled people transition from school to work.",
      "But when she tried to get approval for a prosthetic hand to use for everyday activities, her health plan turned her down. The myoelectric\u00a0hand\u00a0she requested would respond to electrical impulses in her arm that would move the hand to perform certain actions. Without insurance coverage, the hand would cost her just over $46,000, which she said she can't afford.",
      "Working with her doctor, she has appealed the decision to her insurer and been denied three times. Kaplan said she's still not sure exactly what the rationale is, except that the insurer has questioned the medical necessity of the prosthetic hand. The next step is to file an appeal with an independent review organization certified by the state insurance commissioner's office.",
      "A prosthetic hand is not a luxury device, Kaplan said. The prosthetic clinic has ordered the hand and made the customized socket that will fit around the end of her arm. But until insurance coverage is sorted out, she can't use it.",
      "At this point she feels defeated. \"I've been waiting for this for so long,\" Kaplan said."

      "That encompasses people who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also rescind a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.

      "The Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",

      "Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act take effect?",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation is retroactive for Social Security payments starting in January 2024, according to the\u00a0text\u00a0of the bill. That means eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago.",

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 08:51:19 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department told a federal appeals court that the portion of special counsel Jack Smith's report on his investigation involving the 2020 election should be released to the public.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department urged a federal appeals court in Atlanta on Wednesday to clear the way for the release of a portion of special counsel Jack Smith's report detailing his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "In court documents filed with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, the government wrote that Attorney General Merrick Garland has determined not to release the volume of Smith's report that deals with the classified documents case, so long as criminal proceedings involving co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos de Oliveira are pending.",
      "Garland does, however, plan to submit to Congress and the public the first volume of Smith's report, which relates to his investigation and prosecution of Trump stemming from the 2020 presidential election.",
      "\"Because the Attorney General has determined not to release to the public Volume Two of the Final Report to the public while defendants' case remains pending\u2014the volume that concerns the proceedings against defendants\u2014an injunction is unnecessary,\" prosecutors wrote, urging the 11th Circuit to deny the emergency request for an injunction.",
      "They noted that Smith sent his report to Garland on Tuesday and wrote in a cover letter to the attorney general that the portion involving Nauta and de Oliveira should not be released to the public while their cases are pending.",
      "Garland on Wednesday sent a letter formally informing the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary committees that Smith was finished with his probe, had completed the report and the report was ready for release. Garland reiterated that he would not do so unless and until the courts clear the way, and that even if they do, he would not release the volume related to the classified documents probe because of pending cases.",
      "Justice Department lawyers said a redacted version of the second volume of the report \u2014 involving the alleged mishandling of classified documents \u2014 would be made available for review only by the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees at their request, and if they agree not to release the information publicly.",
      "\"This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the department while safeguarding defendants' interests,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "The filing responded to an effort by Trump's former co-defendants, aide Nauta and former Mar-a-Lago employee de Oliveria, to stop the report's release. They argued their cases would be prejudiced by the release of the special counsel's report as the appeals of their cases continue.",
      "In a subsequent filing to the 11th Circuit, lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira asked the appeals court to send the dispute back to District Judge Aileen Cannon's court\u00a0for a hearing and, in the meantime, stop Garland and the Justice Department from issuing Smith's final report.",
      "\"A hearing is necessary to prevent overreach of the federal government to serve political aims at the expense of the individual's right to a fair trial,\" lawyers for Nauta and de Oliveira wrote.",
      "Allowing leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to see the second volume of the report \"reflects an improper attempt to remove from the district court the responsibility to oversee and control the flow of information related to a criminal trial over which it presides, and to place that role instead in the hands of the prosecuting authority \u2014 who unlike the trial court has a vested interest in furthering its own narrative of culpability,\" they said.",
      "Defense attorneys earlier this week simultaneously asked the appeals court and Cannon, who oversaw and dismissed the Trump classified documents case, to block Smith and Garland from publicly releasing a summary of the special counsel's findings. Cannon issued an order on Tuesday, temporarily enjoining the Justice Department\u00a0from publishing the report until the 11th Circuit decides the matter.",
      "The ongoing litigation is part of a bid by Trump and his allies to prevent federal prosecutors from releasing the contents of Smith's report. Smith revealed he has prepared a two-volume report to present to the attorney general, which prosecutors said was submitted Tuesday evening. Garland has pledged to release to the public all special counsel reports completed under his tenure and has so far stood by that promise, including after an investigation related to President Biden's handling of classified records.",
      "Smith led two now-defunct investigations into the president-elect, one tied to his alleged efforts to resist the peaceful transfer of power and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and another based on accusations that Trump unlawfully retained sensitive government records after he left office in 2021. The probes resulted in criminal indictments against Trump, which have since been dismissed. Trump initially pleaded not guilty and denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The special counsel and his office withdrew from the case after the 11th Circuit agreed to dismiss the appeal as it pertains to Trump following his election to a second term in November. It is now being overseen by the U.S. attorney in South Florida and other Justice Department lawyers.",
      "Still, Trump's attorneys urged Garland to remove Smith from his position and put a stop to the report's release, according to a letter included in court documents on Monday.",
      "\"Because Smith has proposed an unlawful course of action, you must countermand his plan and remove him promptly. If Smith is not removed, then the handling of his report should be deferred to President Trump's incoming attorney general, consistent with the expressed will of the People,\" Trump's attorneys wrote.",
      "But prosecutors told the 11th Circuit in their filing that the president-elect has not made any requests to the appeals court and \"would have no basis to seek to block the public release of Volume One of the final report,\" which deals with the investigation and prosecution arising from the alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.",
      "In the classified documents case, Trump was charged alongside Nauta and de Oliveira in an alleged scheme to obstruct the federal probe. Both men pleaded not guilty.",
      "Smith ultimately dropped his bids to prosecute Trump, citing Justice Department rules that forbid the prosecution of a sitting president. But he opted to continue with an appeal of Cannon's decision to dismiss the case against Nauta and de Oliveira to overturn the finding that the special counsel was unlawfully appointed.",
      "The defendants, as a result, sought to stop the release as the case proceeded.",
      "During a press conference on Tuesday, Trump slammed Smith as a \"bad guy\" and complimented Cannon, whom he appointed to the federal bench during his first term, as a \"brilliant judge.\"",

      "Billy Long, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run the IRS, is facing questions about his qualifications to lead the tax agency from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts who serves on the Senate's Finance Committee.",
      "While serving as a representative, Long, a Republican from Missouri and a former auctioneer,\u00a0co-sponsored legislation\u00a0that aimed to wipe out much of the tax code. After leaving office, he served as a tax adviser to businesses seeking to employ a controversial tax credit, the Employee Retention Tax Credit, or ERTC.",
      "In her Jan. 9 letter to Long, Warren raises questions about Long's tax expertise as well as his promotion of the ERTC, which has been\u00a0flagged\u00a0by the IRS for its high rate of fraud. Unlike other recent IRS tax commissioners, Long doesn't have a depth of experience in the tax industry, nor does he have a degree in accounting or tax law.",
      "\"[Y]our lack of significant management or tax experience \u2014 and your promotion of credits that have been \"magnet[s] for fraud\" \u2014 raise serious questions about your qualifications to lead the IRS,\" Warren wrote in the letter, noting that the Senate Finance Committee will hold his confirmation hearing early this year.",
      "The Trump campaign and Long didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "In a 2023 podcast, Long talked about his work with a firm called Lifetime Advisors, where he helped promote the ERTC to businesses, although Warren's letter notes that the podcast appears to have been \"pulled down from multiple podcast platforms, including the Listen Notes website, Apple, Spotify and YouTube.\"",
      "In the podcast, which CBS MoneyWatch listened to in December before it was taken down, Long said qualifying for credit was difficult during its first iteration, but that he helped make it easier for businesses to be eligible while he was in Congress.",
      "\"We went from having to say COVID adversely affected your business definitely, to taking that away, and you don't have to prove that you had any downturn,\" he said. \"We're doing recoveries for folks that had their best two years ever during COVID.\"",
      "In the letter, Warren asks Long to provide information about his work with the ERTC, including whether any returns he had worked on claiming the credit have been challenged by the IRS. Among the senator's other queries are whether Long directed anyone to pull down the 2023 podcast, and how he earned the designation of \"certified tax & business adviser,\" a term that he has used to describe himself on his X profile.",
      "\"Although you bill yourself as a 'Certified Business and Tax Adviser,' this certification appears to only require a three-day training,\" Warren noted. \"There is no record of you on the IRS' database of tax return preparers \u2014 a searchable directory that lists individuals who hold credentials recognized by the IRS \u2014 nor do you appear in the Missouri Board of Accountancy database.\"",

      "Standing before a 17th-century world map in her daily press briefing, Sheinbaum proposed dryly that North America should be renamed \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" or \"Mexican America,\" because a founding document dating from 1814 that preceded Mexico's constitution referred to it that way.",
      "\"That sounds nice, no?\" she added with a sarcastic tone. She also noted that the Gulf of Mexico had been named that way since 1607.",

      "Trump ally Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she would introduce\u00a0legislation\u00a0to that effect on Thursday morning.",
      "The exchange has started to answer a larger question lingering over the bilateral relationship between the two regional powers: How would newly elected Sheinbaum handle Trump's strong-handed diplomatic approach, and promises of mass-deportations and crippling taxes on trading partners like Mexico?",
      "Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 who hailed from a similar strain of class populism as Trump, even though he leaned left \u2013 was able to build a relationship with Trump as an ally, and his government began to block migrants from going north under U.S. pressure, a boon to Trump.",
      "But it was unclear if Mexico's first woman president, a scientist and leftist lacking the folksy populism that rocketed L\u00f3pez Obrador into power, would be able to build the same relationship.",
      "While Wednesday's joke quickly ricocheted across social media feeds, it also set the tone for what a Sheinbaum-Trump relationship could look like in the coming years.",
      "\"Humor can be a good tactic, it projects strength, which is what Trump responds to. It was probably the right choice on this issue,\" said Brian Winter, vice president of the New York-based Council of the Americas. \"Although President Sheinbaum knows it won't work on everything - Trump and his administration will demand serious engagement from Mexico on the big issues of immigration, drugs and trade.\"",
      "It comes after other stern but collaborative responses by Sheinbaum regarding Trump's proposals.",
      "On Trump's pitch to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican imports, Sheinbaum warned that if the new U.S. administration imposes tariffs on Mexico, her administration would respond with similar measures. She said any sort of tax was \"not acceptable and would cause inflation and job losses for the United States and Mexico.\"",
      "She's taken a more concessionary tone on immigration, falling in line with years of Mexican efforts to block migrants from traveling north amid mounting pressure by the U.S.",
      "After originally saying her government would push the Trump administration to deport migrants directly back to their own countries, in January she said Mexico would be open to accepting deportees from other countries, but Mexico could limit it to certain nationalities or request compensation.",
      "Canada also gave a sarcastic response this week to Trump's recent comments about annexing America's northern neighbor. According to Canada's CTV News, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was questioned by a reporter on Monday about Trump's multi-prong threats to\u00a0impose a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico\u00a0in the first hours of his presidency, as well as making Canada the \"51st state.\"",

He owes $578,752.92 as per his plea deal, including $373,749.97 in restitution and $205,002.97 in forfeiture. He is expected to go to prison for at least two years when he is sentenced, although the judge previously said the estimated sentencing range was between 6-8 years.",
      "In a letter to a judge last Friday, Santos' attorneys said their client is required to pay more than $200,000 in forfeiture money 30 days before he is sentenced.

The Justice Department, in announcing Mazza's plea agreement, said that he had \"brought a Taurus revolver, loaded with three shotgun shells and two hollow point bullets, into Washington, D.C., to the Ellipse, and then to the Capitol,\" adding that He \"later admitted to law enforcement that he was also armed with a second firearm, a loaded .40 semi-automatic pistol.\"",
      "However, at some point before 2:45 p.m. that day, according to the Justice Department, \"Mazza lost possession of the revolver.\" Mazza was sentenced to five years in prison for carrying a gun and assaulting police officers.",

The Justice Department, in announcing the verdict, said evidence was presented at trial that Mares and others had traveled from Texas to Virginia just before Jan. 6, 2021, \"carrying with them various firearms, including both handguns and rifles, as well as ammunition,\" according to a Justice Department news release.",
      "\"On the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, Mares and others with him attended the rally on the National Mall carrying their handguns on their persons but having left their rifles in Mares' truck,\" the release said. \"Afterward, Mares and others walked down toward the U.S. Capitol building between approximately 12:15 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., entered the restricted permitter, and remained on U.S. Capitol grounds until approximately 4:30 p.m., all while carrying their handguns.\"",
      "The Justice Department said \"an individual with Mares posted to social media a photograph of six firearms, magazines, and the hats that appear to have been worn by Mares and others that day on Capitol grounds.\" In the photo, the weapons and hats were shown arrayed across what appears to be a bed at a hotel.",
      "Prosecutors also alleged that Mares had posted on social media that he \"'believe[d] that every #patriot should on January 6 if you can't make it to Washington DC you should go to your state capitol and local mayors offices heavily armed and drag out and either jail or execute all the known CORRUPT #politicans for treason!'\" among other similar sentiments.\"",
      "And in one of the first wave of Jan. 6 criminal cases, Lonnie Coffman was accused by the government of driving from Alabama to Washington, D.C., in a pickup truck that \"contained several loaded firearms within arms-reach of the driver's seat,\" including a 9mm Hi-Point handgun, a Windham Weaponry rifle and a Hatfield Gun Company SAS shotgun, according to the statement of offense.",
      "The pickup also contained \"hundreds of rounds of ammunition, large-capacity ammunition feeding devices, a crossbow with bolts, machetes, camouflage smoke devices, a stun gun, cloth rags, lighters, a cooler containing eleven mason jars, and other items.\" And the government also said that as Coffman walked through D.C., and \"in the direction\" of the U.S. Capitol and the rally on the national mall on Jan. 6, \"he knowingly carried on his person two additional loaded firearms.\"",
      "Coffman pleaded guilty to a federal charge of possession of an unregistered firearm and agreed to cooperate with the government on other cases.",

    "story": [
      "Private equity firms that invest in hospitals will now face increased oversight in Massachusetts under a new law signed by Gov. Maura Healey on Wednesday, after the scandal-plagued ownership of nine hospitals in the state exposed significant risks to patient care.",
      "The new law would increase transparency in the opaque financial dealings between hospitals and investment groups that own them. Healey signed it right before the close of the year's state legislative session.",
      "The law will increase financial penalties for hospitals, private equity investors, real estate investment trusts and other entities for failing to submit required financial reporting to the state on time. Fines for not submitting information on time will soar from $1,000 to $25,000 per week, and the law also removes the annual cap of $50,000.",
      "The attorney general's office and Massachusetts Health Policy Commission will also gain more investigative power over private equity deals and the commission will have the power to demand testimony regarding pricing, financial stability and ownership structure from private equity investors and healthcare real estate trusts.",
      "The law comes as a victory for the state after two hospitals closed last year when their owner, Dallas-based Steward Health Care, declared bankruptcy. Steward, which owned more than 30 hospitals across the country, was one of the state's largest hospital operators.",
      "For two years, CBS News has been investigating the detrimental impact that private equity ownership can have on U.S. hospitals \u2014 especially those serving areas of high need and few resources. While\u00a0Steward's hospitals\u00a0struggled, CBS News found evidence of lavish spending by CEO Ralph de la Torre, including the purchase of a $40 million yacht in 2021, a $7 million Texas horse ranch in 2022, and two corporate jets valued at $95 million.",
      "Healy said at a news conference that the new law will \"close loopholes in our regulatory processes so that for-profit providers like Steward Health Care are subject to the same transparency rules as nonprofit providers.\" She added, \"as attorney general, I spent years in court trying to hold Steward to this standard, and I'm glad that our laws will no longer be exploited in this way.\"",
      "The law will also bar the Department of Public Health from granting a license to establish or maintain an acute care hospital that has leased its main campus from a real estate investment trust \u2014 a strategy favored by the private equity industry that Steward used to siphon money away from direct patient care.",
      "\"Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,\" said state House Speaker Ronald J. Mariano during the news conference. \"That's why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.\"",
      "CBS News reached out Steward Health Care regarding the new legislation, and a representative said the company has no comment.",
      "Earlier this week, the U.S. Senate Budget Committee released a scathing 162-page report on two private equity firms' efforts to wring profits out of other hospital companies in underserved communities that put patients in danger.",
      "\"As our investigation revealed, these financial entities are putting their own profits over patients, leading to health and safety violations, chronic understaffing, and hospital closures,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to intervene in his \"hush money\" case in New York ahead of his scheduled sentencing Friday.",
      "In a\u00a0request for emergency relief filed with the Supreme Court, the president-elect asked the justices to temporarily block further criminal proceedings in New York state court, including his upcoming sentencing, before he takes office. Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records last summer and is scheduled to be sentenced on Friday at 9:30 a.m.",
      "Trump's bid comes after a New York appeals court on Tuesday rejected his latest effort to postpone his sentencing. His lawyers have argued that a president's immunity from criminal proceedings extends to the transition period \u2014 the time between the election and inauguration.",
      "In addition to asking the Supreme Court to enter a stay, Trump's lawyers said in the Wednesday morning filing that they had simultaneously asked the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, to block the proceedings. The New York filing was made at about 4 p.m., a court spokesperson said.",
      "In their submission to the Supreme Court, Trump's lawyers argued that the justices should step in and pause his sentencing \"to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency and the operations of the federal government.\" During the transition, they wrote, the president-elect is engaging in the \"extraordinarily demanding task of preparing to assume the executive power of the United States.\"",
      "The president-elect's effort to toss out the jury verdict \"will ultimately result in the dismissal of the District Attorney's politically motivated prosecution that was flawed from the very beginning, centered around the wrongful actions and false claims of a disgraced, disbarred serial-liar former attorney, violated President Trump's due process rights, and had no merit,\" predicted lawyer D. John Sauer, who Trump selected to serve as solicitor general in his next term.",
      "A spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said his office \"will respond in court papers.\"",
      "Trump became the first former president to be convicted of crimes when a jury found him guilty of 34 state felony counts in late May and concluded he authorized a scheme to falsify records related to reimbursements for a $130,000 \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star before the 2016 presidential election.",
      "The investigation that led to the New York charges against Trump began in 2018 and has already produced a landmark Supreme Court decision. The court ruled in July 2020 that the Manhattan district attorney had the power to subpoena Trump's tax records as part of its criminal probe. Trump continued to fight against their release until after his first presidency in 2021, but the Supreme Court rejected his subsequent efforts to shield the financial records from prosecutors.",
      "He was set to be sentenced July 11, but the proceedings were postponed after the Supreme Court issued a landmark decision finding former presidents cannot be federally prosecuted for official actions taken while in office. The ruling stemmed from a different case involving Trump brought by special counsel Jack Smith, which arose out of his alleged efforts to stay in power after the 2020 election. Charges in that case have since been dropped, as Justice Department policy prohibits the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "Trump's sentencing was then set for Sept. 18, but was pushed back again to avoid interfering with the presidential campaign. After Trump was elected to a second term in early November, a Nov. 26 hearing was then delayed as the president-elect and Manhattan prosecutors argued over how to proceed with the case.",
      "New York Justice Juan Merchan then issued an order last week setting Trump's sentencing for Jan. 10, just 10 days before his inauguration. The New York judge said he does not intend to sentence the president-elect to incarceration and is allowing him to appear virtually instead of in person.",
      "But Trump's lawyers have said that the sentencing is set to take place as he is preparing to return to the White House and would compromise his ability to conduct an orderly transition. During this time, Sauer wrote, the president-elect is communicating with world leaders, setting his domestic and foreign policy agenda and coordinating with the outgoing Biden administration across federal agencies.",
      "\"Forcing President Trump to prepare for a criminal sentencing in a felony case while he is preparing to lead the free world as president of the United States in less than two weeks imposes an intolerable, unconstitutional burden on him that undermines these vital national interests,\" Trump's legal team wrote.",

      "The U.S. government has filed a\u00a0motion\u00a0seeking to stop a military tribunal from accepting the plea agreements offered to three men accused of planning the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, including alleged mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.",
      "The Justice Department filed its motion in the Washington, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday, asking the court to prohibit the war tribunal in Guantanamo Bay from moving forward with the plea agreements negotiated last summer. Government attorneys also asked the appeals court to stay the proceedings \u2014 including a plea hearing for the attacks' alleged mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed set for Friday \u2014 while the request is considered.",
      "\"The allegations against the respondents set forth their extensive roles as the counselors, commanders, and conspirators in the murder of 2,976 people, the injury of numerous civilians and military personnel, and the destruction of property worth tens of billions of dollars,\" the filing said, arguing later that \"this Court should issue a writ of mandamus and prohibition to the military commission directing it to recognize that the Secretary validly withdrew from the pretrial agreements with the respondents and prohibiting the military commission from conducting hearings in which the respondents would enter guilty pleas pursuant to the invalid pretrial agreements.\"",
      "Last summer, Mohammed, and two other defendants reached deals that would have enabled them to plead guilty to their alleged roles in the 9/11 attacks in exchange for allowing them to avoid the death penalty.",
      "Shortly afterwards, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin tried to revoke the deals, saying in a memo that \"in light of the significance\" of the decision, he alone should have the authority to approve the plea deals instead of a subordinate authority, who accepted the deals.",
      "The judge in the 9/11 case and then a military appeals court ruled against Austin and said he had weighed in too late. Following the decision by the military appeals court, the Defense Department said it was considering its options and whether to go to a higher court, as it now has.",
      "There are two other defendants in the case, but one hasn't negotiated a plea deal, and the other has been ruled mentally unfit to stand trial.",
      "According to the motion filed Tuesday, the plea agreements, which are still under seal, would have the three defendants plead guilty to the seven charges against them that include murder, conspiracy and terrorism as well as an eighth charge, intentionally causing serious bodily injury.",
      "When asked in November about why he had tried earlier in the year to revoke the plea deals, Austin said, \"I thought at that point in time that it was important enough that I should be the person to make the decision on this. And I still feel that same way. Again, I won't comment on anything that could happen in the future, but again I will just emphasize that I still feel the same way.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government will issue refunds to tens of thousands of unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens who applied for a Biden administration program that was struck down in federal court, according to internal government documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, plans to refund the $580 application fee that roughly 94,000 people paid in hopes of benefiting from the Biden administration policy, dubbed Keeping Families Together. The refunds amount to about $55 million, the documents show.",
      "Announced in June by President Biden, the initiative offered an estimated half a million unauthorized immigrants a chance to get temporary legal status and a streamlined path to permanent residency, if they were married to U.S. citizens and had lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years without committing serious crimes. But a federal judge halted the policy almost immediately after it took effect in late August, agreeing with Republican-led states that argued the program flouted U.S. immigration law.",
      "Even if the initiative had survived the legal challenge mounted by Republican state officials, it still would've been in the crosshairs of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised to reverse Biden administration immigration policies and oversee mass deportations.",
      "The Keeping Families Together policy was designed to help some longstanding unauthorized immigrants, a population progressive activists argued had been ignored amid the Biden administration's focus on handling the record numbers of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.",
      "While marrying a U.S. citizen generally leads to a green card, American immigration law requires those who entered the country illegally to leave and reenter legally to qualify for permanent residency. Undocumented immigrants, however, can be banned from the U.S. for 10 years upon leaving if they have lived in the country unlawfully for a certain period of time.",
      "The program would have allowed eligible applicants to apply for a green card without having to leave the country, by granting them an immigration classification known as parole that effectively cancels out an illegal entry and provides temporary work permits.",
      "In addition to the spouses of American citizens, the program would have also benefited an estimated 50,000 undocumented stepchildren of U.S. citizens.",
      "Reached for comment, USCIS confirmed it would close pending applications and issue refunds to applicants.",
      "\"The court order vacating the [Keeping Families Together] process has resulted in requestors paying a fee for an immigration benefit request that, through no fault of their own, cannot be considered,\" the agency said in a statement, noting it determined the refunds were \"in the public interest and consistent with applicable law.\"",

      "The Laken Riley Act\u00a0would require the Department of Homeland Security to take into custody undocumented immigrants who have been charged with theft and other crimes. The legislation is named for Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was murdered by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant last year. A judge convicted the man, Jose Ibarra, on murder and other charges related to Riley's death in November.",
      "\"As promised, we're starting today with border security,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said ahead of the vote Tuesday, adding that lawmakers have \"a lot to do there to fix it\" and noting that the Laken Riley Act \"is a big part of that.\"",
      "In a 264 to 159 vote, the House approved the measure, with all voting Republicans and 48 Democrats supporting its passage.",
      "The legislation also includes a provision that would empower state attorneys general who claim their state or its residents have been harmed by immigration policies to sue the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "The House approved the legislation in March, with 37 House Democrats joining Republicans in support of its passage. But the bill stalled in the then-Democratic-controlled Senate.",
      "Johnson encouraged more Democrats to join Republicans this time around, saying the vote would be \"telling.\"",
      "\"We're going to detain and deport illegal aliens who commit burglary, theft, larceny, shoplifting, certainly vicious and violent crimes, and I can't believe anybody would be opposed to that,\" Johnson said.",
      "Riley's story became a rallying cry for the GOP during the lead-up to the 2024 election, while Democrats accused Republicans of using her death for political purposes.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said ahead of the vote Tuesday that \"the murder of Laken Riley was an unspeakable and appalling crime,\" but he called the bill \"an empty and opportunistic measure.\" Raskin said the legislation \"fails to address any of the real issues at stake,\" while criticizing Republicans for walking away from a bipartisan border security deal last year when President-elect Donald Trump \"aggressively tanked\" the legislation.",
      "The Maryland Democrat argued that the bill would upend decades of policy by requiring that an undocumented immigrant be detained \"even if they are never convicted or even charged with a crime,\" calling it a \"radical departure\" from current law.",
      "Still, this time around, the bill is seeing more bipartisan support. Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania became the first Senate Democrat to sign on as a cosponsor in the GOP-controlled upper chamber this week, where a vote is expected on Friday.",
      "\"Laken Riley's story is a tragic reminder of what's at stake when our systems fail to protect people,\" Fetterman said in a statement, noting that while he says immigration \"makes our country great,\" he's supportive of giving authorities tools to \"prevent tragedies like this one while we work on comprehensive solutions to our broken system.\"",
      "Republicans have pledged to make border security a key priority as they prepare to hold a GOP trifecta in Washington when Trump returns to the White House later this month.",

    "story": [
      "Two private equity firms' efforts to wring profits out of hospitals in underserved communities put patients in danger, according to a new report released Tuesday by a powerful Senate committee.",
      "The 162-page report by the Senate Budget Committee comes as Americans continue to express outrage over the role of corporations in the U.S. healthcare system, following the December killing of the CEO of the nation's largest health insurer. And its findings add to a chorus of lawmakers trying to address the detrimental impact of private equity ownership on critical U.S. hospitals \u2014 a subject that has been the focus of a two-year CBS News investigation.",
      "\"Private equity has infected our health care system, putting patients, communities, and providers at risk,\" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island who led the investigation with Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.",
      "\"As our investigation revealed, these financial entities are putting their own profits over patients, leading to health and safety violations, chronic understaffing, and hospital closures,\" Whitehouse said.",
      "In September, another Senate committee took the extraordinary step of voting to hold Ralph de la Torre, the CEO of Steward Health Care, in contempt of Congress when he refused to appear after receiving a subpoena. CBS News has documented how he and private equity investors extracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the company prior to it declaring bankruptcy last May.",
      "The Senate's latest investigation unearthed thousands of documents detailing the financial maneuvers of two private equity firms: Leonard Green & Partners and Apollo Global Management. Investigators concluded that the private equity's financial model may pose \"a threat to the nation's health care infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas.\"",
      "\"In the course of its investigation, this Committee obtained over a million pages of new documents that shine light on the business dealings of these PE-owned hospital operators and underscored concerns about the detrimental effects of PE ownership on hospitals and their patients nationwide,\" Senate investigators wrote, noting their findings should serve as a roadmap for reform.",
      "A spokesperson for Leonard Green said they haven't received the report but disagreed with the committee's findings shared by CBS News.",
      "An Apollo spokesperson said the company has invested billions in the hospital companies it's acquired, which has been used to improve facilities, expand services, upgrade technology and hire new staff.",
      "Accusations of financial mismanagement",
      "In 2010, Leonard Green & Partners acquired a California-based hospital company called Prospect Medical Holdings. As executives at Leonard Green and leadership at Prospect Medical sought to drive profits, the Senate committee documented what it said was \"overwhelming evidence of financial mismanagement\" that has led hospitals in five states to cut services or close altogether.",
      "Prospect Medical hospitals that have shut down include Delaware County Memorial in suburban Philadelphia, which closed in 2022, a year after Leonard Green shed its stake in Prospect Medical.",
      "The report noted that same year, Prospect Medical CEO Sam Lee \"invested heavily\" on upgrades to his property in Aspen, Colorado, one of two homes he owns worth a combined $20 million, according to records obtained by Senate investigators.",
      "Investigators said they also obtained documents that showed Leonard Green \"exercised significant control\" over Prospect Medical's finances and operations.",
      "In addition to holding a majority of seats on Prospect Medical's board, executives at Leonard Green granted stock options to officials at Prospect Medical for reaching financial goals, but did not provide similar incentives for \"improvements to patient quality and safety,\" the report noted.",
      "Meanwhile, Prospect Medical issued hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends to its leadership, including a $457 million payout in 2018. CBS News previously reported Lee took home about $90 million while Leonard Green shareholders were paid a total of about $275 million, payments that depleted the company's cash reserves, according to Senate investigators.",
      "\"By 2019, the company faced $2.8 billion in liabilities, underperforming hospitals and the collapse of critical healthcare services in the communities it served,\" Senate investigators wrote.",
      "The company told the Senate Budget Committee that it rejected any implication that Prospect Medical was operated in a financially irresponsible fashion, or that Leonard Green \"has put their financial interests ahead of the interests of the hospital system and the communities they serve.\"",
      "A Leonard Green spokesperson denied Prospect Medical was struggling when it exited its position, writing in a statement the company was \"in strong financial condition with access to over $500 million to support its operations.\"\u00a0 The Leonard Green spokesperson said it enabled Prospect Medical to invest in previously closed or failing hospitals.",
      "\"In the last three years' of Leonard Green's investment alone, over $200 million was invested to improve and expand hospital operations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In a statement, a Prospect Medical spokesperson said the report drew false conclusions and omitted key facts.",
      "\"The Committee drew general conclusions about the quality of care at our hospitals without ever reviewing information from those hospitals, which is where the focus on care takes place, rather than at the corporate level,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement, noting the company has invested more than $750 million in its hospitals and provided more than $900 million in charity and uncompensated care to patients.",
      "\"Nearly all the hospitals Prospect acquired were cash-starved, neglected, in disrepair and on the verge of closure or bankruptcy,\" the spokesperson wrote. \"In nearly every instance, no one else wanted to acquire them, and many were headed to closure.\"",
      "Pennsylvania recently moved to take control of Prospect Medical's hospitals in the state to prevent the company from further shutting down services. In a lawsuit filed in November, the state's attorney general alleged years of the company's mismanagement and neglect have left hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians without care.",
      "And problems at Prospect Medical's hospitals have persisted. The day after Christmas, a water main break at another suburban Philadelphia facility caused a flood, and then a fire, that forced the evacuation of 38 patients.",
      "\"Unfilled promises and underinvestment\"",
      "The Senate report also traced what investigators called \"unfilled promises and underinvestment\"\u00a0 at Ottumwa Regional Health Center, at a facility in rural Iowa operated by a hospital company owned by Apollo Capital Management.",
      "Among their most alarming findings, investigators say \"financial factors\" may have contributed to the continued employment of a male nurse who sexually assaulted at least nine female patients while they were sedated, before he died of a drug overdose.",
      "\"It was uncovered that staff were concerned about [the nurse's] behavior before his death and escalated at least some of these concerns, but no substantive actions were taken in response,\" wrote the Senate investigators, citing the cost of replacing a nurse and the lack of adequate staffing.",
      "\"The Ottumwa community has personally felt the impact of private equity on their health care system,\" said Grassley. \"The diminishing quality of care, service availability and care capacity at the hospital is forcing Ottumwa residents to travel significant distances in order to receive appropriate treatment.\"",
      "According to the report, Apollo told the committee that rural hospitals \"have faced challenges for decades, in part driven by underinvestment,\" and that it planned to do \"the opposite by investing in and supporting companies\" like the one that operates Ottumwa.",
      "In a statement, an Apollo spokesperson told CBS News that as a result of its investments, quality of care has improved and the hospital company it owns has not had to close a single facility.",
      "Yet, the committee said its findings reflected continued underinvestment. The report alleges Apollo and its partners failed to meet certain legally binding commitments since they acquired the hospital in 2015, including maintaining access to services, establishing and implementing an outpatient substance abuse treatment program, and continuing its charity care obligations.",
      "\"Regardless of the challenges in running rural hospitals, Apollo has profited immensely from its ownership of the portfolio of hospitals that contains [Ottumwa], while failing to make committed and necessary investments at [Ottumwa],\" the Senate investigators wrote, noting the hospital was one of about 220 U.S. hospitals operated by hospital companies owned by Apollo.",

    "published": "Tue, 07 Jan 2025 17:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "NASA hopes a revised plan will get Mars samples back to Earth faster and cost less than the agency's original plan.",
    "story": [
      "After an independent review concluded NASA's plans to robotically collect and return rock and soil samples from Mars could cost up to $11 billion, NASA \"pulled the plug\" and is focusing on two options to reduce costs and speed up the return of the samples, agency Administrator Bill Nelson said Tuesday.",
      "Option one would use the same \"sky crane\" landing system proven with NASA's Curiosity and Perseverance Mars rovers, a smaller sample collection spacecraft, a smaller rocket to boost the samples into orbit around the red planet and a European Space Agency spacecraft to capture them and fly them back to Earth.",
      "The plan is similar to but less technologically challenging than the original architecture that was ruled out because of high costs and a sample return in the 2040 timeframe. Option one would cost between $6.6 billion and $7.7 billion and get the samples back as early as 2035 or as late as 2039, depending on congressional funding.",
      "Option two would rely on companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin or others to provide a \"heavy\" Mars landing craft that could deliver the sample collection spacecraft to the surface, along with the Mars Ascent Vehicle needed to blast the collected samples to orbit where the ESA spacecraft would capture and return them to Earth.",
      "As with option one, the timeframe for sample return would be the mid- to late 2030s.",
      "In both cases, the sample collection spacecraft would rely on a radioisotope thermoelectric generator, or RTG, instead of solar panels, making the craft immune to sunlight-blocking dust storms while keeping the solid propellant in the MAV from getting too cold.",
      "\"NASA is going to explore two potential options, architecture possibilities,\" Nelson said. \"The decision over the course of time, with all the engineering that has to go into it, the final decision (on which option to pursue) is likely to come in 2026.\"",
      "He said he had not discussed the mission replanning with the Trump administration or the administrator-nominee Jared Isaacman and does not know what level of support they might bring to the table.",
      "\"But I think it was a responsible thing to do, not to hand a new administration just one alternative,\" Nelson said. \"If they want to have a Mars sample return, which I can't imagine that they don't, I don't think we want the only sample return coming back on a Chinese spacecraft.\"",
      "He called a planned Chinese effort a \"grab-and-go kind of mission whereas ours has been a very methodical process ... to find different samples of different layers showing different ages of material and rocks.\"",
      "He was referring to the agency's Perseverance rover, which landed on the red planet in February 2021 and has been collecting samples across the floor of Jezero crater, an ancient, dried-up lakebed once fed by a rushing river. The sediments may hold evidence of past microbial life.",
      "The samples, Nelson said, will provide a history \"of what Mars was like millions of years ago when there was water in the lake, water coming down that river, and the big question, was there life millions of years ago? So I think the (incoming) administration will certainly conclude they want to proceed. What we wanted to do was to give them the best possible options.\"",
      "He said the Senate currently is budgeting $200 million for ongoing development of the Mars Sample Return mission in NASA's fiscal 2025 budget. The House number is $600 million. Whatever number is eventually agreed on, Nelson said NASA will need at least $300 million in the final budget.",
      "\"And if they want to get this thing back earlier, they're going to have to put more money into it, even more than $300 million in fiscal year '25, and that would be the case every year going forward,\" Nelson said.",
      "In September 2023, an independent review board concluded the original multi-spacecraft sample return mission could cost as much as $10.9 billion, $4 billion to $5 billion more than originally expected. And even at that price, the mission would be stretched out and samples would not get back to Earth before 2040.",
      "Last April, \"we pulled the plug on it,\" Nelson said, and announced NASA was seeking fresh ideas from agency engineers, researchers and the private sector to come up with alternative mission designs to reign in the costs and to get the samples back to Earth earlier.",
      "As originally envisioned, the Mars Sample Return mission, or MSR, was the most complex robotic planetary science mission ever attempted, one requiring a new NASA sample retrieval lander, one or more small helicopters to aid in sample recovery and a powerful solid-fuel rocket to launch the collected samples to orbit.",
      "Once in Mars orbit, the sample container would be collected by the European Space Agency and returned to Earth for detailed laboratory analysis.",
      "NASA originally hoped to launch the MSR mission, at a cost of nearly $6 billion, in 2028. But in September 2023, the independent review board concluded the project was not feasible given current budget projections, unrealistic schedules and a management structure that was not up to the task of getting the spacecraft ready for launch in time.",
      "The review panel concluded the project almost certainly could not get off the ground before 2030 and could cost between $8.4 billion and $10.9 billion depending on the final mission architecture.",

    "story": [
      "NASA's powerful Webb Telescope has spotted more than 40 ancient stars in a distant galaxy, researchers said in a new study.",
      "The study, published Monday in Nature, said the researchers used a technique called gravitational lensing to identify the stars. The phenomenon occurs when light bends around a large celestial body, making objects in space seem closer than they appear.",
      "Because of this, the scientists behind the study were able to get a look at 44 stars in the \"Dragon Arc,\" a part of the Abell 370 galaxy cluster. The arc is about 6.5 billion light-years away from Earth. Without gravitational lensing, trying to identify individual stars so far away would be like trying to look at dust on the moon, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said in a statement.",
      "Even with gravitational lensing acting as a magnifying glass, researchers can usually only spot one or a few stars at a time. Light bent around the galaxy cluster, the Center for Astrophysics said, and turned the Dragon Arc, which is normally spiral-shaped, into a \"hall of mirrors of cosmic proportions.\" That allowed researchers to see dozens of stars at once.",
      "\"This groundbreaking discovery demonstrates, for the first time, that studying large numbers of individual stars in a distant galaxy is possible,\" study co-author Fengwu Sun  said in the statement from the Center for Astrophysics. \"While previous studies with the Hubble Space Telescope found around seven stars, we now have the capability to resolve stars that were previously outside of our capability.\"",
      "The stars themselves are also impressive. Many are red supergiants, like the star Betelgeuse in Earth's galaxy. The galaxy they were found in was formed when the universe was about half its current age, the study said. Further observations of the galaxy might allow for studies of these types of stars, the researchers noted, which would allow scientists to learn more about the stars themselves and the way the universe was formed.",
      "\"Importantly, observing more individual stars will also help us better understand dark matter in the lensing plane of these galaxies and stars, which we couldn't do with only the handful of individual stars observed previously,\" Sun said.",

Parker Solar Probe's ability to thrive in the hostile environment around the Sun is a tribute to the team that designed and built this remarkable spacecraft.\"",

    "title": "Apple's Siri settlement could mean money for consumers \u2014 what to know",
    "published": "Fri, 03 Jan 2025 14:36:11 -0500",
    "summary": "Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its Siri virtual assistant violated people's privacy by eavesdropping on mobile device users.",
    "story": [
      "Apple has agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit that accused the company of turning its virtual assistant Siri into a snoop that eavesdropped on the users of iPhones and other trendy devices in a betrayal to its long-standing commitment to personal privacy.",
      "The proposed settlement filed in federal court earlier this week still needs to be approved by a judge, but here are a few things to know about the case and the privacy issues that it raised.",
      "What was the lawsuit about?",
      "The Wood Law Firm, which specializes in class-action lawsuits, filed the complaint against Apple in August 2019, shortly after The Guardian newspaper published an article alleging that Siri's microphone had been surreptitiously turned on to record conversations occurring without the users' knowledge.",
      "Apple issued a September 2014 software update that was supposed to activate the virtual assistant only with the triggering words \"Hey, Siri,\" but The Guardian story alleged Siri was listening and recording conversations at other times to help improve the company's technology.",
      "The story led to the lawsuit, which later raised allegations that Apple shared some of the conversations that Siri secretly recorded with advertisers looking to connect with consumers who were more likely to buy their products and services.",
      "How many people are covered by the settlement",
      "Tens of millions of U.S consumers who owned or purchased iPhones and other devices equipped with Siri from September 17, 2014, through the end of last year will be eligible to file claims.",
      "How much money will eligible consumers get?",
      "It's far too early to tell for certain, but the settlement currently envisions paying out up to $20 per Siri-enabled device, with each consumer limited to a maximum. The final amount could be affected by two factors \u2014 the number of claims and how much of the settlement fund is reduced to cover legal fees and costs.",
      "A claims administrator estimates only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers will file claims. The lawyers in the case currently are seeking nearly $30 million in fees and expenses, but that figure could still be lowered by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White, who is overseeing the case in Oakland, California. A proposed Feb. 14 court hearing has been proposed to review the settlement terms.",
      "Did Apple break any laws?",
      "If the allegations were true, Apple may have violated federal wiretapping laws and other statutes designed to protect people's privacy. But Apple adamantly denied any wrongdoing and maintained that it would have been cleared of any misconduct had the case gone to trial.",
      "The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "Lawyers representing the consumers asserted that Apple's misbehavior was so egregious that the company could have been liable for $1.5 billion in damages if it lost the case.",
      "Although Apple hasn't explained the reasons for making the settlement, major companies often decide it makes more sense to resolve class-action cases rather than to continue to run up legal costs and risk the chance of potentially bad publicity. The lawsuit also targeted one of Apple's core values framing privacy as a \"fundamental human right.\"",
      "Although $95 million sounds like a lot of money, it's a pittance for Apple. Since September 2014, the company's total profits have exceeded $700 billion \u2014 a streak of prosperity that has helped propel the company's market value to about $3.7 trillion.",
      "Should I be worried about microphones on other devices being used to spy on me?",
      "Perhaps. A case similar to the one filed against Siri is still active in a San Jose, California, federal court against Google and the virtual assistant in its Android software, which has been widely used in smartphones for years.",
      "How do I disable Siri?",
      "You can turn Apple's virtual assistant off by following these simple steps:",
      "1. Navigate to Settings Siri & Search.",
      "2. Toggle off Listen for 'Hey Siri' and press the Side button for Siri.",
      "3. Tap Turn Off Siri when a pop-up window appears.",
      "You can also disable individual apps' access to your iPhone's mic by doing the following: Navigate to Settings (select the app) then toggle off Microphone.",

      "The alleged recordings occurred even when people didn't seek to activate the virtual assistant with the trigger words, \"Hey, Siri.\" Some of the recorded conversations were then shared with advertisers in an attempt to sell their products to consumers more likely to be interested in the goods and services, the lawsuit asserted.",

      "Apple isn't acknowledging any wrongdoing in the settlement, which still must be approved by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White. Lawyers in the case have proposed scheduling a Feb. 14 court hearing in Oakland to review the terms.",
      "If the settlement is approved, tens of millions of consumers who owned iPhones and other Apple devices from Sept. 17, 2014, through the end of last year could file claims. Each consumer could receive up to $20 per Siri-equipped device covered by the settlement, although the payment could be reduced or increased, depending on the volume of claims. Only 3% to 5% of eligible consumers are expected to file claims, according to estimates in court documents.",
      "Eligible consumers will be limited to seeking compensation on a maximum of five devices.",
      "The settlement represents a sliver of the $705 billion in profits that Apple has pocketed since September 2014. It's also a fraction of the roughly $1.5 billion that the lawyers representing consumers had estimated Apple could been required to pay if the company had been found of violating wiretapping and other privacy laws had the case gone to a trial.",
      "The attorneys who filed the lawsuit may seek up to $29.6 million from the settlement fund to cover their fees and other expenses, according to court documents.",

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who oversees requests for emergency relief arising from the 2nd Circuit, ordered Manhattan prosecutors to respond by Thursday morning.",
      "New York prosecutors have told multiple judges this week that they don't believe sentencing should be delayed.",
      "\"Notwithstanding defendant's past and upcoming service as President, his history, character, and condition \u2014 and especially his open disregard for the justice system \u2014 do not support dismissal,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's lawyers wrote in a New York filing Thursday.",

It is axiomatic that there is only one President at a time.\"",
      "Trump was found guilty of 34 felony counts for falsifying business records related to a so-called \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star just before the 2016 presidential election. That payment was wired before his first presidency, but a unanimous jury concluded that Trump, while president, authorized a scheme to falsify the related records. Trump's lawyers have argued it was unconstitutional for the jury to be shown evidence and testimony from the years when Trump was in office.",

The case has already found its way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in July 2020 that the Manhattan district attorney had the power to subpoena Trump's tax records. Trump fought against their release until 2021, when the Supreme Court rejected his subsequent efforts to shield the financial records from prosecutors.",

After Trump was elected to a second term in early November, a Nov. 26 hearing was then delayed as the president-elect and Manhattan prosecutors argued over how to proceed with the case.",

Unlike other recent IRS tax commissioners, Long doesn't have a depth of experience in the tax industry, nor does he have a degree in accounting or tax law.",
      "\"[Y]our lack of significant management or tax experience \u2014 and your promotion of credits that have been \"magnet[s] for fraud\" \u2014 raise serious questions about your qualifications to lead the IRS,\" Warren wrote in the letter, noting that the Senate Finance Committee will hold his confirmation hearing early this year.",

The Madigan medical center is the Army's second-largest medical treatment facility.",
      "The Army launched an investigation into Stockin in 2022 after receiving multiple complaints, McCaskill said. He was suspended from patient care and was given administrative duties. He was formally charged in August 2023 with 23 counts of abusive sexual contact. In January 2024, the Army Office of Special Trial Counsel referred 52 charges and specifications, stemming from allegations by 41 male patients he treated between 2019 and 2022.",
      "Stockin entered into a plea agreement with prosecutors in September 2024, He entered his guilty plea Tuesday, the first day of his court-martial, which is the military's trial court system.",

    "story": [
      "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito said Wednesday that he had talked with Donald Trump about a job for one of his former law clerks in the president-elect's administration a day before Trump asked the Supreme Court to delay the sentencing in his New York \"hush money\" case.",
      "Alito said in a statement that the clerk, William Levi, had asked him to take a call from the president-elect \"regarding his qualifications to serve in a government position.\" The conservative justice also said that he and Trump \"did not discuss any other matter that is pending or might in the future come before the Supreme Court or any past Supreme Court decisions involving the President-elect.\"",
      "\"We did not discuss the emergency application he filed today, and indeed, I was not even aware at the time of our conversation that such an application would be filed,\" Alito said.",
      "Justices often recommend former clerks for top government and law firm jobs, but a direct call with a president appears unusual and comes as Trump has business before the court. Trump's lawyers are asking the Supreme Court to delay his sentencing in New York on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records connected to a $130,000 hush-money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. He is currently scheduled to be sentenced Friday, and the judge in the case said he does not intend to sentence Trump to incarceration. He is also allowing him to appear virtually, instead of in person.",
      "Trump's attorneys argue the sentencing could disrupt the presidential transition and would violate the Supreme Court's previous ruling on immunity for former presidents in another case against Trump. The court has not yet responded.",
      "During Trump's first term, Levi served as chief of staff to Attorney General Bill Barr. He was a law clerk for Alito from 2011 to 2012.",
      "Gabe Roth, executive director of the nonpartisan group Fix the Court, called the phone call \"an unmistakable breach of protocol.\"",
      "\"No person, no matter who they are, should engage in out-of-court communication with a judge or justice who's considering that person's case,\" he said in a statement.",

      "Some fire hydrants in Pacific Palisades ran dry overnight Tuesday due to \"extreme demand\" and low water pressure, Los Angeles officials said.",
      "The Palisades Fire, which was first reported at 10:30 a.m. local time Tuesday, has grown to over 15,800 acres with zero containment, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. The blaze burned through at least 1,000 buildings by Wednesday.",
      "Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, chief executive and chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said at a Wednesday press conference that all three 1-million-gallon water tanks in the area ran dry by 3 a.m., reducing water pressure for fire hydrants at higher elevations.",
      "\"We had a tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades. We pushed the system to the extreme,\" Qui\u00f1ones said. \"Four times the normal demand was seen for 15 hours straight, which lowered our water pressure.\"",
      "Qui\u00f1ones said the tanks, which supply pressure for hydrants in the hilly Palisades, couldn't refill fast enough as firefighting efforts drained water faster than the main trunk line could supply it.",
      "LADWP and city leaders faced criticism by some residents, who blamed planning and the city's infrastructure for failing to support firefighting efforts. Some also claimed on social media that officials had refused or failed to fill the tanks.",
      "However, Los Angeles Fire Department Capt. Erik Scott said\u00a0the LADWP proactively filled all available water storage tanks before the fires began. He said that \"extreme demand\" caused the tanks to be refilled at a slower rate, which affected the supply to some hydrants.",
      "Scott acknowledged to CBS News in an interview Wednesday that crews \"did experience some challenges with water pressure while battling the Pacific Palisades fire, particularly yesterday. We worked real closely with the Department of Water and Power, and they did proactively fill all of the available water storage tanks. But the problem is, the water availability was impacted at the higher elevations. The pressure wasn't quite what we needed, and so it affected some fire hydrants.\"",
      "\"We're using maybe four times the normal amount of water because we're having to use so many hose lines to put out the fires,\" he added.",
      "Mark Pestrella, director of L.A. County Public Works, said the municipal water system that services homes and businesses was \"not designed to fight wildfires.\"",
      "\"A firefight with multiple fire hydrants drawing water from the system for several hours is unsustainable,\" he said.",
      "Compounding the crisis early Wednesday were high winds and dense smoke, which grounded firefighting aircraft, a critical resource for containing fast-moving wildfires, Pestrella said.",
      "Pestrella asked residents to preserve water.",
      "\"I would ask that you turn off your water and turn off your gas, both things before you leave the residence so that we can continue to have that water supply for the hydrant system,\" he said.",

Poland will host a memorial service eight decades after Allied forces seized the notorious camp from German troops and liberated the surviving prisoners on January 27, 1945.",

    "summary": "Mexico's president sarcastically said that the U.S. should be called \"Mexican America\" after Trump's vow to rename the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America.\"",
    "story": [
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum responded sarcastically on Wednesday to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's proposal to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America.\"",
      "Standing before a 17th-century world map in her daily press briefing, Sheinbaum proposed dryly that North America should be renamed \"Am\u00e9rica Mexicana,\" or \"Mexican America,\" because a founding document dating from 1814 that preceded Mexico's constitution referred to it that way.",
      "\"That sounds nice, no?\" she added with a sarcastic tone. She also noted that the Gulf of Mexico had been named that way since 1607.",
      "Trump made the comments during an open-ended Mar-a-Lago press conference during which he also\u00a0didn't rule out\u00a0using military or economic coercion to bring Greenland and the Panama Canal under U.S. control.",
      "\"We're going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, which has a beautiful ring,\" Trump said. \"That covers a lot of territory, the Gulf of America. What a beautiful name. And it's appropriate. It's appropriate. And Mexico has to stop allowing millions of people to pour into our country.\"",
      "Trump ally Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said she would introduce\u00a0legislation\u00a0to that effect on Thursday morning.",
      "The exchange has started to answer a larger question lingering over the bilateral relationship between the two regional powers: How would newly elected Sheinbaum handle Trump's strong-handed diplomatic approach, and promises of mass-deportations and crippling taxes on trading partners like Mexico?",
      "Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 who hailed from a similar strain of class populism as Trump, even though he leaned left \u2013 was able to build a relationship with Trump as an ally, and his government began to block migrants from going north under U.S. pressure, a boon to Trump.",
      "But it was unclear if Mexico's first woman president, a scientist and leftist lacking the folksy populism that rocketed L\u00f3pez Obrador into power, would be able to build the same relationship.",
      "While Wednesday's joke quickly ricocheted across social media feeds, it also set the tone for what a Sheinbaum-Trump relationship could look like in the coming years.",
      "\"Humor can be a good tactic, it projects strength, which is what Trump responds to. It was probably the right choice on this issue,\" said Brian Winter, vice president of the New York-based Council of the Americas. \"Although President Sheinbaum knows it won't work on everything - Trump and his administration will demand serious engagement from Mexico on the big issues of immigration, drugs and trade.\"",
      "It comes after other stern but collaborative responses by Sheinbaum regarding Trump's proposals.",
      "On Trump's pitch to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican imports, Sheinbaum warned that if the new U.S. administration imposes tariffs on Mexico, her administration would respond with similar measures. She said any sort of tax was \"not acceptable and would cause inflation and job losses for the United States and Mexico.\"",
      "She's taken a more concessionary tone on immigration, falling in line with years of Mexican efforts to block migrants from traveling north amid mounting pressure by the U.S.",
      "After originally saying her government would push the Trump administration to deport migrants directly back to their own countries, in January she said Mexico would be open to accepting deportees from other countries, but Mexico could limit it to certain nationalities or request compensation.",
      "Canada also gave a sarcastic response this week to Trump's recent comments about annexing America's northern neighbor. According to Canada's CTV News, Ontario Premier Doug Ford was questioned by a reporter on Monday about Trump's multi-prong threats to\u00a0impose a 25% tariff on products from Canada and Mexico\u00a0in the first hours of his presidency, as well as making Canada the \"51st state.\"",
      "\"You know something, to the president, I'll make him a counteroffer. How about if we buy Alaska, and we'll throw in Minnesota and Minneapolis at the same time,\" Ford said.",

    "story": [
      "The purported leader of a Japan-based crime syndicate pleaded guilty Wednesday to charges alleging that he conspired to traffic uranium and plutonium from Myanmar in the belief that Iran would use it for nuclear weapons.",
      "Takeshi Ebisawa, 60, of Japan, entered the plea in Manhattan federal court to weapons and narcotics trafficking charges that carry a mandatory minimum of 10 years in prison and the possibility of life behind bars. Sentencing was set for April 9.",
      "Prosecutors say Ebisawa didn't know he was communicating in 2021 and 2022 with a confidential source for the Drug Enforcement Administration along with the source's associate, who posed as an Iranian general. Ebisawa was arrested in April 2022 in Manhattan during a DEA sting.",
      "DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in a release that the prosecution demonstrated the DEA's \"unparalleled ability to dismantle the world's most dangerous criminal networks.\"",
      "She said the investigation \"exposed the shocking depths of international organized crime from trafficking nuclear materials to fueling the narcotics trade and arming violent insurgents.\"",
      "Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim said Ebisawa admitted at his plea that he \"brazenly trafficked nuclear material, including weapons-grade plutonium, out of Burma.\"",
      "\"At the same time, he worked to send massive quantities of heroin and methamphetamine to the United States in exchange for heavy-duty weaponry such as surface-to-air missiles to be used on battlefields in Burma,\" he added.",
      "Court papers said Ebisawa - who U.S. prosecutors say is a leader of Japan's notorious Yakuza mafia -- told the DEA's confidential source in 2020 that he had access to a large quantity of nuclear materials that he wanted to sell. To support his claim, he sent the source photographs depicting rocky substances with Geiger counters measuring radiation, claiming they contained thorium and uranium, the papers said.",
      "The nuclear material came from an unidentified leader of an \"ethnic insurgent group\" in Myanmar who had been mining uranium in the country, prosecutors said. Ebisawa had proposed that the leader sell uranium through him in order to fund a weapons purchase from the general, court documents allege.",
      "Prosecutors said samples of the alleged nuclear materials were obtained and a U.S. federal lab found they contained uranium, thorium and plutonium, and that the \"the isotope composition of the plutonium\" was weapons-grade, meaning enough of it would be suitable for use in a nuclear weapon.",
      "Last year, prosecutors posted photos of the purported nuclear materials allegedly sent by Ebisawa.",
      "Prosecutors also allege Ebisawa conspired to sell 500 kilograms of methamphetamine and 500 kilograms of heroin to an undercover agent to be distributed in New York. He also allegedly worked to launder $100,000 in purported narcotics proceeds from the U.S. to Japan.",
      "\"As he admitted in federal court today, Takeshi Ebisawa brazenly trafficked nuclear material, including weapons-grade plutonium, out of Burma,\" said Acting U.S. Attorney Edward Y. Kim for the Southern District of New York. \"At the same time, he worked to send massive quantities of heroin and methamphetamine to the United States in exchange for heavy-duty weaponry such as surface-to-air missiles to be used on battlefields in Burma and laundered what he believed to be drug money from New York to Tokyo.\"",
      "An email seeking comment was sent to Ebisawa's attorneys.",
      "The Yakuza membership\u00a0shrunk to 20,400 in 2023, one-third what it was two decades ago, according to the National Police Agency. It attributed the decline largely to legislation passed to combat organized crime that includes measures like barring members of designated groups from opening bank accounts, renting apartments, buying cell phones or insurance.",

      "Iran's military forces were four days into extensive drills on Wednesday that many believe are essentially preparations for how the country could react to a U.S., Israeli or combined attack on its nuclear facilities.",
      "Brigadier Gen. Mohammad-Nazar Azimi, commander of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Najaf Ashraf West Headquarters, has touted the nationwide drills as including \"new weapons and equipment.\"",
      "Azimi also said the exercises would test the capabilities of Iran's Basij paramilitary forces, who are tasked with maintaining domestic security.",
      "The war games are likely aimed not only at demonstrating Iran's ability to respond to and defend against an attack from outside the country, but also to ensure the Basij are ready to quash any domestic uprising against the country's Islamic cleric rulers that could be precipitated by such an attack.",
      "Some Iranian analysts who are critical of the government and spoke to CBS News on the condition of anonymity said the drills may be a demonstration of power by Iran prompted by the dramatic changes in the balance of power in the Middle East \u2014 with Israel severely disabling Iranian-backed groups in Gaza and Lebanon, and long-time Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad being toppled by rebel forces.",
      "Dr. Yasser Ershadmanesh, a conservative analyst who lectures at the University of Law and International Relations in Tehran, told CBS News on Wednesday that the \"IRGC needed to have this military drill to show them that Iran is ready in all aspects.\"",
      "Ershadmanesh said Israel and its Western allies were exerting pressure on Tehran and presented an \"imminent threat \u2026 so this drill will show Israel and the U.S. that Iran is completely ready, and will send a message to the world and region about Iran's power and readiness.\"",
      "Iran's leaders are likely concerned that President-elect Donald Trump, once he comes back into office on Jan. 20, will increase that pressure significantly by applying further economic sanctions and possibly by supporting an Israeli military attack on Iran's nuclear and or missile facilities.",
      "The tone of an address delivered Wednesday by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seemed to indicate an expectation of increasing tension with the U.S., and a clear unwillingness to negotiate with Washington.",
      "\"Some people ask about why the Islamic Republic is not willing to negotiate and communicate with the United States, despite its relations with European countries and the existence of the European embassy in Iran,\" he said. \"Iran, before the (1979) revolution, was under the control of the United States, but the Islamic Revolution caused that huge political and economic wealth to be taken out of the hands of the Americans. So, their hatred for the revolution is a camel grudge (long-term grudge) \u2014 very different from European countries.\"",
      "Trump and his close advisers have been considering options to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon \u2014 something the president-elect has said he will not allow.",
      "Iranian officials have long said they do not intend to pursue nuclear weapons, but since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the international nuclear deal with Tehran during his first term in office, Iran has steadily ramped up its nuclear enrichment programs, moving the country closer to the ability to make an atomic bomb.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported recently that Trump and his team have discussed the possibility of preemptive airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities as part of that planning.",
      "One of key features of the ongoing \"Great Prophet 19\" military exercise has been a simulated aerial assault on Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, with fictional strikes seeing an enemy hit the plant with a bunker-buster bomb \u2013 the type of weapon Israel or the U.S. could use if they did target Iran's underground nuclear work.",
      "Iran's semi-official SNN news agency said the ongoing exercise began on Jan. 4 and includes air, ground and sea forces and weapons systems, and that it is meant to test Iran's domestically made air defense systems, including a number of different short and mid-range missiles.",
      "Among the weapons being tested in the drills is the Dezful surface-to-air missile system, which is an upgraded version of the Russian-made Tor M1 system. The system can fire up to two rockets simultaneously from mobile launch vehicles and is designed to shoot down aircraft or ballistic missiles.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump says the U.S. needs control of Greenland and the Panama Canal \"for national security.\" Here's why both places are so important.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump, during a long news conference on Tuesday, spoke about his interest in securing U.S. control of Greenland and the Panama Canal, and said he would not rule out the use of military force.",
      "Below is a look at where the two places are and why Trump might want the U.S. to control them.",
      "Where is Greenland and why would Trump want to control it?",
      "Greenland is located to the northeast of Canada and is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. The largest island in the world, but home to only around 60,000 people, it is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic.",
      "It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security purposes,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world. You look at \u2014 you don't even need binoculars \u2014 you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Those deposits are likely to draw the interest of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who's become a close adviser to Trump after providing more than $270 million last year to back his and other Republicans' candidacies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why would Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Trump said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" Trump said.",
      "Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed Trump's claims.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "Panama's Foreign Minister Javier Mart\u00ednez-Acha said Tuesday that his government hadn't spoken formally with Trump or his team about the canal recently, but he reiterated previous comments from the country's president that the canal would remain under Panamanian control.",
      "\"The sovereignty of our canal is not negotiable and is part of our history of struggle and an irreversible conquest,\" said Mart\u00ednez-Acha.",
      "China has also denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",

      "The history of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal\u00a0was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.",
      "It was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.",

      "Iranian media acknowledged the journalist's release, citing only the foreign reports. Iranian officials offered no immediate comment.",
      "Sala, a 29-year-old reporter for the Il Foglio daily, was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19, three days after she arrived on a journalist visa. She was accused of violating the laws of the Islamic Republic, the official IRNA news agency said, but no details of her purported transgressions were ever provided by Iranian officials.",
      "Word of Sala's release was met with cheers in Italy, where her plight had dominated headlines, as lawmakers hailed the successful negotiations to bring her home.",

Meloni tweeted Sala's return in a statement on X in which she thanked \"all those who helped make Cecilia's return possible, allowing her to reembrace her family and colleagues.\"",
      "Italian commentators had speculated that Iran was holding Sala as a bargaining chip to ensure the release of Mohammad Abedini, who was arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport three days before on Dec. 16, on a U.S. warrant. Iranian analysts who spoke with CBS News on the condition they remain anonymous said the same thing.",

      "\"I can't assure you, you're talking about Panama and Greenland,\" Trump told reporters during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. \"No, I can't assure you on either of those two. But I can say this \u2014 we need them for economic security.\"",

Therefore, there will also not be reactions to the visit,\" Mininnguaq Kleist, Greenland's permanent secretary for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CBS News ahead of his arrival on Tuesday. \"Our country is open for visits, and visitors are welcome in our beautiful country.\"",
      "Reuters, citing a source familiar with the trip, said Trump Jr. was planning to shoot content for a podcast, and that he would only be visiting for one day.",
      "On Monday, President-elect Trump said in a social media post that he was, \"hearing that the people of Greenland are 'MAGA.' My son, Don Jr, and various representatives, will be traveling there to visit some of the most magnificent areas and sights. Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our Nation. We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside World. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "Trump had expressed interest in buying Greenland during his first term in office, though the idea was quickly rebuffed by Danish authorities.",
      "Two weeks ago, Trump said on social media that, \"for purposes of National Security and Freedom throughout the World, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.\"",

As part of the sanctions, Hemedti and his family were barred from entering the United States.",

The RSF and allied militias have systematically murdered men and boys \u2014 even infants \u2014 on an ethnic basis, and deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of brutal sexual violence,\" Blinken said. \"Those same militias have targeted fleeing civilians, murdering innocent people escaping conflict, and prevented remaining civilians from accessing lifesaving supplies.\"",
      "In May 2024, the Human Rights Watch organization said the RSF and its allies could have been guilty of genocide against non-Arab ethnic communities over a specific series of attacks in the western region of Darfur.

      "Fighting broke out in Sudan between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF in April 2023 after months of tension between the two top generals who had been running the country. The former allies in charge of the SAF and the RSF had been negotiating to fully integrate the RSF into the army before the formation of a new transitional government. Those negotiations broke down and the two sides went to war.",

      "\"It is deeply disturbing that yet again we see an increase in the number of people subjected to the death penalty in Iran year-on-year,\" said Volker Turk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. That compares to at least 853 people executed in Iran in 2023.",
      "\"It is high time Iran stemmed this ever-swelling tide of executions,\" Turk said in a statement.",
      "Iran uses capital punishment for major crimes including murder, drug trafficking, rape and sexual assault.",

      "The U.N. rights office said that most of last year's executions were for drug-related offenses but it said \"dissidents and people connected to the 2022 protests were also executed.\"",
      "\"There was also a rise in the number of women executed,\" the office said.",
      "IHR said in a report on Monday that at least 31 women had been executed in Iran in 2024.",
      "Iran does not publish official data on executions, but U.N. rights office spokeswoman Liz Throssell told reporters that the team had gathered figures from a range of different reliable rights organizations that monitor the situation, including HRANA, Hengaw and the Norway-based Iran Human Rights.",
      "\"We are confident of the number,\" she said.",
      "The highest number of executions in Iran in recent decades was recorded in 2015, when at least 972 people were put to death.After that, the numbers decreased following a reform of Iran's anti-narcotics law in 2017, but Throssell warned that \"since 2022 the numbers have risen sharply.\"",
      "\"Clearly the number for 2024 is alarmingly, shockingly high,\" Throssell said.",
      "Turk stressed that his office opposed \"the death penalty under all circumstances.\"",
      "\"It is incompatible with the fundamental right to life and raises the unacceptable risk of executing innocent people,\" he said. \"And, to be clear, it can never be imposed for conduct that is protected under international human rights law.\"",
      "The U.N. rights chief urged the Iranian authorities to halt all further executions, and to place a moratorium on the use of the death penalty with a view to ultimately abolishing it.",
      "Some 170 states have either abolished the death penalty or imposed a moratorium on its use.",

      "For those who are interested in curbing their alcohol use, here are six tips on how to do so safely.",
      "The surgeon general's advisory noted that alcohol-related cancer deaths even occurred in some moderate drinkers. (iStock)",
      "1. Analyze your alcohol dependence",
      "Alcohol is \"one of the most serious substances\" when it comes to detoxification, sometimes requiring medical hospitalization to manage withdrawal symptoms, according to Dr. Chris Tuell, clinical director at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Mason, Ohio.",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "Tuell, who is also an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, recommended speaking to a primary care physician before discontinuing years of extreme alcohol use.",
      "DOES \u2018DRY JANUARY\u2019 ACTUALLY IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH? HERE'S WHAT TO KNOW",
      "Dr. Adi Jaffe, PhD, CEO of addiction recovery platform IGNTD in Los Angeles, noted that in some cases, it may be \"medically inadvisable to just quit\" if alcohol dependence is severe.",
      "People who drink heavily, or consume five to seven drinks a day, should consult their doctor before quitting, one addiction specialist recommended. (iStock)",
      "\"You must consult with a medical professional before stopping,\" said Jaffe, author of the book \"Unhooked.\" \"This is especially true if you get tremors, shaking or sweatiness when you don't drink, even for a day or two.\"",
      "\"Those are markers of somebody who's more likely to have a grand mal seizure if they just stop cold turkey.\"",
      "2. Set clear goals and track patterns",
      "For people who haven\u2019t had a \"necessarily problematic\" relationship with alcohol and are just looking to cut back, Tuell recommended setting clear goals to get there.",
      "DRINKING ALCOHOL IS LINKED TO CANCER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"With any behaviors that you plan to change, what are clear, realistic and specific goals on how much or how often you plan to drink?\" he asked.",
      "\"Perhaps you have the goal of only drinking on weekends, or perhaps you limit the amount of alcohol to two drinks per occasion.\"",
      "Writing down your drinking behaviors can help identify triggers, experts say. (iStock)",
      "Tuell suggested tracking your drinking by keeping a journal of when, where and how much you drink.",
      "\"This helps to identify patterns or triggers that may be associated with your mood, such as work stress or family stress and anxieties,\" he said.",
      "Planning alcohol-free days and then gradually increasing the number of those days each week can be effective, the expert added.",
      "3. Avoid triggers and find alternatives",
      "After tracking when, where and how much you drink, it may become clear what triggers you to drink.",
      "Tuell encouraged identifying these situations, emotions and behaviors and finding alternative ways to handle them.",
      "\u2018ALCOHOL GENE\u2019 COULD PREDICT HOW COCKTAILS MAY AFFECT YOU \u2014 AND THERE\u2019S A TEST FOR IT",
      "\"These triggers will frequently lead to behaviors that give us relief and/or a reward, and many times it is not a healthy way of coping,\" he said.",
      "\"Choose non-alcoholic beverages in social settings \u2026 like sparkling water, mocktails or herbal teas, to satisfy the habit of having a drink \u2026 or avoid places where heavy drinking occurs.\"",
      "Social pressure to drink can pose a major temptation, according to experts. (iStock)",
      "Jaffe commented that focusing on less drinking won\u2019t be as effective as drinking something else, like a non-alcoholic drink, or doing a different activity instead.",
      "SEVERE HEALTH RISKS OF VAPING AND E-CIGARETTES, ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTH, SAY EXPERTS",
      "Tuell agreed that finding a healthier alternative to bad behaviors is a good way to stop them.",
      "This could include stress-relieving practices like exercising, reading, journaling or spending more time with supportive friends.",
      "Adding movement as a replacement for drinking can help curb bad habits. (iStock)",
      "Movement, mindfulness exercises and meditation can also be helpful practices throughout the day, according to Jaffe.",
      "\"You can do those practices while you're brushing your teeth or while you're making your coffee,\" he said. \"Meditation practices as short as five or 10 minutes can have an incredible impact on your stress response in life.\"",
      "4. Change your environment",
      "Removing temptations from your environment is a good way to prevent reaching for them, according to experts.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Tuell suggested removing alcohol from your home or limiting activities that make it more accessible, such as hanging out at bars.",
      "\"Smell is the strongest of the five senses connected to memory,\" he added.",
      "Jaffe agreed that environment \"plays a massive role\" in how people interact with alcohol.",
      "\"If you're looking to reduce your drinking \u2026 having other people who are participating in the journey with you will go a long way toward helping you meet your goals of reduction.\"",
      "5. Practice saying \u2018no\u2019 and surround yourself with support",
      "The social pressures of drinking can be a trigger, but learning to say \"no\" is powerful. Tuell recommended being prepared with a \"polite but firm\" response in situations where you might feel pressured to drink.",
      "\u2018I\u2019M A PSYCHOLOGIST \u2013 HERE'S HOW TO FINALLY BREAK YOUR BAD HABITS'",
      "This can be as simple as, \"No, thanks, I\u2019m taking a break from drinking\" or \"I\u2019m good, thanks.\"",
      "Tuell advises surrounding yourself with supportive individuals, like trusted friends or family members with whom you can share your goals.",
      "Experts recommend surrounding yourself with supportive individuals with whom you can share your goals. (iStock)",
      "He also suggested joining a support group, \"like Alcoholics Anonymous, SMART Recovery, Celebrate Recovery or Women for Sobriety.\"",
      "\"If you are one of the 40% of Americans who is trying to stop alcohol use, sometimes it may be necessary to seek counseling services.\"",
      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0foxnews.com/health",
      "Tuell also mentioned that methods like cognitive behavioral therapy can be effective.",
      "6. Be kind to yourself",
      "Reflecting on the reasons you're looking to reduce alcohol intake \u2014 whether it's to improve your health, save money, strengthen relationships or another motivating factor \u2014 can help keep you on the right path, according to Tuell.",
      "\"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "He also encouraged celebrating milestones by enjoying something non-alcohol-related, such as a massage, a round of golf, a shopping trip or another fun outing.",
      "\"To make changes, it takes time,\" Tuell said. \"Setbacks are normal. So be kind to yourself and focus on progress, not perfection.\"",
      "\"If you keep moving forward one step at a time, you will get to a point where you're drinking substantially less.\" (iStock)",
      "While about 40% of people quit their New Year\u2019s resolutions before the end of January, according to Jaffe, the specialist said it's important to not be discouraged by slip-ups.",

      "7. Relationship challenges",
      "\"Many adults with ADHD have difficulty maintaining relationships with others due to inappropriate social behaviors, such as frequently interrupting, losing interest in conversations, difficulty paying attention and forgetfulness,\" Kahn noted.",
      "\"You might forget to call friends back or forget about commitments to others, which can cause issues in your relationships.\"",

      "Benefits of microdosing",
      "The primary reason for microdosing is to reduce costs, according to McGowan.",
      "For example, he said, a patient might think that if a full prescription costs over $250 per week, they may be able to achieve some benefit with just $25 worth of the medication.",

      "Potential risks of the practice",
      "The most likely risk of microdosing is a lack of effectiveness, McGowan noted.",

      "OZEMPIC COULD HELP REDUCE ALZHEIMER\u2019S RISK FOR SOME, STUDY SUGGESTS: \u2018SHIFTING THE PARADIGM\u2019",

      "OZEMPIC PUSH FOR SENIORS? SOME DOCTORS SAY MORE PEOPLE AGE 65 AND OVER SHOULD BE ON IT",
      "People who microdose often use a \"compounded\" version of the medication,\u00a0which the FDA does not regulate.",
      "\"This introduces risks such as contamination, inconsistent formulations and uncertainty about the actual strength of the product being injected,\" McGowan stated.",
      "Without changes to diet and physical activity patterns, the long-term benefits will disappear once the drug is stopped, one doctor noted. (iStock)",
      "Additionally, these compounded versions are usually dispensed in vials, which requires a syringe to draw it up, in contrast to the FDA-approved versions that are simpler to use.",
      "Using the compounded versions through vials runs the risk of drawing up too much medication \u2014 so instead of\u00a0microdosing, it's possible to macrodose, Sowa warned.",
      "Medical supervision is key",

All he had to do was go where Gen Z was, TikTok, and lay out his plan.\"",

      "\"The TikTok ban is controversial, I see two sides to it. I see it as an app that\u2019s very left leaning and consumes way too much of people\u2019s time but it is sometimes the only place I get info about stories that should be breaking world wide. At the same time it can be dangerous. It can radicalize young people. One day you wake up on TikTok and young Americans are saying they\u2019re supportive of Osama bin Laden,\" Wilson told Fox Digital.",

      "\"It seems to be an app leaning towards being anti-American and brainwashing young kids. At the end of the day, if I say to ban it it\u2019s hypocritical against free speech. I just don\u2019t want it harming young people,\" she added.",

      "Fast-forward to 2024 amid the campaign cycle, and Trump joined the app in June during the campaign cycle and has since racked up nearly 15 million followers and 107 million likes as supporters flocked to his content on the platform.

Avoid downloading apps from random websites, pop-up ads or unofficial third-party stores as these are common sources of fake apps.",
      "2. Verify the app\u2019s developer:\u00a0Before installing an app, check who created it.

      "3. Pay attention to reviews and ratings:\u00a0Reviews and ratings can give you insight into an app's authenticity. If an app has mostly negative reviews, very few downloads or generic comments like \"Great app,\" it could be fake. Genuine apps typically have a large number of detailed reviews over time. Be cautious of apps with five-star ratings but no specific feedback.",
      "4. Be cautious of app permissions:\u00a0Check the permissions the app requests before installing. A flashlight app, for example, shouldn\u2019t need access to your contacts or messages. If an app is asking for permissions that don\u2019t align with its purpose, it could be a red flag. Always deny permissions that seem excessive or unnecessary.",
      "5. Keep your phone and apps updated:\u00a0Regular updates for your operating system and apps often include important security fixes that protect your device from malware. Turning on automatic updates can ensure you always have the latest protections.",
      "6. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Install strong antivirus software on your Android. These tools can scan apps for malware, detect suspicious activity and block harmful downloads. Strong antivirus software provides an extra layer of defense, especially when browsing or downloading apps. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Meta's platforms, like Facebook and Instagram, have been more tightly moderated compared to platforms like X, which has meant less freedom of expression for users. The changes Zuckerberg announced on Tuesday aim to relax those rules, letting people share their thoughts more freely. This could lead to more offensive content, but that's the trade-off for more freedom. The introduction of Community Notes is a good change, too, as it gives users more control instead of leaving it to a small group of people who might be biased toward a certain political party or issue.",

      "Floating solar still process (Dalhousie University)",
      "The power of plasmonic solar stills",
      "At the heart of this innovation is a floating solar still, a device that harnesses the sun's energy to purify seawater.",
      "Dr. Mita Dasog, an associate professor of chemistry and Killam Memorial chair at Dalhousie, explains the science behind it: \"Refractory plasmonic nanomaterials are very good at capturing light and converting that light into heat.\"",
      "This principle forms the foundation of their ingenious design. The solar still, conceptualized by Dr. Matthew Margeson during his Ph.D. studies, addresses challenges that have long plagued similar devices. It minimizes thermal losses, prevents salt buildup and can withstand harsh maritime conditions.",
      "Researcher pictured next to floating solar still (Matthew J. Margeson)",
      "A BREAKTHROUGH GADGET COULD HELP YOU DETECT MICROPLASTICS IN YOUR DRINKING WATER",
      "How it works",
      "The floating solar still operates through an elegantly simple yet highly effective process. First, ocean water is drawn up to the device's foam surface through a wicking system. Once the water reaches the surface, it is evaporated by solar-heated plasmonic materials. As the water vapor rises, the salt is left behind, ensuring that only purified water is collected. The vapor then recondenses on a clear plastic dome situated above the device. Finally, the purified water is funneled down the sides of the dome and collected in a sealed bag for easy access.",
      "The results of this process are impressive. In real-world tests conducted in Halifax Harbour, the device produced up to 0.97 gallons of clean water daily, which was a record-breaking yield for passive floating solar stills.",

Through a process called pyrolysis, carbon waste from tires is transformed into a crucial component of the desalination unit.",
      "Dr. Dasog emphasizes the importance of accessibility: \"We shouldn't be making an expensive or very complicated device. It has to be easy to manufacture, last for a long time and be easy to take apart and move.\" This approach not only makes the technology more affordable but also addresses the environmental issue of tire waste.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says business email compromise scams are a serious threat.",
      "With our lives so intertwined with digital communication these days, the threat of email fraud is something we all need to take seriously. Recently, Teresa W. shared a scary experience that underscores the dangers of business email compromise (BEC).",
      "\"I almost lost many thousands of dollars through an internet fraud scam. I got a call from our personal banker who said she saw nearly all the money in our business account being withdrawn. She said she got an email from me along with the money wiring directions. I told her I didn't send that and she said my email came from me directly to her. I said to stop everything and I will get to the bottom of it.",
      "\"Apparently the thieves got hold of a wiring instruction paper from my email, which they hacked into. They created a rule in Outlook to bypass me if anything came from them and go straight to the banker. They changed the wiring instructions to go into their account but thank goodness our banker alerted me so I could get to the bottom of it. Too close for comfort!\"",
      "This incident highlights a sophisticated scam where cybercriminals gain access to legitimate email accounts and use them to deceive others into transferring funds. Teresa\u2019s quick action, combined with her banker's vigilance, prevented a significant financial loss, but it serves as a wake-up call for many businesses.",

      "Email hacking: Scammers often gain access to email accounts through\u00a0phishing attacks, where they trick users into revealing their login credentials or by deploying malware that captures sensitive information.",
      "Email rule creation: Once inside the account, scammers can create rules in email clients like Outlook that redirect or hide specific emails. This means that any communication related to fraudulent activities may go unnoticed by the victim.",
      "Impersonation: The scammer impersonates the victim and sends emails to contacts, such as banks or vendors, requesting urgent wire transfers or sensitive information.",
      "Execution: The scammer provides convincing details and urgency in their requests, making it appear as though the email is genuinely from the victim. They may use specific language or references only known to the victim and their contacts.",

      "Proactive steps to avoid being a victim of BEC scams",
      "To combat BEC and similar scams, businesses must adopt a proactive approach to cybersecurity.",
      "1) Have strong antivirus software: Use reputable, up-to-date, strong antivirus software to check your system. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Use strong passwords:\u00a0Ensure passwords are complex (a mix of letters, numbers and symbols) and unique for each account.\u00a0Make sure to create strong, unique passwords. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication: Where possible, enable multifactor authentication.\u00a0This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Keep an eye on your financial accounts, email accounts and social media for any unusual activity. If you think scammers have stolen your identity, consider identity theft protection here.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "5) Invest in personal data removal services: Using a data removal service can be an effective additional step to protect your personal information after a potential BEC scam. These services locate and remove your information from various online platforms, databases and data brokers. By eliminating unnecessary or outdated information, data removal services minimize your online presence, making it harder for scammers to find and exploit your data.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Regularly update security questions: Change security questions and answers periodically to enhance protection.",
      "7) Regularly review email rules: Check for unauthorized changes in email settings that could indicate compromise.",
      "8) Disable auto-forwarding: Unless absolutely necessary, turn off auto-forwarding features to prevent sensitive information from being sent elsewhere without your knowledge.",
      "9) Verify requests: Always verify any financial requests through a secondary communication method (e.g., a phone call) before proceeding with transactions.",
      "10) Limit access: Restrict access to financial information and transactions only to those who need it within your organization.",
      "11) Contact professionals: If you\u2019re unsure about any steps or if the situation seems severe, consider reaching out to a professional IT service.",
      "12) Report the incident: Report the scam to your local authorities and the\u00a0Federal Trade Commission in the U.S.",
      "13) Create alias email addresses: My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is to use an\u00a0alias email address.\u00a0An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail and having your email eventually stolen in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

    "story": [
      "Your web browser is an ecosystem of its own. It stores your passwords, search history, financial details like credit card numbers, addresses and more. Just like how malicious apps and services can compromise data on your phone or PC, malicious extensions can expose the data stored in your browser.",
      "There are a ton of extensions out there that do more harm than good. In fact, security researchers have just found a dangerous new campaign that is going after browser extensions. So far, around 36 extensions have been compromised, putting over 2.6 million Chrome users at risk of having their browsing data and account credentials exposed.",

      "Hackers are exploiting browser extensions as a gateway to steal sensitive user data through a variety of methods. These compromised extensions are exposing over 2.6 million users to data exposure and credential theft, as reported by\u00a0The Hacker News.",
      "One common attack involves phishing campaigns targeting the publishers of legitimate extensions on platforms like the Chrome Web Store. In these campaigns, attackers trick developers into granting permissions to malicious applications, which then insert harmful code into popular extensions. This code can steal cookies, access tokens and other user data.",
      "The first company to shed light on the campaign was cybersecurity firm Cyberhaven, one of whose employees were targeted by a phishing attack on December 24, allowing the threat actors to publish a malicious version of the extension.",
      "Once these malicious extensions are published and pass the Chrome Web Store's security review, they are made available to millions of users, putting them at risk of data theft. Attackers can use these extensions to exfiltrate browsing data, monitor user activity and even bypass security measures such as two-factor authentication.",
      "In some cases, developers themselves may unknowingly include data-gathering code as part of a monetization software development kit, which stealthily exfiltrates detailed browsing data. This makes it difficult to determine whether a compromise is the result of a hacking campaign or an intentional inclusion by the developer.",

      "1) Verify emails and links before clicking:\u00a0Many attacks begin with\u00a0phishing emails that impersonate trusted entities like Google Chrome Web Store Developer Support. These emails often create a false sense of urgency, urging you to click on malicious links. Always verify the sender\u2019s email address and avoid clicking on links without double-checking their authenticity. When in doubt, go directly to the official website rather than using a provided link.",
      "2) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Having strong antivirus software is an essential line of defense against malicious software. These tools can detect and block malicious code, even if it has been embedded in browser extensions.\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install strong malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Limit extension permissions:\u00a0Be cautious about the permissions you grant to browser extensions. Many require access to sensitive data like browsing history, cookies or account information, but not all requests are necessary. Review what each extension asks for and deny permissions that seem excessive. If possible, opt for extensions with limited access to ensure your data remains protected.",
      "4) Limit the number of extensions: Only install extensions that are genuinely needed and regularly review and uninstall those no longer in use.",
      "5) Keep your browser updated: Always update your browser to the latest version. Updates often include critical security patches that protect against vulnerabilities exploited by malicious software. Using an outdated browser increases the risk of being targeted by attacks that could have been prevented with a simple update. Enable automatic updates to ensure you\u2019re always protected. If you are unsure how to update your browser, check out my\u00a0detailed guide for Google Chrome.",
      "6) Regularly audit your extensions: Conduct periodic reviews of installed extensions and remove any that are unnecessary or pose potential security risks.",
      "7) Report suspicious extensions: If you encounter a suspicious extension, report it to the official browser extension marketplace.",

Even on official stores, check the app\u2019s reviews, ratings and download count to ensure it\u2019s trustworthy.",
      "2. Pay attention to app permissions:\u00a0Be careful about the permissions you grant to apps during installation. A flashlight app, for example, doesn\u2019t need access to your contacts or location. Question any permission that doesn\u2019t align with the app\u2019s functionality. Both iOS and Android allow you to review and manage app permissions in your settings, so take the time to double-check what you\u2019ve already allowed.",

      "Fake VPN apps are everywhere, and they\u2019re bad news. They\u2019re not just useless. They can turn your device into a tool for cybercriminals. The 911 S5 botnet showed us just how dangerous free VPNs can be, turning millions of devices into a giant network for fraud and attacks. The truth is free VPNs aren\u2019t really free. They often come with weak security, leak your data or demand permissions that put your privacy at risk. If you\u2019re serious about protecting your online activity, invest in a trusted, paid VPN service.",

      "Apple AirTags use different technology, so even if it was placed in an RFID-blocking wallet or bag, it could still be detected by a thief with an iPhone or locator.

Because car thieves might be able to locate an Apple AirTag hidden in your vehicle, it may not provide the layer of protection you hope for. Though the technology in RFID wallets will not block signals from an Apple AirTag, which will make them detectable to locators and scanners, Faraday bags will. Unfortunately, you will end up outsmarting yourself in trying to outsmart car thieves if you use a Faraday bag because you will then not be able to track the Apple AirTags either. If you are looking for the optimal way to outsmart car thieves, the Apple AirTags might not be the answer you are looking for.",

This endangers your retirement security in three distinct ways, each more dangerous than the last:",
      "They don\u2019t know anything about you, but they have a way to reach you. Even if a scammer knows only your phone number or email address, it\u2019s enough for them to reach out to you. If they don\u2019t know who you are or anything about you, they have to take the most \"one-size-fits-all\" approach they can manage. Their goal is to get you to respond to them or click a link that leads to a malicious website. Once they learn more about you, they can better tailor their next moves.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "They know what you\u2019re like but not who you are. Scammers can buy ready-made packages of personal information from data brokers. A set like this might include only the phone numbers of people over the age of 60, for example, while another might provide the addresses of elderly people who require live-in care and are experiencing cognitive decline. The potential for abuse is clear. They don\u2019t have to know your name to target a dangerously effective scam at you.",

Scammers can also buy shockingly detailed information about you, from your full name to your health care and financial information. These scams are the most dangerous, with the attackers knowing enough about you to breeze past many of your defenses.",

Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click on links: No matter how much pressure or stress a message or phone call puts you under, stick to the golden rule of never following or clicking on links. Always go to the source of the communication via official channels from a secure device to confirm what\u2019s happening. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

Don\u2019t give out sensitive information: If a message or email can put you under enough pressure to do something you shouldn\u2019t (like follow a link to a phishing site), imagine what a phone call can do. Any request for personal information should raise red flags. If something seems off, hang up.",

      "4. Verify identities before handing over money or information: Always verify who you are dealing with before providing any personal details (name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, financial information, etc.) or money. If someone asks for this information or claims they need to send you money, follow this rule: \"Hang up, look up and call back.\" This applies to phone calls, texts and emails. Hang up or set the message aside, find the legitimate contact information for the organization in question and reach out through official channels (not social media) to confirm the request.",

      "In the early hours of Jan. 1, 2025, two horrific attacks shook the nation, raising serious questions about car-sharing platform security and potential terrorism links. In Las Vegas, a Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump International Hotel, killing the driver and injuring seven others.",
      "Meanwhile, in New Orleans, a pickup truck, later identified as a Ford F-150, plowed into crowds on Bourbon Street, resulting in at least 15 fatalities and dozens of injuries.",

      "The Las Vegas incident",
      "At approximately 8:40 a.m. PT on Jan. 1, 2025, a Tesla Cybertruck pulled up to the valet area of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. Within 15 to 20 seconds, the vehicle exploded, killing the driver and injuring seven bystanders. Investigators discovered that the Cybertruck was packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters.",
      "The FBI is investigating the incident as a potential act of terrorism. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on social media that the explosion was caused by large fireworks or a bomb in the bed of the Cybertruck and was unrelated to the vehicle itself.",
      "The New Orleans attack",
      "In the early hours of New Year's Day, a pickup truck, later identified as a Ford F-150, rammed through police barricades on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter. The driver, identified as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, an Army veteran from Texas, mowed down pedestrians over a three-block stretch while firing into the crowd.",
      "The attack resulted in at least 15 deaths and dozens of injuries. Jabbar was killed in a subsequent shootout with police. The FBI is treating this incident as an act of terrorism, noting that an Islamic State flag was found on the vehicle and improvised explosive devices were discovered inside.",
      "The Turo connection to both incidents",
      "Both vehicles used in these incidents were rented through\u00a0Turo, a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform. This connection has raised significant questions about the company's security measures and screening processes.",
      "What is Turo?",
      "Turo is a peer-to-peer car-sharing platform that connects vehicle owners with people looking to rent cars. Often described as the \"Airbnb for cars,\" Turo allows individuals to list their personal vehicles for rent, providing an alternative to traditional car rental companies.",
      "Founded in 2010 as RelayRides and rebranded to Turo in 2015, the company has grown into an international vehicle-sharing marketplace with more than 14 million users worldwide. Turo is available in more than 16,000 cities across the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and France.",
      "Image from Turo website (Turo)",
      "BEST CAR ACCESSORIES",
      "How does Turo work?",
      "The Turo process is straightforward:",
      "Listing: Car owners list their vehicles on the Turo platform, including details like make, model, price and availability.Booking: Renters search for available cars in their desired location and dates, then book directly through the Turo website or app.Verification: Both car owners and renters must verify their identities through the platform.Pick-up: Renters meet the car owner to pick up the vehicle or arrange for contactless check-in.Return: At the end of the rental period, the renter returns the car to the owner.",

      "Identity verification",
      "Background checks (though the specific extent of these checks is not clear)",
      "Turo requires users to upload a valid driver's license to the app to be cleared for use. In some instances, Turo may collect additional identity verification information such as photographs or scanned copies of driver's licenses, passports or other forms of identification.",
      "The company has stated that they were \"devastated\" by the recent events and that their trust and safety team is actively cooperating with law enforcement. Importantly, Turo said in a statement to CyberGuy, \"We do not believe that either renter had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat, and we are not currently aware of any information that indicates the two incidents are related.\"",

      "HOW TO PREVENT YOUR CAR FROM GETTING STOLEN",
      "Regulatory landscape for peer-to-peer car-sharing platforms",
      "The regulatory landscape for peer-to-peer car-sharing platforms like Turo is in a state of flux, with at least 13 states having enacted laws specifically governing this industry, distinct from regulations applied to traditional car rental companies.",
      "Turo has been proactive in advocating for additional regulations in various states to establish clearer operational guidelines. A significant development occurred in 2022 when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed SB 6715 into law, providing a comprehensive regulatory framework for peer-to-peer car-sharing operations in the state. This legislation aims to expand transportation options and create economic opportunities for New Yorkers while addressing safety and insurance concerns.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "These tragic events have highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the peer-to-peer car-sharing model. As investigations into these incidents continue, it's likely that there will be increased scrutiny of Turo's operations and security measures. The car-sharing industry may face calls for stricter regulations and enhanced screening processes. Turo and similar platforms might need to reevaluate and strengthen their security protocols to prevent such incidents in the future.",

      "A versatile crime-fighting machine",
      "The RT-G is not your average police assistant. This self-balancing sphere can reach speeds of up to 22 mph on both land and water, making it a formidable pursuer of suspects. Its amphibious capabilities allow it to navigate through mud, slush and even dive into rivers, emerging unscathed on the other side.",
      "What sets the RT-G apart is its rapid acceleration. It can hit speeds of about 19 mph in 2.5 seconds, giving it a significant advantage in pursuit scenarios. This quick burst of speed, combined with its ability to handle drops from knee-high ledges and potentially roll down staircases, makes it a persistent and resilient force in the field.",
      "Rotunbot RT-G (Logon Technology)",
      "THE FUTURE OF SECURITY JUST ROLLED IN, AND HER NAME IS ATHENA",
      "Advanced technology at its core",
      "The Rotunbot RT-G is equipped with an array of advanced sensors and technologies that make it a sophisticated piece of equipment. These include GPS for precise positioning, multiple cameras and ultrasonic sensors for environmental awareness, obstacle avoidance capabilities and threat and target tracking systems. These features enable the RT-G to navigate complex environments while avoiding collisions with people and objects. Additionally, the robot uses gyroscopic self-stabilization to maintain its balance and keep its wide contact patch firmly on the ground, ensuring smooth and quiet operation.",

      "Non-lethal arsenal",
      "For law enforcement purposes, the RT-G comes equipped with a comprehensive range of non-lethal tools designed to manage diverse tactical scenarios. These tools include tear gas dispensers, smoke bomb launchers, high-decibel horns, acoustic crowd dispersal devices and net shooters capable of close-range suspect apprehension.",
      "This sophisticated arsenal allows the robot to handle various situations, from crowd control to individual suspect takedowns, without resorting to lethal force, providing law enforcement with a versatile and humane technological solution.",

In Wenzhou, a city in China's Zhejiang province, these robotic spheres are assisting police patrols in commercial zones. This real-world trial is providing valuable insights into the effectiveness and practicality of the RT-G in actual law enforcement scenarios.",
      "However, despite its impressive capabilities, the RT-G is not without its limitations. Video footage shows that the robot can be somewhat unstable when making turns, and its pursuit capabilities may be easily thwarted by a flight of stairs. These challenges highlight the ongoing need for development and improvement in robotic law enforcement technology.",
      "Rotunbot RT-G (Logon Technology)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The Rotunbot RT-G's amphibious nature, high-speed capabilities and non-lethal arsenal make it a versatile tool for police forces. However, like any new technology, it raises questions about privacy, surveillance and the increasing automation of policing. The RT-G may be rolling into the future of law enforcement, but we must carefully consider the implications of deploying such advanced robotic systems in our communities.",

      "\"The bulk of the State\u2019s expert disclosures fail to include opinions and reports. These inadequate disclosures greatly prejudice Mr. Kohberger who is obligated to submit defense guilt phase expert disclosures by January 23, 2025,\" Kohberger defense lawyers Anne Taylor, Jay Logsdon and Elisa Massoth wrote in a court filing. \"The sanctions considered must be the exclusion of the experts or at a bare minimum, an order compelling proper disclosure and an extension of Mr. Kohberger\u2019s January 23, 2025 deadline.\"",

      "\"This is a capital murder case and nothing about it is clear cut,\" the lawyers wrote. \"The expert issues are complex, involving many different facets of DNA, cellular data, cell tower coverage and drive testing, car identification, crime scene and blood spatter analysis, fingerprint analysis, forensic pathology, and electronic device analysis of the suspect, victims, and alternative suspects, and social media accounts.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX \u2014 A new study is sounding the alarm on female-identifying, biologically male felons being incarcerated at female-only prisons, saying those inmates pose physical and psychological risks to biological women.",
      "The report from Independent Women, a nonprofit, released Thursday and shared exclusively with Fox News Digital, says \"male inmates identifying as women are disproportionately likely to have committed sexual offenses, and incarcerated women face heightened risks of harassment and assault under these policies.",
      "\"Placing trans-identifying males, especially those with fully intact male genitalia or a history of violent sex crimes, in close quarters with female inmates risks a serious deprivation of the female\u2019s rights,\" the report states. \"These risks \u2014 and the consequences that have already manifested for women subjected to mixed-sex prison environments \u2014 are known, but are being deliberately ignored in deference to laws and policies that marginalize incarcerated women and silence concerns about their safety.\"",

      "\"It's because the laws are based on self-identification. The only requirement is for someone to state that they are a female,\" Ichikawa told Fox News Digital. \"You can't base your denials on physical attributes, including retention of a penis. You can't deny somebody a transfer based on criminal history.\"",
      "Male inmates who identify as female will often sit before a review board to have cases heard and argue that sex-based prisons violate Equal Protection laws or claim they are being discriminated against on the basis of sex.",

      "\"She was wrong. \u2018Cruel and Unusual Punishment: Stopping the Dangerous Policies Putting Men in Women's Prisons\u2019 makes clear that policy leaders hold clear authority to protect women and enforce sanity. This is a must-read for politicians and their staff trying to end the predations of gender ideology.\"",
      "Transgender policy advocates say housing female-identifying inmates in female-only prisons allows them to live in a safer environment because transgender women face sexual abuse in male-only prisons.",
      "\"Prisons and jails routinely subject transgender people in their care to abusive conditions, including denial of medical care, extended periods of solitary confinement, and harassment, sexual assault, and violence at the hands of guards and other people with whom they are incarcerated,\" the Transgender Law Center states on its website. \"Recent studies show that transgender women are 13 times more likely to be sexually assaulted in prison than others.\"",

      "\"The trans community has been hijacked as a hiding place for very mentally unwell sex criminals,\" Ichikawa said. \"This is a perfect Trojan horse into the biggest victim pool anyone could ever hope and dream of.

      "President-elect Trump once again reiterated that \"all Hell will break out\" if the hostages are not returned by the time he enters office, as Steve Witkoff, his envoy to the Mideast heads for another round of cease-fire negotiations in the region.",
      "In a new report by the Israeli Ministry of Health, recently submitted to the United Nations, hostages who were freed from Hamas captivity described how they were subjected to unimaginable suffering. Among the chilling testimonies, two children revealed they were bound and beaten throughout their captivity, with scars and marks of trauma evident on their bodies. Others reported deliberate burning with heated objects, leaving permanent injuries.",
      "Women detailed horrifying sexual violence, including assaults at gunpoint and forced undressing in front of captors. Men also endured sexual abuse, prolonged starvation, severe beatings, and torture involving branding with hot metal.",
      "Many hostages suffered significant weight loss, with children losing up to 18% of their body weight. Unsanitary conditions led to infections, gastrointestinal illnesses, and other severe health complications. These atrocities, coupled with the systematic use of physical and psychological abuse as tools of oppression, paint a grim picture of the hostages\u2019 ordeal.",

      "Among those still held is Or Levi, whose wife was murdered during the Oct. 7 attack. Or\u2019s brother, Michael Levi, shared his anguish in an interview, describing the devastating impact of the Health Ministry\u2019s report.",
      "Levi expressed deep frustration with the international community, particularly the United Nations, and said he holds little hope for meaningful action after the report. \"For some reason, the Israeli side is not counted as human,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"The U.N. ignores the fact that Hamas is committing crimes against humanity.\" Levi represented the hostages\u2019 families in a briefing to the U.N. Security Council last month. \"When I addressed the Security Council, I wanted them to hear a personal story. They need to understand that there cannot be lives that are worth more than others.\"",
      "\"When you see how inhumane and horrible the conditions that the hostages are in, and knowing that my brother is one of them\u2026 it kills me,\" he said. \"Thinking about my brother, who is almost six feet three, trying to stand up in dark, airless tunnels less than six feet tall \u2013 it\u2019s unbearable.\"",

      "Negotiations to free the hostages are ongoing, after President-elect Trump vowed that there would be \"all hell to pay\" if the hostages are not released before he enters office. However, Levi\u2019s brother Or is reportedly not \"on the lists\" because he is a young man and therefore not considered a \"humanitarian case.\" Michael explained that his brother has a 3-year-old son who, after losing his mother on Oct. 7, has only his father left. \"If this is not a humanitarian case, I don\u2019t know what is,\" he said.",

President Trump\u2019s more aggressive stance could bring results.\"",
      "\"The report we are submitting to the U.N. is a harrowing testimony to the brutal experiences suffered by the hostages in Hamas captivity,\" said Israel\u2019s Health Minister Uriel Busso. \"These are actions that cannot be tolerated and demand that the world wake up and take action.\"",

Security Council for its treatment of the hostages issue. \"The U.N. and the international community are trying to forget the torture and atrocities that took place on Oct. 7. We will never forget the horrors, and we will not stop until we return all the hostages.\"",
      "Dr. Hagar Mizrahi, head of the Ministry\u2019s Medical Directorate, added, \"The severe physical and mental states of the returnees offer the world a glimpse into the widespread atrocities committed by Hamas. The condition of all hostages still held in Gaza is dire. It is imperative that all efforts be made to bring them back.\"",

      "The Ministry of Health\u2019s report is divided into two sections. The first outlines the physical and psychological abuse endured by hostages during their captivity, based on testimonies from medical teams who treated the returnees. The second section focuses on rehabilitation models designed to help returnees recover, informed by data from specialized clinics.",
      "UN SILENT AS GUTERRES CALLS FOR HOSTAGE RELEASE, RECEIVES 'THUNDEROUS' APPLAUSE ON GAZA",
      "Psychological abuse was equally devastating, according to the report. Hostages were isolated and forced to witness acts of violence. Survivors reported intense trauma, including dissociative episodes, severe nightmares, and an overwhelming sense of guilt for leaving loved ones behind. Many remain unable to adjust to normal life, haunted by the horrors they endured.",
      "The report\u2019s release has triggered mixed reactions. While it validates the survivors\u2019 suffering, it also reopens emotional wounds for families and returnees. \"The detailed documentation underscores the urgency for international intervention,\" said Dr. Hagai Levin, head of the Health Team for Hostages and Missing Families Forum.",
      "Levin emphasized the complexity of treating released hostages. \"They face profound psychological challenges, including PTSD, anxiety, depression, and difficulty reintegrating into daily life,\" he explained. \"Children often experience developmental regression and heightened anxiety. Rehabilitation requires a multidisciplinary, long-term approach.\"",

Using human trafficking, drug smuggling, and organized violence, they threaten American security and regional stability. Stronger sanctions, unwavering resolve, and decisive action are essential to dismantle the threat this criminal regime poses to the United States and its allies.

      "OTTAWA, Canada \u2014 With Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s announcement on Monday morning that he will step down as Liberal Party leader, whoever succeeds him will face Official Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre, whose Conservative Party has nearly\u00a0three times the support of committed voters (47% compared to 18% for the Liberals) in this year\u2019s general election.",
      "First elected to the House of Commons in 2004, 45-year-old, Calgary-born Poilievre, 45, became leader of the Canadian Conservatives in 2022 and has seen his party grow in popularity as Canadians have grown tired of 53-year-old Trudeau, whose Liberals formed government in 2015.",
      "\"Bring home the Canadian dream\" has been one of the Conservatives\u2019 major themes, and Poilievre has cast the Liberals as governing with \u2018an extremely radical ideology,\u2019 which he described as \"basically authoritarian socialism,\" in a recent\u00a090-minute interview with popular podcast host Jordan Peterson.",

      "\"People are sick and tired of grandiosity,\" said Poilievre. \"Horrendous, utopian wokeism\" serves, he said, \"egotistical personalities on top,\" rather than \"common people.\"",
      "Trudeau has said that Poilievre wants to\u00a0\"make Canada great again,\" comparing the Tory leader to incoming U.S. President Donald Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" mantra.",
      "But while Poilievre\u2019s populist messaging has generated comparisons to Trump\u2019s political approach, the Canadian Conservative leader has pushed back the president-elect\u2019s recent comments about making Canada the 51st state.",
      "\"I have the strength and the smarts to stand up for this country and my message to incoming President Trump is that first and foremost, Canada will never be the 51st state of the U.S.,\" Poilievre said in an interview with Canadian broadcaster,\u00a0CTV News, before Christmas.",
      "Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau speaks with media outside Rideau Cottage on Monday, Jan. 6, in Ottawa. (AP/Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)",
      "The incoming Trump administration will almost assuredly deal with a Poilievre government as the Conservatives are poised to win the next Canadian election, which could come as early as this spring. When the House of Commons resumes sitting on March 24, the opposition parties are likely to defeat the minority Liberal government in a vote of no-confidence, which would trigger a national vote.",
      "In his Peterson interview, Poilievre acknowledged that Trump \u2014 who has proposed a 25% tariff against Canadian exports \u2014 \"negotiates very aggressively, and he likes to win.\" But as prime minister, the Conservative leader said that he would seek \"a great deal that will make both countries safer, richer and stronger.\"",

      "Poilievre said that he would accelerate approvals to build oil refineries, liquefied natural gas plants and nuclear facilities, and increase its electricity surplus with the U.S.",
      "He also told Peterson that Canada sells its oil and gas to the U.S. at \"enormous discounts,\" which he characterized as a \"ripoff,\" in which \"Canada is ripping itself off.\"",
      "A Poilievre-led government would also embark on \"the biggest crackdown on crime in Canadian history\" and that \"habitual offenders will not get out of jail anymore,\" the Conservative leader said.",
      "On foreign affairs, the Canadian Conservatives\u2019 2023 policy document states that it would, as government, \"take the required steps to renegotiate the Safe Third Country Agreement with the U.S. to close the gaps relating to illegal entries in Canada,\" and that the Conservative Party recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

      "In a statement released in response to Trudeau\u2019s resignation on Monday, Poilievre said that \"this changes nothing\" and that a Conservative Canadian government would \"take back control of our border, take back control of immigration, take back control of spending, deficits and inflation. Take back control of our streets by locking up criminals, banning drugs, treating addiction and stopping gun smugglers.\"",

    "story": [
      "The wind-driven wildfires burning out of control in the Los Angeles area couldn't have emerged at a more perilous moment for California's homeowners, as officials try to rehab what they concede is a deepening \"insurance crisis.\"",
      "\"We were all thinking 2025 is going to be the year insurers regain their appetite for the market in California, but having this catastrophe hit us right out of the gate is really unfortunate,\" said Amy Bach, the executive director of United Policyholders, a California-based nonprofit consumer group.",
      "Follow live coverage here",
      "\"Up until this latest disaster,\" she said, \"we thought we might be turning a corner.\"",
      "The state Department of Insurance issued a new regulation last month meant to turn the tide of some of the largest insurance companies' refusal to take on new customers in California or decisions not to renew policies of current ones. Under the rule, insurance companies are permitted to pass on the cost of reinsurance to consumers, although at an amount that can't exceed an industry standard.",
      "Reinsurance is protection that insurance companies acquire to shield themselves from catastrophic claim events.",
      "The Insurance Department said California had been the only state that didn't allow the cost to be passed on.",
      "In return, insurers doing business in the state must again provide coverage in fire-prone areas at a mandated amount. Another rule finalized last month allows insurers to incorporate catastrophe modeling into their rates on the condition that they increase their policy offerings in underserved areas of the state.",
      "\"Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,\" Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a previous statement. \"This is a historic moment for California.\"",
      "The actions, however, drew scrutiny from consumer advocates who worry it will only lead to sharply increased premiums.",
      "Lara's office didn't immediately respond Wednesday to a request for comment in the wake of the latest wildfires.",
      "The ongoing Palisades Fire is poised to become one of the state's costliest: Fire officials said Wednesday that more than 11,800 acres have been destroyed and that 1,000 structures have been burned, while a J.P. Morgan Insurance analysis estimates\u00a0insured losses from that blaze alone could approach $10 billion. At least four other significant fires have erupted, as well.",
      "The J.P. Morgan analysts note that the area of the Palisades Fire is \"an affluent residential area, with a median home price\" exceeding $3 million.",
      "Bach said homeowners in California might pay anywhere from $1,000 to upward of $40,000 a year to insure their properties.",
      "While no law mandates that property owners in the state must carry insurance, those with mortgages are required to have it. Typical property insurance policies, however, don't generally cover damage from disasters such as earthquakes, floods and landslides. Separate insurance policies are required to protect against those types of calamities.",
      "The concern isn't whether insurance companies will pay out for damage but rather how much and how long it will take, Bach said.",
      "\"For the people who lose their homes in these wildfires, there will be fights over coverage,\" she said.",
      "But that's if they have insurance at all.",
      "In the wealthy Pacific Palisades neighborhood ravaged by the wildfires, some homeowners were blindsided in March when State Farm announced it would stop renewing their coverage.",
      "State Farm, the largest home insurer in California, said its decision was \"not made lightly.\" It blamed costs associated with inflation, catastrophe exposure, reinsurance and regulations for its need to protect 'its bottom line.",
      "The devastation wrought by wildfires in particular, leading to tens of billions of dollars' worth of insured property losses in California over the past decade, has only grown more intense as climate change leads to rising temperatures, longer fire seasons and heightened drought conditions.",
      "State Farm said in a nonrenewal letter provided to the state that the 30,000 property insurance policyholders who were being dropped across California lived in areas deemed to \"present the most substantial wildfire or fire following earthquake hazards.\" Los Angeles' Westside region was hardest-hit by the company's decision, which went into effect last summer. In Pacific Palisades, more than 1,600 policies weren't renewed.",
      "State Farm had already said in 2023 that it would no longer offer home insurance to new customers in California, in part because of catastrophe exposure. Allstate, the sixth-largest home insurer in California, also said that year it was halting new policies in the state.",
      "Asked about its homeowner coverage in the areas affected by the wildfires, State Farm said in a statement Wednesday that its \"number one priority right now is the safety of our customers, agents and employees impacted by the fires and assisting our customers in the midst of this tragedy.\"",
      "California does have an insurance program under the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, established in the 1960s, which provides fire insurance coverage for high-risk properties. The coverage is basic and funded by the insurance companies.",
      "While it's meant as a last resort for homeowners, its use has only soared in recent years, from nearly 154,500 residential policies in September 2019 to more than 408,400 in June \u2014 creating a high risk exposure that state officials say was never intended.",
      "But there had been a glimmer that some insurance companies are willing to fill the voids in the market. On Tuesday, Mercury Insurance, an independent home insurer in California, announced it would begin writing new homeowners insurance policies in the town of\u00a0Paradise,\u00a0the site of the deadly\u00a0Camp Fire\u00a0in 2018, which is considered to be the worst wildfire in modern state history.",
      "Janet Ruiz, the chief spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute, which represents the insurance industry, told NBC Bay Area that the reality is companies have to manage how much they can handle in the face of destructive wildfires and rising reconstruction costs.",
      "\"California is the fourth-largest insurance market in the world,\" Ruiz said. \"We want to be here, we want to be a part of it, but we do need to make some profit.\"",
      "Bach said that if the state succeeds in motivating insurance companies to get back into the market and become competitive, it could be a benefit for consumers.",
      "But she said she worries that the latest wildfires may only have an opposite effect on already skittish insurers.",
      "\"Home insurance is an essential good that the private market is increasingly unwilling to provide,\" Bach said. \"We are at a crossroads.\""

There were multiple fires, as embers were sort of crisscrossing the area,\u201d Hurwitz told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Jansing on Wednesday. \u201cThe ferocity of the fire led us to think that we needed to get out of our house, and get out of our house very quickly.\u201d",
      "Follow live coverage here",
      "The fires\u2019 explosive growth across large swaths of Pasadena, Altadena, Sylmar and Pacific Palisades has taken many by surprise, stretching emergency services to capacity and leaving residents with little warning to evacuate. More than 80,000 residents were abruptly forced to evacuate, with some abandoning their cars on the Pacific Coast Highway and escaping on foot.",
      "The region\u2019s three main fires were at zero percent containment as of Wednesday afternoon, fueled by dry conditions, and have killed at least five people, according to authorities. The Palisades Fire has torched the largest area at more than 15,800 acres, followed by the Eaton Fire, which has charred 10,600 acres. The Hurst Fire has burned 505 acres, according to CAL FIRE\u2019s website.",
      "On Tuesday morning, Hurwitz was home working when he started seeing plumes of smoke outside from the Palisades Fire. His children, ages 9 and 11, were at school about a mile and a half away, he said, and it quickly became clear that he needed to go pick them up.",
      "Hurwitz packed up a few more possessions, including clothes, a laptop, and the family\u2019s pets: a rescue dog, Lily, and a hamster, Wolfy. As he and his wife left the house, Hurwitz realized how much they were leaving behind. But, he added: \u201cOur possessions and our house are one thing. Our lives, our pets\u2019 lives, our kids\u2019 lives are what were paramount. And we didn\u2019t want to take any chances.\u201d",
      "The family is staying with relatives in Ventura, about 60 miles up the coast. They fear that their house is one of the approximately 1,000 structures destroyed by the Palisades Fire, though they won\u2019t be able to see the extent of the damage until they return.",
      "Other evacuees faced similar decisions about what to pack as they fled the flames. Mallory Sobel, who lives in the Pacific Palisades Highlands neighborhood, said she left with just a bag of emergency supplies and her family\u2019s passports. She was tempted to gather photos, too, before she embarked on what turned into a 2 1/2-hour drive to get out of the neighborhood, where homes were shrouded in thick smoke.",
      "\u201cOf course there were lots of things around the house I wanted to keep, but it was all too intense,\u201d Sobel said. \u201cI needed to leave.\u201d",
      "In nearby Topanga, Rabbi Mendy Piekarski rushed to evacuate people from a Chabad Lubavitch synagogue and cultural center Wednesday. He and his colleagues called the parents of 25 students who attended preschool there, and within an hour, all the kids had been picked up and driven out of the evacuation zone.",
      "Piekarski said he and his wife loaded the Chabad\u2019s sacred Torah scrolls into their car before leaving the building, wrapping the bundles of parchment in tallit, a fringed garment worn as a prayer shawl.",
      "\u201cWe cherish them very much and they\u2019re very valuable, so we made sure to bring them to a safe location outside Topanga,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would have loved to take other holy objects, like prayer books, though we didn\u2019t have enough time. It was about taking the most important things: our family and the Torah scrolls.\u201d",
      "He would have liked to take more.",
      "\u201cBut safety is the main thing,\u201d he said.",
      "Hurwitz agrees.",
      "\u201cOur possessions don\u2019t define us. We\u2019re defined by our family relationships and by our experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, we recognize that, especially for our kids, it\u2019s just a lot of upheaval.\u201d"

      "Carter was a little-known figure outside his native Georgia before running for and winning the presidency in 1976.",
      "He served only one term, rejected by voters upset about a global oil crisis and the kidnapping of American diplomats by Islamist revolutionaries in Iran.",

      "Less than a year earlier, the teenage quarterback from the Dallas suburbs had backed away from his commitment to play for the Texas Longhorns and reopened his recruitment. Now, he was seemingly next in line to help the powerhouse Buckeyes win college football\u2019s national championship.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t regret any decision I\u2019ve made on going or anything like that,\u201d Ewers told reporters ahead of Friday\u2019s Cotton Bowl, the site of one semifinal. He said his\u00a0relationships with many at Ohio State still \u201cfeel like if I\u2019d see them walking down the side of the road, it would be like I was hanging out with them yesterday.\u201d",

      "Beginning in June 2021, players were at last legally able to be compensated for the use of their names, images and likenesses (and, in the future, players also will be able to earn shares of the revenue their schools generate). At the same time, relaxed rules have made it easier than ever to transfer between schools without penalty.",
      "Initially on track to graduate from high school in the spring of 2022, Ewers instead skipped his senior year of high school and reclassified to the class of 2021 to sign with Ohio State.",
      "Part of his motivation was his relationships with coaches such as Ryan Day, who offered Ewers a scholarship when he was in the eighth grade. (\u201cHe was a boy at the time, really, who just had a tremendous release,\u201d Day said.)\u00a0But a significant factor in his decision to speed up his path to college, Ewers said Monday, was the opportunity to cash in on NIL payments as a collegiate athlete that he wouldn\u2019t have been permitted to earn had he remained a high school student in Texas.",
      "\u201cOne of the main things was that there was that, I don\u2019t know if you guys remember or not, but the Texas Legislature wasn\u2019t going to allow high school football players to be paid,\u201d Ewers said. \u201cAnd me and my family had a pretty big opportunity in front of us that we felt that it was a good decision for me to go on and forgo my senior year and enroll early at Ohio State and I have the opportunity to have some good money in our pockets as a family.\u201d",
      "Days before he stepped on campus at Ohio State in August 2021, Ewers announced his first endorsement \u2014 with a kombucha company. Soon, ESPN reported, Ewers had signed an NIL deal with a sports marketing company worth\u00a0$1.4 million over three years.",

      "As the Longhorns\u2019 starting quarterback for the past three seasons, Ewers has tapped into those resources as lucratively as anyone in college sports. He has signed as many as 25 NIL deals, according to\u00a0one tally by On3, with companies that make a variety of products, like tea, video games and jerky, as well as a streaming network.",
      "Ewers might have one more twist in his career path still to come. In late December, On3 reported\u00a0that Ewers, who could turn pro and declare for the NFL draft this month, has been offered $6 million by an unnamed school to enter the NCAA\u2019s transfer portal and sign to play another season of college there. From strictly a financial perspective, Ewers is already one of the biggest winners of college sports\u2019 new era of permissiveness. Now, he\u2019s trying to be the big winner of the College Football Playoff\u2019s ultimate prize.",

    "published": "Wed, 08 Jan 2025 23:23:04 GMT",
    "summary": "To researchers who have studied moderation efforts and platforms, it\u2019s the most recent move toward a more freewheeling and unbridled social media environment.",
    "story": [
      "First, it was Elon Musk. Now, it\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg.",
      "Meta\u2019s announcement that it would be ending its fact-checking program and shifting policies around content moderation \u2014 a move that Zuckerberg said was inspired by Musk\u2019s X \u2014 marks a new high-water mark for a worldview, pushed in large part by conservatives, that frames centralized efforts to control mis- and disinformation as censorship rather than public service.",
      "Zuckerberg, who once touted the importance of the company\u2019s moderation efforts, echoed that worldview Tuesday when he said that times had changed and the new shift would reduce \u201ccensorship\u201d and \u201crestore free expression\u201d \u2014 a message that was quickly embraced by some Republican pundits and politicians.",
      "To researchers who have both studied moderation efforts and platforms, it\u2019s the most recent move toward a more freewheeling and unbridled social media environment, where what is real and what isn\u2019t will come to be blurred.",
      "\u201cThe fact-checking program was never going to save Facebook, but it was the last bulwark to complete chaos on the platform,\u201d said Nina Jankowicz, former head of a disinformation board within the Department of Homeland Security, who now helms a nonprofit organization focused on countering attacks on disinformation researchers. \u201cAnd now Mark Zuckerberg is choosing chaos.\u201d",
      "Along with getting rid of fact-checkers, Meta will remove restrictions around topics that have fueled recent political culture wars, including immigration, issues around trans people and gender. Announcing the policies on Fox News, Meta\u2019s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, said the company had been \u201ctoo restrictive.\u201d",
      "A close reading of Meta\u2019s updated policy guidelines reveals that Meta now explicitly allows users to call each other mentally ill based on their gender identity or sexual orientation, among other changes.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump addressed the changes at a news conference. Asked by a reporter whether Zuckerberg was \u201cdirectly responding to the threats that you have made to him in the past,\u201d Trump replied, \u201cProbably.\u201d",
      "Researchers and advocacy groups framed Zuckerberg\u2019s announcement as a political capitulation to the incoming president \u2014 the most recent in a series of changes at Meta that they say reflect a willing submission before Trump takes office.",
      "Jankowicz characterized the choice as a response to the potential threat of regulation and investigation.",
      "\u201cThis was after two years of Zuckerberg being hounded by the weaponization committee,\u201d Jankowicz said, referring to House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan\u2019s Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government \u2014 one of the latest tools used by Republicans to institutionalize their complaints around social media and political bias.",
      "Facebook launched its fact-checking program in 2016, following criticism that it had facilitated the spread of so-called fake news leading up to the presidential election. Facebook, like many other tech platforms, had grown quickly in the past decade and come under growing scrutiny for what it did \u2014 and notably did not\u00a0do \u2014 to regulate the posting and recommendation of content in its increasingly influential News Feed. Zuckerberg and other tech executives reacted quickly to public pressure from politicians, journalists and advocacy organizations, instituting a variety of new roles and moderation processes meant to crack down on issues like harassment and misinformation.",
      "\u201cWe take misinformation seriously,\u201d Zuckerberg wrote in a 2016 post.",
      "In 2020, Meta\u2019s program expanded and the company rolled out new features to address widespread misinformation around Covid and the 2020 election. Zuckerberg repeatedly touted its fact-checking efforts and partners, including at a 2021 House Energy and Commerce committee hearing, where he seemingly called out Trump for inciting the January 6th attacks, saying, \u201cI believe that the former president should be responsible for his words.\u201d",
      "At the same time, academics and researchers worked to understand how these platforms operated and their impact on users.",
      "What was initially a relatively uncontroversial field would quickly become the subject of partisan attacks, with Republicans claiming that tech companies were biased and their moderation efforts were unfairly targeting conservatives. Published research has pushed back against claims that conservatives are disproportionately moderated because of biased systems and tech employees, with data that suggests conservatives are more likely to share misinformation \u2014 sometimes putting them in the crosshairs of platforms\u2019 policies.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s a sportsball game and one team fouls four times as much, it\u2019s not \u2018biased\u2019 for the ref to call four times as many fouls against that team,\u201d Kate Starbird, a professor at University of Washington and co-founder of its Center for an Informed Public, posted to Bluesky following the Meta announcement.",
      "Despite the data, Republican complaints of censorship began to take hold as a political narrative and also in Silicon Valley. The most obvious answer to the negative attention such research brought was to shut down access. In 2021, Facebook quietly disbanded the team behind CrowdTangle, which worked under Facebook\u2019s ownership for five years and provided data to researchers and journalists, slow-marching the transparency tool to its eventual death last year. In 2022, Elon Musk acquired Twitter and, along with renaming the company X, he decimated the structures charged with content moderation \u2014 slashing whole teams, reversing policies, cutting off access to researchers and feeding internal communications to right-wing journalists that would become the backbone of Rep. Jordan\u2019s congressional committee. Known as the Twitter Files, these series of posts on the platform alleged collusion between disinformation researchers, Twitter employees and government agencies, to censor conservatives.",
      "Republican politicians also began to move beyond critiques to bring political pressure to bear on both tech platforms and independent researchers.",
      "Rep. Jordan launched his investigation into the \u201cweaponization\u201d of the federal government in 2023. Jordan\u2019s committee subpoenaed Zuckerberg and other tech companies for documents aimed at proving a conspiracy between government, disinformation researchers and Big Tech. In July, Jordan threatened and then paused a vote to hold Zuckerberg in contempt of Congress for failing to fully comply with the request for documents. In its final report, a 17,000-page document released in December, the committee praised its \u201creal effect,\u201d including the shuttering of disinformation research and Zuckerberg\u2019s statement, in a letter to Jordan, that Facebook had been pressured by Biden administration officials to \u201ccensor certain COVID-19 content,\u201d an assertion disputed by a June Supreme Court decision.",
      "Meta\u2019s announcement comes on the heels of other efforts that seemingly align with the new administration: Trump ally and Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White joined Meta\u2019s board of directors this week; the company donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration; last week it promoted Joel Kaplan, a former adviser to George W. Bush with deep Republican ties, from vice president to head of global policy; and last month Zuckerberg dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, a meeting the incoming deputy chief of policy, Stephen Miller, characterized as reinforcing Zuckerberg as \u201ca supporter of and a participant\u201d in the change Trump intends to affect on the country.",
      "In his announcement, Zuckerberg laid blame on the legacy media, fact-checkers and Meta\u2019s own employees, calling them politically biased. To remedy the perception of that bias, Zuckerberg said he was moving Meta\u2019s trust and safety and content moderation teams from California to Texas.",
      "In an emailed statement, Starbird, the University of Washington professor, who testified about her work studying disinformation before Jordan\u2019s committee in 2023, said Meta\u2019s move to end the fact-checking program \u201cwill reduce users\u2019 ability to identify trustworthy content on Meta\u2019s products and beyond.\u201d",
      "Zuckerberg said the fact-checking program would be replaced by a system like X\u2019s \u201ccommunity notes,\u201d a sort of crowdsourced content moderation program rolled out before Elon Musk\u2019s acquisition of the company in 2022.",
      "Meta provided no further details on how it plans to fill the gap left by fact-checkers. Concerns of speed, quality of contributors and how notes will impact the feeds of users on Facebook, Instagram and Threads should be addressed transparently, said Sol Messing, a research associate professor at New York University\u2019s Center for Social Media and Politics.",
      "\u201cThe people who you get to participate will be incredibly important,\u201d said Messing. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen exactly how they\u2019re going to recruit people to write community notes and how they\u2019re going to ensure that it\u2019s not just a bunch of partisan activists who are participating.\u201d",
      "A system like community notes works best as a complement to fact-checking, not a replacement, said Renee DiResta, a research professor at Georgetown University, also targeted for her work studying disinformation while at Stanford\u2019s Internet Observatory.",
      "\u201cYes, moderation is imperfect and yes, users across the political spectrum distrust it, but platform moderation policies reflect platform values,\u201d DiResta said. \u201cIf the platform sees itself as having an obligation to ensure that its users have the best possible information, cutting fact-checking programs that it\u2019s previously touted, and appears to be continuing to support elsewhere, undermines that. This is a capitulation to political winds \u2014 and it reinforces that working the refs works.\u201d"

      "The letter was posted online by the Committee to Protect Health Care, a physicians advocacy group. Beyond his well-documented anti-vaccine views and advocacy, the letter cites other conspiracy theories Kennedy has actively spread, including baseless claims about a link between school shootings and antidepressants and his promotion of disproven treatments for Covid-19.",
      "\u201cThis appointment is a slap in the face to every health care professional who has spent their lives working to protect patients from preventable illness and death,\u201d the letter says.",
      "Kennedy has been meeting with Republican and Democratic senators on Capitol Hill in anticipation of his confirmation hearing, the date for which has not yet been set. Kennedy would need all but three Republican votes if all the Senate\u2019s Democrats vote against his confirmation.",
      "Kennedy did not return a request for comment on the letter. Asked by text about the swell of opposition from doctors and public health organizations to Trump\u2019s intention to nominate Kennedy, Katie Miller, Kennedy\u2019s spokesperson within the Trump transition team, dismissed the backlash as \u201cjust another grift\u201d that would \u201cbilk donors\u201d to advocacy groups.",
      "\u201cRobert F Kennedy Jr will be confirmed and those who are spending their time undermining him will have no place and no voice at HHS,\u201d Miller said by text. \u201cGood luck and best wishes to them.\u201d",
      "The letter and a corresponding campaign urging health care professionals to contact their senators and the American Medical Association are just the latest responses from physicians and public health advocates to Kennedy\u2019s controversial selection.",
      "The liberal nonprofit group Protect Our Care, which advocates to preserve the Affordable Care Act, also launched a campaign this week with a report and digital ads highlighting Kennedy\u2019s 2019 trip to Samoa before a measles outbreak that killed 83 people, most of them children. This week, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, a physician, wrote in The New York Times that vaccine misinformation spread by Kennedy played a role in Samoa\u2019s outbreak and warned that appointing him at the Department of Health and Human Services would jeopardize public health.",
      "In November news releases, the health care consumer advocacy group Community Catalyst called Kennedy \u201cwholly unqualified and a dangerous pick,\u201d and the nonprofit progressive consumer rights group Public Citizen said Kennedy would \u201cendanger people\u2019s lives if placed in a position of authority over health.\u201d",
      "Green appeared alongside members of Congress with backgrounds in public health Wednesday at a news conference opposing Kennedy organized by 314 Action, a progressive political action committee dedicated to electing scientists.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s allies and a dedicated PAC, American Values 2024, have framed opposition to his selection as having been orchestrated by pharmaceutical companies to silence him and impede his efforts to make America healthy.",
      "The Committee to Protect Health Care, which is not funded by the pharmaceutical industry or for-profit health corporations, has been active in opposing drug companies in state-level efforts to install prescription drug affordability boards.",
      "\u201cWe definitely are no friend of Pharma, and they\u2019re no friend to us,\u201d said the committee\u2019s executive director, Dr. Rob Davidson, a Michigan emergency room physician.",

      "That figure was quickly dismissed as implausible by budget experts, who said the entire discretionary budget was only $1.7 trillion. Musk hadn\u2019t waved people off the number until Wednesday, and it has been widely cited in reports about DOGE\u2019s plans.",
      "Musk, along with former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, is co-leading the DOGE budget-slashing effort, which Trump named in reference to an internet meme. The advisory panel has no official authority and is expected to make recommendations to the White House after Trump is sworn in for a second term.",
      "The Trump transition team didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on Musk\u2019s updated estimate.",
      "Experts have said Musk and Ramaswamy would need to propose cuts to mandatory programs such as Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, to achieve significant savings. Musk himself has warned that cuts could mean \u201chardship\u201d for some.",
      "Penn, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton, noted that Clinton was able to balance the federal budget toward the end of his time in the White House, and he asked about Musk\u2019s plans.",
      "\u201cDo you think the $2 trillion is a realistic number now that you\u2019re looking more closely at it?\u201d he asked.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019ll try for $2 trillion. I think that\u2019s the best-case outcome,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut I do think that you kind of have to have some overage. I think if we try for $2 trillion, we\u2019ve got a good shot at getting 1,\u201d he said, meaning $1 trillion in spending cuts.",
      "Musk, though, didn\u2019t admit an early defeat, saying he could still help Trump achieve \u201can epic outcome.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we can drop the budget deficit from $2 trillion to $1 trillion and free up the economy to have additional growth, such that the output of goods and services keeps pace with the increase in the money supply, then there will be no inflation. So that, I think, would be an epic outcome,\u201d he said.",
      "Penn also asked whether Musk had \u201cidentified some cuts that you\u2019re really looking at, that you think will be successful.\u201d Musk didn\u2019t name any specific cuts, though he said generally that it\u2019s a \u201cvery target-rich environment for saving money.\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:45:58 GMT",
    "summary": "Current acting ICE Director P.J. Lechleitner also told NBC he felt the Biden administration should have been more transparent and forthcoming on immigration.",
    "story": [
      "Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director P.J. Lechleitner said in an interview that President Joe Biden should \u201cabsolutely\u201d have acted sooner to tighten border security to reduce the flow of migrants into the United States.",
      "Lechleitner, who became acting director in July 2023 and is preparing to leave the job this week before the new administration brings in its own appointee, told NBC News on Wednesday that the number of incoming migrants meant his agency had to give staff to help Customs and Border Protection, leaving ICE unable \u201cto do our own core mission adequately.\u201d He also said he was not alone in feeling Biden should have moved faster.",
      "\u201cI think the career people in DHS would have liked that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd all of us in DHS, quite frankly, I don\u2019t know if anybody in DHS wouldn\u2019t have wanted that earlier.\u201d",
      "Lechleitner was referring to executive action Biden took last June to restrict people who crossed the border illegally from claiming asylum.\u00a0By September,\u00a0the monthly total of illegal border crossings had dropped to 54,000, the lowest since Biden took office.\u00a0The drop brought the numbers in line with pre-pandemic Trump levels from the fall of 2019. And the numbers have continued to fall, with only 46,000 migrants crossing illegally in November.",
      "The change was so rapid that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u00a0could no longer find\u00a0migrants to fill buses to send to cities such as New York and Chicago as he had done earlier in the Biden administration.",
      "Lechleitner\u2019s opinions do not necessarily reflect the views of the administration. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In an interview with USA Today published this week, Biden was asked if he had any regrets and he did not mention the southern border. Lechleitner says he\u2019s not surprised that Biden has not identified the lack of action at the border as a regret.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate because I think we could have done more,\u201d he said.",
      "Pressed for specifics, he added, \u201cWe could have put more resources to it, either at CBP, for the border itself, and with ICE. And we could have went and tried to get more of these individuals in the nondetained docket,\u201d he said, referring to arrests of undocumented people outside of ICE custody.",
      "\u201cWe could have detained more people, and we could have removed more people. And I think we could use more resources and support. We could have done that in the last four years,\u201d he said.",
      "Lechleitner has been with the Department of Homeland Security since its inception in 2003 and has served under both Republican and Democratic administrations. After being appointed acting ICE director last year,\u00a0Lechleitner said that he had often asked for more resources for an agency that, according to him, was chronically underfunded.",
      "ICE deported a little more than 47,000 migrants in fiscal year 2024. Lechleitner said ICE could\u00a0not have deported any more than that using the same resources.\u00a0\u201cWe\u2019re burning hot,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at maximum resource capacity. At this point, we\u2019re going to need more money and resources to increase, and with more money and resources, we can increase detention, we can increase removal operations.\u201d",
      "Lechleitner also said he wishes that the Biden administration had been more transparent with the American public about immigration issues and that it had given his agency the freedom to be more vocal and public about its work and concerns, in part because more communication could have reduced misinformation.",
      "\u201cThey should [have] allowed us more opportunity to explain what we\u2019re doing and explain the hard work that ICE is doing and CBP is doing,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us talk. Let us demystify. Because, if not, people are going to just make their own stories up about what\u2019s going on, and it\u2019s going to be more problematic.\u201d",
      "According to Lechleitner, higher-ups prevented his team from doing monthly news conferences that were initially announced.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know exactly why they stopped,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you know, we were only allowed to do so much.\u201d",
      "Another source of frustration Lechleitner identified was cities that adhered to sanctuary policies under which they will not tell ICE when undocumented people are being released from jail.",
      "\u201cIt drives me nuts when our local and state partners, you know, won\u2019t cooperate with us on some of these immigration issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Come on, man, these are public safety, national security threats. And why? Why can\u2019t we just cooperate and just do this to protect the American public?\u2019\u201d",
      "Lechleitner said he wishes the new administration well but cautioned that if it is serious about prioritizing the arrest of migrants with criminal backgrounds, it will be expensive and difficult.",
      "\u201cThe American people have spoken, and hopefully, knock on wood, we\u2019re going to get a lot more support for the workforce to do our job in a more, you know, meaningful way. But we need resources. Give us more resources. Give us more personnel, give us more support, and we can do more.\u201d"

      "Alito said in a statement that they spoke Tuesday afternoon after one of his former law clerks, William Levi, \"asked me to take a call from President-elect Trump regarding his qualifications to serve in a government position.\"",
      "\"I agreed to discuss this matter with President-elect Trump, and he called me yesterday afternoon,\" Alito said in the statement, which was first reported by ABC News. \"We did not discuss the emergency application he filed today, and indeed, I was not even aware at the time of our conversation that such an application would be filed.\"",
      "On Wednesday morning, Trump asked the Supreme Court to halt legal proceedings in his hush money case ahead of his sentencing hearing, which is scheduled for Friday.",
      "In the filing, the president-elect's lawyers argued that Trump is already protected by presidential immunity, and that the high court should block the New York proceedings in order \"to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the Presidency and the operations of the federal government.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has not yet responded to Trump's request.",
      "The emergency filing came after a New York judge on Monday rejected Trump\u2019s request by declining to block the sentencing. Around noon on Tuesday, a New York appeals court judge also rejected Trump's bid.",
      "Alito said that he and Trump \"did not discuss any other matter that is pending or might in the future come before the Supreme Court or any past Supreme Court decisions involving the President-elect.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday night.",
      "Alito came under scrutiny last year after an upside-down American flag flew outside of his Virginia home. The upside-down flag was previously adopted as a protest symbol by some Trump supporters who falsely believed the 2020 election was stolen.",
      "Alito said at the time that he \"had nothing whatsoever to do with the flying of that flag,\" noting in a letter to members of Congress that as soon as he saw the flag, he asked his wife Martha-Ann Alito to take it down, \"but for several days, she refused.\"",
      "After the incident, several congressional Democrats urged Alito to recuse himself from cases involving Trump. Alito declined."

      "The outcome reflected shifts in the power balance in Lebanon and the\u00a0wider Middle East, with Shi\u2019ite Muslim Hezbollah badly pummeled from last year\u2019s war, and its Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad toppled in December.",
      "It also indicated a revival of Saudi influence in a country where Riyadh\u2019s role was eclipsed by Iran and Hezbollah long ago.",

      "Aoun fell short of the 86 votes needed in a first round vote, but crossed the threshold with 99 votes in a second round, according to Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, after lawmakers from Hezbollah and its Shi\u2019ite ally the Amal Movement backed him.",
      "Momentum built behind Aoun on Wednesday as Hezbollah\u2019s long preferred candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, withdrew and declared support for the army commander, and as French and Saudi envoys shuttled around Beirut, urging his election in meetings with politicians, three Lebanese political sources said.",

      "Aoun has a key role in shoring up a\u00a0ceasefire\u00a0between Hezbollah and Israel which was brokered by Washington and Paris in November. The terms require the Lebanese military to deploy into south Lebanon as Israeli troops and Hezbollah withdraw forces.",

Trump\u2019s envoy Steve Witkoff is flying to Doha, Qatar, this week, where\u00a0the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa,\u00a0Brett McGurk, has been participating in this latest round of talks since last weekend.",

      "Witkoff told reporters at Trump's Florida resort that he\u2019s traveling to \u201chopefully finish it up\u201d and outlined some of the deal.",
      "He said that \u201caspirationally,\u201d the Trump team hoped to get a 42-day ceasefire \"enacted sometime before the inaugural.\u201d",
      "A senior Biden administration official told NBC News on Tuesday that it\u2019ll know within the next 24 to 48 hours if a deal was likely, but that there is a decent chance of reaching one.",
      "The deal includes 34 hostages, though it\u2019s unclear how many are  still be alive, according to a separate senior administration official.",

      "But another senior administration official cautioned that \u201cit\u2018s possible that we get there, but it\u2019s not on the verge. Hamas has to reach a political decision that they want to do this and that it\u2019s now or never.\u201d",
      "The negotiations have been tense, with this official saying \u201cwe\u2019re finding that Sinwar\u2019s brother, Mohammed Sinwar, is even more stubborn than his deceased brother.\" (Mohammed succeeded his brother, Yahya Sinwar, as Hamas' leader after Yahya was killed by Israel Defense Forces in October.)",

      "The Trump and Biden teams have been working in tandem on the deal since shortly after the election, with Witkoff praising Biden\u2019s team \u2014 but also suggesting that Trump\u2019s reputation is driving the negotiations and that \u201cit\u2019s [his] strength that is moving things.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of a 42-day ceasefire, that is beyond when the president will be inaugurated,\u201d Witkoff told reporters Tuesday. \u201cSo it will be the president who is going to be most relevant. He will be in office when that 42-day ceasefire is over \u2014 that\u2019s what Hamas cares about, how we move to phase two.\u201d",

      "But another senior administration official downplayed Witkoff\u2019s role, saying that \u201cwe are at this stage in negotiations thanks to painstaking diplomacy over many months,\u201d pointing out that the deal on the table is the same as the one Biden outlined in May.",
      "That said, the official noted, \u201cthe obstacle remains Hamas, and the pressure on Hamas will only continue until it agrees to release hostages pursuant to that proposal.\u201d The official says, \u201cWe are collaborating with \"Steve) Witkoff and are in consultations with him and the Trump team. We are keeping them informed because we want to make sure if this doesn\u2019t come together by January 20th\u00a0there\u2019s a smooth handoff.\u201d",

      "A U.S. official, however, wouldn\u2019t give a number but said is it lower than previously believed.",

      "Israeli and American families of hostages have been calling for the return of the bodies of their loved ones for suitable burials and are also pressing Israeli and U.S. negotiators to make the release of hostages who are still alive their top priority.",
      "CORRECTION: (Jan. 9, 2025, 02:19 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the first name of the former Hamas leader. He is Yahya Sinwar, not Yahta Sinwar."

      "Temple operator, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), apologized for the incident and promised action against anyone found responsible.",
      "Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, a key ally of\u00a0Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, inspected the stampede site and visited some of the injured in hospital.",
      "YSR Congress Party, the main opposition party led by Naidu\u2019s predecessor Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, blamed the state government for the incident, calling it an administrative failure.",
      "Modi\u00a0offered condolences in a post on X, adding, \u201cMy thoughts are with those who have lost their near and dear ones.\u201d"

      "She continued, \u201cYou fall in love with somebody and you realize he\u2019s not leaving his career. He\u2019s not leaving Philadelphia. I\u2019m not leaving Hollywood. When you have children, it\u2019s very difficult.\u201d",

      "But the \"It's Always Sunny\" episode will cast the episode \u2014 and its jokes \u2014 in a new light.",

He taps every contestant on the shoulder, both to capture the moment on camera and to demonstrate to contestants what it feels like to be selected as a traitor. Then Cumming continues to circle, making theatrical motions with his arms to add a bit of confusion to the process. He even goes around the table backward.",

    "story": [
      "When Zendaya walked the Golden Globes red carpet on Jan. 5, it wasn\u2019t her and long-time stylist Law Roach\u2019s ability to perfect a look that caught people\u2019s attention.",
      "It was the diamond rock perched on her left ring finger.",
      "Fans began speculating Zendaya was wearing an engagement ring, indicating she and Tom Holland had decided to take the next step in their relationship.",
      "TMZ and People reported the engagement on Jan. 6, citing sources close to the couple. TODAY.com has reached out to Zendaya and Holland for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "Zendaya is keeping mum \u2014 but her ring tells a story, jewelry experts say.",
      "Laura Taylor, an engagement ring specialist at the U.K. based jewelry brand Lorel Diamonds, estimates the diamond in Zendaya\u2019s ring comes in at about five carats. The stone has a horizontal, or \u201ceast-west,\u201d orientation and is set a Georgian-style cut-down, also called a button-back setting. The ring is two-tone, featuring both gold and silver-hued metals.",
      "The effect, Taylor says, is the perfect example of \u201cOld Hollywood glamour with a modern twist.\u201d The cushion-cut diamond and the button-back setting give the ring vintage familiarity, whereas the east-west orientation and mixed metals make it feel edgy.",
      "Typically found in antiques, the button-back setting is unique because the jewel is fully encircled with metal and prongs (in this case, six), allowing it to sit lower on the band. Taylor calls the low setting a \u201cpractical\u201d choice with an heirloom feel.",
      "The east-west orientation, an alternative to the more typical vertical style, also gives the ring an edge. \u201cIt\u2019s a subtle yet confident way to say, \u2018We\u2019re doing this our way,\u2019\u201d Taylor says.",
      "The east-west orientation also symbolizes \u201cequal partnership and commitment,\u201d Julia Briggs Parsons, founder and CEO of luxury jewelry brand Incredible Rising, says.",
      "Jewelry content creator and gemstone wholesaler Julia Hackman Chaf\u00e9 believes the ring was designed by Jessica McCormack. TODAY.com has reached out to the jeweler for comment. \u201cShe\u2019s giving quiet luxury \u2014 Jessica McCormack is very, \u2018If you know, you know,\u2019\u201d Chaf\u00e9 says.",
      "Based on the brand and the size of the stone, Chaf\u00e9 estimates the ring cost over $200,000.",
      "Initially, Chaf\u00e9 was surprised the ring was not designed by Bulgari, as Zendaya is an ambassador for the luxury brand. In fact, Zendaya and Bulgari\u2019s long relationship was a clue into the engagement. At the Golden Globes, Bulgari took credit for all of Zendaya\u2019s jewelry \u2014 except the ring on her left hand.",
      "The seemingly deliberate choice by the couple makes the ring all the more personal. \u201cThis engagement ring looks like it\u2019s been handed down through generations of love stories,\u201d Taylor says.",
      "Uniquely theirs, jewelers also predict features in Zendaya's ring, like the button-back setting and east-west orientation, will rise in popularity, just like Selena Gomez's recent engagement ring may do for marquise cuts.",

      "\u201cHe was wrestling with a lot inside himself, and he was trying to self-medicate and cope with all those feelings because he didn\u2019t want to put it on anyone because he loved everyone so much,\u201d Holker continued. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want other people to take on his pain.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen I would think about my husband at the time, I would think, \u2018Oh, I love that tWitch is such a great performer, but then when he comes home he feels safe enough to be Stephen,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI was with him for so long, and that\u2019s how he\u2019s been the entire relationship. I was like, \u2018It\u2019s a beautiful thing that he can be both.\u2019\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Amanda Seyfried has starred in her fair share of dramatic roles, but had no idea that her distant relative's life was like something out of a soap opera.",
      "While appearing on the PBS series \"Finding Your Roots,\" the 39-year-old made some shocking discoveries about her family.",
      "With the help of the show's host, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Seyfried traced her ancestry back four generations and learned about a relative named John Peter Ebert who was born in Germany in 1844.",
      "After immigrating to the U.S., Ebert found work as a baker in Allentown, Pennsylvania, where Seyfried grew up. Ebert later married a woman named Amanda and started a family.",
      "\"He's created his own kingdom,\" Seyfried marveled in the episode that aired on Jan. 7.",
      "Sadly, Ebert's story doesn't have a happy ending. Seyfried's ancestor was shot and killed while leaving his home one day \u2014 a tragedy that was news to Seyfried.",
      "\"It\u2019s weird. I don't know him but he's family and I'm just like, 'How dare they!' Like, find justice,\" Seyfried said.",
      "The search for Ebert's killer became a major news story, dredging up Ebert's past. Police discovered that Ebert had fathered an illegitimate son named Herbert, who soon became a prime suspect.",
      "Ebert's widow Amanda reluctantly revealed that her late husband had previously had an affair with a woman named Mary who lived in a public home for the poor. Ebert met Mary while working in the public home as a baker. Allegedly, Ebert was then let go from his job. Unbeknownst to Ebert, Mary got pregnant and gave up their son for adoption. She went on to marry and kept her son's father's identity a secret.",
      "When Herbert's identity was made public following Ebert's death, he was able to provide an alibi. He told local police that he was under the impression that a man named Peter Ebert was his father, and that he had only met him once. When Herbert read in the newspaper that he was a suspect in Ebert's death, he realized he was his father.",
      "Seyfried described the story as a \"soap opera\" and said, \"These poor people.\"",
      "Reflecting on the effects this scandal must have had on Amanda and Mary, Seyfried described the situation as \"so twisted.\"",
      "\"To harbor that and know you have this kid out in the world. Horrible. Hard,\" the actor said. \"It's just gotta feel like a knife in the stomach being twisted every day.\"",
      "Eventually, police discovered that Ebert was shot by a neighbor in a failed robbery attempt. Looking back on her ancestor's infidelity and eventual fate, Seyfried offered the following reflections.",
      "\"He was a human. He made a mistake. He put some lives in turmoil and he had to make choices. He had a lot of kids and a business and he wanted to keep his life, and he made choices that ensured that his life would be saved. Selfish as that is, he was also protecting his kids so I can turn that story around. He didn't have to be shot,\" she said.",
      "\"Nobody deserved that,\" Gates said.",
      "The show's host traced Seyfried's family tree back seven more generations and discovered the name of her 10th great-great-grandfather: Simon Ebert. Knowing that she had such deep roots in one area dating back to the 16th century made Seyfried pause and reflect for a moment.",
      "\"It makes me feel very grounded, a part of something, I guess,\" she said."

      "While appearing on the PBS show, the 53-year-old traced her family tree back several generations. With the help of host Henry Louis Gates Jr., she learned about her maternal great-great-grandfather Pedro Malhabor.",
      "Gates noted that Malhabor's last name was not Filipino in origin. Salonga said, according to family lore, Malhabor was a physics professor from Germany.",
      "The show did a bit of research, and it turns out Malhabor was more likely a naturalist than a physicist. He most likely arrived in the Philippines in the early 1870s when European naturalists visited the island on an exploratory mission. The show posited that Malhabor was among them.",
      "Gates' team found a baptism record for Malhabor's son that revealed Malhabor was from Prussia, a territory that included parts of Germany, Poland and Russia. More specifically, Malhabor likely came from modern day Germany. His wife, meanwhile, came Manila, the capital of the Philippines.",
      "\u201cI mean, the only connection that I knew with regards to the Malhabor (name) was that it was German. But beyond that, we didn\u2019t know anything about anything like this,\u201d Salonga said while reacting to the news that one of her ancestors was Prussian.",
      "Using the baptism record, the \"Finding Your Roots\" team was able to find additional ancestors of German descent. Salonga said it was \"wild\" to learn she has ancestors in Germany.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely sharing all of this with my daughter when I get home. She\u2019s going to flip cause she\u2019s the most Asian looking person. She really is,\u201d she said.",
      "Gates asked Salonga to reflect on what her her ancestors would have thought of her career.",
      "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what they would\u2019ve thought. Maybe the scientists would\u2019ve been disappointed that I ended up in the arts,\u201d she said.",
      "\"Everybody would've been happy you won that Tony (award),\" Gates playfully pointed out.",
      "\"I think so. I think at that point, everybody would've been quiet,\" she agreed.",
      "The episode also explored her father's side of the family tree. Her paternal grandfather, Feliciano P. Salonga, was born in the Philippines in 1894.",
      "After enlisting in the U.S. Navy, he worked in the boiler room of a ship.",
      "\u201cHe didn't see it as drudge work. He saw it as a way to better his own life,\u201d Salonga explained.",
      "The actor's grandfather was 47 years old when World War II broke out and had just been transferred back to Manila. Japanese forces had taken control of his homeland and massacres were common at the time. He was in particular danger since he was associated with the U.S. military.",
      "Salonga's grandfather went missing for some time at this point. Gates asked the star how she thought this may have impacted her own father, who was 12 at the time.",
      "\u201cIt might be a contributing factor as to why he wasn\u2019t an emotional person,\u201d she said.",
      "While reflecting on the discoveries Gates and his team had made, Salonga admitted that she was quite impressed with their research into her family tree.",
      "\"My mind is kind of blown,\" she said."

      "Momentum built behind Aoun on Wednesday as Hezbollah\u2019s long preferred candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, withdrew and declared support for the army commander, and as French and Saudi envoys shuttled around Beirut, urging his election in meetings with politicians, three Lebanese political sources said.",
      "\u201cThere is a very clear message from the international community that they are ready to support Lebanon, but that needs a president, a government,\u201d Michel Mouawad, a Christian lawmaker opposed to Hezbollah who voted for Aoun, told Reuters before the vote. \u201cWe did get a message from Saudi of support,\u201d he added.",
      "Aoun\u2019s election is a first step towards reviving government institutions in a country which has had neither a head of state nor a fully empowered cabinet since Aoun left office.",
      "Lebanon, its economy still reeling from a devastating\u00a0financial collapse\u00a0in 2019, is in dire need of international support to rebuild from the war, which the World Bank estimates cost the country $8.5 billion.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s system of government requires the new president to convene consultations with lawmakers to nominate a Sunni Muslim prime minister to form a new cabinet, a process that can often be protracted as factions barter over ministerial portfolios.",
      "Aoun has a key role in shoring up a\u00a0ceasefire\u00a0between Hezbollah and Israel which was brokered by Washington and Paris in November. The terms require the Lebanese military to deploy into south Lebanon as Israeli troops and Hezbollah withdraw forces.",
      "He told lawmakers on Thursday that he will work to ensure the state has the exclusive right to carry arms, in his first speech at parliament after he was elected.",
      "His comments were seen partly as a reference to Hezbollah\u2019s arsenal, which he had not commented on publicly as the former army commander.",
      "Aoun, 60, has been commander of the U.S.-backed Lebanese army since 2017. On his watch, U.S. aid continued to flow to the army, part of a long-standing U.S. policy focused on supporting state institutions to curb Hezbollah\u2019s influence."

      "\u201cIn my discussions with our European partners, a certain lack of understanding has emerged with regard to recent statements from the USA,\u201d Scholz said Wednesday, adding that \u201cthe principle of inviolability of borders applies to every country, regardless of whether it is to the east or west of us.\u201d",

      "PESHAWAR, Pakistan \u2014 The Biden administration has been in talks with the Taliban to exchange Americans detained in Afghanistan for Afghans in U.S. custody, a senior Taliban leader with direct knowledge of the negotiations told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The Taliban leader, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the issue publicly, said the two sides had been negotiating for the past two years but had so far failed to reach a deal.",
      "He said the Taliban had demanded three Afghan nationals, including Muhammad Rahim, the only Afghan prisoner left at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, a detention site in Cuba for the mostly Muslim men taken into custody around the world in the U.S. \u201cwar on terror.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials say Rahim, who has been held there without charge since 2008, was a senior aide in Al Qaeda, the terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden that carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Others say he held a much lesser role as a courier and translator and is not a national security threat.",
      "\u201cHis mother has been protesting and made several demands for his release,\u201d the Taliban leader said.",
      "The Taliban leader, who said he has participated in some of the meetings with U.S. officials, confirmed that the Taliban had captured three American nationals in the past two years.",
      "\u201cWe believe that the U.S. administration will make it happen as they are very interested in getting back their three nationals currently held in Afghanistan,\u201d he said.",
      "He did not name the three Americans, who he said were accused of spying and preaching Christianity in Afghanistan. The Taliban have previously confirmed they are holding Ryan Corbett and George Glezmann, both of whom the State Department has classified as wrongfully detained.",
      "Corbett, a longtime resident of Afghanistan before the U.S. withdrawal, was arrested on a business trip to the country in August 2022, while Glezmann was arrested during a trip in December of that year. Both men are said to have experienced declining health during their detention.",
      "The Taliban have not confirmed whether they are holding a third person, Mahmood Habibi, a naturalized American who worked for an American consulting group and was arrested in his native Afghanistan in August 2022 after the U.S. drone strike that killed Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.",
      "In addition to Rahim, the Taliban leader said, Afghan officials also demanded the release of two other Afghan nationals imprisoned in the United States who \u201chave nothing to do with terrorism or politics.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe charges leveled against them are different, and we will hopefully get them back to Afghanistan,\u201d he said.",
      "A spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said in a statement that \u201cthe safety and security of Americans overseas is one of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s top priorities, and we are working around the clock to ensure George, Ryan, and Mahmood\u2019s safe return.\"",
      "The spokesperson said that \"President Biden and his team continue to work, often in partnership with key allies, to negotiate for the release of Americans held hostage or unjustly detained abroad so that they can be reunited with their families, and the Administration will do so throughout the remainder of the term.\u201d",
      "According to a 2014 Senate report, the CIA subjected Rahim, who was captured in Pakistan, to \u201cenhanced\u201d interrogation techniques that included sleep deprivation sessions lasting up to almost six days. They did not produce any intelligence.",
      "Rahim is ineligible to leave Guant\u00e1namo, having been deemed a continuing national security threat by a federal review panel multiple times, most recently in November 2023.",
      "The U.S.-Taliban negotiations were first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "In the past four years, Biden has brought back more than 75 American citizens and residents detained around the world, including three from China in a prisoner swap this fall and four from Russia in a multinational prisoner swap last summer. In 2022, Biden approved the release of an Afghan drug lord in U.S. custody in exchange for Navy veteran Mark Frerichs, who was held captive in Afghanistan for 2\u00bd years.",
      "But agreeing to release an Afghan prisoner at Guant\u00e1namo could be politically trickier for Biden, who has come under withering criticism from lawmakers over the chaotic withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from Afghanistan in August 2021.",
      "The White House has said Biden is determined to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay before the end of his term.",
      "On Monday, the Defense Department said it transferred 11 Yemeni men\u00a0to Oman this week who had been held without charge at Guant\u00e1namo for more than two decades. Their release brings the total number of remaining detainees at Guant\u00e1namo to 15, the fewest since 2002.",

      "The Italian statement said\u00a0Sala\u00a0had been freed \u201cthanks to intense work on diplomatic and intelligence channels.\u201d It made no mention of the Abedini case. A source with knowledge of the matter said Abedini remained in a Milan prison.",

      "Over 400 people trapped by rubble in earthquake-stricken Tibet were rescued, officials in China said on Wednesday, with an unknown number still unaccounted for after a tremor rocked the Himalayan foothills and shifted the region\u2019s landscape.",
      "The epicenter of Tuesday\u2019s magnitude 6.8 quake, one of the region\u2019s most powerful tremors in recent years, was located in Tingri in China\u2019s Tibet, about 50 miles north of Mount Everest, the world\u2019s highest mountain. It also shook buildings in neighboring Nepal, Bhutan and India.",
      "The quake was so strong that part of the terrain at and around the epicenter slipped as much as 5.2 feet over a distance of 50 miles, according to an analysis by the United States Geological Survey.",
      "Twenty-four hours after the temblor struck, those trapped under rubble would have endured a night in sub-zero temperatures, adding to the pressure on rescuers looking for survivors in an area the size of Cambodia.",
      "Temperatures in the high-altitude region dropped as low as minus 0 degrees Fahrenheit overnight. People trapped or those without shelter are at risk of rapid hypothermia and may only be able to live for five to 10 hours even if uninjured, experts say.",
      "At least 126 people were known to have been killed and 188 injured on the Tibetan side, state broadcaster CCTV reported. No deaths have been reported in Nepal or elsewhere.",
      "Chinese authorities have yet to announce how many people are still missing. In Nepal, an official told Reuters the quake destroyed a school building in a village near Mount Everest, which straddles the Nepali-Tibetan border. No one was inside at the time.",
      "German climber Jost Kobusch said he was just above the Everest base camp on the Nepali side when the quake struck. His tent shook violently and he saw several avalanches crash down. He was unscathed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m climbing Everest in the winter by myself and...looks like basically I\u2019m the only mountaineer there, in the base camp there\u2019s nobody,\u201d Kobusch told Reuters in a video call.",
      "His expedition organizing company, Satori Adventure, said Kobusch had left the base camp and was descending to Namche Bazaar on Wednesday on the way to Kathmandu.",
      "But in Tibet, the damage was extensive.",
      "An initial survey showed 3,609 homes had been destroyed in the Shigatse region, home to 800,000 people, state media reported late on Tuesday. Over 1,800 emergency rescue personnel and 1,600 soldiers had been deployed.",
      "Footage broadcast on CCTV showed families huddled in rows of blue and green tents quickly erected by soldiers and aid workers in settlements surrounding the epicenter, where hundreds of aftershocks have been recorded.",
      "State media said over 30,000 people affected by the quake had been relocated.",
      "Home to some 60,000 people, Tingri is Tibet\u2019s most populous county on China\u2019s border with Nepal and is administered from the city of Shigatse, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, one of the most important figures in Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "No damage has been reported to Shigatse\u2019s Tashilhunpo monastery, state media reported, founded in 1447 by the first Dalai Lama.",
      "The 14th and current Dalai Lama, along with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Taiwan President Lai Ching-te, have expressed condolences to the earthquake\u2019s victims.",
      "500 aftershocks",
      "Southwestern parts of China, Nepal and northern India are often hit by earthquakes caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates, which are pushing up an ancient sea that is now the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.",
      "More than 500 aftershocks with magnitudes of up to 4.4 had followed the quake as of 8 a.m. local time on Wednesday (7 p.m. ET Tuesday), the China Earthquake Networks Center said.",
      "Over the past five years, there have been 29 quakes with magnitudes of 3 or above within 120 miles of the epicenter of Tuesday\u2019s temblor, according to local earthquake bureau data.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s quake was the worst in China since a 6.2 magnitude earthquake in 2023 that killed at least 149 people in a remote northwestern region.",
      "In 2008, an 8.0 magnitude earthquake hit Sichuan, claiming the lives of at least 70,000 people, the deadliest quake to hit China since the 1976 Tangshan quake that killed at least 242,000."
