      "TOKYO -- A frog holding a taro-leaf umbrella. A parade of frolicking animals. An Ukiyo-e style Mount Fuji. Giant waves. A Japanese artist who goes by the name Lito carves these delicate designs on fallen leaves, giving life back to them.",
      "The world of Lito\u2019s delicate art, which he began in 2020 and posts on social media almost daily, has won fans from around the world. The leaf art has also given him solace after earlier struggles with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a purpose in life \u2014 the joy of making people happy with his art.",
      "He enjoys working at night. From a pile of leaves treated with a wrinkle-free chemical, he picks one and places it on a cutting board.",
      "First, he outlines the design on the leaf with a pen in his right hand. Then he takes a design knife in his left hand and starts cutting the leaf carefully. Slowly, the leaf begins to take the shape of a frog carrying an umbrella \u2014 a simple design he demonstrated in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "More complex, highly intensive work on a single leaf can take more than eight hours to complete.",
      "His leaf-cutting works include titles such as \u201cScrolls of Frolicking Animals,\u201d \u201cLeaf Aquarium,\u201d and \u201cThirty-six Views of Mt. Fuji: The Great Wave off Kanagawa.\u201d Each piece includes his own twists, and often uses animals.",
      "\u201cI would rather finish it in one go when I am focused,\u201d Lito, 38, said. He didn't want to disclose his real name for personal reasons.",
      "Since his childhood, Lito says he has had high levels of concentration and patience. But he had trouble fitting into what was considered the norm at school or at work, despite all his efforts. He struggled to interpret others' feelings and to avoid confrontations.",
      "After years of difficulty, he went to a hospital at age 30 and was told he has ADHD, a diagnosis that he felt explained why he has always done things differently.",
      "He saw no point in forcing himself to do things the same way as other people, and began to adjust his life.",
      "In early 2020, Lito came across the art of leaf cutting. He saw it as the perfect use of his patience and concentration.",
      "Word of his skills has spread across social media, and he has published books on his leaf-cutting work. He holds a near monthly solo exhibition in various places in Japan.",
      "\u201cIf I can make people happy by doing what I am doing, I want to do more. That\u2019s my driving force for what's next,\u201d Lito says."

      "\"Moana 2\" brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over Thanksgiving Day weekend.",
      "NEW YORK -- Christmas came early at the box office this year.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day weekend, setting records with $221 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. That, combined with \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cGladiator II,\u201d made for an unprecedented weekend in cinemas and a confluence of blockbusters more like what\u2019s often found in late December.",
      "Expectations were high for Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cMoana 2,\u201d but the film \u2014 originally planned as a series for Disney+ before it was redirected to the big screen \u2014 blew predictions out of the water. Its five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing. (The previous best was $125 million for \u201cFrozen 2\u201d in its second week of release in 2019.) \u201cMoana 2\u201d added $165.3 million internationally; with $386 million worldwide, it's the second-best global launch of the year.",
      "At the same time, the sensation of \u201cWicked\u201d showed no signs of slowing down. The Universal Pictures musical brought in $117.5 million over the five-day weekend, pushing its two-week global total to $359.2 million. Not accounting for inflation, \u201cWicked\u201d is now the highest grossing Broadway adaptation over \u201cGrease.\u201d (That 1978 film grossed $190 million, but factoring in inflation would put it past $900 million.)",
      "\u201cGladiator II,\u201d meanwhile, also held well, dipping 44% from its opening weekend. Ridley Scott\u2019s sequel to his Oscar-winning best picture original collected $44 million in its second weekend. While its steep price tag of $250 million will make profitability challenging, \u201cGladiator II\u201d has swiftly gathered $320 million worldwide.",
      "Those three films drove the overall box office to a record $420 million in overall Thanksgiving weekend ticket sales, according to Comscore \u2014 more than $100 million more than ever before. For an industry that has been battered in recent years by the pandemic, work stoppages and the upheaval caused by streaming, it was a triumphant weekend that showed the still-potent power of Hollywood\u2019s blockbuster machine. Before \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d arrived in theaters, ticket sales were running about 25% behind pre-pandemic levels.",
      "Michael O\u2019Leary, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theatre Owners, said the weekend showed what\u2019s possible when \u201call the pieces of the puzzle come together\u201d in compelling big-budget movies with marketing muscle.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic that this weekend is the start of what we believe is a full-on charge into the future,\u201d he said. \"The remaining quarter of this year looks very promising and then on into 2025 and 2026. We\u2019re hoping next year is the first kind of normal year this industry has had in a long time.\u201d",
      "Like the last time such anticipated movies collided on the release calendar \u2014 2023's much-ballyhooed \u201cBarbenheimer\" \u2014 the movie industry again could see evidence of a rising moviegoing tide lifting all blockbusters. In recent years, studios have typically tried to space out most of their biggest releases. Earlier this fall, \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\" for example, was the No. 1 film for three straight weeks, despite not being particularly successful.",
      "\u201cFor a long, long time in Hollywood, there\u2019s been a belief that you don\u2019t put big blockbuster movies up against each other,\u201d said O'Leary. \u201cBut the truth of the matter is that competition is good. It\u2019s good for the movies. It\u2019s good for the studios. It\u2019s good for the theater owners. But it\u2019s particularly good for the moviegoing public.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d was the nexus of a strategy shift for Disney. When it first began development, it was fashioned as a series for streaming. But when Bob Iger returned as chief executive, he reconsidered the balance between theatrical and streaming. The original \u201cMoana,\" after all, was the most streamed movie on Disney+ in 2023, with the added benefit of $680 million in box office in 2016. Only in February this year did Iger announce the release of \u201cMoana 2,\" with Auli\u2019i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson returning as the voices of Moana and Maui.",
      "\u201cIt just shows you that the big screen and small screen are not adversarial. They can be complementary and additive,\u201d says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cWhoever made that decision to go big screen globally with \u2018Moana 2,' that was one of the greatest decisions ever.\u201d",

      "After such large debuts, \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d are likely to continue to drive moviegoing through December.

      "BANGOR, Maine -- Stephen King\u2019s raucous rock \u2018n\u2019 roll radio station is going silent at year\u2019s end.",
      "The renowned author and lifelong rocker who used to perform with the Rock Bottom Remainders, a rock band that featured literary icons, said Monday that at age 77, it\u2019s time to say good-bye to three Bangor, Maine, stations that have been bleeding money. King kept the stations afloat for decades, and he said he and his wife, Tabitha, are proud to have kept them going for so long.",
      "\u201cWhile radio across the country has been overtaken by giant corporate broadcasting groups, I\u2019ve loved being a local, independent owner all these years,\u201d King said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019ve loved the people who\u2019ve gone to these stations every day and entertained folks, kept the equipment running, and given local advertisers a way to connect with their customers.\"",
      "King\u2019s foray into radio began at age 36 with his 1983 purchase of a radio station that was rebranded WZON in deference to his book, \u201cThe Dead Zone.\u201d That station went through a few permutations before closing, and then being reacquired by King in 1990.",
      "The ZONE Corporation's current lineup consists of WKIT-FM, which bills itself as \u201cStephen King's Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll Radio Station,\" along with WZON-AM Retro Radio and an adult alternative station, WZLO-FM. They'll go off the air on Dec. 31.",
      "Ken Wood, the stations' general manager, said he\u2019s sad that the era is ending but happy that it happened. \u201cIndependent, locally owned radio stations used to be the norm. There are only a few left in Maine, and we\u2019re lucky we had these three as long as we did,\u201d he said."

      "Bobby Flay\u2019s latest cookbook is really a sort of recipe for how Bobby Flay was made",
      "NEW YORK -- Bobby Flay's latest cookbook is really a sort of recipe for how Bobby Flay was made.",
      "The chef, restaurateur and TV personality has compiled 100 of his most important dishes into a lush, beautifully photographed coffee table book he hopes will inspire home cooks.",
      "\u201cThis is certainly my most important book to me and I think is going to be my most important book to people who consider themselves my readers,\u201d Flay says.",
      "\u201cBobby Flay: Chapter One: Iconic Recipes and Inspirations from a Groundbreaking American Chef,\u201d has dishes from his restaurants like Mesa Grill, Bolo, Bar Americain and Gato, and his epic runs on \u201cIron Chef.\u201d",
      "\u201cInterestingly enough, when I was going through the database of all these thousands of recipes, they popped out at me immediately,\u201d he says.",
      "Three dishes from Mesa Grill that stayed on its menu from the time the restaurant opened in 1991 to when it closed 26 years later \u2014 including Shrimp and Roasted Garlic Tamale \u2014 made the book. As did Steamed Baby Clams with Saffron-Tomato Broth and Scallion Croutons from Bolo and an \u201cIron Chef\u201d stunner \u2014 Curried Fried Chicken with Charred Lime.",
      "The book is broken up into just three sections \u2014 seafood, meat and vegetables \u2014 with Flay avoiding making a chronology of dishes for fear of confusing readers. All have been updated to reflect today's ingredients and techniques.",
      "\u201cWhat I want people to do is, even though it\u2019s this beautiful sort of coffee table book, I do want them to use it either by cooking from it directly or being inspired by it,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cSo when somebody says, \u2018I want to cook fish tonight, I got that Bobby Flay cookbook, let me open to the fish section\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s going to inspire them.\u201d",
      "Most illuminating are the eight essays Flay wrote that describe a career that has won four Daytime Emmys, multiple James Beard Awards and the honor of cooking a state dinner for President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "Readers will learn that Flay struggled at school \u2014 although smart, he had a learning disability \u2014 and a turning point came when he was a temporary busboy leaving his last shift at the restaurant Joe Allen and the chef asked if he wanted a job in the kitchen.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t know that I wanted to cook for a living. I was 17 years old or something. I was just like, 'Well, I don\u2019t have anything to do today. I don\u2019t know where my friends are, so fine. Like, where do I find an apron?\u2019\u201d",
      "Flay, soon turning 60, learned he had to work with his hands to be inspired and food unlocked something in him. It is, he says, how he shares his love.",
      "\u201cI remember waking up one morning a handful of months after I started working, laying in bed, staring at the ceiling. And I\u2019m like, \u2018I can\u2019t wait to go to work today,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cI never felt that feeling before.\u201d",
      "Flay hit the ground running, soon working for Jonathan Waxman at Bud's, reborn as a red-headed Irish-American New Yorker loving the food of Southwest and Mexico. As he traveled his repertoire grew \u2014 Spanish, Italian and French.",
      "\u201cI am always thrilled to see somebody cooking something interesting. I get inspired by it,\u201d he says. \u201cLet\u2019s face it: We\u2019re watching what everybody else is doing. I mean, you can\u2019t just sit in a room and just come up with a brand new cuisine.\u201d",
      "Flay also became a Food Network star, hosting such shows as \u201cGrillin\u2019 & Chillin\u2019\u201d and \u201cBoy Meets Grill\u201d and competition shows like \u201cBobby\u2019s Triple Threat\u201d and \u201cBeat Bobby Flay,\u201d which has a new holiday-themed series this year featuring Marcus Samuelsson, Eric Adjepong and Brooke Williamson.",
      "Not all his food became iconic, like his liberal use of Calabrian chilies. When he opened Bolo, he created what he believed would be its signature dish \u2014 a paella with duck and lobster. His staff weren't so sure, but he insisted. The New York Times critic would later rave about Bolo but said of the paella that the lobster \"looks as if it fell into the dish and wonders how it is ever going to get out.\u201d",
      "Flay credits many people for his success, saying food is a collaborative field. Take his Lamb Shank with Toasted Orzo, Roasted Garlic and Oven-Dried Tomato. He says chef Tom Valenti was one of the first to serve lamb shanks in the city and Flay's twist was to add orzo, making a comforting winter dish. A food writer later offered a tip: toast the orzo in a dry pan to give it a nutty flavor.",
      "\u201cI did it and it worked and it was amazing and people loved it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe food world is a wonderful place because it\u2019s helmed by people who are generous with their thoughts and their experience.\u201d",
      "He loves the camaraderie of the kitchen and the challenge and is tired of hearing negativity about the restaurant business. \u201cListen, it gave somebody like me a life, forget about a career,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll see on shows like \u2018The Bear\u2019 and stuff like that that it\u2019s not so much about how much gratification the customer gets. It\u2019s more about the battle and the challenge to get through the evening and work alongside people and get something good on the plate.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- Mat\u00edas Tarnopolsky will become president and CEO of the New York Philharmonic on Jan. 1 after six years heading the Philadelphia Orchestra, a hiring boosted by his long friendship with incoming music director Gustavo Dudamel.",
      "Tarnopolsky's appointment was announced Monday. The 54-year-old, who has American, British and Argentine citizenship, fills a void created when Gary Ginstling quit in July just one season into the job.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done a really wonderful job with Philadelphia, and one of the most important issues was that he has a very close relationship with Gustavo Dudamel,\u201d philharmonic co-chairman Peter W. May said. \u201cThat was really the most important factor for us.\u201d",
      "Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Tarnopolsky played clarinet and received bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in music and musicology from King's College, London. A performance of Mahler\u2019s Fifth Symphony by Leonard Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic at the 1987 BBC Proms had an especially memorable impact.",
      "Tarnopolsky worked as an assistant publication editor at the BBC Proms from 1994-96 and as producer of the BBC Symphony Orchestra from 1996-99 before moving to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1999 as senior director of programming.",
      "He was the New York Philharmonic's vice president of artistic planning from December 2005 until August 2009, then spent nine years as executive director of Cal Performances at Berkeley until moving to Philadelphia in August 2018. Cal hosted Dudamel and the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Symphony Orchestra in several residencies.",
      "\u201cThis is a full circle moment because in a funny way this started when I used to work at the New York Philharmonic and I went to visit a conductor called Gustavo Dudamel in his home country of Venezuela, went to Caracas to visit him, and we immediately hit it off,\u201d Tarnopolsky said. \u201cI watched him work with the kids of the Sim\u00f3n Bolivar and was just blown away, and so we invited him to conduct the New York Philharmonic. So this is a story almost two decades in the making.\u201d",
      "Ginstling joined the New York Philharmonic as executive director from Washington's National Symphony Orchestra in November 2022, when it was announced he would succeed Deborah Borda as CEO the following July 1. Ginstling's resignation was announced this past July 11.",
      "\u201cFrankly, it just wasn\u2019t a good fit from both Gary's perspective and our perspective,\" May said. \"Mat\u00edas clearly had significantly more experience than Gary has had in terms of leading one of the top orchestras in the country and we're quite confident that this is the right guy for the job.\u201d",
      "Philharmonic co-chairman Oscar L. Tang said Tarnopolsky is aligned with the vision held by Dudamel and the board.",
      "\u201cGustavo says that he feels classical music is a human right and he wants to view classical music as a force for social development, social good,\u201d Tang said. \u201cThese are some of the aspirations that Peter and I have for the New York Phil in terms of extending its role in the cultural and civic life of New York City and really the country and the world.\u201d",
      "Aspen Leadership Group, which assisted on the search that led to Gintsling's hiring, worked with a six-member search committee to identify about a half-dozen candidates.",
      "\u201cThis is just the right appointment at just the right time,\u201d said Borda, who has remained with the orchestra as executive adviser to the CEO and the board. \u201cWe've worked hard over the past six months to clear I think a good pathway for Mat\u00edas.\u201d",
      "The New York Philharmonic returned to renovated Geffen Hall in October 2022, announced Dudamel\u2019s hiring four months later, agreed to a three-year labor contract with its musicians this September and last month fired two players after accusations of sexual misconduct and abuse of power.",
      "Borda said guest conductors have been engaged and a tour has been arranged for Dudamel's first season, with his approval, but much of the 2026-27 programming remains open.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s a chance that comes along maybe once in a lifetime to author a completely new chapter for a great musical institution,\u201d Tarnopolsky said. \u201cThe commitment here is to rededicate ourselves to ensuring the philharmonic\u2019s place in the civic, cultural, musical, educational life of contemporary New York.\u201d",
      "Ryan Fleur, the Philadelphia Orchestra's executive director, will become its interim president on Jan. 1, a role he held for eight months in 2018 between Allison Vulgamore's departure and Tarnopolsky's arrival.",

    "summary": "His wide-ranging career spanned some of Woody Allen&rsquo;s best films.",
    "story": [
      "His wide-ranging career spanned some of Woody Allen\u2019s best films.",
      "NEW YORK -- The Oscar-winning screenwriter Marshall Brickman, whose wide-ranging career spanned some of Woody Allen 's best films, the Broadway musical \u201cJersey Boys\u201d and a number of Johnny Carson's most beloved sketches, has died. He was 85.",
      "Brickman died Friday in Manhattan, his daughter Sophie Brickman told The New York Times. No cause of death was cited.",
      "Brickman was best known for his extensive collaboration with Allen, beginning with the 1973 film \u201cSleeper.\u201d Together, they co-wrote \u201cAnnie Hall\u201d (1977), \u201cManhattan\" (1979) and \u201cManhattan Murder Mystery\" (1993). The loosely structured script for \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d in particular, has been hailed as one of the wittiest comedies. It won Brickman and Allen an Oscar for best original screenplay.",
      "In his acceptance speech (Allen skipped the ceremony), Brickman referenced one of the film's many oft-quoted lines, saying: \"I've been out here a week, and I still have guilt when I make a right turn on a red light.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf the film is worth anything,\u201d Brickman told Vanity Fair in 2017, \u201cit gives a very particular specific image of what it was like to be alive in New York at that time in that particular social-economic stratum.\u201d",
      "Brickman and Allen had met in the early 1960s, when Allen was breaking through as a stand-up comedian. Brickman was brought on to write jokes for him. At the time, he had been playing banjo for the folk group the Tarriers. In one of the many twists of Brickman's career, it was an album he and his college roommate Eric Weissberg recorded that later made the soundtrack to 1972's \u201cDeliverance,\u201d including \u201cDueling Banjos.\u201d",
      "Brickman, born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was the son of Jewish socialists Abram (who fled Poland during WWII) and Pauline (Wolin) Brickman, who was from New York. They later moved to the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, where Brickman grew up. His start in show business, after graduating from the University of Wisconsin with degrees in science and music, came with the Tarriers. He replaced Alan Arkin in the group.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I was asked to join was because they needed somebody to front the group and talk while everybody was tuning up,\u201d Brickman told the Writers Guild in 2011. \u201cAnd so I started to develop little jokes and routines and stuff like that.\u201d",
      "By the late \u201860s, Brickman was head writer for Carson\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show.\" There, one of his most enduring contributions were the Carnac the Magnificent sketches, during which Carson played a \u201cmystic from the East\u201d who could divine answers to unseen questions. Brickman\u2019s other TV stints included \u201cCandid Camera,\u201d \u201cThe Dick Cavett Show\u201d and \u201cThe Muppet Show.\u201d",
      "When Brickman and Allen began writing together, they found a natural chemistry, with Brickman playing a supporting role to Allen's semi-autobiographical material.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t write scenes together. I think that\u2019s the death for any collaboration,\u201d Brickman told the Writers Guild. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any such thing really as an equal collaboration. I think that in any collaboration, one person, one personality, one point of view has to dominate.\"",

      "LONDON -- The British government's culture secretary has held talks with the BBC as the broadcaster comes under growing scrutiny after one of its TV hosts drew an angry backlash for dismissing sexual misconduct allegations against him.",
      "Gregg Wallace, a long-time co-presenter on the popular cooking contest show \u201cMasterChef,\u201d is facing allegations from multiple women that he made inappropriate sexual comments and behaved inappropriately on set over 17 years.",
      "Wallace, 60, said last week he was stepping away from the show while an investigation was launched into his alleged behavior. But his case received further attention Sunday, when he said in a social media post that the complaints came from \u201ca handful of middle-class women of a certain age.\"",
      "His comments angered some of the women who made complaints against him. A spokesman for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office described Wallace's remarks as \u201ccompletely inappropriate and misogynistic.\u201d",
      "The spokesperson, Dave Pares, said Monday that Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy was seeking assurances from the BBC that the publicly funded broadcaster handled such complaints about workplace culture properly.",
      "Wallace apologized for his comments on Instagram on Monday, saying he needs to \u201ctake some time out.\u201d",
      "The BBC has faced questions on how it handles sexual misconduct allegations and how Wallace had continued to front some of its most popular shows for so long despite the complaints.",
      "Television presenter Aggie MacKenzie, who competed on \u201cCelebrity MasterChef\u201d in 2011, told ITV on Monday that Wallace made \u201cendless smutty jokes\u201d and alleged that \u201che\u2019s been allowed to carry on in his own sweet way for many, many years.\u201d",
      "She said his comments about his accusers illustrate \u201chow he just has no insight or understanding of how he behaves. He just doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d",
      "Others have alleged that Wallace undressed in front of women working on his shows, made comments about his sex life or made women uncomfortable with sexualized jokes during filming.",
      "The BBC reported that 13 people who worked with Wallace over a range of shows have complained about inappropriate sexual comments.",
      "It reported that Wallace was warned by his employers after a complaint in 2018, and an internal investigation at the time found his behavior was \u201cunacceptable and unprofessional.\"",
      "Wallace\u2019s lawyers have denied that he \u201cengages in behavior of a sexually harassing nature.\u201d",
      "The BBC, which has said it has \u201crobust processes\u201d to deal with the issue, declined to comment on Wallace's case because of the ongoing investigation by \u201cMasterChef\u201d's production company."

Kendrick was treated for \u201cminor injuries from a sharp object,\u201d she wrote. An investigation into the fight is underway, she said.",
      "Weinstein complained it was difficult for him to get answers from the Fulton County Sheriff's Office about what happened, but he thinks Kendrick was stabbed with \u201csome type of an improvised shank.\u201d",

      "Four of the defendants, including Young Thug, pleaded guilty in October. The rapper, whose given name is Jeffery Williams, was freed on probation. Stillwell and Kendrick rejected plea deals after more than a week of negotiations, and their lawyers chose not to present evidence or witnesses.",

      "\u201cFirst Reformed\u201d fans flocked to the sold-out denim hat featured in Paul Schrader's 2017 film about a pastor's descent into despair over the environment. The J. Hannah gold locket inspired by Sofia Coppola's \u201cPriscilla\u201d (2023) is still on the market for $1,480.",
      "One catalyst in the trend\u2019s rise can be traced to 2018, when the clothing brand Online Ceramics and A24 joined forces. The brand, founded by artists Elijah Funk and Alix Ross, began with the idea of making bootleg T-shirts inspired by the Grateful Dead. Ross recounted two serendipitous moments in the company\u2019s history: One was watching Pete Davidson wearing a \u201cGood Time\u201d T-shirt on \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon\u201d in 2018.",
      "\u201cI was really jealous that we didn\u2019t make that,\u201d Ross recalled of Davidson\u2019s shirt, adorned with a poster image of Robert Pattinson and co-director Benny Safdie.",
      "The other was knowing, after just seeing the trailer, that Online Ceramics had to make \u201cHereditary\u201d T-shirts \u2014 with or without A24\u2019s permission. Thanks to a mutual friend, they managed to get in touch with the studio just before the film\u2019s release and got A24's stamp of approval.",
      "Hopeful online shoppers today will be disappointed as they scroll through dozens of Online Ceramics x A24 items, inspired by films like \u201cMaXXXine,\u201d \u201cMidsommar\u201d and \u201cLove Lies Bleeding,\u201d only to find each one sold out.",
      "Watching movies \u2014 following a pandemic and the rise of streaming \u2014 has become less of a collective experience in recent years. For many fans, repping their favorite films in public is a way to combat that.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so fun knowing that everyone loves the movie so much to go stand in line for multiple hours. I got here three hours before it even opened and there\u2019s probably, like, 30 people in front of me,\u201d said Sabrina Bratt. \u201cPhysical keepsakes are just so cute and fun.\u201d",
      "For studios, the benefit is multifaceted. Not only is it an additional revenue source in a time of slowed production in Hollywood, it also is a way to engage with the fans that help keep their films in the zeitgeist long after they leave the theater.",
      "\u201cPeople, and particularly younger people, they want to be a part of something. And wearing a shirt for a movie is no different to wearing a shirt for the band that you just went to see. There\u2019s a cachet to it. There\u2019s a value to it. It\u2019s a sign of who I am,\u201d said Neon Chief Marketing Officer Christian Parkes.",
      "Alex Ng is the co-founder and creative director of the Los Angeles-based brand Brain Dead, which also owns a movie theater on Fairfax Avenue. As the film industry continues to evolve out of necessity, Ng contends this intersection of fashion and film will play an increasingly important role in Hollywood.",
      "\u201cWhat people want is like a token or a souvenir. They go to Disneyland and they get a Mickey, right? So, if you go to an arthouse cinema, there\u2019s not a lot of things or souvenirs you could take away from a film that you love,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to connect those pieces. And I think that\u2019s the new era that we\u2019re seeing as a movie-going experience.\u201d",
      "As the demand has grown for merchandise, studios and brands have sought to take advantage for films old and new.",
      "Searchlight Pictures recently released a handful of products to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Alexander Payne\u2019s buddy comedy for oenophiles, \u201cSideways,\u201d including tees, hats and, of course, wine keys.",
      "Brain Dead has done a handful of movie collaborations with studios like A24, Focus Features and, more recently, MUBI and Jordan Peele\u2019s Monkeypaw Productions.",
      "Some products are odes to cult classics, like \u201cBeing John Malkovich\u201d and \u201cThe Big Lebowski,\u201d while others commemorate newer releases. Within days of announcing a limited-edition, long-sleeve shirt for \u201cThe Substance\u201d \u2014 complete with a 30-day trial for MUBI \u2014 Brain Dead had sold out of the product online.",
      "Although Ng bristles at the idea of \u201chype,\u201d arguing it suggests something\u2019s popularity isn\u2019t sincere, he appreciates the ways in which demand for movie merchandise has grown: \u201cI think when we can speak to someone who loves films in that, that\u2019s really cool to me.\u201d",
      "Ross, too, is ambivalent about how popular merch has become.",
      "\u201cI cringe at seeing how many movie companies are trying to rip off what we did,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, it\u2019s just kind of like, \u2018Damn.\u2019 Like I can\u2019t believe it got to this point.\u201d"

      "One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character",
      "LONDON -- One art critic compared the new Harry Kane bronze statue to a bulging-jawed comic strip character.",
      "In Miami, observers say the Dwyane Wade sculpture looks more like actor Laurence Fishburne than the former basketball star. Of course, the infamous Cristiano Ronaldo bust in 2017 gave the chiseled soccer star a chubby face and goofy smile.",
      "A statue of Mohamed Salah in 2018 depicted the Liverpool star with a disproportionately large head. In 2011, a terracotta warrior statue of Andy Murray at a Shanghai tennis tournament drew chuckles, including from the star himself: \u201cI thought I was better looking than that.\"",
      "It wasn't always this way. In classical times, sculptors \u201chad absolutely no interest in depicting people accurately,\u201d explained Lucy Branch, a London-based sculptural conservator.",
      "\u201cWhat they ended up doing quite often, they recycled sculptures so when another athlete became more prominent, they just changed the name on the plaque,\u201d said Branch, host of the \u201cSculpture Vulture\u201d podcast.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this idea now, in this era, that commemorative sculpture should be like portraiture \u2014 it should look exactly like the person they are commemorating. But actually that's a really new idea in sculpture.\"",
      "To avoid pitfalls, here are some tips from sculptors:",
      "London-based sculptor Hywel Pratley studied countless images of Queen Elizabeth II to create a memorial statue in the East Midlands town of Oakham.",
      "\u201cA good portrait sculpture is evidence of 1,000 decisions after 10,000 observations,\u201d Pratley said.",
      "In addition, Yorkshire county sculptor Steve Winterburn recommends getting close with a subject's family and friends to help find characteristics.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t want it looking like a Madame Tussauds,\u201d said Winterburn, who created a statue of five Rugby League greats at Wembley Stadium. \u201cIt still needs a bit of art in it, a bit of soul. That\u2019s what makes art really sing.\u201d",
      "The Ronaldo bust depicted the Portugal star smiling crookedly. Likewise, the Salah sculpture features the Egyptian smiling while celebrating a goal. In Miami, Wade's mouth is open in the statue representing the moment the player famously jumped onto a courtside table and yelled \u201cThis is my house.\u201d",
      "It's probably best avoided.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to do teeth looking good in sculpture,\u201d Pratley said.",
      "Start \"by understanding the profile\" before moving on to determine widths from the front view, Pratley said.",
      "\u201cGet the profile right and you will have won half the battle, because then you can have something at least that you can trust,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re lost, you can say, \u2018well I knew where I was then,\u2019 \u2014 and you will get lost as a sculptor in the forms.",
      "\"There\u2019s so many to understand. It\u2019s not two dimensions, it\u2019s three. There\u2019s an exponential opportunity for everything to go wrong. If you\u2019ve got the profile, then you can go forward with more confidence.\u201d",
      "Winterburn tries to make the eyes \u201ccome alive\u201d in his work.",
      "\"The eye is the soul of the person that carries it,\" he said. \u201cIf you look at a lot of public work, I\u2019m not being funny, they\u2019re dead. There\u2019s nothing in them, they\u2019re just featureless, soulless. With a painting, if in doubt, fade it out. With sculpture, there is nowhere to hide.\"",
      "For Pratley, especially when he is working with a live model, \u201cI\u2019m often struck by how the absolute essence of somebody is somewhere between the nostrils and the mouth. The flicker of muscles and the subtle movement of muscles around the mouth is so much you \u2014 it\u2019s so much that person.\u201d",
      "Commemorative sculpture historically has been on plinths, Branch notes.",
      "\u201cPart of the reason for that is because we put our heroes on a pedestal,\" she said. \"The problem is, the lower to the ground the sculpture is, the more scrutiny it\u2019s going to get and the less it can get away with not looking quite right.\u201d",
      "The Kane sculpture features the England captain seated.",
      "\u201cBeing so low, people get to look at it incredibly closely,\u201d Branch said. \u201cIt\u2019s trying to get sculpture to be more with the people, but then that comes with its own problems.\u201d",
      "In the UK, local councils \u2014 like a city council in the US \u2014 might propose a project, fund it and select the sculptor, sometimes with little input from the public and limited vetting of artists.",
      "Branch says there's a better way: Vote on it.",
      "That's what happened for the Emmeline Pankhurst statue in Manchester. A selection committee used an online platform to get public input and Hazel Reeves' proposal to honor the suffragette won.",
      "\u201cIt is a really good balance and check for whether people on the committees have chosen the right sculptor or the right composition for that person who is being commemorated,\u201d Branch said. \u201c(The public) may not necessarily be highly educated about sculpture, but they always tend to know whether the artist has hit the nail on the head.\u201d",

      "Five years after a catastrophic fire reduced Notre Dame Cathedral to a smoldering shell, journalists entered the Gothic masterpiece for a first glimpse of its fully restored interiors during a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron",
      "PARIS -- Five years after a catastrophic fire reduced Notre Dame Cathedral to a smoldering shell, journalists got a first glimpse of the Gothic masterpiece's fully restored interiors during a visit with French President Emmanuel Macron. The transformation is nothing short of breathtaking: light dances across brilliant stone, gilded accents gleam anew, and the iconic monument's majesty is reborn. From Dec. 8, visitors will once again marvel at the cathedral\u2019s blend of history and craftsmanship.",
      "Here\u2019s a reporter\u2019s-eye view:",
      "The nave, once darkened by soot and rubble, now radiates a celestial brilliance. Visitors can see the true color of the cathedral\u2019s walls: a pale Lutetian limestone \u2014 named after the Roman word for Paris, Lutecia \u2014 that glows under sunlight streaming through restored stained-glass windows. The newfound blond hues highlight the soaring Gothic columns and ribbed vaults, creating a bright and uplifting atmosphere. Restorers say it's the first time in centuries the true stone has been exposed in this way.",
      "The polished checkerboard marble floor, glistening underfoot, is so smooth it seems you could glide across it \u2014 communicating with the gilded, golden grille partition of the choir area.",
      "Overhead, incandescent chandeliers hang majestically from each vaulted arch, stretching from west to east, casting a warm, golden light throughout the nave.",
      "The meticulous restoration process involved cleaning over 42,000 square meters of stone \u2014 an area equivalent to roughly six soccer fields \u2014 using innovative latex peels to strip away centuries of grime without causing damage. Conservators uncovered mason marks etched by medieval builders \u2014 intimate traces of the artisans who shaped Notre Dame in the 12th and 13th centuries.",
      "This gleaming transformation is a stark contrast to the wreckage of 2019, when the nave was strewn with charred debris.",
      "The altar in the cathedral\u2019s chancel carries a poignant symbol of the fire\u2019s devastation. Nicolas Coustou\u2019s Piet\u00e0, part of the V\u0153u de Louis XIII ensemble, survived largely unscathed, but molten lead from the blaze fused into the hand of Christ. Restorers chose to preserve this as a subtle, yet powerful, reminder of the tragedy.",
      "Surrounding the altar, the intricate marquetry floor, long hidden under layers of dirt, has been pieced together from fragments recovered after the fire.",
      "Nearby, the polished Cross of Glory, which famously \u2014 literally \u2014 glowed amid the flames, now stands restored to its full brilliance. Framed by the radiant blonde stonework of the nave, the cross serves as a centerpiece of the cathedral\u2019s rebirth.",
      "The grand organ, among the largest and most storied in France, has undergone an intricate revival. Spared from the flames but coated in lead dust, its 8,000 pipes, ranging in size from that of a pen to over 10 meters (33 feet) tall, were painstakingly disassembled, cleaned, and retuned. Over two years, this work was performed with precision in the cathedral\u2019s silent, cavernous interior, where harmonization was achieved entirely by ear.",
      "Now, the organ\u2019s grandeur is unmistakable. Its towering wooden case, marked with carvings left by past craftsmen, gleams under sunlight streaming through restored clerestory windows. Even in silence, it commands awe.",
      "The 29 chapels circling the nave and choir burst with color and detail previously dulled by dirt and neglect. Restorers revealed intricate murals, gilded stars on ceilings, and vibrant motifs originally created under Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s direction. Each chapel tells a unique story through its designs and themes.",
      "The Chapel of Saint Marcel stands out as a masterpiece, its mural of the saint\u2019s relics vividly restored. Visitors are captivated by its radiant colors, producing an effect likened to the Sistine Chapel in Rome \u2014 a visual firework display. In other chapels, traces of 19th-century painters\u2019 color tests, hidden in nooks, provide glimpses into their artistic process.",
      "The transept crossing, where the original spire collapsed, presented one of the restoration\u2019s most formidable challenges. Above, soaring new vaults of Lutetian limestone replicate the medieval originals with remarkable precision.",
      "Beneath the crossing, archaeologists uncovered a trove of history: fragments of Notre Dame\u2019s medieval jub\u00e9, or choir screen, buried in the rubble. These intricately carved stones, some still bearing faint traces of polychrome paint, provide a rare glimpse into the cathedral\u2019s vibrant 13th-century decorative history.",
      "The newly restored roof draw gazes skyward, where medieval timber techniques have been faithfully recreated. Known as \u201cthe forest,\u201d the intricate wooden framework remains hidden beneath the roofline, but glimpses into the rafters reveal the precision of both ancient and modern craftsmanship.",
      "Outside, the spire rises 96 meters, faithfully replicating Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s 19th-century design. Clad in oak and lead, it stands crowned by a gilded rooster containing relics of St. Denis, St. Genevieve, and a fragment of the Crown of Thorns, alongside a scroll listing contributors to the restoration.",
      "The spire also honors the late General Jean-Louis Georgelin, who oversaw the project until his death in 2023. His name is now etched at its base.",
      "There\u2019s more than meets the eye in this restoration. Notre Dame now features unseen state-of-the-art fire prevention systems to guard against future disasters. Thermal cameras monitor the roof, and a fine misting system, designed to extinguish flames at their source, is seamlessly integrated into the structure. Fireproof barriers divide the roof into compartments, preventing flames from spreading.",
      "Reinforced water supply lines can deliver 600 cubic meters (21,188 cubic feet) of water per hour, ensuring the cathedral is better protected than ever before.",

      "NEW YORK -- The stress of Thanksgiving is over. Now it's time to heat up leftovers, relax on the couch and enjoy the smooth sounds of a wrongly mocked music genre: yacht rock.",
      "The late-'70s songs of Steely Dan, Michael McDonald and Christopher Cross take center stage Friday in the well-crafted Max documentary \u201cMusic Box: Yacht Rock: A DOCKumentary.\u201d",
      "Director Garret Price marries interviews with yacht rock artists, current musicians who are fans and the creators of the parody web series who coined the genre's name in 2005.",
      "\u201cThis music is the soundtrack to our lives, whether we want it or not. It\u2019s playing in grocery stores, pharmacies, doctor\u2019s offices, elevators, our parents' cars our whole life,\" says Price. \u201cI kind of took it for granted because it\u2019s just there. I think a lot of people have abandoned this music and I\u2019m hoping those people rediscover it.\u201d",
      "So who exactly made yacht rock? The experts in the film argue it is Toto, McDonald, Kenny Loggins, the Doobie Brothers, Cross and Steely Dan \u2014 described as \u201cthe primordial ooze from which yacht rock sprang.\u201d Think songs like \u201cRide Like the Wind\u201d by Cross, \u201cReelin\u2019 In the Years\u201d by Steely Dan and \u201cRosanna\u201d by Toto.",
      "What\u2019s not yacht rock \u2014 at least according to the filmmakers \u2014 is the Eagles, Hall & Oates, Jimmy Buffett or Fleetwood Mac, who don\u2019t perfectly fit the definition: elevated pop music infused with jazz and R&B.",
      "Cross, McDonald, Loggins and Toto\u2019s David Paich and Steve Porcaro discuss the music and how they handled the label. Donald Fagen of Steely Dan only had a short phone call with Price, but allowed the band's music to be used.",
      "\u201cI had this film basically done except for the Steely Dan music syncs and it was sitting idle for months and was like, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to tell this story unless I get this music.\u2019 Lo and behold, we finally hear from Donald Fagen,\u201d says Price. \u201cWe have this moment that I don\u2019t even know if I could beat if I had a sit-down interview with him.\u201d",
      "Giving context are musician-comedian Fred Armisen, musician-author Questlove, musicians Thundercat, Brian Robert Jones and Brenda Russell, producer Prince Paul and rock critics and session players.",
      "Questlove opens the door to a less restricted definition of yacht rock, adding artists like Al Jarreau, the Pointer Sisters and George Benson, arguing that the genre isn\u2019t limited to white artists.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with a completely arbitrary genre like this that got made up completely, that\u2019s kind of the beauty of it \u2014 the debates of what is or isn\u2019t,\u201d says Price.",
      "Yacht rock enjoyed a brief window on the charts in the late 1970s and the documentary argues that MTV largely contributed to its demise. Yacht rockers weren't able or willing to transition into a visual space.",
      "Once that window closed, yacht rock became derided \u2014 mocked in everything from \u201c30 Rock\u201d to \u201cFamily Guy.\u201d In \u201cThe 40-Year-Old Virgin,\u201d a character tortures her electronics store co-workers by playing McDonald on a constant loop.",
      "\u201cI feel like these artists have always been kind of punchlines in pop culture,\u201d says Price. \u201cI went in saying, \u2018I want to make a fun film but not make fun of anybody.\u2019\u201d",
      "The label \u201cyacht rock\u201d came much later thanks to a comedy series of short films by J.D. Ryznar and Steve Huey, who currently lead The Yacht or Nyacht Podcast. They were hoping to win a contest with their short films and the name took off.",
      "\u201cThis is kind of a private in-joke that sort of went global all of a sudden,\u201d says Huey. \u201cThe underlying intent is we love this music. We poke some fun at it, but we also want people to hear it for what it is, which is really, really good, solid, well-crafted music.\u201d",
      "Ryznar says the label was inspired by the cover and name of \u201cFull Sail\u201d \u2014 an album from Loggins and Jim Messina \u2014 Cross' hit single \u201cSailing\u201d and the captain-hat wearing half of Captain & Tennille.",
      "\"We just noticed this '70s motif and it seemed to describe the music that was so well-produced so perfectly,\" Ryznar says. \u201cIt\u2019s not called yacht rock because it sounds good on a boat, though it does. It\u2019s called yacht rock because it\u2019s well crafted, like the finest yacht.\u201d",
      "Price, an editor on \u201cDaisey Jones & The Six\u201d who also directed the dark \u201cWoodstock 99: Peace, Love, and Rage,\u201d says his latest work arrives at a great time in the year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect post-Thanksgiving film to watch with your family after what may be a more contentious Thanksgiving this year than others,\u201d says Price. \u201cWe can all just chill out, vibe out, listen to this smooth, polished music and just smile.\u201d"

      "A majority of Supreme Court justices didn\u2019t seem convinced Monday that federal regulators misled companies as they refused to allow them to sell sweet flavored vaping products following a surge in teen e-cigarette use",
      "WASHINGTON -- A majority of Supreme Court justices didn't seem convinced Monday that federal regulators misled companies as they refused to allow them to sell sweet flavored vaping products following a surge in teen e-cigarette use.",
      "The court did raise questions about the Food and Drug Administration crackdown that included denials of more than a million nicotine products formulated to taste like fruit, dessert or candy. Teen vaping use has since dropped to a decade low, but the agency could change its approach after the inauguration next month of President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to \u201csave\u201d vaping.",
      "Vape companies have long marketed their products as a way to help adults quit traditional cigarettes, and say the FDA changed its standards with little warning as blocked the sale of over a million new flavored products.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan, though, was skeptical.",
      "\u201cI guess I\u2019m not really seeing what the surprise is here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew what the FDA\u2019s point of view was ... that blueberry vapes are really problematic in terms of youth smoking.\"",
      "The FDA was slow to regulate the now multibillion-dollar vaping market, and even years into the crackdown flavored vapes that are technically illegal nevertheless remain widely available.",
      "The agency says the vaping companies were denied because they couldn't show flavored vapes had a net public benefit, as laid out in the law. It has approved some tobacco-flavored vapes, and recently allowed its first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers.",
      "The issue came before the high court when the agency appealed a decision from the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals tossing out one of its denials.",
      "While other lower courts rebuffed vaping company lawsuits, the 5th Circuit sided with Dallas-based company Triton Distribution. The decision allowed the sale of e-juices like \u201cJimmy The Juice Man in Peachy Strawberry,\" and \u201cMother's Milk and Cookies\u201d which are heated by an e-cigarette to create an inhalable aerosol.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether the FDA process had given the companies a fair chance to make their claims, given that their businesses were at stake.",
      "Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh also expressed concern about what recourse companies have if agencies issue misleading guidance, though he also elicited that the FDA wasn't required to issue the guidance it gave in the vaping case. \u201cI'm trying to figure out what the legal error is here,\u201d he said.",
      "The conservative-majority court has overall been skeptical of the power of federal regulators, including by striking down the so-called Chevron doctrine that had judges deferring to agencies' interpretation of the law.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned whether the vaping companies wanted the court to take that concept a step further. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a reverse Chevron deference, except we're deferring to the applicant,\" she said.",
      "The court is expected to decide the case in the coming months.",

      "Artificial intelligence is changing the way industries do business",
      "WASHINGTON -- Artificial intelligence is changing the way companies do business \u2014 helping programmers write code and fielding customer service calls with chatbots.",
      "But the pharmaceutical industry is still waiting to see whether AI can tackle its biggest challenge: finding faster, cheaper ways to develop new drugs.",
      "Despite billions poured into research, new medicines still typically take a decade or more to develop.",
      "Founded in 2018, Insitro is part of a growing field of AI companies promising to accelerate drug discovery by using machine learning to analyze huge datasets of chemical and biological markers. The South San Francisco-based company has signed deals with drugmakers like Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb to help develop medicines for metabolic diseases, neurological conditions and degenerative disorders.",
      "CEO and founder Daphne Koller spoke with the AP about what AI brings to the challenges of drug discovery. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: I think the problem with drug discovery is that we are trying to intervene in a system that we only slightly understand. Many of the successes that we\u2019ve seen in the last 15 to 20 years have been when we arrive at a sufficient understanding of the system so we can really design interventions to align with it.",
      "So one of the things that we try to do at Insitro is unravel the underlying complexity of heterogeneous diseases and identify new intervention modes that could help, maybe not the entire population, but perhaps just a subset of it. That way we can really identify the right therapeutic hypothesis to intervene in a particular patient population. And that, I think, is the real crux of the industry\u2019s lack of success.",
      "A: One of the things that has been happening in parallel to the AI revolution is a much quieter revolution in what I call quantitative biology, which is the ability to measure biological systems with unprecedented fidelity. You can measure systems like proteins and cells with increasingly better measurements and technology.",
      "But if you give that data to a person, their eyes will just glaze over because there\u2019s only so many cells someone can look at and only so many subtleties they can see in these images. People are just limited in their ability to perceive subtle differences.",
      "So you end up with a very reductionist view of a very complex, multifaceted system which is really important to unraveling the distinctions between patients and uncovering where an intervention really can make a difference.",
      "A: My PhD was in computer science. But I started to get into the field of machine learning in the service of biomedical problems back in 1998 or 1999.",
      "At that time, the problems that machine learning was able to tackle were, frankly, uninspiring. How inspired can you get about classifying spam versus non-spam in a dataset of email messages?",
      "I was looking for something that had more richness to it. And my first foray into this field was not because I was particularly interested in becoming a biologist, but because I was looking for more technically challenging questions. And then, as I started looking into it, I became interested in biology in its own right.",
      "A: This is probably one of the most important things we\u2019ve achieved as an organization.",
      "You can take the most sophisticated, best meaning scientists from either side and put them in the same room together and they might as well be speaking Thai and Swahili to each other.",
      "When you\u2019re an engineer, you\u2019re looking for the strongest, most consistent patterns that are going to allow you to make predictions about a majority of cells or individuals. When you\u2019re a life scientist, oftentimes you\u2019re actually looking for the exceptions because those are the threads that can lead to new discoveries.",
      "So we\u2019ve put in place a number of cultural elements and organizational elements to help people engage with each other openly, constructively and with respect."

      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning such care for minors, and most of those states face lawsuits.",
      "The nation's top court will be weighing whether Tennessee\u2019s law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, requiring that people in similar circumstances be treated the same under the law. Both sides in the case claim they are acting to protect minors from harm.",
      "Gender-affirming care is supported by the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical groups. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s typically involved:",
      "Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are often referred to clinics where teams from various medical specialties provide gender-affirming care.",
      "Such care begins with an evaluation, which can include a pediatrician and a mental health specialist who assess the degree of distress, if any, the young person is experiencing.",
      "Those who meet defined criteria may be diagnosed with what\u2019s called gender dysphoria if their distress is continuous and significant.",
      "Some young people and their families may decide to try a social transition involving a new hairstyle, clothing, name or pronouns. Experts agree that allowing children to express their gender in a way that matches their identity is beneficial.",
      "Chazzie Grosshandler, 18, of Chicago, said she was 9 years old when she told her parents she was a girl and \u201cnot just a boy who likes girly things.\u201d She started receiving care two years later.",
      "\u201cThe first-ever step of gender-affirming care for me was when I told my parents that I was a girl and that I had felt this way for a long time and that they accepted me,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people get really confused when they hear the word \u2018care\u2019 that it has to be something medical. But the truth is that it\u2019s more than just medical. It\u2019s love and acceptance.\u201d",
      "A subset of young people may be offered additional interventions such as puberty blockers to ease distress and give them time to explore their gender identity.",
      "The drugs, known as GnRH agonists, block the release of key hormones involved in sexual maturation. They\u2019ve been used for decades to treat precocious puberty, an uncommon medical condition that causes puberty to begin abnormally early.",
      "The medication starts after a young person show early signs of puberty \u2014 enlargement of breasts or testicles. This typically occurs around age 8 to 13 for those assigned female at birth and a year or two later for those assigned male at birth.",
      "The drugs can be given as injections every few months or as arm implants lasting up to a year or two. Many of the effects are reversible \u2014 puberty and sexual development resume as soon as the drugs are stopped. Researchers are exploring the effects of puberty blockers on bone development, but no research has shown an increased risk for bone fractures.",
      "Young people can stay on puberty blockers for several years.",
      "After puberty blockers, trans adolescents go through puberty either with or without hormone treatment.",
      "Some may choose to take hormones to make their bodies more closely match their gender identity. They take manufactured versions of either estrogen or testosterone \u2014 hormones that prompt sexual development in puberty. Estrogen comes in skin patches and pills. Testosterone is available in injections, implants or gels.",
      "Guidelines recommend starting these when teens are mature enough to make informed medical decisions. Many transgender people take the hormones for life.",
      "If the medication is stopped, some physical changes remain. Testosterone generally leads to permanent voice-lowering, facial hair and development of the Adam\u2019s apple. Estrogen can lead to permanent breast development.",
      "Research on long-term hormone use in transgender adults has found potential health risks including a modest risk for blood clots with estrogen and negative cholesterol changes with testosterone.",
      "Gender-affirming surgery in transgender teens is far less common than hormone treatment. When it is done among transgender youth, it\u2019s almost always breast reduction surgery in older transgender males.",
      "Even so, that type of surgery is extremely rare. Perhaps surprisingly, breast reduction among minors is most frequently performed in males who are not transgender. This is for a condition called gynecomastia, which means having more breast tissue than usual.",
      "A study looking at millions of 2019 insurance claims found 151 breast reductions performed for U.S. minors. Nearly all \u2014 97% \u2014 were not transgender.",
      "Research suggests that transgender youth are prone to stress, depression and suicidal thoughts. Some studies suggest treatment for gender dysphoria can improve young people\u2019s well-being, but some nuances remain unclear.",
      "In one study, researchers spent two years testing and tracking 315 transgender youth who received hormone therapy. Depression and anxiety symptoms eased and life satisfaction increased among those designated female at birth, but not among those designated male at birth. The researchers speculated that the youth designated male at birth might be more affected by stress from being different from most of their peers.",
      "In the same study, published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, two participants died by suicide \u2014 one after six months and the other after a year.",
      "Longer term studies on treatment outcomes are underway.",

      "WASHINGTON -- When the Supreme Court this week wades into the contentious issue of transgender rights, the justices will hear from an attorney with knowledge that runs deep.",
      "Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the nation's highest court, representing families who say Tennessee\u2019s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their children terrified about the future.",
      "Arguments in the case come amid heightened pushback to transgender rights, including a presidential campaign where Republican Donald Trump put his fierce opposition front and center.",
      "Strangio will bring months of intense legal preparation to the case as well as hard-won lessons from his own experience.",

      "Strangio grew up outside of Boston and came out as trans when he was in law school. Now 42, he's an American Civil Liberties Union attorney whose legal career has included representing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, challenging a ban on transgender people serving in the military and helping win an LGBTQ+ worker-discrimination case at the Supreme Court. He's also the father of a 12-year-old, the son of a father who supports Trump, and has a close relationship with his Army-veteran brother.",
      "He's also an advocate, speaking out as a series of U.S. states banned gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. The laws are part of a wave of restrictions on school sports participation and bathroom usage around the country. After the first openly transgender person was elected to Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declared support for restricting bathroom use to sex assigned at birth.",
      "Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young people and its law protects them from making treatment decisions prematurely.",
      "\u201cTennessee, like many other states, acted to ensure that minors do not receive these treatments until they can fully understand the lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to the point that Tennessee might take a different view of their efficacy,\u201d state attorneys wrote in court filings.",
      "Arguing for Tennessee is state Solicitor General Matt Rice. He served in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the transgender worker-discrimination case Strangio worked on that term. The state attorney general's office did not make Rice available for an interview ahead of arguments, but his background also includes a couple of years as a minor league baseball player for the Tampa Bay Rays before he earned his law degree from the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The Biden administration is supporting the challenge to Tennessee's law, but the federal government\u2019s position is expected to change after Trump takes office in January. Strangio said he'll nevertheless keep advocating for transgender youth to access health care that wasn't available when he was young.",
      "\u201cMany of us think about our childhood and young adulthood as lost years, when we were just simply disembodied from our core,\u201d he said. Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose the bans and have endorsed such care, saying it\u2019s safe when administered properly. Strangio also pointed out that many medical interventions for young people, like gastric bypass surgeries for weight loss, carry some risk and it makes sense to inform families and let them decide.",
      "\u201cThere is harm that is compounded when we are forcing young people to be denied care that their doctors and their parents and they themselves all agree they need,\u201d he said.",

      "As temperatures drop into the teens, Minnesotans have embraced sauna culture for warmth and community",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- As another frigid winter settles over Minnesota with temperatures dipping into the teens, people like Ed Kranz are embracing the cold \u2014 and working up quite a sweat.",
      "Kranz and his wife, Colleen, are among Minnesotans who believe the best way to endure winter is to heat up in saunas and then cool off in their state's icy weather.",
      "On a bone-chilling Sunday morning, they set up a mobile wood-fired sauna from their business, Saunable, near a frozen lake in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan. After about 10 minutes of sweating in the 185 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius) sauna they moseyed outside into the 15-degree temperatures, lingering around a fire in bathing suits before repeating the process three or four more times. One brave soul dipped into a hole in the frozen lake for a post-sauna cold plunge.",
      "Their hot-and-cold venture is common in Minnesota, where plenty of residents embrace sauna culture for warmth and community. Devotees say they are mingling Old World traditions with newfangled internet-based communities, and making social connections in a society that can feel isolating.",
      "Sauna and cold plunges go together like peanut butter and jelly, said Glenn Auerbach, a self-described sauna evangelist and the founder and editor of SaunaTimes. Auerbach started the website in 2008 to share his thoughts, research and conversations with movers and shakers in the sauna world. He and his interlocutors mull over the nitty-gritty of sauna construction, how to cultivate \u201cgood sauna vibes\u201d and the potential health benefits of the sauna lifestyle.",
      "A typical temperature to achieve the holy trinity of the sauna experience \u2014 heat, steam and ventilation \u2014 is about 180 to 200 degrees F (82-93 degrees C), a temperature that starkly contrasts Minnesota's frigid winter weather.",
      "The craftiest in the sauna community can build a facility for about $10,000, according to Auerbach. Those looking to skip the physical labor can outsource the construction. Sauna's popularity, which enthusiasts say spiked following the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought with it a rise in manufacturers selling saunas for about $30,000 to $40,000.",
      "While sauna's cultural cache may have increased in recent years, the practice long predates the Instagrammable spaces now popping up, Auerbach said.",
      "The smell of cedar wood has been lodged in Justin Juntunen's memory ever since he first stepped into his family's sauna as a child. Juntunen, the founder of Cedar and Stone Nordic Sauna, is a descendant of Finnish immigrants who came to America in the 1880s. They brought with them an appreciation for saunas and the communal values the steam-filled rooms impart to local life.",
      "People in Finland say there are more saunas than cars, Juntunen said. When immigrants like his grandfather came to Minnesota to work in the mines, mills or docks, they would often save up to build a farmhouse. But they would build a sauna first, living in the space while the house was constructed. Later, saunas would serve as informal town centers.",
      "People gossiped in saunas, they gave birth in saunas and they died in saunas, Juntunen said. The public nature of the facilities reflects the egalitarian ethos that infuses Nordic culture, and sauna culture by extension, he added.",
      "\u201cThis is a tradition that\u2019s actually for everyone,\u201d Juntunen said. \u201cMy favorite Nordic proverb is all people are created equal, but nowhere more so than in the sauna.\"",
      "In addition to a desire for in-person experiences following the COVID-19 pandemic, sauna enthusiasts say interest rose after some of the internet\u2019s most famous figures, such as podcasters Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman, touted it.",
      "\u201cEvery big podcaster in the world discovered that you could jump in cold water and it feels kind of good. And then people click on it online,\u201d Juntunen said.",
      "In this way, technology has been a paradox for sauna culture, he added. Digital media helped sauna culture grow at the same time as saunas were billed as reprieves from the pervasive reach of technology over every facet of daily life.",
      "Either way, almost all of sauna culture's adherents say its rise is inextricably linked to a desire for community.",
      "Those who committed to building their own saunas have hosted friends, neighbors, and former high school hockey teammates over. This has created a new form of post-COVID-19 contagiousness: \u201cGood heat is contagious,\u201d Auerbach said.",
      "This core function of sauna culture spans generations. Juntunen's grandfather would rush to the sauna after work because it was the space where stories were told.",
      "\"It\u2019s a space where storytelling happens, where connection happens or silence happens,\" Juntunen said. \u201cI think that is a really beautiful example of what a sauna truly is.\u201d"

      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
      "HONG KONG -- Every Wednesday, retiree Zhang Zhili travels an hour by bus to an education center, drawn by the pulsing rhythms of the African drum she plays there in a classroom filled with fellow retirees whose hands move in unison, every beat lifting her spirits.",
      "Zhang, 71, has found joy and new friends at the \u201celderly university\u201d in Beijing. Besides African drums, the former primary school teacher joins social dance classes, paying about 2,000 yuan ($280) for two courses this semester. Seeing herself standing tall in dance class boosts her confidence. After class, she hangs out with her friends.",
      "\u201cWhen we get old, what do we need?\" she said. \u201cTo love ourselves.\u201d",
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional nursing homes, afraid of abandonment by their families and quality issues. That's driving a boom in universities, home care services, and communities catering to older adults. Though some providers struggle to turn a profit, they persist because they see promise in the growing market.",
      "China has a rapidly aging population. Last year, about 297 million people were aged 60 or above, over one-fifth of the population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 400 million, or over 30% of all Chinese.",
      "That's fueling growth in services and products aimed at older adults in what Beijing calls the silver economy, which is projected to balloon from about 7 trillion yuan (about $982 billion) currently to approximately 30 trillion yuan (about $4.2 trillion) in 2035, raising its share in the economy from about 6% to roughly 10%, Hu Zuquan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a public institution affiliated with China's main planning agency, told state media.",
      "Du Peng, dean of the school of population and health at Beijing's Renmin University, said the government is expanding basic care services to all older people who need them, moving beyond its traditional focus on those without family support. Last year, officials compiled a list of basic care services they aim to make available nationwide, including providing ability assessments for those over 65 and care training subsidies for family members of those who are disabled.",
      "Filial piety runs deep in China and most older people prefer aging at home with family after they retire, typically when they're 50 to 60 years old, one of the youngest retirement ages among the world\u2019s major economies. Many help care for their grandchildren, and for some, nursing homes are seen as a kind of abandonment, except in cases of serious disability.",
      "In January, Beijing issued new guidelines calling for expanding home care services and meal deliveries and more clothing, food and tech products tailored for older adults. They include enriching their lives through education.",
      "Home-based services offer a more affordable alternative to nursing homes, alleviating accommodation costs, Du said. Most older Chinese are relatively healthy, and these able people perhaps need richer cultural lives rather than disability care, he said.",
      "Cai Guixia, 60, said she has found fulfillment in African drumming and modeling classes. She thinks she would feel \u201cforsaken\u201d in a conventional nursing home, preferring to hire a domestic helper.",
      "Liu Xiuqin, an owner of two care homes, saw business opportunities in meeting those needs.",
      "She invested more than 800,000 yuan (about $112,000) to open a school in Beijing. Cai and Zhang are among its 150 students attending classes in dance, singing, yoga and modeling training for about 1,000 yuan ($140) per course each semester. Outside the classroom, her team organizes gatherings where students can socialize.",
      "Liu expects to break even in another year and is prepared for the wait. She believes in the market's future, given that the generation born in the 1960s and later values quality of life and health more than their parents did.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about making quick money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires persistence.\u201d",
      "Turning a profit is proving challenging for some silver economy businesses.",
      "In the southern city of Guangzhou, Wu Tang co-founded a school last year after his geotechnical investigation and surveying business was hit by the downturn in China\u2019s property market. His school offers courses to help people achieve some of their childhood dreams, but he has yet to cover his costs. He also faces competition from cheaper government-run courses.",
      "And there's Cui Yang, who runs a care station in Beijing, sending helpers zigzagging across the district to provide 30 yuan ($4.20) haircuts at home; accompanying people on hospital visits for 50 yuan ($7) per hour and other services. Even with government subsidies including free rent, Cui is losing money. Without the subsidies, the business would fail, she said.",
      "The struggles aren\u2019t limited to small operators.",
      "Wu Wenjing heads the home care department of a healthcare subsidiary of state-owned financial conglomerate China Everbright Group in southwest China's Chongqing. It has been in the red for 13 straight years, spending 5 million yuan (about $702,000) annually and still losing 1 million (about $140,000) a year, she said.",
      "Wu's business employs 70 workers who visit homes as caregivers, rehabilitation therapists and psychotherapists. The industry is competitive and it has a high turnover rate given the difficulties of working alone in clients\u2019 homes. Wu hopes to break even in five years, and is delighted about the government's efforts to grow the silver economy.",
      "\"The spring of China\u2019s elderly care business has finally come,\u201d she said.",
      "Various companies are looking to grab a slice of this government-backed market. Property developers like Vanke Co. and Sino-Ocean Group and insurance companies such as Taikang Insurance Group have built high-end communities for older adults with amenities such as movie-screening and mahjong rooms and dining services.",
      "China's also working to tackle the problem of dementia, providing cognitive screening tests and training staff who work in memory clinics or as social workers. Several Chinese pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working on drugs targeting Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia.",
      "Some vacant schools and kindergartens -- casualties of the country\u2019s declining birthrate -- are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Government efforts to back the silver economy are paying off: official data showed the country had 410,000 care facilities by June, double the number in 2019.",
      "Still, questions remain about the spending power of many older Chinese.",
      "A 2021 national survey co-conducted by China's Civil Affairs Ministry found older adults had a median annual income of 11,400 yuan ($1,574). In rural areas it was less than half of that. More than one in 10 older Chinese are living in poverty, with living standards much lower in rural areas and western China, according to data from surveys conducted by Peking University.",
      "China's silver economy is still in its infancy, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking.",
      "If they lack enough insurance to cover medical and other expenses, many older Chinese must set aside funds for such costs, limiting their spending capacity, he said, and it takes time to build industries producing senior-focused products and people trained to provide such services. Tax incentives and investments in training a skilled workforce would help, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are prospects here, but it seems there's still much that needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

      "MILWAUKEE -- The Aurora Health Care Mobile Medical Clinic team waited patiently at a table in the main hallway of the Milwaukee Public Library\u2019s sprawling downtown branch, a blood pressure cuff and mental health questionnaire at the ready as they called out to patrons who paused: \u201cDo you have any questions about your health?\u201d",
      "On this Tuesday afternoon, one man did. His joints were bothering him, he told Carolyn McCarthy, the team\u2019s nurse practitioner. And he knew his bones need calcium to stay strong, so he stopped taking his blood pressure medication, a calcium channel blocker.",
      "McCarthy talked with him at length in simple and specific terms about how the medication worked on his cells, why it was important to take and how it doesn\u2019t affect calcium storage in his bones.",
      "\u201cHopefully, he walked away a little bit more informed,\u201d McCarthy said.",
      "The mobile clinic is one of several health programs offered by libraries around across the U.S. \u2014 from tiny rural town libraries to large urban systems. They offer fitness classes, food pantries, cooking classes, conversations about loneliness and mental health, and even blood pressure monitors that can be checked out just like books.",
      "The public health programs leverage libraries' reputation as sources of reliable information and their ability to reach people beyond formal health care settings. No money, insurance, language skills or ID required, no limits on age. All are welcome.",
      "Libraries are \u201cthe last true public institution,\u201d said Jaime Placht, a health and well-being specialist at the Kansas City Public Library system in Kansas City, Missouri. The system has a full-time social work team. \u201cThe library is a public health space.\u201d",
      "The Kansas City Public Library, along with Milwaukee and several others, is part of the American Heart Association's Libraries with Heart program. Several Kansas City branches have blood pressure stations \u2014 which Placht said have been used 13,000 times \u2014 as well as a take-home blood pressure kits that have been checked out nearly 100 times. The program started there about a year ago.",
      "\u201cWe have patrons that say, \u2018Because I used the blood pressure monitor at the library, I went and saw my physician for the first time in a long time,\u2019\u201d Placht said.",
      "There is no local public health office in Jarrell, Texas, a small town between Austin and Waco. But there is a nonprofit library that can connect patrons to mental health help. It's one of nine rural libraries in central Texas that receives funding from the St. David\u2019s Foundation, the philanthropic arm of one of the state\u2019s largest health systems.",
      "Jarrell Community Library and Resource Center is a place for brave conversations. When a senior card game group turned to a discussion of the best crematorium in town, the library brought in local experts to teach about end-of-life planning, library director Susan Gregurek said. Last year, seven women came to the library for information on how to file restraining orders against their husbands.",
      "\u201cThis is mental health, but it\u2019s obviously larger than mental health,\" Gregurek said.",
      "The public library in Smithville, Texas, which also gets money from the Libraries for Health program, stocks boxes of surplus food from area farmers and built out programs that help teens, older adults and parents address isolation. The library\u2019s peer support specialist has gone from working with four to five people a month to nearly 60 in the community southeast of Austin.",
      "St. David's Foundation has invested more than $3 million in the program over three years, which Smithville library director Judy Bergeron said is key when she hears comments like, \u201cWhy are we funding the library so much? Nobody reads anymore.\u201d",
      "A year and a half into being in Milwaukee's libraries, mobile health clinic reaches eight patrons on average per visit. They've had some people come back to say they went to the hospital and got a life-saving treatment, McCarthy said. They\u2019ve also had patients who did not seek help and later died.",
      "\u201cWhat we do is a Band-Aid on a broken (health care) system,\u201d McCarthy said of the clinic.",
      "Another library effort in Milwaukee teaches kids about healthy nutrition habits at the Mitchell Street branch \u2014 a weekly after-school program run by chef Sharrie Agee since 2022.",
      "\u201cCertain areas of Milwaukee don\u2019t have the same opportunities to (access) healthy ingredients, healthy sources of food, the knowledge behind how to use those ingredients,\u201d said Agee, whose class learns how to make snacks from different continents.",

      "Other locations have weighed similar \u201cgenerational tobacco bans,\u201d which phase out the use of tobacco products based not just on a person's age but on birth year.",
      "Under a Massachusetts law signed in 2018, the age to buy any tobacco product \u2014 including cigarettes, cigars and e-cigarettes \u2014 was raised to 21. Massachusetts also has banned the sale of all flavored tobacco products in an effort to reduce youth interest in nicotine.",
      "The new proposal, which lawmakers plan to file next year, would expand the effort to curb smoking by gradually ending all sales of nicotine and tobacco products. If the bill is approved, young people not old enough to legally purchase nicotine and tobacco would never be lawfully able to purchase them in Massachusetts, thereby creating no more new users.",
      "It would not apply to marijuana, and the cutoff date would be adjusted when passed to ensure everyone age 21 and above at that time would not be affected.",
      "Brookline, a town of about 63,000 neighboring Boston, was the first municipality in the country to adopt such a ban in 2020. Instead of raising the age for purchasing cigarettes, the bylaw blocks the sale of tobacco to anyone born on or after Jan. 1, 2000. The rule went into effect in 2021.",
      "That would mean at some point in the future no one would be allowed to buy any tobacco products in the town. The measure was challenged, but the state's highest court weighed in earlier this year, upholding the ban.",

      "Nicotine and tobacco products are addictive and can increase the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, stroke and other illnesses.",
      "Nearly 9 out of 10 adults who smoke cigarettes daily first tried smoking by age 18, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which also found that in 2024 about 2 in 5 students who had ever used a tobacco product currently used them.",
      "Peter Brennan, executive director of the New England Convenience Store and Energy Marketers Association, said the proposal would undercut small mom and pop shops that rely on cigarettes for a significant portion of their sales.",
      "It also would put stores located near neighboring states that allow the sale of cigarettes to all adults at a competitive disadvantage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re really just taking away adults\u2019 right to purchase a legal, age-restricted product.\u201d",
      "Taking certain rights away from some adults and not others is likely unconstitutional, he said, adding that other prohibition efforts haven\u2019t worked, like past bans on alcohol, marijuana and gambling.",
      "It's unclear how much support the proposal has in the Legislature.",
      "Massachusetts has taken other steps in recent decades to curb smoking, including raising taxes on cigarettes. Those taxes would presumably be reduced and ultimately eliminated by an incremental statewide smoking ban.",
      "Any reduction in cigarette tax revenue would be more than offset by reduced healthcare costs and other savings, Lewis said.",

      "The justices on Wednesday are taking up the issue of gender-affirming care for transgender minors, which has been banned by Tennessee and 25 other Republican-led states.",
      "The fight over whether transgender adolescents can access puberty blockers and hormonal treatments is part of a broader effort to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use.",
      "Trump backed a national ban on such care as part of his 2024 campaign in which he demeaned and mocked transgender people.",
      "In its waning days, the Biden administration, along with families of transgender adolescents, will appeal to the justices to strike down the Tennessee ban as unlawful sex discrimination and protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable Americans.",
      "\u201cThe stakes are high, of course, for transgender adolescents, but also for the parents who are watching their children suffer, who are just trying to do right by their kids,\u201d Chase Strangio, who represents the families at the Supreme Court, said in an interview. Strangio, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, will be the first openly transgender person to argue before the high court.",
      "A lawyer for Tennessee will argue that the \u201clife-altering gender-transition procedures\u201d are risky and unproven and that it\u2019s the state\u2019s role to protect children.",
      "Trump nominated three justices in his first term who pushed the court in a more conservative direction that included the decision in 2022 overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling, which had protected abortion rights for nearly 50 years.",
      "Yet one of Trump's appointees, Justice Neil Gorsuch, also authored a ruling in 2020 that protected LGBTQ people from discrimination in the workplace under federal civil rights law.",

The Williams Institute is a think tank that researches sexual orientation and gender identity demographics to inform laws and public policy decisions.",

      "The bans in Tennessee and elsewhere have put families in the position of deciding whether to travel for ongoing health care, go without or wait until their children turn 18.",
      "Erin Friday, a leader of Our Duty, an international group that supports the bans on gender-affirming care for minors, said the case is going to be as important as Roe v. Wade. She said upholding the Tennessee law would bolster the cases for the laws restricting sports participation and bathroom use.",
      "Among the arguments advanced by defenders of the state laws is that many children who initially say they are transgender eventually change their mind. Friday said her daughter was 11 when she said she was transgender, which Friday attributed to the child having been \u201cindoctrinated\u201d at school. But after receiving psychiatric treatment, her daughter changed her mind, Friday said. If laws like Tennessee\u2019s are struck down, \u201cmore children would be irreversibly harmed and live a life of deep regret,\u201d Friday said in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "Guidelines from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health that were revised in 2022 say evidence of regret about transitioning is scant but also that patients should be told about the possibility during psychological counseling.",
      "Some doctors who work with transgender minors said a state should not come between doctors, their patients and parents. \u201cFrom a medical standpoint, I think it\u2019s really frightening and dangerous to think that legislators could pass a law that basically judges or controls what people could do with a medication based on a diagnosis,\u201d Dr. Susan Lacy of Memphis, Tennessee, who joined with the families in suing the state, said in an interview.",
      "Michelle Quist Ryder, CEO of the American Psychological Foundation, said the laws, if left in place, are damaging for the physical and mental health of transgender people and their supporters. Gender dysphoria \u2014 the unease a person may have when their assigned sex and gender identity don\u2019t match \u2014 has been linked to depression and suicidal thoughts.",
      "\u201cThe more we lessen the sense of safety in this community, trans youth will look out and say, \u2018Who else is going to come after me?\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "There are prominent names in some of the 83 briefs, an unusually high number, filed on both sides of the case. Actors Elliot Page and Nicole Maines, and Sarah McBride of Delaware, who in November became the first openly transgender person to win election to Congress, have joined more than five dozen people in urging the court to strike down the Tennessee law.",

      "British lawmakers have given initial approval to a bill that would help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales",
      "LONDON -- British lawmakers gave initial approval on Friday to a bill to help terminally ill adults end their lives in England and Wales, following an impassioned debate that saw people sharing personal stories of loss and suffering.",
      "Members of Parliament approved the assisted dying bill by a 330-275 vote, signaling their approval in principle for the bill, which will undergo further scrutiny before it goes to a final vote.",
      "Friday's vote came after hours of debate \u2014 emotional at times \u2014 that touched on issues of ethics, faith and law. There was no braying and shouting that often marks debates in the House of Commons and speeches were considered respectfully and heard in silence.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, we\u2019re not talking about a choice between life or death, we are talking about giving dying people a choice about how to die,\u201d the bill\u2019s main sponsor, Kim Leadbeater, said as she presented the bill to a packed chamber.",
      "Supporters said the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent suffering, while protecting the vulnerable.",
      "Opponents said the disabled and elderly were at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, to end their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members. Others called for the improvement of palliative care to ease suffering as an alternative.",
      "The proposed bill would allow adults over the age of 18 who are expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided help to end their life, subject to several safeguards.",
      "They would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves, and two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision. The bill will not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland.",
      "Backers of the bill told heart-wrenching stories about constituents and family members who suffered in the final months of their lives and dying people who committed suicide in secret because it is currently a crime for anyone to provide assistance.",
      "Danny Kruger, who led the argument against the bill, cautioned lawmakers not to back a \u201cstate suicide service.\" He argued that no amount of safeguards will stop many vulnerable people feeling the pressure to make a request to end their lives.",
      "Kruger voiced his disappointment at the outcome but said there's a chance lawmakers will reject the bill when it comes back for a vote in the next few months. Some of those voting in favor said they only did so to examine the details further and could potentially vote against it in the future.",
      "\u201cI still think we can stop it,\u201d he said.",
      "Although the bill was proposed by Leadbeater, a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it was an open vote with alliances formed across the political divide.",
      "The government is widely expected to come up in the next few months with assessments on how assisted dying will be funded and how it would impact the U.K.'s state-funded National Health Service, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer did not show his hand ahead of the vote, but backed the change. Others in his Cabinet, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood, voted against. There were similar divisions across other political parties.",
      "Long-time British campaigner Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with lung cancer and played a leading role in advocating the need for a vote on assisted dying, voiced her joy at the \u201cwonderful\u201d outcome and said it will give people an \u201cequal choice.\u201d",
      "When diagnosed with her terminal illness, Rantzen said she would travel to Switzerland to bring an end to her life, where the law allows assisted dying for non-residents.",
      "Hundreds of people on both sides of the issue gathered outside Parliament on a cold but bright day as the debate continued for nearly five hours.",
      "Opponents held signs saying, \u201cKill the bill, not the ill,\u201d and, referring to the National Health Service, \u201cNHS It's cradle to grave. Not 'til old, inconvenient or expensive!\u201d",
      "The group Dignity in Dying, many wearing pink winter hats, led supporters as they clutched signs saying \u201cGiving me choice over my death,\u201d and \u201cYou can't cure death. Please make it fear free.\u201d",
      "Backers of the measure erupted in cheers when the result was announced and hugged each other.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a relief, it\u2019s history, finally we are getting towards having a society that shows love and compassion above the need to just keep people alive,\" said Joshua Cook, 33, who has Huntington\u2019s disease, an incurable neurodegenerative disease.",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves health care practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances.",

      "Missouri's Republican attorney general says he still considers it illegal to provide abortions after fetal viability, despite a newly approved state abortion rights amendment",
      "COLUMBIA, Mo. -- Missouri's Republican attorney general has pledged to enforce some laws restricting abortion despite a new constitutional amendment widely expected to undo the state's near-total ban on the procedure.",
      "In an opinion requested by incoming GOP governor Mike Kehoe, Attorney General Andrew Bailey wrote that his office will continue enforcing a ban on abortion after fetal viability.",
      "There is an exception carved out in the amendment for cases in which a health care provider deems an abortion necessary to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnder the express terms of the amendment, the government may still protect innocent life after viability,\u201d Bailey wrote. \u201cThe statutes thus remain generally enforceable after viability.\u201d",
      "Bailey said his office also will continue to honor a Missouri law requiring parental permission for minors to receive abortions.",
      "Bailey's opinion comes after voters approved a ballot measure this month that enshrines abortion rights in the state constitution while allowing lawmakers to restrict or ban it after fetal viability.",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",
      "The measure\u2019s passage was one of seven victories for abortion rights advocates this past election, while Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead the measure leaves it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri sued the day after the election to invalidate the state\u2019s abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care. That lawsuit is still pending.",
      "Allowing restrictions on abortions after viability was a sticking point for some abortion rights supporters in Missouri.",
      "Advocates had worried that failing to include such limits would sink their chances of passing abortion protections. But others cautioned against giving the Republican-controlled Legislature the power to enact regulations that could effectively end access."

    "story": [
      "A twice-yearly shot that prevents HIV infections will be available at low cost in 120 poor countries",
      "MEXICO CITY -- It\u2019s been called the closest the world has ever come to a vaccine against the AIDS virus.",
      "The twice-yearly shot was 100% effective in preventing HIV infections in a study of women, and results published Wednesday show it worked nearly as well in men.",
      "Drugmaker Gilead said it will allow cheap, generic versions to be sold in 120 poor countries with high HIV rates \u2014 mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. But it has excluded nearly all of Latin America, where rates are far lower but increasing, sparking concern the world is missing a critical opportunity to stop the disease.",
      "\u201cThis is so far superior to any other prevention method we have, that it\u2019s unprecedented,\u201d said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS. She credited Gilead for developing the drug, but said the world\u2019s ability to stop AIDS hinges on its use in at-risk countries.",
      "In a report issued to mark World AIDS Day on Sunday, UNAIDS said that the number of AIDS death last year \u2014 an estimated 630,000 \u2014 was at its lowest since peaking in 2004, suggesting the world is now at \u201ca historic crossroads\u201d and has a chance to end the epidemic.",
      "The drug called lenacapavir is already sold under the brand name Sunlenca to treat HIV infections in the U.S., Canada, Europe and elsewhere. The company plans to seek authorization soon for the drug to be used for HIV prevention.",
      "While there are other ways to guard against infection, like condoms, daily pills, vaginal rings and bi-monthly shots, experts say the Gilead twice-yearly shots would be particularly useful for marginalized people often fearful of seeking care, including gay men, sex workers and young women.",
      "\u201cIt would be a miracle for these groups because it means they just have to show up twice a year at a clinic and then they\u2019re protected,\u201d said UNAIDS\u2019 Byanyima.",
      "Such was the case for Luis Ruvalcaba, a 32-year-old man in Guadalajara, Mexico, who participated in the latest published study. He said he was afraid to ask for the daily prevention pills provided by the government, fearing he would be discriminated against as a gay man. Because he took part in the study, he'll continue to receive the shots for at least another year.",
      "\u201cIn Latin American countries, there is still a lot of stigma, patients are ashamed to ask for the pills,\u201d said Dr. Alma Minerva P\u00e9rez, who recruited and enrolled a dozen study volunteers at a private research center in Guadalajara.",
      "How widely available the shots will be in Mexico through the country's health care system isn't yet known. Health officials declined to comment on any plans to buy them for its citizens; daily pills to prevent HIV were made freely available via the country\u2019s public health system in 2021.",
      "\"If the possibility of using generics has opened, I have faith that Mexico can join,\u201d said P\u00e9rez.",
      "Byanyima said other countries besides Mexico that took part in the research were also excluded from the generics deal, including Brazil, Peru and Argentina. \u201cTo now deny them that drug is unconscionable.\u201d she said.",
      "In a statement, Gilead said it has \u201can ongoing commitment to helping enable access to HIV prevention and treatment options where the need is the greatest.\u201d Among the 120 countries eligible for generic version are 18 mostly African countries that comprise 70% of the world\u2019s HIV burden.",
      "The drugmaker said it is also working on establishing \u201cfast, efficient pathways to reach all people who need or want lenacapavir for HIV prevention.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, 15 advocacy groups in Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, Chile, Guatemala and Colombia wrote to Gilead, asking for the generic version to be made available in Latin America, citing the \u201calarming\u201d inequity in access to new HIV prevention tools while infection rates were rising.",
      "While countries including Norway, France, Spain and the U.S. have paid more than $40,000 per year for Sunlenca, experts have calculated it could be produced for as little as $40 per treatment once generic production expands to cover 10 million people.",
      "Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University, said it will be enormously useful to have the Gilead shots available in the hardest-hit countries in Africa and Asia. But he said the rising HIV rates among groups including gay men and transgender populations constituted \u201ca public health emergency\u201d in Latin America.",
      "Hannya Danielle Torres, a 30-year-old trans woman and artist who was also in the study in Mexico, said she hoped the government would find a way to provide the shots. \u201cMexico may have some of the richest people in the world but it also has some of the most vulnerable people living in extreme poverty and violence,\u201d Torres said.",
      "Another drugmaker, Viiv Healthcare, also left out most of Latin America when it allowed generics of its HIV prevention shot in about 90 countries. Sold as Apretude, the bi-monthly shots are about 80% to 90% effective in preventing HIV. They cost about $1,500 a year in middle-income countries, beyond what most can afford to pay.",
      "Asia Russell, executive director of the advocacy group Health Gap, said that with more than 1 million new HIV infections globally every year, established prevention methods are not enough. She urged countries like Brazil and Mexico to issue \u201ccompulsory licenses,\u201d a mechanism where countries suspend patents in a health crisis.",
      "It\u2019s a strategy some countries embraced for previous HIV treatments, including in the late 1990s and 2000s when AIDS drugs were first discovered. More recently, Colombia issued its first-ever compulsory license for the key HIV treatment Tivicay in April, without permission from its drugmaker, Viiv.",
      "Dr. Salim Abdool Karim, an AIDS expert at South Africa's University of KwaZulu-Natal, said he had never seen a drug that appeared to be as effective as the Gilead shot in preventing HIV.",
      "\u201cThe missing piece in the puzzle now is how we get it to everyone who needs it,\u201d he said.",

      "Lebanese families with children diagnosed with cancer are now grappling with the hardships of both illness and war",
      "BEIRUT -- Carol Zeghayer gripped her IV as she hurried down the brightly lit hallway of Beirut\u2019s children\u2019s cancer center. The 9-year-old's face brightened when she spotted her playmates from the oncology ward.",
      "Diagnosed with cancer just months before the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel erupted in October 2023, Carol relies on weekly trips to the center in the Lebanese capital for treatment.",
      "But what used to be a 90-minute drive, now takes up to three hours on a mountainous road to skirt the heavy bombardment in south Lebanon, but still not without danger from Israeli airstrikes. The family is just one among many across Lebanon now grappling with the hardships of both illness and war.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s just a child. When they strike, she asks me, \u2018Mama, was that far?\u2019\u201d said her mother, Sindus Hamra.",
      "The family lives in Hasbaya, a province in southeastern Lebanon where the rumble of Israeli airstrikes has become part of daily life. Just 15 minutes away from their home, in the front-line town of Khiam, Israeli troops and Hezbollah fighters clash amidst relentless bombardments.",
      "On the morning of a recent trip to Beirut for her treatment, the family heard a rocket roar and its deafening impact as they left their home. Israeli airstrikes have also hit vehicles along the Damascus-Beirut highway, which Carol and her mother have to cross.",
      "The bombardment hasn\u2019t let up even as hopes grew in recent days that a ceasefire might soon be agreed.",
      "More than war, Hamra fears that Carol will miss chemotherapy.",
      "\u201cHer situation is very tricky \u2014 her cancer can spread to her head,\u201d Hamra said, her eyes filling with tears. Her daughter, diagnosed first with cancer of the lymph nodes and later leukemia, has completed a third of her treatment, with many months still ahead.",
      "While Carol's family remains in their home, many in Lebanon have been displaced by an intensified Israeli bombardment that began in late September. Tens of thousands fled their homes in southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs \u2014 among them were families with children battling cancer.",
      "The Children\u2019s Cancer Center of Lebanon quickly identified each patient\u2019s location to ensure treatments remained uninterrupted, sometimes facilitating them at hospitals closer to the families' new locations, said Zeina El Chami, the center\u2019s fundraising and events executive.",
      "During the first days of the escalation, the center admitted some patients for emergency care and kept them there as it was unsafe to send them home, said Dolly Noun, a pediatric hematologist and oncologist.",
      "\u201cThey had no place to go,\u201d she added. \"We\u2019ve had patients getting admitted for panic attacks. It has not been easy.\u201d",
      "The war has not only deepened the struggles of young patients.",
      "\u201cMany physicians have had to relocate,\u201d Noun said. \u201cI know physicians, who work here, who haven\u2019t seen their parents in like six weeks because the roads are very dangerous.\u201d",
      "Since 2019, Lebanon has been battered by cascading crises \u2014 economic collapse, the devastating Beirut port explosion in 2020, and now a relentless war \u2014 leaving institutions like the cancer center struggling to secure the funds needed to save lives.",
      "\u201cCancer waits for no one,\u201d Chami said. The crises have affected the center\u2019s ability to hold fundraising events in recent years, leaving it in urgent need of donations, she added.",
      "The facility is currently treating more than 400 patients aged from few days to 18 years old, Chami said. It treats around 60% of children with cancer in Lebanon.",
      "For Carol, the war is sometimes a topic of conversation with her friends at the cancer center. Her mother hears her recount hearing the booms and how the house shook.",
      "For others, the moments with their friends in the center's playroom provide a brief escape from the grim reality outside.",
      "Eight-year-old Mohammad Mousawi darts around the playroom, giggling as he hides objects and books for his playmate to find. Too absorbed by the game, he barely answers questions, before the nurse calls him for his weekly chemotherapy treatment.",
      "His family lived in Ghobeiry, a neighborhood in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs. Their house was marked for destruction in an Israeli evacuation warning weeks ago, his mother said.",
      "\u201cBut till now, they haven\u2019t struck it,\u201d said his mother, Suzan Mousawi. \u201cThey have hit (buildings) around it \u2014 two behind it and two in front of it.\u201d",
      "The family has relocated three times. They first moved to the mountains, but the bitter cold weakened Mohammad\u2019s already fragile immune system.",
      "Now they\u2019ve settled in Ain el-Rummaneh, not far from their home in the southern Beirut suburbs known as Dahiyeh, which has come under significant bombardment. As the Israeli military widened the radius of its bombardment, some buildings hit were less than 500 meters (yards) from their current home.",
      "The Mousawis have lived their entire lives in Dahiyeh, Suzan Mousawi said, until the war uprooted them. Her parents\u2019 home was bombed. \u201cAll our memories are gone,\u201d she said.",
      "Mohammad has 15 weeks of treatment left, and his family is praying it will be successful. But the war has stolen some of their dreams.",
      "\u201cWhen Mohammad fell ill, we bought a house,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t big, but it was something. I bought him an electric scooter and set up a pool, telling myself we\u2019d take him there once he finishes treatment.\u201d",
      "She fears the house, bought with every penny she had saved, could be lost at any moment.",
      "For some families, this kind of conflict is not new. Asinat Al Lahham, a 9-year-old patient of the cancer center, is a refugee whose family fled Syria.",
      "\u201cWe escaped one war to another,\u201d Asinat\u2019s mother, Fatima, added.",
      "As her father, Aouni, drove home from her chemotherapy treatment weeks ago, an airstrike happened. He cranked up the music in the car, trying to drown out the deafening sound of the attack.",
      "Asinat sat in the back seat, clutching her favorite toy. \u201cI wanted to distract her, to make her hear less of it,\u201d he said.",
      "In the medical ward on a recent day, Asinat sat in a chair hooked to an IV drip, negotiating with her doctor. \u201cJust two or three small pinches,\u201d she pleaded, asking for flavoring for her instant noodles that she is not supposed to have.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel safe \u2026 nowhere is safe \u2026 not Lebanon, not Syria, not Palestine,\u201d Asinat said. \u201cThe sonic booms are scary, but the noodles make it better,\u201d she added with a mischievous grin.",
      "The family has no choice but to stay in Lebanon. Returning to Syria, where their home is gone, would mean giving up Asinat\u2019s treatment.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t leave here,\u201d her mother said. \u201cThis war, her illness \u2026 it\u2019s like there\u2019s no escape.\u201d"

      "Members of Parliament (MPs), who have been holding emotional meetings with constituents and searching their souls, are due to debate the issue that crosses political lines.",
      "Supporters say the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent unnecessary suffering. Opponents say it would put vulnerable people at risk, fearing that some would be coerced to end their lives and that some elderly or disabled people may opt for death so they don't become a burden.",

      "Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, along with three former Conservative prime ministers \u2014 Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Theresa May \u2014 have publicly opposed the bill, though they are no longer in the House of Commons and can't vote. Former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron supports it.",

They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die.",
      "Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built in and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\u201d \u2014 two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",

      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has done so voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",

      "Esther Rantzen, 84, a broadcaster dying of lung cancer, has urged passage of the bill so others don\u2019t have to do what she plans to do by traveling to Switzerland to legally end her life. She urged all 650 MPs to attend the hearing.",
      "\u201cThis is such a vital life and death issue, one that we the public care desperately about,\u201d Rantzen said in a public letter. \u201cIt is only right that as many MPs as possible listen to the arguments for and against, and make up your own minds, according to your own conscience, your personal thoughts and feelings.\u201d",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances."

    "story": [
      "Millions of obese Americans would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning",
      "WASHINGTON -- Millions of Americans with obesity would be eligible to have popular weight-loss drugs like Wegovy or Zepbound covered by Medicare or Medicaid under a new rule the Biden administration proposed Tuesday morning.",
      "The costly proposal from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services immediately sets the stage for a showdown between the powerful pharmaceutical industry and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken opponent of the weight-loss drugs who, as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the agency, could block the measure.",
      "While the rule would give millions of people access to weekly injectables that have helped people shed pounds so quickly that some have labeled them miracle drugs, it would cost taxpayers as much as $35 billion over the next decade.",
      "\u201cIt's a good day for anyone who suffers from obesity,\u201d U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cIt's a game changer for Americans who can't afford these drugs otherwise.\u201d",
      "The rule would not be finalized until January, days after Trump takes office. A bipartisan coalition of congressional members has lobbied for the drugs to be covered by Medicare, saying it could save the government from spending billions of dollars on treating chronic ailments that stem from obesity. While it's unclear where Trump himself stands on coverage of the weight-loss drugs, his allies and Cabinet picks who have vowed to cut government spending could balk at the upfront price tag.",
      "Under the proposal, only those who are considered obese \u2014 someone who has a body mass index of 30 or higher \u2014 would qualify for coverage. Some people may already get coverage of the drugs through Medicare or Medicaid, if they have diabetes or are at risk for stroke or heart disease.",
      "Becerra estimated that an additional 3.5 million people on Medicare and 4 million on Medicaid could qualify for coverage of the drugs. But research suggests far more people might qualify, with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimating roughly 28 million people on Medicaid are considered obese.",
      "Medicare has been barred from offering the drugs under a decades-old law that prohibits the government-backed insurance program from covering weight-loss products. The rule proposed by the Biden administration, however, would recognize obesity as a disease that can be treated with the help of the drugs.",
      "The anti-obesity drug market has expanded significantly in recent years, with the Food and Drug Administration approving a new class of weekly injectables like Novo Nordisk\u2019s Wegovy and Eli Lilly\u2019s Zepbound to treat obesity.",
      "People can lose as much as 15% to 25% of their body weight on the drugs, which imitate the hormones that regulate appetites by communicating fullness between the gut and brain when people eat.",
      "The cost of the drugs has largely limited them to the wealthy, including celebrities who boast of their benefits. A monthly supply of Wegovy rings up at $1,300 and Zepbound will put you out $1,000. Shortages of the drugs have also limited the supplies.",
      "Kennedy, who as Trump's nominee for HHS secretary is subject to Senate confirmation, has railed against the drugs' popularity. In speeches and on social media, he's said the U.S. should not cover the drugs through Medicaid or Medicare. Instead, he supports a broad expansion of coverage for healthier foods and gym memberships.",
      "\u201cFor half the price of Ozempic, we could purchase regeneratively raised, organic food for every American, three meals a day and a gym membership, for every obese American,\u201d Kennedy said to a group of federal lawmakers during a roundtable earlier this year. Ozempic is a diabetes drug that can stimulate weight loss."

      "President-elect Donald Trump has chosen health economist Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a critic of pandemic lockdowns and vaccine mandates, to lead the National Institutes of Health, the nation's leading medical research agency.",
      "Trump, in a statement Tuesday evening, said Bhattacharya, a 56-year-old physician and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine, will work in cooperation with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, \"to direct the Nation\u2019s Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cTogether, Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America\u2019s biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease,\" he wrote.",
      "The decision to choose Bhattacharya for the post is yet another reminder of the ongoing impact of the COVID pandemic on the politics on public health.",
      "Bhattacharya was one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that lockdowns were causing irreparable harm.",
      "The document \u2014 which came before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and during the first Trump administration \u2014 promoted \u201cherd immunity,\u201d the idea that people at low risk should live normally while building up immunity to COVID-19 through infection. Protection should focus instead on people at higher risk, the document said.",
      "\u201cI think the lockdowns were the single biggest public health mistake,\u201d Bhattacharya said in March 2021 during a panel discussion convened by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "The Great Barrington Declaration was embraced by some in the first Trump administration, even as it was widely denounced by disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "His nomination would need to be approved by the Senate.",
      "Trump on Tuesday also announced that Jim O\u2019Neill, a former HHS official and Silicon Valley investor, will serve as deputy secretary of the sprawling agency. Trump said O\u2019Neill \u201cwill oversee all operations and improve Management, Transparency, and Accountability to, Make America Healthy Again,\u201d the president-elect announced.",
      "O\u2019Neill is a longtime associate of billionaire entrepreneur Peter Thiel, one of Trump's leading backers from the tech industry. Thiel and O'Neill co-founded Mithril Capital Management, a venture fund that invests in medical technology and other startup companies. O\u2019Neill previously served in HHS under George W. Bush and was considered to head the Food and Drug Administration during Trump's first term. He has expressed disdain for federal regulation, including FDA's approach to regulating emerging drugs and other technologies.",
      "O\u2019Neill also worked on some of Thiel\u2019s signature projects, often reflecting his libertarian philosophy.",
      "He served on the board of a Thiel-funded nonprofit that aimed to develop man-made islands that would float outside U.S. territory, allowing them to experiment with new forms of government. He also helped form and run the Thiel Fellowship, which awards $100,000 to young entrepreneurs who want to leave school to pursue a business or scientific venture.",
      "O\u2019Neill is the only one of Trump\u2019s health picks so far who brings previous experience working inside the HHS bureaucracy. Trump\u2019s previous choices to lead public health agencies \u2014 including Kennedy, Dr. Mehmet Oz for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator and Dr. Marty Makary for FDA commissioner \u2014 have all been Washington outsiders who are vowing to shake up the agencies.",
      "Bhattacharya, who faced restrictions on social media platforms because of his views, was also a plaintiff in Murthy v. Missouri, a Supreme Court case contending that federal officials improperly suppressed conservative views on social media as part of their efforts to combat misinformation. The Supreme Court sided with the Biden administration in that case.",
      "After Elon Musk acquired Twitter in 2022, he invited Bhattacharya to the company's headquarters to learn more about how his views had been restricted on the platform, which Musk renamed X. More recently, Bhattacharya has posted on X about scientists leaving the site and joining the alternative site Bluesky, mocking Bluesky as \"their own little echo chamber.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya has argued that vaccine mandates that barred unvaccinated people from activities and workplaces undermined Americans' trust in the public health system.",
      "He is a former research fellow at the Hoover Institution and an economist at the RAND Corporation.",
      "The National Institutes of Health falls under HHS, which Trump has nominated Kennedy to oversee. The NIH's $48 billion budget funds medical research on vaccines, cancer and other diseases through competitive grants to researchers at institutions across the nation. The agency also conducts its own research with thousands of scientists working at NIH labs in Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Among advances that were supported by NIH money are a medication for opioid addiction, a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer, many new cancer drugs and the speedy development of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.",

      "The detection of bird flu virus this week in a batch of unpasteurized milk sold in California underscores what health experts say are the known and potential risks of the products",
      "President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for the nation's top health job, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has vowed to allow wider distribution of raw milk across America. But the detection of bird flu virus in unpasteurized milk sold in California stores underscores what health experts say are the known and potential risks.",
      "\u201cYou have to assume that raw milk, unpasteurized milk, has potential infectious agents that can cause serious illness in the people who drink it,\" said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious disease researcher who has investigated foodborne illness outbreaks.",
      "Raw Farm LLC, of Fresno, California, voluntarily recalled one lot of \u201ccream top\u201d whole raw milk after Santa Clara County health officials found the bird flu virus in a sample last week. State health officials said the county has been testing raw milk sold in stores as \u201ca second line of consumer protection.\u201d",
      "No illnesses have been traced to Raw Farm products, which have a lot code of 20241109 and a best-by date of Nov. 27. But officials with California's health department warned consumers not to drink the milk and said retailers should remove it from their shelves. On Tuesday, Los Angeles County health officials warned that \u201cmany retailers\u201d there may have sold recalled raw milk contaminated with the virus.",
      "Here's what else you need to know about raw milk and bird flu:",
      "It\u2019s not a surprise that the virus was found in raw milk sold in stores, Osterholm said.",
      "Bird flu, also known as Type A H5N1 influenza, was first confirmed in U.S. dairy cattle in March and has been spreading widely. In California, more than 435 dairy herds have seen infections \u2014 more than all other U.S. states combined. And high levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows.",
      "About 20% of samples of pasteurized milk sold in stores were found to contain viral remnants of the virus, according to tests conducted earlier this year by government scientists. Pasteurization, or heat treatment, kills the bird flu virus and also bacteria such as E. coli, listeria and salmonella, which are known to make people sick.",
      "Officials with California's Department of Food and Agriculture have been conducting weekly tests of raw milk in bulk tanks from the state's dairies. Additional tests conducted at Raw Farm sites in California were negative for the virus, but officials said they would begin testing for bird flu twice a week.",
      "Few tests of unpasteurized milk products from stores have been conducted, so it's possible that other raw dairy products may contain the virus, Osterholm said.",
      "\u201cIt is still really unclear how much testing is going on,\u201d said Osterholm. \u201cWe're flying blind.\u201d",
      "To date, there's no evidence that people have been infected with the bird flu virus by drinking raw milk. At least 55 people in the U.S. are known to have been infected by the virus this year, but nearly all were dairy or poultry workers who developed mild illness after close contact with infected animals.",
      "Tests have shown that mice fed raw milk contaminated with bird flu became very sick and barn cats on farms that drank milk from infected cows suffered brain damage and died, noted Nicole Martin, a microbiologist and associate director of the Milk Quality Improvement Program at Cornell University,",
      "\u201cI don't think we know yet whether people can contract H5N1 from consumption of raw milk, but we have enough evidence that would suggest that folks need to be a little more cautious right now,\u201d Martin said.",
      "Nearly 4.4% of U.S. adults, or about 11 million people, report that they drink raw milk at least once each year. About 1% of adults say they consume raw milk each week, according to a 2022 FDA study.",
      "Proponents of raw milk cite perceived health benefits and better taste as key reasons for consumption. Raw Farm advertises its products as \u201cunprocessed and complete\u201d with vitamins, minerals, enzymes and beneficial bacteria.",
      "Fans include Kennedy, who has said he only drinks raw milk. Kennedy has criticized agriculture departments for cracking down on raw milk and promised that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201c aggressive suppression \u201d of unpasteurized milk would end under Trump.",
      "Mark McAfee, owner of Raw Farm, has appeared several times on podcasts hosted by Nicole Shanahan, Kennedy's former running mate. Both Kennedy and Shanahan are customers, McAfee told the Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThey want that same level of differentiating, wonderful, tested, gorgeous, safe, delicious raw milk for everybody,\" McAfee said.",
      "Health officials have warned for years that raw milk can cause illnesses that range from mild to life-threatening. Between 1998 and 2018, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention documented more than 200 illness outbreaks traced to raw milk, which sickened more than 2,600 people and hospitalized more than 225.",
      "Before the U.S. adopted safety standards in 1924 under what was called the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance, about 25% of foodborne illnesses were related to dairy consumption, according to the Center for Dairy Research. Now, dairy products account for about 1% of such illnesses.",

      "The 86-year-old has no way of knowing which grave belongs to his father, M\u2019Bap Senghor, one of the hundreds of West African riflemen who fought for France during World War II but were likely killed on Dec. 1, 1944, by the French army after demanding unpaid wages.",
      "In this cemetery, where they are supposedly buried, all the graves are anonymous and the exact location of the remains is unknown, as is the number of victims. The true scale and circumstances of the killings remain unclear as Senegal commemorates the 80th anniversary of the massacre on Sunday, threatening to reignite smoldering tensions between France and the former colony.",
      "\u201cI have been fighting to get answers for over 80 years,\u201d says Biram Senghor. \u201c(French President Emmanuel) Macron cannot do what the other French presidents before him did; France has to repent.\u201d",
      "The West Africans were members of the unit called \u201cTirailleurs S\u00e9n\u00e9galais,\u201d a corps of colonial infantry in the French Army that fought in both World Wars. According to historians, there were disputes over unpaid wages in the days before the massacre and on Dec. 1, French troops turned on the unarmed African soldiers and shot them dead.",
      "For decades, French authorities tried to minimize what had happened in Thiaroye. Reports by the French military shortly after the massacre determined that 35 West African soldiers were killed in response to a \u201cmutiny.\u201d Other reports by the French army mention 70 deaths.",
      "But today, many French and Senegalese historians agree the true death toll is likely in the hundreds, with some speaking of almost 400 African soldiers killed, based on estimates of the number of riflemen present at the camp on the day of the massacre.",
      "On Thursday, Macron officially recognized the events of Thiaroye as a massacre for the first time in a letter to Senegal\u2019s President Diomaye Faye, which was seen by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cFrance must recognize that on that day, the confrontation between soldiers and riflemen who demanded their full legitimate wages be paid, triggered a chain of events that resulted in a massacre,\u201d read Macron\u2019s letter.",
      "But many historians dispute the idea of a confrontation between the French soldiers and the West African riflemen.",
      "\u201cWhat happened on December 1st was the execution of unarmed soldiers,\u201d says Martin Mourre, a French historian and author of Thiaroye 1944, History and Memory of a Colonial Massacre.",
      "He points to the fact that no weapons were mentioned during the trial of the African riflemen accused of mutiny and the absence of any injuries among the French soldiers as evidence that no confrontation took place.",
      "In his letter to the Senegalese president, Macron did not mention the number of soldiers killed.",
      "The controversies and unknowns about the massacre are in part due to a lack of transparency by French authorities regarding the military reports and testimonies.",
      "In 2014, French President Francois Hollande handed over the European nation\u2019s archives on Thiaroye to Macky Sall, then-president of Senegal.",
      "But historians say that key documents, including ones indicating the site of the mass graves and the number of West African soldiers present at the camp on the day of the massacre, are still missing. It is unclear if France holds such archives or if they even exist.",
      "Macron\u2019s office and the French foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Additionally, very little was done by the Senegalese authorities under former president Sall to allow historians to delve into the historical documents.",
      "\u201cThe archives remained inaccessible until this year, for obscure reasons,\u201d says Mourre.",
      "Mamadou Diouf, a Senegalese historian who heads the commemoration committee for the Thiaroye massacre this year, says Sall did not show much interest in the subject to avoid diplomatic tensions with France.",
      "But Senegal\u2019s President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who was elected in March in part on a promise of redefining Senegal\u2019s relationship with the former colonizer, has vowed to regain control of the historical narrative on Thiaroye.",
      "His administration has organized major commemorations of the massacre from Dec. 1 to April 2025 across the country.",
      "\u201cThe authorities' goal behind the major commemorations is to make Thiaroye part of Senegal\u2019s national story,\u201d says Babacar Ndiaye, political analyst at the Wathi think tank, which focuses on political and economic issues in West Africa.",
      "\u201cIt will be talked about a lot on television, in the press and most importantly on social media,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis will reach a younger audience who might know little about the events of Thiaroye.\u201d",
      "The 80th anniversary of the massacre comes as France\u2019s influence is declining in the region, with Paris losing its sway in its former West African colonies.",
      "French troops have been ousted in recent years from Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso after years of fighting Islamic extremists alongside regional troops. Earlier this week, Chad, one of the last countries in the region where France had maintained a large military presence, ended a military cooperation agreement with Paris.",
      "France still has around 350 troops in Senegal, mainly in a supportive role. Asked about their continued presence, Faye suggested it is not something the Senegalese would want.",
      "\u201cHistorically, France enslaved, colonized and stayed here,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, I think that when you reverse the roles a little, you will have a hard time conceiving that another army \u2014 of China, Russia, Senegal, or any other country \u2014 could have a military base in France.\u201d",
      "At the ceremony held at the military cemetery in Thiaroye on Sunday, Faye announced the construction of a memorial in honor of the riflemen, the creation of a research center where archives on the massacre will be kept, and streets named after the event. History lessons on the massacre will also be added to the school curriculum and Dec. 1 will officially become \u201cnational day of the tirailleur.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we are doing here is part of our duty of remembrance and to reveal the truth of the facts, to discharge a moral debt towards the riflemen and their families,\u201d said during his speech in front of an audience that included France\u2019s Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot, as well as Gambia, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, Gabon and the Comoros heads of state. Macron was not present at the ceremony.",
      "\u201cWe are not opening a door to arouse resentment, maintain anger or hatred,\u201d Faye said.",
      "But once more, Senegal and the former colonizer's account of the massacre differed.",
      "While the French foreign minister described the events of Thiaroye as a \u201ccry of anger\u201d from the riflemen that France \u201crepressed in a bloodshed,\u201d the Senegalese president said they were \u201ca premeditated act.\u201d",

      "A top Romanian court has validated the first round of a presidential race in which a far-right outsider emerged as the frontrunner, plunging the country into a week of turmoil amid allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling",
      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- A top Romanian court on Monday validated the first round of a presidential race in which a far-right outsider emerged as the frontrunner, plunging the country into turmoil amid allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling.",
      "The Constitutional Court\u2019s unanimous decision came after it asked the Central Election Bureau to recount and verify all 9.4 million ballots cast in the first round of the presidential election on Nov. 24. BEC approved the request and said that scanned reports were due to be sent in on Dec. 1. The decision is final.",
      "Calin Georgescu, a little-known far-right populist and independent candidate, narrowly won the first round, beating the incumbent prime minister Marcel Ciolacu. Georgescu will face reformist Elena Lasconi, the leader of the Save Romania Union party, in a Dec. 8. runoff. Lasconi beat Ciolacu by just 2,740 votes.",
      "The recount was prompted by a complaint lodged by Cristian Terhes, a presidential candidate who garnered 1% of the ballot. Terhes\u2019 press office said the court ordered the recount \u201cdue to indications of fraud,\u201d alleging that valid votes cast for Ludovic Orban \u2014 who had dropped out of the race but remained on the ballot \u2014 were reassigned to Lasconi.",
      "He also claimed that Lasconi\u2019s party had urged people to vote before some diaspora polls had closed, saying it violated electoral laws against campaign activities on polling day.",
      "On Monday, the BEC submitted partial recount results to the court, which did not include hundreds of thousands of the votes from Romania\u2019s large diaspora.",
      "Dominic Fritz, the vice president of USR, said in a statement before that court\u2019s decision that more than 8 million votes had been recounted, and that \u201cno one has found any reason to question the final results.\u201d",
      "Many observers had warned that invalidating the vote could further fuel the crisis that gripped Romania's political establishment in the wake of the first round.",
      "Georgescu\u2019s unexpected success prompted a series of protests by people concerned with previous remarks he made in praising Romanian fascist and nationalist leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and believe he poses a threat to democracy.",
      "Many have attributed to his rapid rise in popularity on the social media platform TikTok. According to a report by Expert Forum, a Bucharest-based think tank, Georgescu\u2019s account has had an explosion which it said \u201cappears sudden and artificial, similar to his polling results.\u201d",
      "Without naming Georgescu, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis\u2019 office said after a Supreme Council of National Defense meeting last Thursday that an analysis of documents revealed that \u201ca presidential candidate benefited from massive exposure due to preferential treatment granted by the TikTok platform.\u201d",
      "Romania\u2019s National Audiovisual Council asked the European Commission to investigate TikTok\u2019s role in the Nov. 24 vote. Pavel Popescu, the vice president of Romania\u2019s media regulator Ancom, said he would request TikTok\u2019s suspension in Romania if investigations find evidence of \u201cmanipulation of the electoral process.\u201d",
      "TikTok did not respond to a request from The Associated Press.",
      "On Sunday, Romania also held a parliamentary election in which pro-Western parties won the most votes and will look to form a coalition government. The ballot also saw a surge of support for far-right nationalists who made huge gains in the country\u2019s legislature."

      "\u201cMexico must be respected, especially by its trading partners,\u201d President Claudia Sheinbaum said, after Canada\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, told The Associated Press on Sunday that \u201cthe message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood.\u201d",

      "Biden's three-day visit to Angola will focus largely on the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance the U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies.",

He also will travel to the Atlantic port city of Lobito for a look at the rail project. He will announce new developments on health, agribusiness and security, White House officials said.",
      "Biden had been expected to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit in December 2022. The trip was pushed back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among some Africans that their continent is still low priority for Washington.",
      "The last U.S. president to visit sub-Saharan Africa was Barack Obama in 2015. Biden did attend a United Nations climate summit in Egypt in North Africa in 2022.",
      "\u201cI just kind of push back on the premise that this is some Johnny-come-lately trip at the very end,\u201d national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on board Air Force One on the way to Angola, noting that top administration officials had visited Africa, including Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cThis is something he (Biden) has been focused on since he became president of the United States.\u201d",
      "Critical minerals are a key field for U.S.-China competition, and China has a stranglehold on Africa\u2019s critical minerals.",
      "The U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer) railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China\u2019s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy.",
      "The Biden administration has called the corridor one of the president\u2019s signature initiatives, yet Lobito\u2019s future and any change in U.S. engagement with the continent depends on the incoming administration of President-elect Trump.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden is no longer the story,\u201d said Mvemba Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEven African leaders are focused on Donald Trump.\u201d",

      "Many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which won't be complete until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration. Blunting China has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump\u2019s to-do list.",
      "\u201cAs long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it\u2019s going to keep being funded,\u201d said Christian-G\u00e9raud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Kirby said the Biden administration hopes Trump and his team see the value in Lobito but \u201cwe are still in office. We still have 50 days. This is a key major development not just for the United States and our foreign policy goals in Africa, but for Africans.\u201d",
      "The Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola\u2019s port of Lobito, strengthening a route west for Africa\u2019s critical minerals. It also ultimately aims to extend from Zambia and Congo to Africa\u2019s east coast through Tanzania and be a coast-to-coast rail link.",
      "While Biden\u2019s administration called it a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for U.S. investment in Africa, it\u2019s little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, with China dominant in mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, with most heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe rely on.",
      "Michelle Gavin, a former adviser on Africa to Obama, said the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend.",
      "The Lobito Corridor was \u201cnot just about trying to blunt China, but trying to imagine, OK, what does it look like if we actually were to show up in a more serious way?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one project. It\u2019s one good idea. And I\u2019m very glad we\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s not enough.\u201d",
      "Lobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola\u2019s long and strong ties with Beijing.",
      "The Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola\u2019s civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year.",
      "The visit will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America\u2019s value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden\u2019s trip to criticize the Louren\u00e7o government\u2019s authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while laws have been passed that severely restrict freedoms, according to rights groups.",

And we\u2019re going to keep trying and see what we can do to get it down to zero so that both sides are fully implementing it. But, this is, this is the only it\u2019s only a, a week or so old.\u201d",

      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Hezbollah fired into a disputed border zone held by Israel on Monday, the militant group\u2019s first attack since its ceasefire with Israel took hold last week, after Lebanon accused Israel of violating the truce more than 50 times in recent days.",
      "The Israeli military said two projectiles were launched toward Mount Dov, a disputed Israeli-held territory known as Shebaa Farms in Lebanon, where the borders of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel meet. Israel said the projectiles fell in open areas and no injuries were reported.",
      "Hezbollah said in a statement that it fired on an Israeli military position in the area as a \u201cdefensive and warning response\u201d after what it called \u201crepeated violations\u201d of the ceasefire deal by Israel. It said complaints to mediators tasked with monitoring the ceasefire \u201cwere futile in stopping these violations.\u201d",
      "The U.S.- and French-brokered ceasefire came into effect on Wednesday calling for a 60-day halt in fighting, aiming to end more than a year of exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel.",
      "Since then, Israel has carried out a number of strikes in Lebanon, most recently on Monday, when a drone strike killed a man on a motorcycle in southern Lebanon and another hit a Lebanese army bulldozer in the northeastern town of Hermel, wounding a soldier. The Lebanese army had stayed on the sidelines of the war between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "Israel says the strikes are in response to Hezbollah violations of the ceasefire, without giving specifics.",
      "BEIRUT \u2014 Lebanon\u2019s parliament speaker on Monday accused Israel of committing 54 breaches of the ceasefire that ended the war between Hezbollah and Israel, demanding urgent intervention to halt what he called \u201cflagrant violations.\u201d",
      "Speaking to the Lebanese newspaper Al Joumhouria, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri condemned Israel\u2019s \u201caggressive actions,\u201d including the alleged demolition of homes in border villages, the persistent overflight of Israeli reconnaissance drones, and airstrikes that have caused casualties.",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Berri\u2019s assertions. Israel says it reserves the right under the ceasefire deal to respond to perceived ceasefire violations.",
      "An Israeli drone strike on Monday hit a Lebanese army military bulldozer in the northeastern town of Hermel, wounding a soldier, the Lebanese army said in a statement.",
      "Also on Monday, an Israeli drone strike targeting a motorcycle in Jdeidet Marjayoun in southern Lebanon killed one person, the Lebanese Health Ministry said. In Bint Jbeil province, a drone strike injured one person, the state-run National News Agency said.",
      "On Saturday, two people were killed in an airstrike on Marjayoun province, Lebanon\u2019s state media said.",
      "Berri called on the technical committee established to monitor the ceasefire to take immediate action, urging it to \u201coblige Israel to halt its violations and withdraw from Lebanese territories without delay.\u201d",

It said it struck several military vehicles in Lebanon\u2019s Bekaa province as well as strikes on Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon.",
      "The incidents underscored the fragility of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah reached after nearly 14 months of cross-border fighting.",
      "Since the ceasefire went into effect on Wednesday, Israel has struck several times in response to what it says have been ceasefire violations by Hezbollah. Lebanon has accused Israel of violating the deal but so far Hezbollah has not resumed its rocket fire.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar on Monday rejected accusations that Israel is violating the tenuous ceasefire agreement, saying it was responding to Hezbollah violations.",
      "In a post on X, Saar said that he made that point in a call with his French counterpart, Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot. France, along with the U.S., helped broker the deal and is part of an international monitoring committee meant to ensure the sides uphold their commitments.",

      "Neutra, 21, was a New York native who enlisted in the Israeli military and was captured when Hamas attacked southern Israel. Neutra\u2019s parents, Ronen and Orna, led a public campaign while he was thought to be alive for their son\u2019s freedom. They spoke at protests in the U.S. and Israel, addressed the Republican National Convention this year and kept up ties with the Biden administration in their crusade to secure their son\u2019s release.",
      "In a statement announcing the death, the military did not say how it came to the conclusion over Neutra\u2019s fate. He was one of seven American Israelis still held in Gaza, four of whom are now said to be dead. Hamas released a video of one, Edan Alexander, over the weekend, indicating he was still alive.",
      "In late summer, Israel said Hamas killed Hersh Goldberg-Polin, another prominent Israeli American hostage, along with five other captives, whose bodies the Israeli military recovered.",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostage. Some 100 captives are still held inside Gaza, around two-thirds believed to be alive.",
      "Iraqi militias supported by Iran deployed in Syria on Monday to back the government\u2019s counteroffensive against a surprise advance by insurgents who seized the largest city of Aleppo, a militia official and a war monitor said.",
      "Insurgents led by jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham launched a two-pronged attack on Aleppo last week and the countryside around Idlib before moving toward neighboring Hama province. Government troops built a fortified defensive line in northern Hama in an attempt to stall the insurgents\u2019 momentum while jets on Sunday pounded rebel-held lines.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with Syrian President Bashar Assad in Damascus Sunday and announced Tehran\u2019s full support for his government. He later arrived for talks in Ankara, Turkey, one of the rebels' main backers.",

      "Results from Ireland's election suggest the two dominant center-right parties look likely to form a new government",
      "DUBLIN -- Ireland\u2019s two long-dominant center-right parties looked likely to form a new government as results came in Sunday from a fractured national election, though with a reduced vote share and complex coalition negotiations ahead.",
      "In an exception to the global anti-incumbent mood, outgoing governing parties Fianna Fail and Fine Gael took the two largest shares of the vote, narrowly ahead of left-of-center opposition Sinn Fein.",
      "Under Ireland's system of proportional representation, vote share does not translate neatly into seats in parliament. With about two-thirds of results declared, Fianna Fail was on course to be the biggest party in the 174-seat D\u00e1il, the lower house of parliament, with Fine Gael and Sinn Fein battling for second place.",
      "It's certain that no party will have enough seats to govern on its own, and the most likely outcome is a coalition between Fianna Fail, led by Miche\u00e1l Martin, and Fine Gael under outgoing Prime Minister Simon Harris. In that case either Harris or Martin \u2014 or possibly both, if they strike a job-sharing deal \u2014 will become Ireland's next premier, known as the taoiseach.",
      "Sinn Fein, which aims to reunify the Republic of Ireland with the U.K. territory of Northern Ireland, lacks a clear path to power because the other two parties say they won\u2019t work with it, partly because of its historic ties with the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland.",
      "Ireland uses a complex system of proportional representation in which each of the country\u2019s 43 constituencies elects several lawmakers and voters rank candidates in order of preference. As a result, it can take days for full results to be known.",
      "\u201cThe people of Ireland have now spoken,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe now have to work out exactly what they have said, and that is going to take a little bit of time.\u201d",
      "The cost of living \u2014 especially Ireland\u2019s acute housing crisis \u2014 was a dominant topic in the three-week campaign, alongside immigration, which has become an emotive and challenging issue in a country of 5.4 million people long defined by emigration.",
      "The results of Friday's election mean Ireland has partly bucked the global trend of incumbents being rejected by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures.",
      "The next government, like the last, will likely be led by two parties that have dominated Irish politics for the past century. Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have similar policies, but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland\u2019s 1920s civil war. After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat, they formed a coalition, propped up by the Green Party.",

      "JERUSALEM -- Hezbollah fired into a disputed border zone held by Israel on Monday after multiple Israeli strikes inside Lebanon since a ceasefire took hold last week. The militant group said the volley, its first during the truce, was a warning shot in response to what it called repeated Israeli violations.",
      "Israeli leaders threatened to retaliate and within hours, Israel's military carried out a string of strikes in southern Lebanon, including five hits in the al-Tuffah region, Lebanese state media reported. There was no immediate word on casualties or what was struck. Israeli strikes in Lebanon in recent days have killed at least four people and wounded others.",
      "The attacks have further strained the fragile U.S.- and French-brokered ceasefire, which began Wednesday and calls for a 60-day halt in fighting. It aims to end more than a year of war between Hezbollah and Israel that's part of a wider regional conflict sparked by the devastating Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, accused Israel of violating the truce more than 50 times in recent days, with strikes, demolition of homes near the border and overflight of drones.",
      "Israel has said its strikes were in response to unspecified Hezbollah violations, and that under the ceasefire deal it reserves the right to retaliate.",
      "The Israeli military said Hezbollah launched two projectiles on Monday toward Mount Dov, a disputed Israeli-held territory known as Shebaa Farms in Lebanon, where the borders of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel meet. Israel said the projectiles fell in open areas and no injuries were reported.",
      "Hezbollah said in a statement that it fired on an Israeli military position in the area as a \u201cdefensive and warning response\u201d after what it called \u201crepeated violations\u201d of the ceasefire deal by Israel. It said complaints to mediators tasked with monitoring the ceasefire \u201cwere futile in stopping these violations.\u201d",
      "Officials in the United States \u2014 which along with France heads a commission meant to monitor adherence to the deal \u2014 played down the significance of Israeli strikes. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said, \u201cLargely speaking, the ceasefire is holding.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from dozens of strikes down to one a day maybe two a day,\u201d Kirby told reporters, referring to Israeli strikes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep trying and see what we can do to get it down to zero.\u201d",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Hezbollah fire was \u201ca serious violation\u201d and vowed, \u201cIsrael will respond forcefully.\u201d Defense Minister Israel Katz said the volley \u201cwill be met with a harsh response.\u201d",
      "Under the ceasefire deal, Iran-backed Hezbollah has 60 days to withdraw its fighters and infrastructure from southern Lebanon, pulling back north of the Litani River, which is about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the Israeli-Lebanese border. During that time, Israeli troops are also to withdraw to their side of the border.",
      "On Monday before the Hezbollah fire, Israeli carried out at least four airstrikes and an artillery barrage around southern Lebanon, including a drone strike that killed a person on a motorcycle, according to Lebanese state media. Another strike killed a corporal in the Lebanese security services. The Israeli military said it carried out operations in the south against Hezbollah militants, \u201cthwarting threats to Israeli civilians,\u201d without elaborating.",
      "Another drone strike Monday hit a Lebanese army bulldozer, wounding a soldier, in the northeastern town of Hermel \u2013 far north of the Litani River. The Israeli military said it hit military vehicles operating \u201cin the area of a Hezbollah missile manufacturing site.\u201d",
      "The Lebanese army, which stayed on the sidelines of the Israel-Hezbollah fighting, is supposed to deploy additional troops in the south alongside U.N. peacekeepers to ensure Hezbollah\u2019s withdrawal from the area. An Israeli strike on Saturday in the southern Marjayoun area killed two people, according to state media.",
      "In a video statement, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel was striking Hezbollah fighters in the south when they are identified or seen attempting to move weapons.",
      "\u201cTheir presence south of the Litani River is the most basic violation of the understandings \u2026 They must move north immediately,\u201d he said, despite the 60-day period the deal gives for a pullback.",
      "In Gaza, meanwhile, alarm over increasing hunger was growing. The amount of food allowed in by Israel has plunged over the past two months, compounded by a decision Sunday by the U.N. to halt aid deliveries from the main crossing into the territory because of the threat of armed gangs looting convoys.",
      "Experts already warned of famine in the northernmost part of Gaza, which Israeli forces have almost completely isolated since early October.",
      "Muhannad Hadi, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for the occupied Palestinian Territories, warned on Monday of \u201csevere hunger surging\u201d in central and southern Gaza as well. Speaking at a conference in Cairo aimed at increasing aid, he said more than 1 million people have not received their monthly food rations since July.",
      "Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas\u2019 Oct 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, has driven almost the entire population of the territory from their homes. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians now live in squalid tent camps and reliant on international aid.",
      "In a tent camp in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, Palestinians lined up at makeshift mud ovens trying to buy a few loaves of flatbread for their families.",
      "With the price of flour mounting because of scarcity, the bakers \u2014 women displaced from further north \u2014 said they could bake less bread, and families could afford far less.",

      "A distant relative also selling bread, Enayat al-Attar, said some people cut up a single piece of flatbread among themselves. \u201cFlour is running out for everyone,\u201d she said.",
      "The Israeli military said it allowed 40 trucks carrying 600 tons of flour for the World Food Program to enter the southern Gaza Strip on Sunday night, as well as 16 other food trucks.",
      "Israel has said it is working to increase the flow of aid. November saw an increase in the average number of humanitarian trucks it let into Gaza, up to 77 daily from 57 the month before, according to official Israeli figures.",
      "But the levels are still nearly the lowest of the entire 15-month war. And the U.N. says less than half of that actually reaches Palestinians because Israeli military restrictions, fighting and robberies make it too dangerous to deliver the aid.",
      "On Sunday, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, said it is halting aid deliveries through Kerem Shalom, the main artery for aid, because of repeated robberies. It blamed the breakdown of law and order in large part on Israeli policies.",

There is honey over two plates, while some drops of water come out of a tap that fall on a piece of wood. All for the bees. After a few months, sometimes six, he takes them to the Andean forests of Peru, more than 225 kilometers (140 miles) from Lima, where his parents live and also take care of bees.",

      "A rebel spokesman says drone strikes by Mali\u2019s military regime have killed eight Tuareg rebel leaders in the north of the country",
      "BAMAKO, Mali -- Drone strikes by Mali's military regime killed eight Tuareg rebel leaders in the town of Tinzaouatine in the north of the country, a rebel spokesman said Sunday. It was the first time since the start of the rebellion in 2012 that so many Taureg leaders have been killed in a single attack.",
      "\u201cSeveral synchronized drone strikes martyred some Azawad leader on December 1, 2024 in Tinzaouatine, near the Algerian border,\u201d spokesman Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane said in a statement.",
      "Azawad is the term used by the separatists for northern Mali. The statement from the separatists lists the names of eight Tuareg chiefs, the best known of whom is Fahad Ag Al Mahmoud, Secretary General of the Gatia, a Tuareg armed group.",
      "Later Sunday evening, the General Staff of the Malian armed forces confirmed the deaths of the rebel leaders, whom it described as terrorists, \u201cin a special operation.\u201d The military statement was broadcast on Malian national television channel ORTM.",
      "\u201cClearly this is a major loss to northern Malian groups since among the victims there are key leaders who have been influential in their communities,\" said Rida Lyammouri, senior fellow at the Policy Center for the New South, a Moroccan think tank. \"However, it will further intensify the anti sentiment toward Bamako, and the setback doesn\u2019t mean the fight is over.\u201d",
      "He said \u201cthe junta has demonstrated with these airstrikes that it is not afraid to use the air assets (drones) it acquired anytime it can.\"",
      "The attack by Mali's military regime comes a day after the armed groups in the north announced they were merging into a single political-military entity, now called the Azawad Liberation Front. The new group\u2019s mission is \u201cthe total liberation of Azawad and the formation of the Azawad Authority\u201d, said Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, a spokesman for the groups, in a press release dated Nov. 30."

      "French Prime Minister Michel Barnier is bracing for a no-confidence vote this week, a political reckoning poised to topple his fragile government and send shockwaves across the eurozone",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 French Prime Minister Michel Barnier is bracing for a no-confidence vote this week, a political reckoning almost certain to topple his fragile government and send shockwaves across the eurozone.",
      "Barnier on Monday invoked a rarely used constitutional mechanism to push through the contentious 2025 budget without parliamentary approval, arguing it was essential to maintain \u201cstability\u201d amid deep political divisions.",
      "The move immediately drew sharp backlash, with Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally and the leftist New Popular Front both filing no-confidence motions in response, setting the stage for a vote as early as Wednesday that could see Barnier\u2019s ouster.",
      "The looming showdown unfolds against the backdrop of a fractured National Assembly, left in disarray after June\u2019s snap elections delivered no clear majority.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron had turned to Barnier in September to navigate the impasse and address France\u2019s soaring deficit. Yet Barnier\u2019s proposed austerity budget \u2014 slashing 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raising taxes by 20 billion euros \u2014 has only deepened divisions, inflaming tensions in the lower house and triggering this dramatic political confrontation.",
      "The use of the constitutional tool, called Article 49.3, allows the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote but leaves it exposed to no-confidence motions. Opposition leaders argue that Barnier\u2019s concessions, including scrapping an electricity tax hike, do not go far enough to address their concerns. Le Pen accused Barnier of ignoring her party\u2019s demands.",
      "\u201cEveryone must shoulder their responsibilities,\u201d she said.",
      "The political standoff has unsettled financial markets, with borrowing costs rising sharply amid fears of prolonged instability. Barnier warned of \u201cserious turbulence\u201d if the budget isn\u2019t passed, but critics dismissed his remarks as fear-mongering.",
      "If the no-confidence motion succeeds, Macron will remain president but will need to appoint a new prime minister to steer legislation through the fractured assembly. The uncertainty threatens to deepen France\u2019s economic troubles and reverberate across the eurozone."

      "Artificial intelligence is changing the way industries do business",
      "WASHINGTON -- Artificial intelligence is changing the way companies do business \u2014 helping programmers write code and fielding customer service calls with chatbots.",
      "But the pharmaceutical industry is still waiting to see whether AI can tackle its biggest challenge: finding faster, cheaper ways to develop new drugs.",
      "Despite billions poured into research, new medicines still typically take a decade or more to develop.",
      "Founded in 2018, Insitro is part of a growing field of AI companies promising to accelerate drug discovery by using machine learning to analyze huge datasets of chemical and biological markers. The South San Francisco-based company has signed deals with drugmakers like Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb to help develop medicines for metabolic diseases, neurological conditions and degenerative disorders.",
      "CEO and founder Daphne Koller spoke with the AP about what AI brings to the challenges of drug discovery. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: I think the problem with drug discovery is that we are trying to intervene in a system that we only slightly understand. Many of the successes that we\u2019ve seen in the last 15 to 20 years have been when we arrive at a sufficient understanding of the system so we can really design interventions to align with it.",
      "So one of the things that we try to do at Insitro is unravel the underlying complexity of heterogeneous diseases and identify new intervention modes that could help, maybe not the entire population, but perhaps just a subset of it. That way we can really identify the right therapeutic hypothesis to intervene in a particular patient population. And that, I think, is the real crux of the industry\u2019s lack of success.",
      "A: One of the things that has been happening in parallel to the AI revolution is a much quieter revolution in what I call quantitative biology, which is the ability to measure biological systems with unprecedented fidelity. You can measure systems like proteins and cells with increasingly better measurements and technology.",
      "But if you give that data to a person, their eyes will just glaze over because there\u2019s only so many cells someone can look at and only so many subtleties they can see in these images. People are just limited in their ability to perceive subtle differences.",
      "So you end up with a very reductionist view of a very complex, multifaceted system which is really important to unraveling the distinctions between patients and uncovering where an intervention really can make a difference.",
      "A: My PhD was in computer science. But I started to get into the field of machine learning in the service of biomedical problems back in 1998 or 1999.",
      "At that time, the problems that machine learning was able to tackle were, frankly, uninspiring. How inspired can you get about classifying spam versus non-spam in a dataset of email messages?",
      "I was looking for something that had more richness to it. And my first foray into this field was not because I was particularly interested in becoming a biologist, but because I was looking for more technically challenging questions. And then, as I started looking into it, I became interested in biology in its own right.",
      "A: This is probably one of the most important things we\u2019ve achieved as an organization.",
      "You can take the most sophisticated, best meaning scientists from either side and put them in the same room together and they might as well be speaking Thai and Swahili to each other.",
      "When you\u2019re an engineer, you\u2019re looking for the strongest, most consistent patterns that are going to allow you to make predictions about a majority of cells or individuals. When you\u2019re a life scientist, oftentimes you\u2019re actually looking for the exceptions because those are the threads that can lead to new discoveries.",
      "So we\u2019ve put in place a number of cultural elements and organizational elements to help people engage with each other openly, constructively and with respect."

    "story": [
      "Positioned along the seismically active Ring of Fire, Indonesia and the Philippines have the second and third highest installed geothermal energy capacity in the world, after the United States",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Providing round-the-clock energy, using minimal space and considered a clean source of power \u2014 geothermal energy seems like an ideal option for countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, where the potential is high, and governments are seeking to transition away from highly polluting fossil fuels.",
      "Yet most of the potential of geothermal energy, created by harnessing heat produced by the earth from underground reservoirs of hot water to power turbines that generate electricity, remains untapped in these countries and across the world \u2014 as financial, regulatory and community roadblocks have stalled growth.",
      "More readily available financing and domestic regulatory changes are starting to address these barriers, but experts say more should be done to unlock the vast clean energy source trapped just beneath the Earth\u2019s surface.",
      "Countries with high geothermal potential \u2014 such as the United States, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 are usually located close to tectonically active regions where hot water or steam is naturally carried to the Earth\u2019s surface through volcanic activity, or can be accessed by shallow drilling.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re essentially standing on our own sun, which we can get clean, reliable energy from,\u201d said Marit Brommer, CEO of the International Geothermal Association based in Germany.",
      "Experts also laud geothermal plants for their ability to operate continuously to meet the minimum level of power demanded around-the-clock, unaffected by weather, with long lifespans and minimal maintenance.",
      "As countries shift towards renewable and cleaner energy, geothermal use is expected to grow: In Southeast Asia, geothermal power generation is expected to increase tenfold from 2020 to 2050, reaching 276 million megawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "With their steaming volcanoes and bubbling lakes, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 two archipelagic Southeast Asian countries located on the seismically active \u201cRing of Fire\u201d \u2014 are the second and third-largest users of geothermal energy in the world, with some of the highest geothermal energy potential. The U.S. is number one.",
      "Yet Indonesia uses less a tenth of its gargantuan reserves, making up 6% of its power supply. In the Philippines, about 8% of geothermal capacity has been developed, constituting 14.6% of the country's energy use, the country's largest source of renewable energy.",
      "Both countries plan to expand use of geothermal energy as they transition away from fossil fuels: Indonesia aims to increase the share of geothermal power generation by at least 8% by 2030, making it the second-largest renewable energy source after hydropower. The Philippine government is targeting several projects to boost geothermal capacity by adding nearly 1.5 gigawatts, nearly doubling its current use.",
      "But the exploratory stage of geothermal development \u2014 when companies do tests and drilling to confirm the size, temperature, pressure, and potential production rates of sites \u2014 is expensive and risky. That makes it hard to attract finance for development, said Shigeru Yamamura, an energy specialist at the Asia Development Bank.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most difficult part of developers, because (financially) they cannot take 100% of the exploration risk themselves,\u201d Yamamura told The Associated Press.",
      "Climate finance for geothermal development is limited for most Southeast Asian nations, accounting for only 9% of finance available for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \u2014 a political and economic bloc of ten states in the region, which includes Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "A 2024 ASEAN energy report said \u201cblended finance\u201d using both public and private sources, grants and green bonds could help bridge the gap.",
      "The Philippine government has announced green energy auction schemes for geothermal energy and is preparing a \u201csmart green grid plan\u201d that prioritizes renewable energy \u2014 vital to enable private developers to get financing from banks. This signals progress in policy support for investment, Yamamura said.",
      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has focused on geothermal as part of the country's energy transition. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources says it's working to shorten permitting times and considering ways to increase rates of return on investments in geothermal projects. The state electric utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, also said it's committed to ramping up geothermal energy development.",
      "The World Bank is providing a $150 million loan to scale up Indonesian investments in geothermal energy by reducing the risks of early-stage exploration. The Green Climate Fund and the Clean Technology Fund are providing a $127.5 million.",
      "Even when finance is secured, community pushback can slow development.",
      "In Indonesia, residents of villages have protested projects, citing safety and environmental concerns: Several geothermal sites in Indonesia have had deadly gas leaks in the past five years.",
      "Some Indonesian communities don't understand what geothermal energy is and how they could benefit from its development, said Timothy Ravis, a doctoral student in global development at Cornell University.",
      "Protests at geothermal sites in the Philippines have led at least one company to pay royalties to Indigenous groups worried about land degradation caused by geothermal development.",
      "Governments and businesses should work to gain the consent of communities near projects to help ensure they succeed, said Brommer.",
      "\u201cWe need to show that this development benefits all people, not just a company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's not about being a good neighbor, it's about being the best neighbor and really working with communities to respect their concerns.\"",

Its five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing. (The previous best was $125 million for \u201cFrozen 2\u201d in its second week of release in 2019.) \u201cMoana 2\u201d added $165.3 million internationally; with $386 million worldwide, it's the second-best global launch of the year.",
      "At the same time, the sensation of \u201cWicked\u201d showed no signs of slowing down. The Universal Pictures musical brought in $117.5 million over the five-day weekend, pushing its two-week global total to $359.2 million. Not accounting for inflation, \u201cWicked\u201d is now the highest grossing Broadway adaptation over \u201cGrease.\u201d (That 1978 film grossed $190 million, but factoring in inflation would put it past $900 million.)",
      "\u201cGladiator II,\u201d meanwhile, also held well, dipping 44% from its opening weekend. Ridley Scott\u2019s sequel to his Oscar-winning best picture original collected $44 million in its second weekend. While its steep price tag of $250 million will make profitability challenging, \u201cGladiator II\u201d has swiftly gathered $320 million worldwide.",
      "Those three films drove the overall box office to a record $420 million in overall Thanksgiving weekend ticket sales, according to Comscore \u2014 more than $100 million more than ever before. For an industry that has been battered in recent years by the pandemic, work stoppages and the upheaval caused by streaming, it was a triumphant weekend that showed the still-potent power of Hollywood\u2019s blockbuster machine. Before \u201cWicked,\u201d \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cGladiator II\u201d arrived in theaters, ticket sales were running about 25% behind pre-pandemic levels.",
      "Michael O\u2019Leary, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theatre Owners, said the weekend showed what\u2019s possible when \u201call the pieces of the puzzle come together\u201d in compelling big-budget movies with marketing muscle.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very optimistic that this weekend is the start of what we believe is a full-on charge into the future,\u201d he said. \"The remaining quarter of this year looks very promising and then on into 2025 and 2026. We\u2019re hoping next year is the first kind of normal year this industry has had in a long time.\u201d",
      "Like the last time such anticipated movies collided on the release calendar \u2014 2023's much-ballyhooed \u201cBarbenheimer\" \u2014 the movie industry again could see evidence of a rising moviegoing tide lifting all blockbusters. In recent years, studios have typically tried to space out most of their biggest releases. Earlier this fall, \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\" for example, was the No. 1 film for three straight weeks, despite not being particularly successful.",
      "\u201cFor a long, long time in Hollywood, there\u2019s been a belief that you don\u2019t put big blockbuster movies up against each other,\u201d said O'Leary. \u201cBut the truth of the matter is that competition is good. It\u2019s good for the movies. It\u2019s good for the studios. It\u2019s good for the theater owners. But it\u2019s particularly good for the moviegoing public.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d was the nexus of a strategy shift for Disney. When it first began development, it was fashioned as a series for streaming. But when Bob Iger returned as chief executive, he reconsidered the balance between theatrical and streaming. The original \u201cMoana,\" after all, was the most streamed movie on Disney+ in 2023, with the added benefit of $680 million in box office in 2016. Only in February this year did Iger announce the release of \u201cMoana 2,\" with Auli\u2019i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson returning as the voices of Moana and Maui.",
      "\u201cIt just shows you that the big screen and small screen are not adversarial. They can be complementary and additive,\u201d says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cWhoever made that decision to go big screen globally with \u2018Moana 2,' that was one of the greatest decisions ever.\u201d",
      "And it helped lead a resurgence for Walt Disney Co., whose last two animated November releases \u2014 \u201cStrange World\u201d and \u201cWish\u201d \u2014 fizzled in theaters. \u201cMoana 2\u201d may become the third $1 billion-grossing movie for the studio in 2024, along with \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine.\u201d Though reviews for \u201cMoana 2\" have only been 65% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes, audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d is also part of a major rebound for family moviegoing. According to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment, family moviegoing in 2024 is going to account for approximately $6.8 billion in ticket sales, roughly the sums of 2022 and 2023, combined.",
      "After such large debuts, \u201cMoana 2\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d are likely to continue to drive moviegoing through December. The only question will be if this year's Christmas movies \u2014 historically a much bigger holiday period for theaters \u2014 can come anywhere near the Thanksgiving lineup. Among the movies aiming for that holiday corridor are Disney's \u201cMufasa: The Lion King,\u201d Paramount's \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\" and Searchlight's \u201cA Complete Unknown,\u201d with Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet as a young Bob Dylan.",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",
      "1. \"Moana 2,\" $135 million.",
      "2. \u201cWicked,\u201d $80 million.",

      "The top United Nations court will take up the largest case in its history on Monday",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The top United Nations court will take up the largest case in its history on Monday, when it opens two weeks of hearings into what countries worldwide are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact.",
      "After years of lobbying by island nations who fear they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice last year for an opinion on \u201cthe obligations of States in respect of climate change.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want the court to confirm that the conduct that has wrecked the climate is unlawful,\u201d Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, who is leading the legal team for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Associated Press.",
      "In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels.",
      "Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis.",
      "\u201cWe live on the front lines of climate change impact. We are witnesses to the destruction of our lands, our livelihoods, our culture and our human rights,\u201d Vanuatu\u2019s climate change envoy Ralph Regenvanu told reporters ahead of the hearing.",
      "Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits.",
      "On Sunday, ahead of the hearing, advocacy groups will bring together environmental organizations from around the world. Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change \u2014 who first developed the idea of requesting an advisory opinion \u2014 together with World Youth for Climate Justice plan an afternoon of speeches, music and discussions.",
      "From Monday, the Hague-based court will hear from 99 countries and more than a dozen intergovernmental organizations over two weeks. It\u2019s the largest lineup in the institution\u2019s nearly 80-year history.",
      "Last month at the United Nations\u2019 annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the $1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed.",
      "\u201cFor our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the world\u2019s biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines,\u201d Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, told reporters in a briefing.",
      "Fifteen judges from around the world will seek to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment?",
      "The second question makes particular reference to \u201csmall island developing States\u201d likely to be hardest hit by climate change and to \u201cmembers of \u201cthe present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change.\u201d",
      "The judges were even briefed on the science behind rising global temperatures by the U.N.\u2019s climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ahead of the hearings.",
      "The case at the ICJ follows a number of rulings around the world ordering governments to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "In May, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution and countries must take steps to adapt to and mitigate their adverse effects.",
      "That ruling came a month after Europe\u2019s highest human rights court said that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change, in a landmark judgment that could have implications across the continent.",
      "The ICJ\u2019s host country of The Netherlands made history when a court ruled in 2015 that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change is a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens. The judgment was upheld in 2019 by the Dutch Supreme Court."

      "WASHINGTON -- A majority of Supreme Court justices didn't seem convinced Monday that federal regulators misled companies as they refused to allow them to sell sweet flavored vaping products following a surge in teen e-cigarette use.",
      "The court did raise questions about the Food and Drug Administration crackdown that included denials of more than a million nicotine products formulated to taste like fruit, dessert or candy. Teen vaping use has since dropped to a decade low, but the agency could change its approach after the inauguration next month of President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to \u201csave\u201d vaping.",

      "Justice Elena Kagan, though, was skeptical.",
      "\u201cI guess I\u2019m not really seeing what the surprise is here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew what the FDA\u2019s point of view was ... that blueberry vapes are really problematic in terms of youth smoking.\"",
      "The FDA was slow to regulate the now multibillion-dollar vaping market, and even years into the crackdown flavored vapes that are technically illegal nevertheless remain widely available.",
      "The agency says the vaping companies were denied because they couldn't show flavored vapes had a net public benefit, as laid out in the law. It has approved some tobacco-flavored vapes, and recently allowed its first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers.",
      "The issue came before the high court when the agency appealed a decision from the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals tossing out one of its denials.",
      "While other lower courts rebuffed vaping company lawsuits, the 5th Circuit sided with Dallas-based company Triton Distribution.

      "The conservative-majority court has overall been skeptical of the power of federal regulators, including by striking down the so-called Chevron doctrine that had judges deferring to agencies' interpretation of the law.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned whether the vaping companies wanted the court to take that concept a step further. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a reverse Chevron deference, except we're deferring to the applicant,\" she said.",
      "The court is expected to decide the case in the coming months."

      "TORONTO -- Canada's ambassador to the United States said Sunday that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was successful in getting President-elect Donald Trump and key Cabinet nominees to understand that lumping Canada in with Mexico over the flow of drugs and migrants into the U.S. is unfair.",
      "Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador in Washington, told The Associated Press in an interview that Trudeau's dinner with Trump on Friday was a very important step in trying to get Trump to back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner.",
      "Hillman was at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and sat at an adjacent table to Trudeau and Trump.",
      "Trump threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if they don\u2019t stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across their borders. He said in a social media post last Monday he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders.",
      "Hillman said Trudeau asked to see Trump in person in a phone call Monday and Trump invited him to dinner on Friday.",
      "At the dinner, Hillman said the case was made to Trump that there is no comparison between the Canada-U.S. border and Mexico-U.S. border.",
      "\u201cThe message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "Hillman said the bulk of Friday night's dinner centered around Trump's border concerns. The ambassador said a priority of Trudeau's was to point out the degree of difference.",
      "Hillman said there really is no comparison, noting there is essentially zero trafficking of fentanyl from Canada to the United States. She said there are seizures but authorities say those are personal use seizures and not criminal trafficking. She said that 99.8% of the fentanyl seized by U.S. authorities in the U.S. comes from Mexico.",
      "\u201cAlso with respect to individuals, illegal individuals crossing illegally, Canada last year was less than one percent, 0.6 percent were of total interceptions from Canada,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024 \u2014 and Hillman said the migrant numbers are coming down since the summer.",
      "\u201cThe facts are hard to deny,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "But Hillman said Canada is ready to make new investments in border security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers.",
      "She also noted an agreement between Canada and the United States that allows for migrants caught crossing illegally into the United States to be sent back to Canada. She said that was talked about. She said Mexico and the U.S. do not have a similar agreement.",
      "At the dinner that lasted three hours, Hillman said America's trade deficit with Canada was also raised. Hillman said the U.S. had a $75 billion trade deficit with Canada last year but noted a third of what Canada sells into the U.S. are energy exports and prices have been high.",
      "\u201cTrade balances are something that he focuses so it\u2019s important to engage in that conversation but to put it into context,\" Hillman said.",
      "\u201cWe are one tenth the size of the United States so a balanced trade deal would mean per capita we are buying 10 times more from the U.S. than they are buying from us. If that\u2019s his metric we will certainly engage on that.\"",
      "Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump\u2019s nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s pick to lead the Interior Department, Mike Waltz, Trump\u2019s choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men\u2019s wives.",
      "Also at the dinner were David McCormick, just elected U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, and his wife, Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump, as well as Canadian Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, whose responsibilities include border security, and Katie Telford, Trudeau\u2019s chief of staff.",
      "Hillman said Canadian and incoming Trump administration officials will work on Trump's concerns in the coming weeks. Trump called the talks \u201cproductive\u201d on Sunday in a social media post but signaled no retreat from his tariff pledge.",
      "Hillman said Trump and Trudeau \"get along well\" and the dinner was also a chance to socialize. She said Trump used his iPad to play music and she said Trump told Trudeau he's a big fan of Canadian singer Celine Dion.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it could have been better to be frank. Okay, I\u2019ll take that back, I\u2019ll change that. If he obviously said there would be no tariffs that would have been better but there was no realistic expectation of that,\u201d Hillman said.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",

      "DETROIT -- A Stellantis joint venture with Samsung SDI has won a commitment from the U.S. government for up to a $7.54 billion loan to help build two electric vehicle battery plants in Kokomo, Indiana.",
      "The project being built by StarPlus Energy LLC is expected to create at least 2,800 jobs at the plants and hundreds more at a nearby park for parts supply companies, the Energy Department said Monday in a statement.",
      "The loan still must be finalized, but the government said the commitment shows its intent to finance the project. To get the loan, StarPlus must develop a plan to engage with community and labor leaders to create good paying jobs. It also has to meet technical, legal, environmental and financial conditions before the government will fund the loan.",
      "It's unclear whether the loan will be finalized before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to end funding for such projects, which he called the \u201cgreen new scam.\u201d A message was left Monday seeking comment from the Trump transition team.",
      "The Energy Department didn't directly answer a question about whether the loan would be funded before the inauguration, but said it would be irresponsible for \"any government to turn its back on private sector partners, states, and communities that are benefiting from lower energy costs and new economic opportunities\u201d from the loans.",
      "The plants would make battery cells and modules for electric vehicles to be sold in North America, the department said. At full capacity, the plants will produce enough batteries to supply about 670,000 vehicles per year.",
      "\u201cThis will greatly expand EV battery manufacturing capacity in North America and reduce America's reliance on adversarial foreign nations like China,\u201d the statement said.",

      "America\u2019s wealthiest have long urged each other to give away more money.",
      "Marie Dageville and her husband Benoit Dageville became billionaires overnight when his data cloud company, Snowflake, went public in September 2020. After that life changing moment, Marie, a former hospice nurse, then set out to learn how to urgently give away that new fortune.",
      "\u201cWe need to redistribute what we have that is too much,\u201d she said in an interview with The Associated Press from her home in Silicon Valley.",
      "While many say giving away a lot of money is hard, that is not Dageville\u2019s perspective. Her advice is to just get started.",
      "America's wealthiest people have urged each other to give away more of their money since at least 1889, the year Andrew Carnegie published an essay entitled, \u201cThe Gospel of Wealth.\" He argued that the richest should give away their fortunes within their lifetimes, in part to lessen the sting of growing inequality.",
      "A whole industry of advisers, courses and charitable giving vehicles has grown to help facilitate donations from the wealthy, to some extent prompted by the Giving Pledge, an initiative housed at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2010, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates invited other billionaires to promise to give away half of their fortunes in their lifetimes or in their wills. So far, 244 have signed on.",
      "So, what stands in the way of the wealthiest people giving more and giving faster?",
      "Philanthropy advisers say some answers are structural, like finding the right vehicles and advisers, and some have to do with emotional and psychological factors, like negotiating with family members or wanting to look good in the eyes of their peers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a massive, perfect storm of behavioral barriers,\u201d said Piyush Tantia, chief innovation officer at ideas42, who recently contributed to a report funded by the Gates Foundation looking at what holds the wealthiest donors back.",
      "He points out that unlike everyday donors, who may give in response to an ask from a friend or family member, the wealthiest donors end up deliberating much more about where to give.",
      "\u201cWe might think, \u2018It\u2019s a billionaire. Who cares about a hundred grand? They make that back in the next 15 minutes',\" he said. \"But it doesn\u2019t feel like that.\u201d",
      "His advice is to think about philanthropy as a portfolio, with different risk levels and strategies ideally working in concert. That way it's less about the outcome of any single grant and more about the cumulative impact.",
      "Marie Dageville said she benefited from speaking with other people who had signed the Giving Pledge, especially one person who urged her to make general operating grants, meaning the organization can choose how to spend the funds themselves. She trusts nonprofits close to the communities they serve to know best how to spend the money and said she is not held back by a worry that they will misuse it.",
      "\u201cIf you are in the position where you are at now \u2014 able to redistribute this fortune \u2014 either you took risks or someone took risks on you,\" she said, adding. \u201cSo why can\u2019t you take some risk (in your philanthropy)?\u201d",
      "Dageville also thinks there is too much focus on the wants of the donors, rather than the needs of the recipients.",
      "Private and open conversations between donors also help them move forward, advisers have found. The Center for High Impact Philanthropy at University of Pennsylvania runs an academy that convenes very wealthy donors, their advisers and the heads of foundations to learn together in cohorts.",
      "Kat Rosqueta, the center's executive director, said donors like MacKenzie Scott, the author and now billionaire ex-wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, show it's possible to move quickly.",
      "\u201cDo all the ultra high net worth funders have to go slower than MacKenzie Scott? No,\u201d she said.",
      "But she said, sometimes donors struggle with seeing how to make a difference, given that philanthropic funding is tiny compared to government spending or the business sector.",
      "Cara Bradley, deputy director of philanthropic partnerships at the Gates Foundation, said the scrutiny of billionaire philanthropy also means they feel a huge responsibility to use their funds as best as possible.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve signed a pledge genuinely committed to trying to give away this tremendous amount of wealth. And then, people can get stuck because life gets busy. This is hard. Philanthropy is a real endeavor,\u201d she said.",
      "It is also not easy to conduct empirical research on billionaires, said Deborah Small, a marketing professor at Yale School of Management. But she said, in general, current social norms value anonymity in giving, which is seen as being more virtuous because the donor isn't recognized for their generosity.",
      "\u201cIt would be better for causes, and for philanthropy as a whole, if everybody was open about it because that would create the social norm that this is an expectation in society,\u201d she said.",
      "Jorge P\u00e9rez, founder and CEO of the real estate developer Related Group, along with his wife, Darlene, was early to join the Giving Pledge in 2012. In an interview with The Associated Press, P\u00e9rez said he frequently speaks with his peers about giving more and faster.",
      "\u201cI think people have stopped taking my calls,\u201d he joked.",
      "He also has engaged his adult children in their philanthropy, much of which they conduct through The Miami Foundation. He said they decided to draw on the expertise of the foundation, rather than starting their own organizations, to speed along the evaluation of potential grantees.",
      "Even before the P\u00e9rezes joined the Giving Pledge, they were major supporters of the arts and of scholarships in Miami, where they are based. In 2011, the couple donated their art collection along with cash, together worth $40 million, to the art museum, which was renamed the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami after the gift.",
      "P\u00e9rez said he gives because he thinks very unequal societies are not sustainable and because he wants to leave behind a legacy.",
      "\u201cI keep on selling the idea that you\u2019re giving because of very selfish reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is it makes you feel good. But two, particularly in the city or the state or the country that you\u2019re going to live in, in the long run, this is going to make a huge difference in making our society fairer, better and more progressive and probably lead to greater economic wealth.\u201d",

      "Struggling chipmaker Intel says in a surprise announcement that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired",
      "Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, the struggling chipmaker said Monday in a surprise announcement.",
      "Two company executives, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, will act as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a replacement for Gelsinger, who also stepped down from the company's board.",
      "The departure of Gelsinger, whose career spanned more than 40 years, underscores the turmoil at Intel. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Gelsinger started at Intel in 1979 and was its first chief technology officer. He returned to the company as chief executive in 2021.",
      "Gelsinger said his exit was \u201cbittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.\u201d",
      "Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer at Intel. Holthaus was appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, which includes the client computing, data center and AI groups.",
      "Frank Yeary, independent chair of Intel's board, will become interim executive chair.",
      "\u201cPat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021,\u201d Yeary said in a statement. \"As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.\u201d",
      "Gelsinger's departure comes as Intel\u2019s financial woes have been piling up. The company posted a $16.6 billion loss and halted its dividend in the most recent quarter, and its shares have fallen by about 60% since he took over as CEO. Gelsinger announced plans in August to slash 15% of its huge workforce \u2014 or about 15,000 jobs \u2014 as part of cost-cutting efforts to to save $10 billion in 2025.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s ascendance, meanwhile, was cemented earlier this month when it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",
      "Unlike some of rivals, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them. Under Gelsinger, the company has been working to build up its foundry business making semiconductors in the U.S. designed by other firms, in a bid to compete with rivals such as market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or TSMC.",
      "Intel has benefited from tens of billions of dollars that the administration has pledged to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness.",
      "After taking over as CEO, Gelsinger unveiled plans to build a $20 billion chipmaking facility in central Ohio, and poured billions more into expanding in Europe, where leaders were also worried about dependence on Asia.",
      "The Biden administration had said it would give Intel up to $8.5 billion in federal funding for semiconductor plants around the country, but last week it trimmed that amount, according to three people familiar with the grant who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Shares of the Santa Clara, California, company, were up less than 1% in afternoon trading after being up more than 5% earlier in the day.",

      "Consumers in the U.S. are scouring the internet for online deals as they look to make the most of the post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon on Cyber Monday",
      "Consumers in the United States are scouring the internet for online deals as they look to take advantage of the post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon with Cyber Monday.",
      "Even though e-commerce is now part and parcel of many people's regular routines and the holiday shopping season, Cyber Monday \u2014 a term coined in 2005 by the National Retail Federation \u2014 has become the biggest online shopping day of the year, thanks to the deals and the hype the industry has created to fuel it.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That would make it the season's \u2014 and the year's \u2014 biggest \u2014 shopping day for e-commerce.",
      "Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday night, per Adobe \u2014 reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent every minute.",
      "For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales event right after midnight Pacific time on Saturday. Target's two days of discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday. Walmart rolled out its Cyber Monday offers for Walmart+ members on Sunday afternoon and opened it up to all customers three hours later, at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "Consumer spending for Cyber Week \u2014 the five major shopping days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday \u2014 provides a strong indication of how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays.",
      "Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a healthy pace.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",
      "Many economist have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing to automobiles.",
      "The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5% to 3.5% \u2014 compared to 3.9% in 2023.",
      "A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season won\u2019t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period. But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging signs for retailers.",
      "Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that discounts from Thanksgiving onward have \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d \u2014 and online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40 billion mark combined.",
      "U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2% increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That's also more than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1\u202fbillion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said.",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double-digits while in-store purchase rose a modest 0.7%.",
      "E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $4.6 million per minute \u2014 with top categories by volume including clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to Adobe. \u201cHot products\u201d included Lego sets, espresso machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care.",
      "Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the comfort of their homes.",
      "RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the Midwest.",
      "Sensormatic Solutions, which also tracks store traffic, said its preliminary analysis showed retail store traffic on Black Friday was down 8.2% compared to 2023.",
      "Grant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic Solutions, noted that in-store traffic was getting spread across multiple days since many retailers offered generous discounts before and after Black Friday.",
      "\u201cSome of the extended Black Friday promotions really ended up leading to a little bit of a softer day-of traffic than expected,\u201d Gustafson said.",
      "While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more \u201cexperience-driven spending\u201d in recent years, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic waned.",
      "Jie Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business, told The Associated Press ahead of the post-Thanksgiving shopping weekend that he expected shoppers to \u201cindulge themselves a bit more\u201d when it comes to \u201cself-gifting,\u201d increasing interest in categories like self care.",
      "Adobe notes that shoppers are also buying higher-ticket items this season \u2014 with consumers opening their wallets to invest or \u201ctrade up\u201d to more premium versions of products like electronics, appliances and sporting goods.",
      "Brie Carere, executive vice president and chief customer officer at FedEx, cited strong shipping volume for Thanksgiving weekend, and CyberMonday has had a good start. She anticipated that FedEx\u2019s shipping volume on the online shopping holiday will be slightly up over the 19 million items shipped a year ago on the holiday.",
      "But she said the truncated season \u2014 there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day \u2014 is making it harder for her retail customers to forecast.",
      "In fact, Carere said only four of FedEx\u2019s top 20 holiday e-commerce customers got their shipping predictions correct for the week before the Thanksgiving weekend. And she also noted that while FedEx predicts low single-digit percentage growth in shipping volume each day, she thinks that many retail customers will see a decline for the overall holiday period because of the truncated season.",
      "\u201cI do think that we\u2019re going to see some retailers be disappointed in their volume numbers,\u201d she said.",
      "Carere also doesn\u2019t anticipate much of a lull in shipping between Thanksgiving weekend and last two weeks before Christmas because of the shorter season.",
      "Jim Katsafanas, president of U.S. Small Business Sales, UPS, agreed, noting last week \u201cwe are going to see a pretty consistent surge of volume right through the end. \u201d",

    "story": [
      "Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker that owns brands like Jeep and Ram and Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot",
      "NEW YORK -- Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the automaker, which owns car brands like Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, amid an ongoing struggle with slumping sales.",
      "The world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker announced that its board accepted Tavares' resignation Sunday, effective immediately.",
      "Stellantis noted Sunday that the process of finding a new, permanent CEO is \u201cwell under way.\u201d In the meantime, the company says a new interim executive committee, led by chairman John Elkann, will be established.",
      "As head of PSA Peugeot, Tavares took control of the Netherlands-based company in January 2021 \u2014 when it merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, creating an automotive giant that is the parent to several well-known brands today. Beyond Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, the company portfolio includes Dodge, Chrysler, Fiat, Peugeot, Maserati and Opel.",
      "Stellantis' North American operations had been the company\u2019s main source of profits for some time, but struggles piled up this year, with the company citing rising competition and larger market changes. As a result of lofty sticker prices and fewer affordable options, many high-priced vehicles have been left unsold on dealers' lots.",
      "For its third quarter, Stellantis posted 27% plunge in net revenues, as gaps in launching new products and action to reduce inventories also slashed global shipments of new vehicles by 20%.",
      "The carmaker reported net revenues of 33 billion euros (nearly $36 billion ) in the three-month period ending Sept. 30, down from 45 billion euros in the same period last year. All regions except South America reported double-digit dips in revenues \u2014 led by North America, which plunged 42% to 12.4 billion euros ($13.1 billion).",
      "In recent months, Tavares had come under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union after the release of dismal financial performance reports. He also oversaw cost-cutting efforts that included delaying factory openings and laying off union workers \u2014 further straining the company's relations with the UAW, which filed several grievances against Stellantis and threatened to strike in recent months.",
      "The UAW welcomed Tavares' resignation with president Shawn Fain calling the move \u201ca major step in the right direction for a company that has been mismanaged and a workforce that has been mistreated for too long.\u201d He noted that thousands of UAW members had been calling for Tavares' firing for weeks for what Fain called the CEO's \u201creckless mismanagement of the company.\u201d",
      "\u201cTavares is leaving behind a mess of painful layoffs and overpriced vehicles sitting on dealership lots,\u201d Fain said in a statement. He added that the union looks forward to sitting down with Stellantis\u2019 new chief executive and \u201cwill keep using all means available\u201d to hold the company accountable.",
      "Beyond the U.S., Stellantis has faced pressure in Italy \u2014 where lawmakers questioned the former chief executive over the company's production plans in October, with the far-right government accusing the company of relocating assembly plants to low-cost countries. Tens of thousands of autoworkers in the country also held a one-day walkout, calling for more employment certainty and protections.",
      "In efforts to revive sales, Stellantis previously made a number of leadership changes in October, which included naming new heads of operations in North America and Europe. At the time, the company expected Tavares to step down in early 2026, closer to the end of his five-year contract.",
      "The company confirmed in September that it was searching for a CEO to eventually succeed Tavares, but it maintained those efforts were part of standard leadership transition plans.",
      "In a statement Sunday, Stellantis\u2019 senior independent director Henri de Castries said that Stellantis' success is \u201crooted in a perfect alignment\u201d between shareholders, the company's board and the CEO \u2014 but noted \u201cdifferent views\u201d had emerged in recent weeks, resulting in the decision to approve Tavares' resignation.",
      "Elkann, the chairperson of Stellantis' board, thanked Tavares for \u201chis years of dedicated service and the role he has played in the creation of Stellantis\u201d in an additional statement. He added that he looks forward to appointing a new CEO.",
      "Stellantis did not comment further beyond Sunday's release. The announcement arrived shortly after Bloomberg reported Tavares' plans to step down, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter."

      "This was supposed to be the fifth and final round to produce the first legally binding treaty on plastics pollution, including in the oceans, by the end of 2024.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the talks:",
      "After a week of talks and with time running out early Monday, negotiators agreed to meet again next year. They don\u2019t yet have firm plans.",
      "This has been the largest session with more than 3,300 participants at the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on Plastic Pollution, including delegates from over 170 countries and representatives of nearly 450 organizations.",

      "The most contentious issue of the talks has been whether there will be a limit on the amount of plastic that companies are allowed to produce. Panama proposed text for the treaty to address plastic production and support for it quickly grew to over 100 countries.",
      "It was a compromise to build consensus because it did not include a numerical target or production cap. Instead, it proposed that countries would adopt a global target at a later conference of the parties meeting.",
      "Juan Carlos Monterrey, the head of Panama\u2019s delegation, said Monday that the nations standing up for a strong treaty may have been delayed, but they will not be stopped.",

      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year",
      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year? Artificial intelligence chatbots might help, but don't expect them to do all the work or always give you the right answers.",
      "Anyone scouring the internet for Cyber Monday deals is likely going to encounter more conversational iterations of the chatbots that some retailers and e-commerce sites have built to provide shoppers with enhanced customer service.",
      "Some companies have integrated models infused with newer generative AI technologies, allowing shoppers to seek advice by asking naturally phrased questions like \u201cWhat's the best wireless speaker?\u201d",
      "Retailers hope consumers use these chatbots, which are typically called shopping assistants - as virtual companions that help them discover or compare products. Prior chatbots were mostly used for task-oriented functions such as helping customers track down online orders or return ones that didn't meet expectations.",
      "Amazon, the king of online retail, has said its customers have been questioning Rufus - the generative AI- powered shopping assistant it launched this year - for information such as whether a specific coffee maker is easy to clean, or what recommendations it has for a lawn game for a child's birthday party.",
      "And Rufus, which is available for holiday shoppers in the U.S. and some other countries, is not the only shopping assistant out there. A select number of Walmart shoppers will have access this year to a similar chatbot the nation's largest retailer is testing in a few product categories, including toys and electronics.",
      "Perplexity AI added something new to the AI chat-shopping world last month by rolling out a feature on its AI-powered search engine that enables users to ask a question like \u201cWhat's the best women's leather boots?\" and then receive specific product results that the San Francisco-based company says are not sponsored.",
      "\u201cIt has been adopted at pretty incredible scale,\u201d Mike Mallazzo, an analyst and writer at retail research media company Future Commerce, said.",
      "Retailers with websites and e-commerce companies started paying more attention to chatbots when use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence text chatbot made by the company OpenAI, went mainstream in late 2022, sparking public and business interest in the generative AI technology that powers the tool.",
      "Victoria\u2019s Secret, IKEA, Instacart and the Canadian retailer Ssense are among other companies experimenting with chatbots, some of which use technology from OpenAI.",
      "Even before the improved chatbots, online retailers were creating product recommendations based on a customer's prior purchases or search history. Amazon was at the forefront of having recommendations on its platform, so Rufus' ability to provide some is not particularly groundbreaking.",
      "But Rajiv Mehta, the vice president of search and conversational shopping at Amazon, said the company is able to offer more helpful recommendations now by programming Rufus to ask clarifying or follow-up questions. Customers are also using Rufus to look for deals, some of which are personalized, Mehta said.",
      "To be sure, chatbots are prone to hallucinations, so Rufus and most of the tools like it can get things wrong.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, wrote in a November blog post that his firm tested Rufus by requesting gaming TV recommendations. The chatbot's response included products that were not TVs. When asked for the least expensive options, Rufus came back with suggestions that weren't the cheapest, Kaziukenas said.",
      "An Associated Press reporter recently asked Rufus to give some gift recommendations for a brother. The chatbot quickly spit out a few ideas for \u201cthoughtful gifts,\" ranging from a T-shirt and a keychain with charms to a bolder suggestion: a multifunctional knife engraved with the phrase \u201cBEST BROTHER EVER.\u201d",
      "After a 5-minute written conversation, Rufus offered more tailored suggestions - a few Barcelona soccer jerseys sold by third-party sellers. But it wasn\u2019t able to say which seller offered the lowest price. When asked during another search for a price comparison on a popular skin serum, Rufus showed the product's pre-discounted price instead of its present one.",
      "\u201cRufus is constantly learning,\u201d Amazon's Mehta said during an interview.",
      "Shop AI, a chatbot that Canadian e-commerce company Shopify launched last year, can also help shoppers discover new products by asking its own questions, such as soliciting details about an intended gift recipient or features the buyer wants to avoid. Shop AI has trouble, however, recommending specific products or identifying the lowest-priced item in a product category.",
      "The limitations show the technology is still in its infancy and has a long way to go before it becomes as useful as the retail industry - and many shoppers - wish it could be.",
      "To truly transform the shopping experience, shopping assistants will \u201cneed to be deeply personalized\u201d and be able - on their own - to remember a customer\u2019s order history, product preferences and purchasing habits, consulting giant McKinsey & Company said in an August report.",
      "Amazon has noted that Rufus' answers are based on information contained in product listings, community Q&As and customer reviews, which would include the fake reviews that are used to boost or diminish sales for products on its marketplace.",
      "The large language model that powers the chatbot was also trained on the company's entire catalog and some public information on the web, Trishul Chilimbi, an Amazon vice president who oversees AI research, wrote in the electrical engineering magazine IEEE Spectrum in October.",
      "But its unclear how Amazon and other companies are weighting different training components - such as reviews - in their recommendations, or how exactly the shopping assistants come up with them, according to Nicole Greene, an analyst at management consulting firm Gartner.",
      "Perplexity AI's new shopping feature allows users to enter search queries such as \u201cbest phone case\" and to receive answers derived from various sources, including Amazon and other retailers, such as Best Buy. Perplexity also invited retailers to share data about their products and said those that do would have an increased chance of having their items recommended to shoppers.",
      "But Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, suggested in a recent interview with Fortune magazine that he didn't know how the new shopping feature recommended products to customers. But in an interview with the AP, Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko pushed back on that characterization, saying Srinivas' comment \u201cwas probably taken out of context.\u201d",
      "The context, he said, is that with generative AI technology \u201cYou can\u2019t know in advance exactly what the output will be just based off of knowing what the inputs\u201d are from the training materials.",
      "Shevelenko said retailers and brands need to know they can't have their products recommended in Perplexity's search engine because they're \u201cjamming key words\u201d into their websites or using different techniques to show up better on search results",
      "\u201cThe way you show up in an answer is by having a better product and better features,\u201d he said."

      "Established nonprofits, everyday individuals and mutual aid groups all want your dollars to make a difference",
      "NEW YORK -- Millions displaced by global conflicts. Communities reeling from unseasonably strong natural disasters. Lives upended due to healthcare inequalities.",
      "In the middle of these crises are established nonprofits, everyday individuals and mutual aid groups \u2014 all seeking your dollars to make a difference. But with no shortage of worthy causes and the rise of new giving technologies, how should you donate?",
      "The choices can be immobilizing for those looking to open up their wallets. Many value conventional charities. But others \u2014 Gen Z and millennials, as well as the unmarried and less religious, according to 2021 research by the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy \u2014 like to crowdfund by pooling donations online for folks in dire circumstances.",
      "The approaches reflect differing assessments of impact and trustworthiness. But they aren't necessarily opposed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really: what is the right type of support that either an organization or a community or an individual needs?\u201d said Bloomerang Chief Customer Officer Todd Baylis, who co-founded a platform that helps nonprofits fundraise online. \"And being able to tailor that to the individual giver.\u201d",
      "Here are some questions worth considering as you determine which assistance best suits your objectives:",
      "It might come down to whether you want to make a big difference for one person or help seed large-scale change.",
      "Tiltify is a technology platform that helps nonprofits and individual crowdfunders alike raise money. If donors want to ensure that food gets to communities recovering from disasters, Tiltify CEO Michael Wasserman says a nonprofit contribution is probably best, as established organizations already have distribution pipelines and built-up expertise.",
      "But if you want to ensure a particular person can take care of themselves, he said, a direct donation to a crowdfunding campaign might make more sense than sending money \u201cthrough a charitable funnel.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt really depends on what your goal is as a donor: if you\u2019re trying to help out somebody specifically or if you\u2019re trying to help out people in plural,\u201d Wasserman said.",
      "You could do both at once, according to one nonprofit that delivers cash transfers. GiveDirectly reports sending more than $860 million to 1.6 million people across three continents. Senior Program Manager Richard Nkurunziza says the idea was initially met with fears of misuse. But GiveDirectly finds that cash donations are a dignified way to empower poor people to invest in their unique needs.",
      "In Rwandan villages, he said, recipients have spent donations on household renovations, new businesses and youth education \u2014 all of which ultimately benefit their entire community.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of agency,\u201d said Nkurunziza. \u201cIt gives an opportunity for the recipient to make a decision on how they use the funds for themselves.\u201d",
      "Crowdfunding could be considered \u201cmore democratic,\u201d according to Claire van Teunenbroek, a University of Twente professor specializing in online giving behavior. That's because donors have more control over their gifts' usage when they choose exactly who benefits.",
      "The disadvantage, she said, is that people with the greatest needs aren't always the ones with the most success. Humans are prone to supporting \u201ceasily sellable\u201d projects with highly emotional appeals. Studies have also shown racial disparities in crowdfunding.",
      "The most popular reason donors told Bloomerang they stopped giving was because they did not trust contributions were being used wisely, according to the company\u2019s Generational Giving Report. The second most common response was that donors no longer felt connected to the nonprofit they\u2019d previously supported.",
      "The answers underscore the need for recipients to actively prove their trustworthiness.",
      "Tax-exempt nonprofits must submit annual financial disclosures to the Internal Revenue Service that include publicly available information, including executives' salaries. Watchdogs, such as Charity Navigator, compile lists of verified nonprofits and assess their work.",
      "Crowdfunding, while convenient, is much more susceptible to fraud. The online sites are relatively unregulated, leaving the responsibility for protection up to donors and the platforms themselves. In GoFundMe's case, donations can be refunded up to one year after they are made. The company also advises that organizers identify themselves and their beneficiaries, and specify their plans for spending contributions.",
      "Online users mistakenly associate high donation numbers with credibility, according to van Teunenbroek. She said risk is better mitigated by making sure the project's description is detailed.",
      "\u201cFor a donor, if you prefer more certainty, then traditional nonprofits are probably better because they have an established reputation,\u201d she said.",
      "ALSAC CEO Rick Shadyac said his charity works hard to make donors feel confident that their money is supporting the mission of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital: improving pediatric cancer survival rates worldwide by covering the costs of care and researching treatments.",
      "Shadyac encouraged people to give regardless of the medium and to always look for reputable causes. Bonafide charities, he said, bring \u201cgreater degrees of confidence\u201d while crowdfunding requires more \u201cdue diligence.\u201d But he sees room for both.",
      "\u201cThey should actually complement each other,\" he said.",
      "\u201cSome of this is more in the realm of micro-philanthropy where they may be wanting to help a specific individual because they found themselves in difficult circumstances,\u201d he added. \"But if you want to help kids with cancer, you want to help cure heart disease, there are charities that are keenly focused on that.\u201d",
      "ALSAC gets nearly one quarter of its annual revenue during the last two months of the calendar, Shadyac said, around the time of year designated as \u201cGiving Season.\u201d The uptick could stem from the spirit of generosity around the holidays, he added. Sure enough, a 2023 study found that people in good moods are more likely to make a charitable donation.",
      "They might also be making their year-end tax plans.",
      "\u201cNot-for-profits give them the opportunity to address some things that are important to them while also getting a tax deduction,\u201d Shadyac said.",
      "Crowdfunding donations to individual campaigns, however, cannot be written off on your taxes. But crowdfunding can make it easier to identify with the ultimate beneficiaries of one's gift, van Teunenbroek said.",
      "Mutual aid refers to reciprocal support networks of neighbors who promptly meet each other's most pressing needs when existing systems fail to make them whole. Because of those reciprocal ties, participants often describe the act as \u201csolidarity, not charity.\u201d",
      "In the internet age, these groups often solicit cash contributions through online payment processors like Venmo, Cash App, PayPal or Zelle. Anyone can scan QR codes, which are usually reposted across social media accounts, to donate. The money goes straight to those impacted or helps purchase supplies for shared resources like community fridges. Transparency might come in the form of a screenshotted receipt shared by organizers on their profile.",
      "Tamara Kneese joined several mutual aid efforts during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic to take care of her neighbors in Oakland. Kneese, a director at the nonprofit research institute Data & Society, said these groups tend to start as immediate responses to crises that are acutely hurting disadvantaged communities. The idea, she added, is that \u201cstate abandonment cannot be addressed by charitable giving alone.\u201d",
      "Kneese said the challenges of such bottom-up, grassroots groups are that resources dwindle and people burn out. Only so many requests can be fulfilled. Organizers' politics clash.",
      "The benefits, she found, are that support comes from within the community and members have direct interactions with those using it.",
      "\u201cIt is not just a sense of charity, like you make a donation and you're done,\" she said. \"There is more of a relationship involved and it is not just transactional.\u201d",

      "President Joe Biden has arrived for his long-awaited first presidential visit to sub-Saharan Africa to the cheers of thousands in Angola",
      "LUANDA, Angola -- LUANDA, Angola (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden arrived for his long-awaited first presidential visit to sub-Saharan Africa on Monday to the cheers of thousands in Angola, where he will highlight an ambitious U.S.-backed railway project meant to counter China\u2019s influence on the continent of over 1.4 billion people.",
      "Biden's three-day visit to Angola will focus largely on the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment in Zambia, Congo and Angola. It aims to advance the U.S. presence in a region rich in the critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies.",
      "Biden's trip comes weeks before Republican Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20, finally delivering on Biden's pledge to visit sub-Saharan Africa. On his way to Angola, he stopped in the Atlantic Ocean island nation of Cape Verde for a brief, closed-door meeting with Prime Minister Ulisses Correia e Silva.",
      "Biden plans to meet with Angolan President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o in the capital, Luanda, where crowds lined the streets for his arrival, and visit the National Slavery Museum. He also will travel to the Atlantic port city of Lobito for a look at the rail project. He will announce new developments on health, agribusiness and security, White House officials said.",
      "Biden had been expected to visit Africa last year after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit in December 2022. The trip was pushed back to 2024 and delayed again this October because of Hurricane Milton, reinforcing a sentiment among some Africans that their continent is still low priority for Washington.",
      "The last U.S. president to visit sub-Saharan Africa was Barack Obama in 2015. Biden did attend a United Nations climate summit in Egypt in North Africa in 2022.",
      "\u201cI just kind of push back on the premise that this is some Johnny-come-lately trip at the very end,\u201d national security spokesman John Kirby told reporters on board Air Force One on the way to Angola, noting that top administration officials had visited Africa, including Vice President Kamala Harris. \u201cThis is something he (Biden) has been focused on since he became president of the United States.\u201d",
      "Critical minerals are a key field for U.S.-China competition, and China has a stranglehold on Africa\u2019s critical minerals.",
      "The U.S. has for years built relations in Africa through trade, security and humanitarian aid. The 800-mile (1,300-kilometer) railway upgrade is a different move and has shades of China\u2019s Belt and Road foreign infrastructure strategy.",
      "The Biden administration has called the corridor one of the president\u2019s signature initiatives, yet Lobito\u2019s future and any change in U.S. engagement with the continent depends on the incoming administration of President-elect Trump.",
      "\u201cPresident Biden is no longer the story,\u201d said Mvemba Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank. \u201cEven African leaders are focused on Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has committed $3 billion to the Lobito Corridor and related projects, administration officials said, alongside financing from the European Union, the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, a Western-led private consortium and African banks.",
      "\u201cA lot is riding on this in terms of its success and its replicability,\u201d said Tom Sheehy, a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan federal research institution.",
      "He called it a flagship for the G7\u2019s new Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, which was driven by Biden and aims to reach other developing nations as a response to China\u2019s Belt and Road.",
      "Many are optimistic that the Lobito project, which won't be complete until well after Biden has left office, will survive a change of administration. Blunting China has bipartisan backing and is high on Trump\u2019s to-do list.",
      "\u201cAs long as they keep labeling Lobito one of the main anti-China tools in Africa, there is a certain likelihood that it\u2019s going to keep being funded,\u201d said Christian-G\u00e9raud Neema, who analyzes China-Africa relations for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "Kirby said the Biden administration hopes Trump and his team see the value in Lobito but \u201cwe are still in office. We still have 50 days. This is a key major development not just for the United States and our foreign policy goals in Africa, but for Africans.\u201d",
      "The Lobito Corridor will be an upgrade and extension of a railway line from the copper and cobalt mines of northern Zambia and southern Congo to Angola\u2019s port of Lobito, strengthening a route west for Africa\u2019s critical minerals. It also ultimately aims to extend from Zambia and Congo to Africa\u2019s east coast through Tanzania and be a coast-to-coast rail link.",
      "While Biden\u2019s administration called it a \u201cgame-changer\u201d for U.S. investment in Africa, it\u2019s little more than a starting point for the U.S. and its partners, with China dominant in mining in Zambia and Congo. Congo has more than 70% of the world\u2019s cobalt, with most heading to China to reinforce its critical mineral supply chain that the U.S. and Europe rely on.",
      "Michelle Gavin, a former adviser on Africa to Obama, said the U.S. had failed to take Africa seriously over multiple administrations, a bipartisan trend.",
      "The Lobito Corridor was \u201cnot just about trying to blunt China, but trying to imagine, OK, what does it look like if we actually were to show up in a more serious way?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s one project. It\u2019s one good idea. And I\u2019m very glad we\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s not enough.\u201d",
      "Lobito was made possible by some American diplomatic success in Angola that led to a Western consortium winning the bid for the project in 2022 ahead of Chinese competition, a surprise given Angola\u2019s long and strong ties with Beijing.",
      "The Biden administration accelerated American outreach to Angola, turning around what was an antagonistic relationship three decades ago when the U.S. armed anti-government rebels in Angola\u2019s civil war. U.S.-Angola trade was $1.77 billion last year.",
      "The visit will also draw attention to a perennial challenge for America\u2019s value-based diplomacy in Africa. International rights groups have used Biden\u2019s trip to criticize the Louren\u00e7o government\u2019s authoritarian shift. Political opponents have been imprisoned and allegedly tortured, while laws have been passed that severely restrict freedoms, according to rights groups.",

      "Adani, 62, is one of Asia\u2019s richest men and perceived as close to Prime Minister Narendra Mo di. He was thrust into the spotlight on Nov. 20 when U.S. prosecutors in New York charged him and seven of his associates with securities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and wire fraud, as well as duping investors by concealing that his company\u2019s huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by bribes.",
      "They were accused of allegedly paying or planning to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials to help secure contracts and financing amounting to billions of dollars.",
      "\u201cThis is not the first time we have faced such challenges. What I can tell you is that every attack makes us stronger. And every obstacle becomes a stepping stone for a more resilient Adani Group,\u201d Adani said late Saturday at an awards ceremony in the northern Indian city of Jaipur.",
      "The businessman said roadblocks his group faces are \u201cthe price of pioneering.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more bold your dreams, the more the world will scrutinize you,\u201d he said. \u201cIn today\u2019s world negativity spreads faster than facts. And as we work through the legal process, I want to reconfirm our absolute commitment to world-class regulatory compliance.\u201d",
      "The Adani Group, in a statement last week, said the allegations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against directors of Adani Green were baseless.",
      "Adani\u2019s imprint across India\u2019s economy runs deep. His group is the country\u2019s largest operator of coal mines and largest infrastructure developer, operating several ports and airports, and employing tens of thousands of people. Despite his fossil fuel roots, Adani has ambitions to become the world\u2019s largest player in renewable energy by 2030.",
      "Analysts say a key factor in his meteoric rise over the years has been his knack for aligning his group\u2019s priorities with those of the Modi government. His critics accuse him of crony capitalism and gaining preferential treatment from the state which has facilitated him winning governmental contracts. The group has repeatedly denied the accusation.",

      "Closing arguments will begin Monday in the trial of a tech consultant in the stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco last year",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Closing arguments will begin on Monday in the trial of a tech consultant in the 2023 stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco, an event that shocked the broader tech community whose members mourned the loss of an entrepreneur they called charismatic and kind.",
      "San Francisco prosecutors say Nima Momeni stabbed Lee three times after a dispute over his treatment toward Momeni's sister, Khazar Momeni, with whom Lee was friends.",
      "Defense attorneys say Lee, 43, was on a multi-day drug bender of cocaine and ketamine that made him agitated and violent, forcing Momeni to use his Krav Maga martial arts skills to fend off the paring knife Lee brandished in the early morning hours of April 4, 2023 after a \u201c bad joke.\u201d",
      "Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "The trial, which began Oct. 14, has been emotionally taxing for family members of both men. Mahnaz Tayarani, mother of the defendant, has sat on one side of the court room while Lee's father, brother and ex-wife sat on the other.",
      "Surveillance video of Bob joking around on his final night and autopsy photos of his wounds have been difficult to view, said Lee's brother, Timothy Oliver Lee. He dismissed Momeni's explanation of events as a fabrication.",
      "\"Even if he was under the influence, he was still Bob. He was never aggressive. He was always a teddy bear and always a great guy,\u201d he said.",
      "Surveillance video shows the two men leaving the posh condo of Khazar Momeni around 2 a.m. and getting into Momeni's BMW. Other surveillance then shows them getting out of the car in an isolated section of the city by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Momeni testified he stopped his car after going over a pothole that caused Lee to spill the beer he was holding. Momeni said he then cracked a joke suggesting Lee should spend his last night visiting the city with family instead of trying to find a strip club to keep the party going.",
      "That's when Lee suddenly pulled a knife, Momeni said. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "\u201cI was scared for my life,\" Momeni said in testimony that was at times rambling and contentious. \"I had to defend myself.\u201d",
      "Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m., dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Prosecutors say Momeni was furious with Lee after he introduced Khazar to a drug dealer who gave her GHB, known as a date-rape drug, hours before the stabbing. They say Momeni grilled Lee earlier in the evening about what might have happened to his sister at the drug dealer\u2019s apartment.",
      "Jurors were allowed to ask questions and, through San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alexandra Gordon, asked why Momeni did not call police, either after Lee's knife attack or after Momeni realized Lee had been stabbed to death.",
      "A knife recovered from the area where Lee was stabbed showed Momeni\u2019s DNA on the handle, but the defense said the handle should have been tested for Lee\u2019s fingerprints.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to his generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died."

      "Ultra low-cost online retailers Temu and Shein are giving Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season",
      "Shopping on Temu can feel like playing an arcade game. Instead of using a joystick-controlled claw to grab a toy, visitors to the online marketplace maneuver their computer mouses or cellphone screens to browse colorful gadgets, accessories and trinkets with prices that look too good to refuse.",
      "A pop-up spinning wheel offers the chance to win a coupon. Rotating captions warn that a less than $2 camouflage print balaclava and a $1.23 skeleton hand back scratcher are \u201cAlmost sold out.\u201d A flame symbol indicates a $9.69 plush cat print hoodie is selling fast. A timed-down selection of discounted items adds to the sense of urgency.",
      "Welcome to the new online world of impulse buying, a place of guilty pleasures where the selection is vast, every day is Cyber Monday, and an instant dopamine hit that will have faded by the time your package arrives is always just a click away.",
      "By all accounts, we\u2019re living in an accelerating age for consumerism, one that Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, its fierce rival, supercharged with social media savvy and an interminable assortment of cheap goods, most shipped directly from merchants in China based on real-time demand.",
      "The business models of the two platforms, coupled with avalanches of digital or influencer advertising, have enabled them to give Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season.",
      "Software company Salesforce said it expects roughly one in five online purchases in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada to be made through four online marketplaces based or founded in Asia: Shein, Temu, TikTok Shop - the e-commerce arm of video-sharing platform TikTok - and AliExpress.",
      "Analysts with Salesforce said they are expected to pull in roughly $160 billion in global sales outside of China. Most of the sales will go to Temu and Shein, a privately held company which is thought to lead the worldwide fast fashion market in revenue.",
      "Lisa Xiaoli Neville, a nonprofit manager who lives in Los Angeles, is sold on Shein. The bedroom of her home is stocked with jeans, shoes, press-on nails and other items from the ultra-fast fashion retailer, all of which she amassed after getting on the platform to purchase a $2 pair of earrings she saw in a Facebook ad.",
      "Neville, 46, estimates she spends at least $75 a month on products from Shein. A $2 eggshell opener, a portable apple peeler and an apple corer - both costing less than $5 - are among the quirky, single-use kitchen tools taking up drawer space. She acknowledges she doesn\u2019t need them because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t even cook like that.\u201d Plus, she\u2019s allergic to apples.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t eat apples. It will kill me,\u201d Neville said, laughing. \u201cBut I still want the coring thing.\u201d",
      "Shein, now based in Singapore, uses some of the same web design features as Temu\u2019s, such as pop-up coupons and ads, to persuade shoppers to keep clicking, but it appears a bit more restrained in its approach.",
      "Shein primarily targets young women through partnerships with social media influencers. Searching the company's name on video platforms turns up creators promoting Shein's Black Friday sales event and displaying the dozens of of trendy clothes and accessories they got for comparatively little money.",
      "But the Shein-focused content also includes videos of TikTokers saying they're embarrassed to admit they shopped there and critics lashing out at fans for not taking into account the environmental harms or potential labor abuses associated with products that are churned out and shipped worldwide at a speedy pace.",
      "Neville has already picked out holiday gifts for family and friends from the site. Most of the products in her online cart cost under $10, including graphic T-shirts she intends to buy for her son and jeans and loafers for her daughter. All told, she plans to spend about $200 on gifts, significantly less than $500 she used to shell out at other stores in prior years.",
      "\u201cThe visuals just make you want to spend more money,\u201d she said, referring to the clothes on Shein's site. \u201cThey're very cheap and everything is just so cute.\u201d",
      "Unlike Shein, Temu's appeal cuts across age groups and gender. The platform is the world\u2019s second most-visited online shopping site, software company Similarweb reported in September. Customers go there looking for practical items like doormats and silly products like a whiskey flask shaped like a vintage cellphone from the 1990s.",
      "Temu advertised Black Friday bargains for some items at upwards of 70% off the recommended retail price. Making a purchase can quickly result in receiving dozens of emails offering free giveaways. The caveat: customers have to buy more products.",
      "Ellen Flowers, 36, a lifestyle blogger who lives in Dallas, recently decided to pair a $3,500 dining table with $25 dining chairs from Temu to save money. She's also purchased clothes from Temu. The quality or fit wasn't always always great, so Flowers donated some unwanted pieces to thrift stores to avoid paying return shipping fees that would cost almost as much as the clothes.",
      "Flowers planned to buy stocking stuffers on Temu as well as baubles for an ornament-swapping party in early December. She also wanted to buy necklaces and bracelets for an activity at her 5-year-old niece's upcoming birthday party.",
      "\u201cI love buying my nieces presents,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cSince they\u2019re young, they don\u2019t need the Louis Vuitton handbag. I can give them a cute handbag from Temu. Then they\u2019ll lose interest in a month and I\u2019ll buy them another one.\u201d",
      "Despite their rise, Temu and Shein have proven particularly ripe for pushback. Last year, a coalition of unnamed brands and organizations launched a campaign to oppose Shein in Washington. U.S. lawmakers also have raised the possibility that Temu is allowing goods made with forced labor to enter the country.",
      "More recently, the Biden administration put forward rules that would crack down on a trade rule known as the de minimis exception, which has allowed a lot of cheap products to come into the U.S. duty-free. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to slap high tariffs on goods from China, a move that would likely raise prices and across the retail world.",
      "Both Shein and Temu have set up warehouses in the U.S. to speed up delivery times and help them better compete with Amazon, which is trying to erode their price advantage through a new storefront that also ships products directly from China.",
      "Meanwhile, Temu is onboarding Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that would allow the company to not be as exposed to changes around the de minimus trade rule, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse.",
      "The change comes as both Shein and Temu are attempting to expand beyond the bargain-hungry shoppers who popularized their platforms. Temu is allowing sellers to ship products to customers from local U.S. warehouses and says the move will allow it to sell larger items like furniture as it expands its selection of big-ticket items.",
      "Meanwhile, American children's clothing retailer The Children\u2019s Place signed a deal last month to distribute its products through Shein\u2019s platform. Last year, Shein went into business with women's fashion retailer Forever 21. It has been working to recruit other brands and reportedly has hopes of getting listed on the London Stock Exchange."

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- Volkswagen workers launched rolling two-hour strikes Monday at nine plants across Germany to underscore their resistance to pay cuts and factory closures the company says are necessary to cope with a slack European auto market.",
      "The work stoppages included the company's base plant at Wolfsburg, where workers rallied against a cost-cutting drive by the automaker\u2019s management in which they face the threat of the company\u2019s first plant closures in its home country.",
      "Volkswagen argues that it must lower costs in Germany to levels achieved by competitors and by Volkswagen plants in eastern Europe and South America. Chief employee representative Daniela Cavallo has said employees should not shoulder the burden of management failures to develop attractive products and come up with a cheaper, entry-level electric vehicle.",
      "\u201cWe demand that all make their contribution \u2013 management and the shareholder side as well,\u201d Cavallo said at the rally in Wolfsburg as employees drummed, whistled and clapped.",
      "She said the next round of talks in a week\u2019s time \u201cis likely to set the course \u2013 rapprochement or escalation. We are ready for both.\u201d",
      "The so-called warning strikes, a common tactic in German wage negotiations, are taking place as part of talks for a new labor agreement after a mandatory peace period that bars strikes expired on Sunday. The IG Metall industrial union said any job actions beyond those occurring on Monday would be announced later.",
      "The company is demanding a 10% pay cut for 120,000 German workers and has said it can't avoid shedding factory capacity that is no longer needed. Employee representatives say the company has proposed closing three of its German plants.",
      "Thorsten Gr\u00f6ger, the regional leader of the IG Metall industrial union in Lower Saxony, where Volkswagen is headquartered, said that the company won\u2019t be able to \u201coverlook\u201d the walkouts. \u201cIf necessary, this will be one of the toughest conflicts Volkswagen has ever seen.\u201d",
      "The company hasn't publicly detailed its plans but is facing a drop in demand in Europe, higher costs and increasing competition from Chinese automakers. Volkswagen built factories to supply a European car market of 16 million in annual vehicle sales, but now faces demand for around 14 million, Volkswagen brand head Thomas Schaefer was quoted as saying in the Welt am Sonntag newspaper. Since Volkswagen has a quarter of the market, that represents a loss of 500,000 cars a year.",
      "For years, strong profits in China helped cover higher costs but the changing environment now means that \u201cit's high time to address this,\u201d Schaefer said.",
      "The walkouts began at a plant in Zwickau in eastern Germany and were to continue at plants in Braunschweig, Chemnitz, Dresden, Emden, Hanover, Kassel, and Salzgitter.",
      "The next negotiations are slated for Dec. 9."

      "Shiffrin was leading after the first run of the GS on Saturday as she chased after her 100th World Cup win. With the finish line in sight on her second run, the 29-year-old leaned into the hill, lost an edge and slid into a gate, flipping head over skis. She then slammed into another gate before coming to a stop in the protective fencing.",

Neither knee injury required surgery, and both times, Shiffrin was back to racing within two months.",

      "Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence was carted off the field after taking a violent elbow to the facemask from Houston linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair",
      "JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Trevor Lawrence walked out of EverBank Stadium with his wife by his side and a smile on his face, a positive sign for the oft-injured Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback.",
      "Lawrence was carted off the field after taking a violent blow to the facemask from Houston linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair, a hit that prompted a sideline-clearing brawl and a secondary scuffle.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a play that really has no business being in our league,\u201d Jaguars coach Doug Pederson said following his team's 23-20 loss Sunday.",
      "Back in the starting lineup after missing two games with a sprained left shoulder, Lawrence scrambled left on a second-and-7 play in the second quarter. He initiated a slide before Al-Shaair raised his forearm and unleashed on the defenseless quarterback.",
      "Lawrence clenched both fists after the hit \u2014 movements consistent with what\u2019s referred to as the \u201cfencing response,\u201d which can be common after a traumatic brain injury. He was on the ground for several minutes as teammates came to his defense and mobbed Al-Shaair, whose latest perceived cheap shot could result in a suspension.",
      "\u201cThat was a dumb hit on his part,\u201d Jaguars defensive end Josh Hines-Allen said. \u201cHate to see it. The first thing I thought of was to go get him because it\u2019s your brother, and that\u2019s the quarterback.\u201d",
      "Added tight end Evan Engram: \u201cI saw him sliding and then I saw the hit, and then, honestly, (my emotions) just took over. I just knew it was wrong. It was just a dirty play, and you stick up for your guys.\u201d",
      "Lawrence eventually was helped to his feet and loaded into the front seat of a cart to be taken off the field. He was not transported to a hospital for tests. He was quickly ruled out with a concussion, though.",
      "\u201cThank you to everyone who has reached out/been praying for me,\u201d Lawrence posted on X hours after the game. \u201cI'm home and feeling much better. Means a lot. Thank you all.\u201d",
      "Texans coach DeMeco Ryans called it \u201cunfortunate.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re coaching,\u201d Ryans said. \u201cWant to be smart in everything we do and not hurt the team, get a penalty there. Just have to be smarter when a quarterback is going down.",
      "\u201cJust unfortunate play, not representative of who Azeez is. Like, he\u2019s a smart player, really great leader for us.\u201d",
      "Al-Shaair was ejected for \u201can illegal hit on the quarterback, unnecessary, to the neck and head area,\u201d referee Land Clark said in a pool report. Jaguars rookie cornerback Jarrian Jones also was ejected for throwing a punch during the melee.",
      "As Al-Shaair was leaving the field, fans started screaming at him. Jaguars veteran guard Brandon Scherff joined in, prompting another altercation with Al-Shaair. Texans teammate Will Anderson grabbed Al-Shaair and was escorting him off the field when a fan threw a water bottle and hit Anderson in the helmet. The fan was later ejected.",
      "Officials and coaches got the teams under control before play resumed. Al-Shaair was not in the locker room when it opened to reporters after the game.",
      "\u201cI just want to say prayers to Trevor,\u201d Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud said. \u201cI really hope and pray he\u2019s OK. Prayers to his family as well. But, yeah, still rocking with Azeez. I don\u2019t think that was his intent, and I pray that Trevor is OK and his family is right there with him.\u201d",
      "Mac Jones replaced Lawrence and rallied the Jaguars in the fourth quarter. Jones completed 20 of 32 passes for 235 yards and two touchdowns. Pederson declined to speculate on Lawrence's status moving forward, especially with the Jags now eliminated in the AFC South.",
      "Lawrence, the top pick in the 2021 draft, missed a game for the first time in his professional career in 2023 because of a sprained right shoulder sustained in Week 16. He also missed significant practice time because of other injuries: a sprained left knee in Week 6, a sprained right ankle in Week 13 and a concussion in Week 15.",
      "\u201cTrevor is a warrior,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re all praying for him. We definitely have his back. For him to play today was incredible. He\u2019s a tough dude. Really wanted to get the win for him. Obviously fell short. But definitely praying for him. I know we all have his back for sure.\u201d",

      "Chicago (4-8) had never fired a coach during a season. But a six-game losing streak marked by questionable coaching decisions spurred the founding NFL franchise to change course. The Bears let Eberflus go Friday and replaced him on an interim basis with offensive coordinator Thomas Brown.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the end of the game situations, just some of the detailing to finish in those moments,\u201d Poles said. \u201cWe all know a lot of these games come down to those critical spots that we weren\u2019t able to get over the hump.\u201d",
      "Warren and Poles spoke during a news conference that lasted just under 21 minutes, including about an eight-minute opening statement from Warren.",
      "The tipping point with Eberflus came Thursday, with an excruciating 23-20 loss at Detroit. The Bears let the clock run down rather than call a timeout following a sack, resulting in incomplete pass from the Lions 41 as time expired when they could have run more than one play.",
      "The Bears decided to make the change the next day \u2014 but not before Eberflus conducted his usual day-after-the-game availability with reporters via Zoom. He was informed a few hours later.",
      "Warren said the Bears had not made the decision by the time Eberflus held his news conference.",
      "\u201cIn retrospect, could we have done it better?\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely, and I\u2019ll be the first one to raise my hand, yes. But during his press conference and even a couple hours later, we had not reached a decision.\u201d",

      "McCaffrey\u2019s 19-yard run in the first quarter was his longest of the season, and he had seven carries for 53 yards and two catches for 14 yards before getting hurt.",

      "The season starts now for Pep Guardiola",
      "For Pep Guardiola, the season starts now.",
      "Chastened. Relieved. Defiant. The Manchester City manager displayed a whole range of emotions after his latest ordeal at Anfield that plunged the out-of-sorts English champions to an unlikely low.",
      "Make that seven matches without a win for a team which, not so long ago, never lost.",
      "That\u2019s all in the past for Guardiola, though.",
      "\u201cReset,\u201d he said after a 2-0 loss to Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday. \u201cThere\u2019s a feeling we start from here this season.\u201d",
      "How he intends to move on from the worst run of results in his managerial career remains to be seen. But it all starts Wednesday with a home game against Nottingham Forest.",
      "\u201cWe are not used to this,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cMany, many things are happening. The teams are good and we can\u2019t handle it right now. I have to find the solution to be stable and solid.",
      "\u201cThese players gave me a chance to lead maybe the best years of my life. All I can do is find a solution \u2014 in the right moment, the club will make the decision what is needed for this club to continue to be there.\u201d",
      "Was he referring to making signings in the January transfer window? City\u2019s fatigued and injury-ravaged squad sure needs some, especially in midfield.",
      "Or was he referring to his own future? It\u2019s not the first time in recent days that Guardiola brought up how fragile his position could quickly become if City keeps on losing.",
      "Moments before walking down the tunnel after the final whistle at Anfield, Guardiola held up one outstretched hand and an extra finger as a retort to taunts by Liverpool fans. It was a nod to the six Premier League titles he has won in eight full seasons at City.",
      "No. 7 doesn\u2019t look likely this season. Not with City already 11 points behind Liverpool.",
      "\u201cCall me delusional or something like that,\u201d Guardiola said, \u201cbut I have the feeling we will try to build back our confidence to win games.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Guardiola said he was taking some belief from recent training sessions. From the return to fitness of some players, such as Ruben Dias, Nathan Ake, Jack Grealish and Jeremy Doku. Maybe from a second-half display against Liverpool that, while hardly vintage City, at least showed some spirit and resolve, even if Liverpool appeared happy to play on the break and never looked troubled.",
      "It felt like Guardiola was relieved to come away from Anfield with the damage limited and City\u2019s hardest fixture of the season out of the way.",
      "Yet his comments will sound so hollow if City goes on to lose to \u2014 or even draw with \u2014 sixth-place Forest, which is only one point and one spot further back and has a manager in Nuno Espirito Santo who has enjoyed some surprise results at City with former club Wolverhampton. Forest also is the only team to beat Liverpool in 20 games this season.",
      "\u201cLet's not forget they are the champions,\u201d Espirito Santo said of City, \u201cthe team that won so many (titles) with so many quality players. It's going to be very tough.",
      "\u201cWe'll take what other opponents did right (against City) so we can do it again.\u201d",
      "Guardiola's masterplan might include a change of role for Grealish, who could yet play more centrally as a No. 10 rather than as a winger. Or a first start since September for Kevin De Bruyne, who has had to settle for cameo roles off the bench as he struggles to fully overcome a groin injury.",
      "Getting some energy into his midfield will be important as the absence of Rodri and Mateo Kovacic continues to bite hard and be City's biggest issue. That might come in the form of a new signing next month, unless Guardiola is working on a new plan on the training ground.",
      "A midweek victory for City, coupled with setbacks for Liverpool at Newcastle and Arsenal at home to Manchester United elsewhere Wednesday, could yet rekindle some belief that all is not lost this season.",
      "On current form, this is unlikely.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s almost a mini-crisis at Manchester City,\" said Jamie Carragher, a pundit for British broadcaster Sky Sports. \"I think City might have a fight on their hands for top four.\u201d",

      "The Fighting Irish will find out next Sunday if they'll play at home in the first round of the College Football Playoff. They all but clinched an at-large spot with their win at Southern California on Saturday and, combined with Ohio State's loss, strengthened their position to be a host team Dec. 20 or 21.",
      "Their 49-35 win at USC, made possible by 99- and 100-yard interception returns for touchdowns late in the game, helped the Irish move up to No. 4 in The Associated Press college football poll Sunday. It's their highest ranking in four years. They were No. 5 in last week's CFP rankings and, after Ohio State's 13-10 loss to Michigan, should move up a spot when the new rankings come out Tuesday night.",
      "Coach Marcus Freeman and his players like to use their 16-14 loss to Northern Illinois as the starting point for measuring their progress.",
      "\u201cTo see where we were 84 days ago to where we are now, it's a testament to the trust and the decisions that those guys in that locker room and the coaching staff and everybody that helps have made,\" Freeman said. \"This is what it's all about, man. It's a journey, and you can't let the highest of highs and lowest of lows deter you from what you need to do to reach your goals.\u201d",
      "Since that dumbfounding September day they\u2019ve won 10 straight games, tied with Boise State for second-longest streak in the Football Bowl Subdivision. No. 1 Oregon has won 13 in a row.",
      "Turnover margin, besides wins, is one of the ways Notre Dame tracks progress. Leonard threw two interceptions against NIU and the Huskies converted both into field goals, including the game-winner in the final minute.",
      "Leonard has been picked off just three times in the last 10 games, and Notre Dame is second in the nation in turnover margin at plus-1.33 per game. The Irish also are one of the highest-scoring teams in the nation, at just under 40 points per game, and have a top-10 defense.",
      "\u201cSometimes you've got to lose to gain and make a big jump,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cI told our players Monday after that (NIU) game that this will be the greatest thing that ever happened to this football team if we learn from it and continue to use it. It's hard to say that. The greatest thing that happened to this program this season was a loss, because it taught us what it takes to have success.\u201d",
      "Checking in on five of the Top 25:",
      "Things have changed in a month's time for the Nittany Lions. At No. 3, they're back in the same spot as they were when they lost 20-13 to Ohio State at home. This week, they're headed to Indianapolis to play No. 1 Oregon in the Big Ten championship game for a top four seed in the CFP. The Buckeyes, meanwhile, are No. 7 after falling five spots in the rankings and waiting to find out their playoff fate. Since the loss, Penn State has won four straight and outscored opponents by an average of 39-12.",
      "Winning takes care of everything, so the fact Alabama committed four turnovers in its 28-14 Iron Bowl win over Auburn was only a minor inconvenience \u2014 this time. But QB Jalen Milroe has committed six turnovers over the last two games, and only eight players in the country have more than Milroe's 14 for the season, according to Sportradar.",
      "The Gamecocks could make a compelling case for a playoff spot. They've won six games in a row since starting 3-3 for their longest streak in 11 years. Their 17-14 win over No. 18 Clemson was their school-record fourth of the season against a ranked opponent, and it gave them four road wins for the first time since 2006. Redshirt freshman QB LaNorris Sellers is a rising star. He ran for a career-high 166 yards and two TDs and threw for 164 against the Tigers.",
      "The Rebels' hopes of earning the Group of Five playoff spot have been revived thanks to Tulane losing to Memphis. UNLV has won four straight since its 29-24 home loss to Boise State, and the Rebels get a rematch in Friday's Mountain West title game. UNLV was the third-highest G5 team in last week's CFP rankings, behind Boise State and Tulane. The Rebels likely will be the second-highest G5 team this week, meaning they can punch their ticket with a win on the blue turf.",
      "The strides the Orange have made under first-year coach Fran Brown have been overshadowed by turnarounds orchestrated by Curt Cignetti at Indiana and by Kenny Dillingham at Arizona State. Brown snagged Ohio State transfer Kyle McCord out of the portal and the two have led the Orange to their first nine-win season since 2018 and second since 2002. Their 42-38 win over Miami was their first against a top-10 team since 2017 and propelled them into the Top 25.",
      "Oregon has been No. 1 seven straight weeks and the unanimous choice for the fifth straight week. ... At four straight weeks, Notre Dame and South Carolina have the longest active streaks of rising in consecutive AP polls. ... Memphis secured back-to-back 10-win seasons for the first time with its 34-24 win over Tulane. That allowed the Tigers to crack the Top 25 for the first time since 2020. ... This week marks the first time since Oct. 16, 2022, that the state of Louisiana has had no team in the Top 25. Tulane dropped out Sunday. LSU fell out Nov. 17.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 13:46:24 -0500",

      "Michael Andretti has been sidelined from his namesake motorsports organization and won\u2019t have any role with the Formula 1 program he spent the last four years desperately trying to launch",
      "Only the coldest of hearts won't empathize with Michael Andretti, who has been sidelined from his namesake motorsports organization and won't have any role with the the Formula 1 program he spent the last four years desperately trying to launch.",
      "His effort to get a program partnered with General Motors into F1 was approved last week, roughly a month after Andretti stepped aside from leading his race teams. F1's decision to expand its grid for Cadillac F1 came amidst a federal antitrust investigation into why Liberty Media refused to admit Andretti Global as an 11th team \u2014 and after Andretti partners Dan Towriss and Mark Walter took controlling interest of the effort.",
      "\u201cThe Cadillac F1 Team is made up of a strong group of people that have worked tirelessly to build an American works team,\u201d Andretti posted on social media. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the hard work they have put in and congratulate all involved on this momentous next step. I will be cheering for you!\u201d",
      "While he will have no role with the F1 team, it is unclear what his regular involvement will be with his IndyCar team. His famous father, 1978 F1 champion Mario Andretti, will be on the board of the F1 team and an ambassador.",
      "What changed F1's position on Andretti \u2014 an application it basically mocked in its January denial \u2014 is not known. Few have said much beyond noting GM's increased commitment to take a larger role beyond engine supplier.",
      "Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the president of F1's governing body, had championed the GM bid from the start and Andretti's application was the only one of seven to receive approval from the FIA. In an interview with The Associated Press, he called F1's decision to finally allow the GM team a spot in the sport \u201ca win for all of motorsports\u201d but also sympathized with Michael Andretti.",
      "\u201cI feel he should be proud because he's the founder who started this thing with his partners,\u201d Ben Sulayem said. \"We did the proper due process, we never favored anyone, and it is only because his application ticked all the boxes that the FIA approved it. Michael is a lovely person and I do not feel this was personal against Michael Andretti.",
      "\u201cThe other teams? For them, it was about the money. They don't want the money to go from split between 10 teams to split between 11 teams,\" he added. \"But it was only a matter of time before General Motors was going to be approved and I feel it is incorrect to say it happened because Michael stepped aside. What did Michael do? Why would people not want him? Because he spoke publicly? He didn't break any rules. He didn't abuse anyone. If people want to see it as personal, it is up to them. He doesn't annoy me.\"",
      "What likely did annoy F1 and Liberty Media, its commercial rights holder, was the Justice Department investigation. Liberty announced it was under investigation this summer, not long after Mario Andretti visited Washington to discuss the F1 snub with lawmakers.",
      "The FBI was allegedly at last month's Las Vegas Grand Prix and Ben Sulayem confirmed to AP he was interviewed by federal investigators.",
      "\u201cIt is the department that protects the interest of the United States and the FIA has nothing to hide,\u201d Ben Sulayem said. \u201cI was proud to speak to them and they were very polite and understanding. I wanted this to be cleared: I wanted GM in F1 because it is good for business.\u201d",
      "F1 currently has just one American team, owned by California businessman Gene Haas, despite a series-high three races in the United States. Should the Cadillac F1 team make it to the grid in 2026 as scheduled, there will be two American teams and Ford will officially join Red Bull that season as a technical partner.",
      "This Andretti-less F1 effort will be led by TWG Global, the investment company founded by Walter, who as CEO of Guggenheim Partners is the controlling owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Premier League club Chelsea, and Towriss, who became involved in motorsports initially as a sponsor for Andretti and took an ownership role in Andretti Global in 2022.",
      "Towriss is now the majority owner of the Andretti race teams and work on the F1 team will continue in Andretti's Indiana shop, its recently opened satellite factory in Silverstone and GM\u2019s facilities in North Carolina and Michigan. Towriss is the CEO of TWG Global\u2019s motorsports arm.",
      "There is no indication who the drivers will be for the F1 team, although Valtteri Bottas indicated last weekend he'd like to be considered and the original Andretti effort targeted current IndyCar driver Colton Herta, who is sponsored by Towriss' company, Gainbridge.",

      "Liverpool is in control of the Premier League title race",
      "Liverpool is in control of the Premier League title race. Manchester City is in free fall.",
      "A 2-0 win against City on Sunday moved Liverpool nine points clear at the top of the standings and 11 ahead of Pep Guardiola\u2019s four-time defending champion.",
      "Goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah exposed the gap between the title rivals and emphasized the deepening crisis for Guardiola, whose serial title winners languish fifth in the standings.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t perfect, but we came close to perfection and that\u2019s the only way you can beat a quality team like City,\u201d Liverpool head coach Arne Slot said.",
      "It\u2019s now seven games without a win for City in all competitions, including six losses during that run.",
      "The latest defeat at Anfield could have been even more emphatic, with Virgil van Dijk hitting the post and Salah missing the target when through on goal in a game which Liverpool totally dominated.",
      "The home crowd mocked Guardiola, chanting he would be fired in the morning. With his team unable to respond, it was left to him to hold up six fingers in reference to the six league titles he has won in seven years during a period of unprecedented domestic dominance.",
      "\u201cMaybe they're right, that I must be sacked (fired) for the results we have, but I didn't expect (that) in Anfield,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s part of the game. I understand completely and accept it. We had incredible, incredible battles together.\u201d",
      "City's dominance looks increasingly likely to come to an end this season, with Guardiola enduring the worst losing streak of his managerial career and Liverpool looking a potential champion after such an impressive start under Slot.",
      "It\u2019s 11 wins from 13 games in the league for Slot, whose team also leads the Champions League standings.",
      "Victory against City came days after beating European champion Real Madrid by the same score line and having already seen off German champion Bayer Leverkusen 4-0.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone including me would have predicted this,\u201d Slot said of his team's start to the campaign.",
      "In contrast, City\u2019s players look bereft of confidence, having thrown away a three-goal lead against Feyenoord in the Champions League on Tuesday, just days after being thrashed 4-0 by Tottenham.",
      "Guardiola\u2019s team could have been behind even before Gakpo\u2019s opener in the 12th minute, following a wonderful threaded cross by Salah. And Liverpool should have wrapped up the game long before Salah eventually converted a penalty in the 78th when City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega brought down Luis Diaz in the box.",
      "Guardiola has now lost four straight league games for the first time as a manager, Premier League stat supplier Opta said. The last time City lost four in a row in the league was 2008, Opta said.",
      "Ruben Amorim got Manchester United fans smiling again after a 4-0 win against Everton.",
      "In his first Premier League game at Old Trafford, the home crowd serenaded United\u2019s players with \u201cole\u201d as they played one of their best performances of the season. It marks a big change from the boos that rang around the stadium toward the end of former manager Erik ten Hag\u2019s reign.",
      "In Amorim\u2019s third game in charge in all competitions since taking over last month, United produced its best performance under him, with Marcus Rashford and Joshua Zirkzee scoring two goals each.",
      "\u201cIt is a nice result. It is important with a new coach and a new way of playing, we are still learning. We have to back up this performance,\u201d Rashford said.",
      "Amorim is undefeated since taking over last month and United is ninth - four points off the top four.",
      "While performances on the field are pleasing supporters, there were protests off it over increasing ticket prices.",
      "A banner displayed both inside and outside the stadium read: \u201cStop exploiting loyalty\u201d.",
      "It hasn\u2019t taken long for Amorim to get United\u2019s strikers scoring.",
      "Rashford has three goals in three games under the Portuguese, having managed four in 18 before that.",
      "Rasmus Hojlund scored twice in the Europa League win against Bodo Glimt and Zirkzee\u2019s double on Sunday were his first goals since the opening game of the season.",
      "Goals had been hard to come by under Ten Hag, with United only scoring eight in nine games in the league before he was fired.",
      "Rashford began the rout against Everton in the 34th minute and Zirkzee doubled United\u2019s lead five minutes later. Rashford scored again a minute into the second half and Zirkzee\u2019s second came in the 64th after a swift break.",

      "Matthew Stafford passed for two fourth-quarter touchdowns, Kyren Williams rushed for 104 yards and a score, and the Los Angeles Rams beat New Orleans 21-14 to hand interim Saints coach Darren Rizzi his first loss",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Kryen Williams and the Los Angeles Rams strode to the locker room at halftime confident that the zero they had on the scoreboard was no indication of how the final 30 minutes would go.",
      "\u201cWe knew the second half was going to be ours,\u201d said Williams, who rushed for a season-high 104 yards, including a 4-yard touchdown, in the Rams' 21-14 victory over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt felt great. It felt like I was me, myself and I when I was out there playing like that,\" Williams said. \"I was playing instinctive football and had great energy.\u201d",
      "Matthew Stafford passed for two fourth-quarter touchdowns as the Rams (6-6) stayed close in the NFC West race and handed interim Saints coach Darren Rizzi his first loss.",
      "\u201cAll we could do is get one win this week, and we were able to,\u201d Rams coach Sean McVay said. \u201cThere was improvement for our team collectively, and that\u2019s what I want to continue to see.\u201d",
      "The Saints (4-8) drove inside the Rams 10-yard line in the final minutes, but Derek Carr\u2019s pass on fourth-and-3 was deflected from behind by edge rusher Jared Verse and fell incomplete.",
      "\u201cI realized the tight end was staying on me,\u201d Verse said, referring to the Saints' Foster Moreau. \u201cThe No. 1 rule on the edge is you can\u2019t be blocked by the tight end \u2014 you just can\u2019t. I just walked him back and was able to peel off and affect the throw.\u201d",
      "That allowed the Rams to run out the clock on the Saints and Rizzi, who had won his first two games since taking over after the firing of Dennis Allen.",
      "\u201cWe did a lot of things in the game that we set out to do and played the game in a lot of ways that we wanted to, but we didn\u2019t execute in crunch time,\" Rizzi said. \u201cWe had a chance to win there. We had a guy open in the end zone and we can\u2019t get the ball off. So, unfortunate.\u201d",
      "Stafford passed for 183 yards without a turnover. His scoring passes went for 3 yards to Demarcus Robinson and 7 yards to Puca Nacua, the latter putting the Rams up for good with 8:54 left.",
      "\u201cThe first half was definitely frustrating, but we knew at the same time, every time we were handing it off we were getting good yards,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cYou have to keep playing. Football is a game of ebbs and flows.\"",
      "Versatile New Orleans tight end Taysom Hill, who powered the Saints to their previous victory with one of the best games of his career, injured his left knee and was carted off the field after converting a fourth-and-short run late in the fourth quarter.",
      "The 34-year-old Hill, a fan favorite, waved from the cart as the Superdome crowd chanted his name. Rizzi did not provide an update on Hill after the game, saying he still needed to have imaging done before the full extent of his injury was understood.",
      "The Saints narrowly outgained the Rams and possessed the ball for more time, but struggled to get in the end zone. New Orleans settled for three field-goal attempts in the first half, with Blake Grupe hitting two from 54 yards but missing one from 36.",
      "That was enough to give New Orleans a 6-0 halftime lead before Williams' 10th TD of the season put the Rams up 7-6.",
      "\u201cKyren\u2019s energy was outstanding,\u201d McVay said. \u201cHe was excellent in being really decisive. He was putting his foot in the ground, leveling off well and doing a great job on slash running to the second and third levels.\u201d",
      "Saints running back Alvin Kamara rushed for 112 yards on 23 carries.",
      "New Orleans' lone touchdown came on Carr's 28-yard pass in the fourth quarter to Marquez Valdes-Scantling, his fourth TD reception in four games since being signed midseason. Dante Pettis hauled in Carr's pass in tight coverage in the right corner of the end zone for a 2-point conversion that tied it at 14.",
      "Hill\u2019s departure capped off a tough day for New Orleans on the injury front. Starting center Erik McCoy was unable to return from his re-aggravated groin injury despite two weeks' rest, so Shane Lemieux started in his place. The offensive line took another hit in the fourth quarter when guard Nick Saldiveri was carted off with a left knee injury. Safety Tyrann Mathieu appeared to hurt his shoulder making a second-half tackle on Williams. He remained on the sideline after receiving treatment and said after the game that he expected to recover quickly.",

Beyond Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, the company portfolio includes Dodge, Chrysler, Fiat, Peugeot, Maserati and Opel.",
      "Stellantis' North American operations had been the company\u2019s main source of profits for some time, but struggles piled up this year, with the company citing rising competition and larger market changes. As a result of lofty sticker prices and fewer affordable options, many high-priced vehicles have been left unsold on dealers' lots.",
      "For its third quarter, Stellantis posted 27% plunge in net revenues, as gaps in launching new products and action to reduce inventories also slashed global shipments of new vehicles by 20%.",
      "The carmaker reported net revenues of 33 billion euros (nearly $36 billion ) in the three-month period ending Sept. 30, down from 45 billion euros in the same period last year. All regions except South America reported double-digit dips in revenues \u2014 led by North America, which plunged 42% to 12.4 billion euros ($13.1 billion).",
      "In recent months, Tavares had come under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union after the release of dismal financial performance reports. He also oversaw cost-cutting efforts that included delaying factory openings and laying off union workers \u2014 further straining the company's relations with the UAW, which filed several grievances against Stellantis and threatened to strike in recent months.",
      "The UAW welcomed Tavares' resignation with president Shawn Fain calling the move \u201ca major step in the right direction for a company that has been mismanaged and a workforce that has been mistreated for too long.\u201d He noted that thousands of UAW members had been calling for Tavares' firing for weeks for what Fain called the CEO's \u201creckless mismanagement of the company.\u201d",
      "\u201cTavares is leaving behind a mess of painful layoffs and overpriced vehicles sitting on dealership lots,\u201d Fain said in a statement. He added that the union looks forward to sitting down with Stellantis\u2019 new chief executive and \u201cwill keep using all means available\u201d to hold the company accountable.",
      "Beyond the U.S., Stellantis has faced pressure in Italy \u2014 where lawmakers questioned the former chief executive over the company's production plans in October, with the far-right government accusing the company of relocating assembly plants to low-cost countries. Tens of thousands of autoworkers in the country also held a one-day walkout, calling for more employment certainty and protections.",
      "In efforts to revive sales, Stellantis previously made a number of leadership changes in October, which included naming new heads of operations in North America and Europe. At the time, the company expected Tavares to step down in early 2026, closer to the end of his five-year contract.",
      "The company confirmed in September that it was searching for a CEO to eventually succeed Tavares, but it maintained those efforts were part of standard leadership transition plans.",
      "In a statement Sunday, Stellantis\u2019 senior independent director Henri de Castries said that Stellantis' success is \u201crooted in a perfect alignment\u201d between shareholders, the company's board and the CEO \u2014 but noted \u201cdifferent views\u201d had emerged in recent weeks, resulting in the decision to approve Tavares' resignation.",
      "Elkann, the chairperson of Stellantis' board, thanked Tavares for \u201chis years of dedicated service and the role he has played in the creation of Stellantis\u201d in an additional statement. He added that he looks forward to appointing a new CEO.",
      "Stellantis did not comment further beyond Sunday's release. The announcement arrived shortly after Bloomberg reported Tavares' plans to step down, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter."

      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year",
      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year? Artificial intelligence chatbots might help, but don't expect them to do all the work or always give you the right answers.",
      "Anyone scouring the internet for Cyber Monday deals is likely going to encounter more conversational iterations of the chatbots that some retailers and e-commerce sites have built to provide shoppers with enhanced customer service.",
      "Some companies have integrated models infused with newer generative AI technologies, allowing shoppers to seek advice by asking naturally phrased questions like \u201cWhat's the best wireless speaker?\u201d",
      "Retailers hope consumers use these chatbots, which are typically called shopping assistants - as virtual companions that help them discover or compare products. Prior chatbots were mostly used for task-oriented functions such as helping customers track down online orders or return ones that didn't meet expectations.",
      "Amazon, the king of online retail, has said its customers have been questioning Rufus - the generative AI- powered shopping assistant it launched this year - for information such as whether a specific coffee maker is easy to clean, or what recommendations it has for a lawn game for a child's birthday party.",
      "And Rufus, which is available for holiday shoppers in the U.S. and some other countries, is not the only shopping assistant out there. A select number of Walmart shoppers will have access this year to a similar chatbot the nation's largest retailer is testing in a few product categories, including toys and electronics.",
      "Perplexity AI added something new to the AI chat-shopping world last month by rolling out a feature on its AI-powered search engine that enables users to ask a question like \u201cWhat's the best women's leather boots?\" and then receive specific product results that the San Francisco-based company says are not sponsored.",
      "\u201cIt has been adopted at pretty incredible scale,\u201d Mike Mallazzo, an analyst and writer at retail research media company Future Commerce, said.",
      "Retailers with websites and e-commerce companies started paying more attention to chatbots when use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence text chatbot made by the company OpenAI, went mainstream in late 2022, sparking public and business interest in the generative AI technology that powers the tool.",
      "Victoria\u2019s Secret, IKEA, Instacart and the Canadian retailer Ssense are among other companies experimenting with chatbots, some of which use technology from OpenAI.",
      "Even before the improved chatbots, online retailers were creating product recommendations based on a customer's prior purchases or search history. Amazon was at the forefront of having recommendations on its platform, so Rufus' ability to provide some is not particularly groundbreaking.",
      "But Rajiv Mehta, the vice president of search and conversational shopping at Amazon, said the company is able to offer more helpful recommendations now by programming Rufus to ask clarifying or follow-up questions. Customers are also using Rufus to look for deals, some of which are personalized, Mehta said.",
      "To be sure, chatbots are prone to hallucinations, so Rufus and most of the tools like it can get things wrong.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, wrote in a November blog post that his firm tested Rufus by requesting gaming TV recommendations. The chatbot's response included products that were not TVs. When asked for the least expensive options, Rufus came back with suggestions that weren't the cheapest, Kaziukenas said.",
      "An Associated Press reporter recently asked Rufus to give some gift recommendations for a brother. The chatbot quickly spit out a few ideas for \u201cthoughtful gifts,\" ranging from a T-shirt and a keychain with charms to a bolder suggestion: a multifunctional knife engraved with the phrase \u201cBEST BROTHER EVER.\u201d",
      "After a 5-minute written conversation, Rufus offered more tailored suggestions - a few Barcelona soccer jerseys sold by third-party sellers. But it wasn\u2019t able to say which seller offered the lowest price. When asked during another search for a price comparison on a popular skin serum, Rufus showed the product's pre-discounted price instead of its present one.",
      "\u201cRufus is constantly learning,\u201d Amazon's Mehta said during an interview.",
      "Shop AI, a chatbot that Canadian e-commerce company Shopify launched last year, can also help shoppers discover new products by asking its own questions, such as soliciting details about an intended gift recipient or features the buyer wants to avoid. Shop AI has trouble, however, recommending specific products or identifying the lowest-priced item in a product category.",
      "The limitations show the technology is still in its infancy and has a long way to go before it becomes as useful as the retail industry - and many shoppers - wish it could be.",
      "To truly transform the shopping experience, shopping assistants will \u201cneed to be deeply personalized\u201d and be able - on their own - to remember a customer\u2019s order history, product preferences and purchasing habits, consulting giant McKinsey & Company said in an August report.",
      "Amazon has noted that Rufus' answers are based on information contained in product listings, community Q&As and customer reviews, which would include the fake reviews that are used to boost or diminish sales for products on its marketplace.",
      "The large language model that powers the chatbot was also trained on the company's entire catalog and some public information on the web, Trishul Chilimbi, an Amazon vice president who oversees AI research, wrote in the electrical engineering magazine IEEE Spectrum in October.",
      "But its unclear how Amazon and other companies are weighting different training components - such as reviews - in their recommendations, or how exactly the shopping assistants come up with them, according to Nicole Greene, an analyst at management consulting firm Gartner.",
      "Perplexity AI's new shopping feature allows users to enter search queries such as \u201cbest phone case\" and to receive answers derived from various sources, including Amazon and other retailers, such as Best Buy. Perplexity also invited retailers to share data about their products and said those that do would have an increased chance of having their items recommended to shoppers.",
      "But Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, suggested in a recent interview with Fortune magazine that he didn't know how the new shopping feature recommended products to customers. But in an interview with the AP, Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko pushed back on that characterization, saying Srinivas' comment \u201cwas probably taken out of context.\u201d",
      "The context, he said, is that with generative AI technology \u201cYou can\u2019t know in advance exactly what the output will be just based off of knowing what the inputs\u201d are from the training materials.",
      "Shevelenko said retailers and brands need to know they can't have their products recommended in Perplexity's search engine because they're \u201cjamming key words\u201d into their websites or using different techniques to show up better on search results",
      "\u201cThe way you show up in an answer is by having a better product and better features,\u201d he said.",

      "Consumers in the United States are scouring the internet for online deals as they look to take advantage of the post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon with Cyber Monday.",
      "Even though e-commerce is now part and parcel of many people's regular routines and the holiday shopping season, Cyber Monday \u2014 a term coined in 2005 by the National Retail Federation \u2014 has become the biggest online shopping day of the year, thanks to the deals and the hype the industry has created to fuel it.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That would make it the season's \u2014 and the year's \u2014 biggest \u2014 shopping day for e-commerce.",
      "Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday night, per Adobe \u2014 reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent every minute.",
      "For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales event right after midnight Pacific time on Saturday. Target's two days of discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday. Walmart rolled out its Cyber Monday offers for Walmart+ members on Sunday afternoon and opened it up to all customers three hours later, at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "Consumer spending for Cyber Week \u2014 the five major shopping days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday \u2014 provides a strong indication of how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays.",
      "Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a healthy pace.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",
      "Many economist have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing to automobiles.",
      "The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5% to 3.5% \u2014 compared to 3.9% in 2023.",
      "A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season won\u2019t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period. But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging signs for retailers.",
      "Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that discounts from Thanksgiving onward have \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d \u2014 and online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40 billion mark combined.",
      "U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2% increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That's also more than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1\u202fbillion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said.",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double-digits while in-store purchase rose a modest 0.7%.",
      "E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $4.6 million per minute \u2014 with top categories by volume including clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to Adobe. \u201cHot products\u201d included Lego sets, espresso machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care.",
      "Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the comfort of their homes.",
      "RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the Midwest.",
      "Sensormatic Solutions, which also tracks store traffic, said its preliminary analysis showed retail store traffic on Black Friday was down 8.2% compared to 2023.",
      "Grant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic Solutions, noted that in-store traffic was getting spread across multiple days since many retailers offered generous discounts before and after Black Friday.",
      "\u201cSome of the extended Black Friday promotions really ended up leading to a little bit of a softer day-of traffic than expected,\u201d Gustafson said.",
      "While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more \u201cexperience-driven spending\u201d in recent years, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic waned.",
      "Jie Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business, told The Associated Press ahead of the post-Thanksgiving shopping weekend that he expected shoppers to \u201cindulge themselves a bit more\u201d when it comes to \u201cself-gifting,\u201d increasing interest in categories like self care.",
      "Adobe notes that shoppers are also buying higher-ticket items this season \u2014 with consumers opening their wallets to invest or \u201ctrade up\u201d to more premium versions of products like electronics, appliances and sporting goods.",
      "Brie Carere, executive vice president and chief customer officer at FedEx, cited strong shipping volume for Thanksgiving weekend, and CyberMonday has had a good start. She anticipated that FedEx\u2019s shipping volume on the online shopping holiday will be slightly up over the 19 million items shipped a year ago on the holiday.",
      "But she said the truncated season \u2014 there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day \u2014 is making it harder for her retail customers to forecast.",
      "In fact, Carere said only four of FedEx\u2019s top 20 holiday e-commerce customers got their shipping predictions correct for the week before the Thanksgiving weekend. And she also noted that while FedEx predicts low single-digit percentage growth in shipping volume each day, she thinks that many retail customers will see a decline for the overall holiday period because of the truncated season.",
      "\u201cI do think that we\u2019re going to see some retailers be disappointed in their volume numbers,\u201d she said.",
      "Carere also doesn\u2019t anticipate much of a lull in shipping between Thanksgiving weekend and last two weeks before Christmas because of the shorter season.",
      "Jim Katsafanas, president of U.S. Small Business Sales, UPS, agreed, noting last week \u201cwe are going to see a pretty consistent surge of volume right through the end. \u201d",

    "story": [
      "As temperatures drop into the teens, Minnesotans have embraced sauna culture for warmth and community",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- As another frigid winter settles over Minnesota with temperatures dipping into the teens, people like Ed Kranz are embracing the cold \u2014 and working up quite a sweat.",
      "Kranz and his wife, Colleen, are among Minnesotans who believe the best way to endure winter is to heat up in saunas and then cool off in their state's icy weather.",
      "On a bone-chilling Sunday morning, they set up a mobile wood-fired sauna from their business, Saunable, near a frozen lake in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan. After about 10 minutes of sweating in the 185 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius) sauna they moseyed outside into the 15-degree temperatures, lingering around a fire in bathing suits before repeating the process three or four more times. One brave soul dipped into a hole in the frozen lake for a post-sauna cold plunge.",
      "Their hot-and-cold venture is common in Minnesota, where plenty of residents embrace sauna culture for warmth and community. Devotees say they are mingling Old World traditions with newfangled internet-based communities, and making social connections in a society that can feel isolating.",
      "Sauna and cold plunges go together like peanut butter and jelly, said Glenn Auerbach, a self-described sauna evangelist and the founder and editor of SaunaTimes. Auerbach started the website in 2008 to share his thoughts, research and conversations with movers and shakers in the sauna world. He and his interlocutors mull over the nitty-gritty of sauna construction, how to cultivate \u201cgood sauna vibes\u201d and the potential health benefits of the sauna lifestyle.",
      "A typical temperature to achieve the holy trinity of the sauna experience \u2014 heat, steam and ventilation \u2014 is about 180 to 200 degrees F (82-93 degrees C), a temperature that starkly contrasts Minnesota's frigid winter weather.",
      "The craftiest in the sauna community can build a facility for about $10,000, according to Auerbach. Those looking to skip the physical labor can outsource the construction. Sauna's popularity, which enthusiasts say spiked following the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought with it a rise in manufacturers selling saunas for about $30,000 to $40,000.",
      "While sauna's cultural cache may have increased in recent years, the practice long predates the Instagrammable spaces now popping up, Auerbach said.",
      "The smell of cedar wood has been lodged in Justin Juntunen's memory ever since he first stepped into his family's sauna as a child. Juntunen, the founder of Cedar and Stone Nordic Sauna, is a descendant of Finnish immigrants who came to America in the 1880s. They brought with them an appreciation for saunas and the communal values the steam-filled rooms impart to local life.",
      "People in Finland say there are more saunas than cars, Juntunen said. When immigrants like his grandfather came to Minnesota to work in the mines, mills or docks, they would often save up to build a farmhouse. But they would build a sauna first, living in the space while the house was constructed. Later, saunas would serve as informal town centers.",
      "People gossiped in saunas, they gave birth in saunas and they died in saunas, Juntunen said. The public nature of the facilities reflects the egalitarian ethos that infuses Nordic culture, and sauna culture by extension, he added.",
      "\u201cThis is a tradition that\u2019s actually for everyone,\u201d Juntunen said. \u201cMy favorite Nordic proverb is all people are created equal, but nowhere more so than in the sauna.\"",
      "In addition to a desire for in-person experiences following the COVID-19 pandemic, sauna enthusiasts say interest rose after some of the internet\u2019s most famous figures, such as podcasters Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman, touted it.",
      "\u201cEvery big podcaster in the world discovered that you could jump in cold water and it feels kind of good. And then people click on it online,\u201d Juntunen said.",
      "In this way, technology has been a paradox for sauna culture, he added. Digital media helped sauna culture grow at the same time as saunas were billed as reprieves from the pervasive reach of technology over every facet of daily life.",
      "Either way, almost all of sauna culture's adherents say its rise is inextricably linked to a desire for community.",
      "Those who committed to building their own saunas have hosted friends, neighbors, and former high school hockey teammates over. This has created a new form of post-COVID-19 contagiousness: \u201cGood heat is contagious,\u201d Auerbach said.",
      "This core function of sauna culture spans generations. Juntunen's grandfather would rush to the sauna after work because it was the space where stories were told.",
      "\"It\u2019s a space where storytelling happens, where connection happens or silence happens,\" Juntunen said. \u201cI think that is a really beautiful example of what a sauna truly is.\u201d"

      "Super Micro is also searching for a new chief financial officer and appointing other executives per recommendations from the committee, which began its review several months ago \u2014 after EY communicated concerns over issues like transparency, internal control related to financial reporting and integrity of management while conducting its first audit for the company.",
      "Additional information that emerged during this review eventually led EY to resign as Super Micro's public accountant in October. Super Micro, which disagreed with EY's decision, later appointed BDO as its new independent auditor last month.",

But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how extraordinary it is,\u201d said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. \u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Van Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature -- which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July \u2014 is the first ever to take place.",
      "None has ever been seen alive at sea.",

All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don\u2019t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don\u2019t know how this one died.",
      "Over the next week, researchers studying the 5-meter (16-foot) -long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin hope to find out.",
      "\u201cThere may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,\u201d said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. \u201cWho knows what we\u2019ll discover?\u201d",
      "Only six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification.",
      "New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.",
      "DNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species \u2014 and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn\u2019t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before.",
      "On Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks \u2014 normal, they said, and not the cause.",
      "The dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with M\u0101ori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.",
      "Members of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -\u2013 a prayer -\u2013 over the creature before the study begins.",
      "\u201cAccording to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,\u201d said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.\u201d",
      "The iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale\u2019s head this week.",
      "\u201cIt all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "It\u2019s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean's deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery.",
      "The assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery.",
      "\u201cWhat we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,\u201d said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \u201cIn discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.\u201d"

      "Closing arguments will begin Monday in the trial of a tech consultant in the stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco last year",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Closing arguments will begin on Monday in the trial of a tech consultant in the 2023 stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco, an event that shocked the broader tech community whose members mourned the loss of an entrepreneur they called charismatic and kind.",
      "San Francisco prosecutors say Nima Momeni stabbed Lee three times after a dispute over his treatment toward Momeni's sister, Khazar Momeni, with whom Lee was friends.",
      "Defense attorneys say Lee, 43, was on a multi-day drug bender of cocaine and ketamine that made him agitated and violent, forcing Momeni to use his Krav Maga martial arts skills to fend off the paring knife Lee brandished in the early morning hours of April 4, 2023 after a \u201c bad joke.\u201d",
      "Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "The trial, which began Oct. 14, has been emotionally taxing for family members of both men. Mahnaz Tayarani, mother of the defendant, has sat on one side of the court room while Lee's father, brother and ex-wife sat on the other.",
      "Surveillance video of Bob joking around on his final night and autopsy photos of his wounds have been difficult to view, said Lee's brother, Timothy Oliver Lee. He dismissed Momeni's explanation of events as a fabrication.",
      "\"Even if he was under the influence, he was still Bob. He was never aggressive. He was always a teddy bear and always a great guy,\u201d he said.",
      "Surveillance video shows the two men leaving the posh condo of Khazar Momeni around 2 a.m. and getting into Momeni's BMW. Other surveillance then shows them getting out of the car in an isolated section of the city by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Momeni testified he stopped his car after going over a pothole that caused Lee to spill the beer he was holding. Momeni said he then cracked a joke suggesting Lee should spend his last night visiting the city with family instead of trying to find a strip club to keep the party going.",
      "That's when Lee suddenly pulled a knife, Momeni said. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "\u201cI was scared for my life,\" Momeni said in testimony that was at times rambling and contentious. \"I had to defend myself.\u201d",
      "Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m., dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Prosecutors say Momeni was furious with Lee after he introduced Khazar to a drug dealer who gave her GHB, known as a date-rape drug, hours before the stabbing. They say Momeni grilled Lee earlier in the evening about what might have happened to his sister at the drug dealer\u2019s apartment.",
      "Jurors were allowed to ask questions and, through San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alexandra Gordon, asked why Momeni did not call police, either after Lee's knife attack or after Momeni realized Lee had been stabbed to death.",
      "A knife recovered from the area where Lee was stabbed showed Momeni\u2019s DNA on the handle, but the defense said the handle should have been tested for Lee\u2019s fingerprints.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to his generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died."

      "Struggling chipmaker Intel says in a surprise announcement that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired",
      "Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, the struggling chipmaker said Monday in a surprise announcement.",
      "Two company executives, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, will act as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a replacement for Gelsinger, who also stepped down from the company's board.",
      "The departure of Gelsinger, whose career spanned more than 40 years, underscores the turmoil at Intel. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Gelsinger started at Intel in 1979 and was its first chief technology officer. He returned to the company as chief executive in 2021.",
      "Gelsinger said his exit was \u201cbittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.\u201d",
      "Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer at Intel. Holthaus was appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, which includes the client computing, data center and AI groups.",
      "Frank Yeary, independent chair of Intel's board, will become interim executive chair.",
      "\u201cPat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021,\u201d Yeary said in a statement. \"As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.\u201d",
      "Gelsinger's departure comes as Intel\u2019s financial woes have been piling up. The company posted a $16.6 billion loss and halted its dividend in the most recent quarter, and its shares have fallen by about 60% since he took over as CEO. Gelsinger announced plans in August to slash 15% of its huge workforce \u2014 or about 15,000 jobs \u2014 as part of cost-cutting efforts to to save $10 billion in 2025.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s ascendance, meanwhile, was cemented earlier this month when it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",
      "Unlike some of rivals, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them. Under Gelsinger, the company has been working to build up its foundry business making semiconductors in the U.S. designed by other firms, in a bid to compete with rivals such as market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or TSMC.",
      "Intel has benefited from tens of billions of dollars that the administration has pledged to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness.",
      "After taking over as CEO, Gelsinger unveiled plans to build a $20 billion chipmaking facility in central Ohio, and poured billions more into expanding in Europe, where leaders were also worried about dependence on Asia.",
      "The Biden administration had said it would give Intel up to $8.5 billion in federal funding for semiconductor plants around the country, but last week it trimmed that amount, according to three people familiar with the grant who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Shares of the Santa Clara, California, company, were up less than 1% in afternoon trading after being up more than 5% earlier in the day.",

    "summary": "Positioned along the seismically active Ring of Fire, Indonesia and the Philippines have the second and third highest installed geothermal energy capacity in the world, after the United States",
    "story": [
      "Positioned along the seismically active Ring of Fire, Indonesia and the Philippines have the second and third highest installed geothermal energy capacity in the world, after the United States",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Providing round-the-clock energy, using minimal space and considered a clean source of power \u2014 geothermal energy seems like an ideal option for countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, where the potential is high, and governments are seeking to transition away from highly polluting fossil fuels.",
      "Yet most of the potential of geothermal energy, created by harnessing heat produced by the earth from underground reservoirs of hot water to power turbines that generate electricity, remains untapped in these countries and across the world \u2014 as financial, regulatory and community roadblocks have stalled growth.",
      "More readily available financing and domestic regulatory changes are starting to address these barriers, but experts say more should be done to unlock the vast clean energy source trapped just beneath the Earth\u2019s surface.",
      "Countries with high geothermal potential \u2014 such as the United States, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 are usually located close to tectonically active regions where hot water or steam is naturally carried to the Earth\u2019s surface through volcanic activity, or can be accessed by shallow drilling.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re essentially standing on our own sun, which we can get clean, reliable energy from,\u201d said Marit Brommer, CEO of the International Geothermal Association based in Germany.",
      "Experts also laud geothermal plants for their ability to operate continuously to meet the minimum level of power demanded around-the-clock, unaffected by weather, with long lifespans and minimal maintenance.",
      "As countries shift towards renewable and cleaner energy, geothermal use is expected to grow: In Southeast Asia, geothermal power generation is expected to increase tenfold from 2020 to 2050, reaching 276 million megawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "With their steaming volcanoes and bubbling lakes, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 two archipelagic Southeast Asian countries located on the seismically active \u201cRing of Fire\u201d \u2014 are the second and third-largest users of geothermal energy in the world, with some of the highest geothermal energy potential. The U.S. is number one.",
      "Yet Indonesia uses less a tenth of its gargantuan reserves, making up 6% of its power supply. In the Philippines, about 8% of geothermal capacity has been developed, constituting 14.6% of the country's energy use, the country's largest source of renewable energy.",
      "Both countries plan to expand use of geothermal energy as they transition away from fossil fuels: Indonesia aims to increase the share of geothermal power generation by at least 8% by 2030, making it the second-largest renewable energy source after hydropower. The Philippine government is targeting several projects to boost geothermal capacity by adding nearly 1.5 gigawatts, nearly doubling its current use.",
      "But the exploratory stage of geothermal development \u2014 when companies do tests and drilling to confirm the size, temperature, pressure, and potential production rates of sites \u2014 is expensive and risky. That makes it hard to attract finance for development, said Shigeru Yamamura, an energy specialist at the Asia Development Bank.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most difficult part of developers, because (financially) they cannot take 100% of the exploration risk themselves,\u201d Yamamura told The Associated Press.",
      "Climate finance for geothermal development is limited for most Southeast Asian nations, accounting for only 9% of finance available for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \u2014 a political and economic bloc of ten states in the region, which includes Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "A 2024 ASEAN energy report said \u201cblended finance\u201d using both public and private sources, grants and green bonds could help bridge the gap.",
      "The Philippine government has announced green energy auction schemes for geothermal energy and is preparing a \u201csmart green grid plan\u201d that prioritizes renewable energy \u2014 vital to enable private developers to get financing from banks. This signals progress in policy support for investment, Yamamura said.",
      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has focused on geothermal as part of the country's energy transition. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources says it's working to shorten permitting times and considering ways to increase rates of return on investments in geothermal projects. The state electric utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, also said it's committed to ramping up geothermal energy development.",
      "The World Bank is providing a $150 million loan to scale up Indonesian investments in geothermal energy by reducing the risks of early-stage exploration. The Green Climate Fund and the Clean Technology Fund are providing a $127.5 million.",
      "Even when finance is secured, community pushback can slow development.",
      "In Indonesia, residents of villages have protested projects, citing safety and environmental concerns: Several geothermal sites in Indonesia have had deadly gas leaks in the past five years.",
      "Some Indonesian communities don't understand what geothermal energy is and how they could benefit from its development, said Timothy Ravis, a doctoral student in global development at Cornell University.",
      "Protests at geothermal sites in the Philippines have led at least one company to pay royalties to Indigenous groups worried about land degradation caused by geothermal development.",
      "Governments and businesses should work to gain the consent of communities near projects to help ensure they succeed, said Brommer.",
      "\u201cWe need to show that this development benefits all people, not just a company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's not about being a good neighbor, it's about being the best neighbor and really working with communities to respect their concerns.\"",

      "Ultra low-cost online retailers Temu and Shein are giving Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season",
      "Shopping on Temu can feel like playing an arcade game. Instead of using a joystick-controlled claw to grab a toy, visitors to the online marketplace maneuver their computer mouses or cellphone screens to browse colorful gadgets, accessories and trinkets with prices that look too good to refuse.",
      "A pop-up spinning wheel offers the chance to win a coupon. Rotating captions warn that a less than $2 camouflage print balaclava and a $1.23 skeleton hand back scratcher are \u201cAlmost sold out.\u201d A flame symbol indicates a $9.69 plush cat print hoodie is selling fast. A timed-down selection of discounted items adds to the sense of urgency.",
      "Welcome to the new online world of impulse buying, a place of guilty pleasures where the selection is vast, every day is Cyber Monday, and an instant dopamine hit that will have faded by the time your package arrives is always just a click away.",
      "By all accounts, we\u2019re living in an accelerating age for consumerism, one that Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, its fierce rival, supercharged with social media savvy and an interminable assortment of cheap goods, most shipped directly from merchants in China based on real-time demand.",
      "The business models of the two platforms, coupled with avalanches of digital or influencer advertising, have enabled them to give Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season.",
      "Software company Salesforce said it expects roughly one in five online purchases in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada to be made through four online marketplaces based or founded in Asia: Shein, Temu, TikTok Shop - the e-commerce arm of video-sharing platform TikTok - and AliExpress.",
      "Analysts with Salesforce said they are expected to pull in roughly $160 billion in global sales outside of China. Most of the sales will go to Temu and Shein, a privately held company which is thought to lead the worldwide fast fashion market in revenue.",
      "Lisa Xiaoli Neville, a nonprofit manager who lives in Los Angeles, is sold on Shein. The bedroom of her home is stocked with jeans, shoes, press-on nails and other items from the ultra-fast fashion retailer, all of which she amassed after getting on the platform to purchase a $2 pair of earrings she saw in a Facebook ad.",
      "Neville, 46, estimates she spends at least $75 a month on products from Shein. A $2 eggshell opener, a portable apple peeler and an apple corer - both costing less than $5 - are among the quirky, single-use kitchen tools taking up drawer space. She acknowledges she doesn\u2019t need them because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t even cook like that.\u201d Plus, she\u2019s allergic to apples.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t eat apples. It will kill me,\u201d Neville said, laughing. \u201cBut I still want the coring thing.\u201d",
      "Shein, now based in Singapore, uses some of the same web design features as Temu\u2019s, such as pop-up coupons and ads, to persuade shoppers to keep clicking, but it appears a bit more restrained in its approach.",
      "Shein primarily targets young women through partnerships with social media influencers. Searching the company's name on video platforms turns up creators promoting Shein's Black Friday sales event and displaying the dozens of of trendy clothes and accessories they got for comparatively little money.",
      "But the Shein-focused content also includes videos of TikTokers saying they're embarrassed to admit they shopped there and critics lashing out at fans for not taking into account the environmental harms or potential labor abuses associated with products that are churned out and shipped worldwide at a speedy pace.",
      "Neville has already picked out holiday gifts for family and friends from the site. Most of the products in her online cart cost under $10, including graphic T-shirts she intends to buy for her son and jeans and loafers for her daughter. All told, she plans to spend about $200 on gifts, significantly less than $500 she used to shell out at other stores in prior years.",
      "\u201cThe visuals just make you want to spend more money,\u201d she said, referring to the clothes on Shein's site. \u201cThey're very cheap and everything is just so cute.\u201d",
      "Unlike Shein, Temu's appeal cuts across age groups and gender. The platform is the world\u2019s second most-visited online shopping site, software company Similarweb reported in September. Customers go there looking for practical items like doormats and silly products like a whiskey flask shaped like a vintage cellphone from the 1990s.",
      "Temu advertised Black Friday bargains for some items at upwards of 70% off the recommended retail price. Making a purchase can quickly result in receiving dozens of emails offering free giveaways. The caveat: customers have to buy more products.",
      "Ellen Flowers, 36, a lifestyle blogger who lives in Dallas, recently decided to pair a $3,500 dining table with $25 dining chairs from Temu to save money. She's also purchased clothes from Temu. The quality or fit wasn't always always great, so Flowers donated some unwanted pieces to thrift stores to avoid paying return shipping fees that would cost almost as much as the clothes.",
      "Flowers planned to buy stocking stuffers on Temu as well as baubles for an ornament-swapping party in early December. She also wanted to buy necklaces and bracelets for an activity at her 5-year-old niece's upcoming birthday party.",
      "\u201cI love buying my nieces presents,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cSince they\u2019re young, they don\u2019t need the Louis Vuitton handbag. I can give them a cute handbag from Temu. Then they\u2019ll lose interest in a month and I\u2019ll buy them another one.\u201d",
      "Despite their rise, Temu and Shein have proven particularly ripe for pushback. Last year, a coalition of unnamed brands and organizations launched a campaign to oppose Shein in Washington. U.S. lawmakers also have raised the possibility that Temu is allowing goods made with forced labor to enter the country.",
      "More recently, the Biden administration put forward rules that would crack down on a trade rule known as the de minimis exception, which has allowed a lot of cheap products to come into the U.S. duty-free. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to slap high tariffs on goods from China, a move that would likely raise prices and across the retail world.",
      "Both Shein and Temu have set up warehouses in the U.S. to speed up delivery times and help them better compete with Amazon, which is trying to erode their price advantage through a new storefront that also ships products directly from China.",
      "Meanwhile, Temu is onboarding Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that would allow the company to not be as exposed to changes around the de minimus trade rule, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse.",
      "The change comes as both Shein and Temu are attempting to expand beyond the bargain-hungry shoppers who popularized their platforms. Temu is allowing sellers to ship products to customers from local U.S. warehouses and says the move will allow it to sell larger items like furniture as it expands its selection of big-ticket items.",
      "Meanwhile, American children's clothing retailer The Children\u2019s Place signed a deal last month to distribute its products through Shein\u2019s platform. Last year, Shein went into business with women's fashion retailer Forever 21. It has been working to recruit other brands and reportedly has hopes of getting listed on the London Stock Exchange."

    "published": "Sat, 30 Nov 2024 15:38:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The U.S. Navy is making progress in deploying its first shipborne hypersonic weapon",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Navy is making progress in deploying its first shipborne hypersonic weapon",
      "The U.S. Navy is transforming a costly flub into a potent weapon with the first shipborne hypersonic weapon, which is being retrofitted aboard the first of its three stealthy destroyers.",
      "The USS Zumwalt is at a Mississippi shipyard where workers have installed missile tubes that replace twin turrets from a gun system that was never activated because it was too expensive. Once the system is complete, the Zumwalt will provide a platform for conducting fast, precision strikes from greater distances, adding to the usefulness of the warship.",
      "\u201cIt was a costly blunder. But the Navy could take victory from the jaws of defeat here, and get some utility out of them by making them into a hypersonic platform,\u201d said Bryan Clark, a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute.",
      "The U.S. has had several types of hypersonic weapons in development for the past two decades, but recent tests by both Russia and China have added pressure to the U.S. military to hasten their production.",
      "Hypersonic weapons travel beyond Mach 5, five times the speed of sound, with added maneuverability making them harder to shoot down.",
      "Last year, The Washington Post reported that among the documents leaked by former Massachusetts Air National Guard member Jack Teixeira was a defense department briefing that confirmed China had recently tested an intermediate-range hypersonic weapon called the DF-27. While the Pentagon had previously acknowledged the weapon's development, it had not recognized its testing.",
      "One of the U.S. programs in development and planned for the Zumwalt is the \u201cConventional Prompt Strike.\" It would launch like a ballistic missile and then release a hypersonic glide vehicle that would travel at speeds seven to eight times faster than the speed of sound before hitting the target. The weapon system is being developed jointly by the Navy and Army. Each of the Zumwalt-class destroyers would be equipped with four missile tubes, each with three of the missiles for a total of 12 hypersonic weapons per ship.",
      "In choosing the Zumwalt, the Navy is attempting to add to the usefulness of a $7.5 billion warship that is considered by critics to be an expensive mistake despite serving as a test platform for multiple innovations.",
      "The Zumwalt was envisioned as providing land-attack capability with an Advanced Gun System with rocket-assisted projectiles to open the way for Marines to charge ashore. But the system featuring 155 mm guns hidden in stealthy turrets was canceled because each of the rocket-assisted projectiles cost between $800,000 and $1 million.",
      "Despite the stain on its reputation, the three Zumwalt-class destroyers remain the Navy\u2019s most advanced surface warship in terms of new technologies. Those innovations include electric propulsion, an angular shape to minimize radar signature, an unconventional wave-piercing hull, automated fire and damage control and a composite deckhouse that hides radar and other sensors.",
      "The Zumwalt arrived at the Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi, in August 2023 and was removed from the water for the complex work of integrating the new weapon system. It is due to be undocked this week in preparation for the next round of tests and its return to the fleet, shipyard spokeswoman Kimberly Aguillard said.",
      "A U.S. hypersonic weapon was successfully tested over the summer and development of the missiles is continuing. The Navy wants to begin testing the system aboard the Zumwalt in 2027 or 2028, according to the Navy.",
      "The U.S. weapon system will come at a steep price. It would cost nearly $18 billion to buy 300 of the weapons and maintain them over 20 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "Critics say there is too little bang for the buck.",
      "\u201cThis particular missile costs more than a dozen tanks. All it gets you is a precise non-nuclear explosion, some place far far away. Is it really worth the money? The answer is most of the time the missile costs much more than any target you can destroy with it,\u201d said Loren Thompson, a longtime military analyst in Washington, D.C.",
      "But they provide the capability for Navy vessels to strike an enemy from a distance of thousands of kilometers \u2014 outside the range of most enemy weapons \u2014 and there is no effective defense against them, said retired Navy Rear Adm. Ray Spicer, CEO of the U.S. Naval Institute, an independent forum focusing on national security issues, and former commander of an aircraft carrier strike force.",
      "Conventional missiles that cost less aren\u2019t much of a bargain if they are unable to reach their targets, Spicer said, adding the U.S. military really has no choice but to pursue them.",
      "\u201cThe adversary has them. We never want to be outdone,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.S. is accelerating development because hypersonics have been identified as vital to U.S. national security with \u201csurvivable and lethal capabilities,\u201d said James Weber, principal director for hypersonics in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Critical Technologies.",
      "\u201cFielding new capabilities that are based on hypersonic technologies is a priority for the defense department to sustain and strengthen our integrated deterrence, and to build enduring advantages,\u201d he said."

      "Members of Parliament approved the assisted dying bill by a 330-275 vote, signaling their approval in principle for the bill, which will undergo further scrutiny before it goes to a final vote.",
      "Friday's vote came after hours of debate \u2014 emotional at times \u2014 that touched on issues of ethics, faith and law. There was no braying and shouting that often marks debates in the House of Commons and speeches were considered respectfully and heard in silence.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be clear, we\u2019re not talking about a choice between life or death, we are talking about giving dying people a choice about how to die,\u201d the bill\u2019s main sponsor, Kim Leadbeater, said as she presented the bill to a packed chamber.",
      "Supporters said the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent suffering, while protecting the vulnerable.",
      "Opponents said the disabled and elderly were at risk of being coerced, directly or indirectly, to end their lives to save money or relieve the burden on family members. Others called for the improvement of palliative care to ease suffering as an alternative.",
      "The proposed bill would allow adults over the age of 18 who are expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided help to end their life, subject to several safeguards.",
      "They would have to be capable of taking the fatal drugs themselves, and two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision. The bill will not apply to Scotland or Northern Ireland.",
      "Backers of the bill told heart-wrenching stories about constituents and family members who suffered in the final months of their lives and dying people who committed suicide in secret because it is currently a crime for anyone to provide assistance.",
      "Danny Kruger, who led the argument against the bill, cautioned lawmakers not to back a \u201cstate suicide service.\" He argued that no amount of safeguards will stop many vulnerable people feeling the pressure to make a request to end their lives.",
      "Kruger voiced his disappointment at the outcome but said there's a chance lawmakers will reject the bill when it comes back for a vote in the next few months. Some of those voting in favor said they only did so to examine the details further and could potentially vote against it in the future.",
      "\u201cI still think we can stop it,\u201d he said.",
      "Although the bill was proposed by Leadbeater, a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it was an open vote with alliances formed across the political divide.",
      "The government is widely expected to come up in the next few months with assessments on how assisted dying will be funded and how it would impact the U.K.'s state-funded National Health Service, hospice care and the legal system.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer did not show his hand ahead of the vote, but backed the change. Others in his Cabinet, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood, voted against. There were similar divisions across other political parties.",
      "Long-time British campaigner Esther Rantzen, who is terminally ill with lung cancer and played a leading role in advocating the need for a vote on assisted dying, voiced her joy at the \u201cwonderful\u201d outcome and said it will give people an \u201cequal choice.\u201d",
      "When diagnosed with her terminal illness, Rantzen said she would travel to Switzerland to bring an end to her life, where the law allows assisted dying for non-residents.",
      "Hundreds of people on both sides of the issue gathered outside Parliament on a cold but bright day as the debate continued for nearly five hours.",
      "Opponents held signs saying, \u201cKill the bill, not the ill,\u201d and, referring to the National Health Service, \u201cNHS It's cradle to grave. Not 'til old, inconvenient or expensive!\u201d",
      "The group Dignity in Dying, many wearing pink winter hats, led supporters as they clutched signs saying \u201cGiving me choice over my death,\u201d and \u201cYou can't cure death. Please make it fear free.\u201d",
      "Backers of the measure erupted in cheers when the result was announced and hugged each other.",

      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",

      "Wayne Holdsworth became an advocate for banning Australian children younger than 16 from social media because his son took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Wayne Holdsworth became an advocate for banning Australian children younger than 16 from social media because his son took his own life after falling victim to an online sextortion scam.",
      "Mac Holdsworth died last year at his Melbourne family home at the age of 17 after a 47-year-old Sydney man who purported to be an 18-year-old woman demanded money for an intimate image the boy had shared.",
      "Since then, the grieving father has taken his tragic story to around 20 schools to warn students of the risks of social media.",
      "\u201cI saw firsthand the damage that social media could do. I saw Mac, my son, get sexually extorted on social media,\u201d Holdsworth said. \u201cHis mental health deteriorated at a rapid rate.\u201d",
      "Online predators began approaching the teenager before his 16th birthday and his father believes such a ban could have saved his life.",
      "Australia's House of Representatives on Wednesday voted for such a ban and the Senate is expected to make it law soon.",
      "Holdsworth said most of the 3,000 students he\u2019s spoken to, from age 12 to 17, agree with a ban on children under the age of 16.",
      "\u201cThey come up to me and they say, \u2018I\u2019m so glad that this is going to be implemented,\u2019\u201d Holdsworth said. \u201cEven the kids see it now that they\u2019re going to be protected from those predators outside that are preying on them.\u201d",
      "He said three girls approached him after a school address on Monday to tell him that they were being subjected to sextortion. One had already handed over 2,500 Australian dollars ($1,600) of her parents\u2019 money to a blackmailer.",
      "Holdsworth said he was the first adult they had confided in.",
      "\u201cThe parent won\u2019t know until the credit card statement comes out,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s prevalent. It happened last night and it\u2019ll happen tonight,\u201d he added.",
      "Holdsworth described the government plan to ban children younger than 16 from social media as \u201cabsolutely essential for the safety of our children.\u201d",
      "But not all parents are convinced that banning young children from social media is the answer.",
      "Critics say the legislation was rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents\u2019 authority to decide what\u2019s best for their children.",
      "They also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encounter, and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer.",
      "Independent Sydney lawmaker Kylea Tink on Tuesday became the first member of the House of Representatives to speak publicly against the bill, which would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts.",
      "\u201cAs a mom of three young adults ... I\u2019m very aware of the negative impacts of social media and the challenges of parenting in this digital world,\u201d Tink told Parliament. \u201cI also recognize, however, that my children are digital natives and are very literate about how these platforms work. For this reason, I encourage everyone involved in this debate to ensure they are listening to the voices of young Australians when it comes to this decision-making process rather than assuming that the grownups in the room know best.\u201d",
      "Tink was among 13 lawmakers who voted against the bill in the House on Wednesday. They were overwhelmed by 102 legislators who voted for it.",
      "The platforms have urged a Senate committee that examined the legislation on Monday to delay a vote until after a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies is completed next June.",
      "The four-hour committee meeting on Monday attracted 15,000 written submissions.",
      "X Corp. told the committee that billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's platform had \u201cserious concerns as to the lawfulness of the bill,\" including its compatibility with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.",
      "\u201cThere is no evidence that banning young people from social media will work and to make it law in the form proposed is highly problematic,\u201d X said.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the legislation was \u201cinconsistent with what Australian parents have told us that they want, which is a simple and effective way for them to set controls and manage their teens\u2019 online experience.\u201d",
      "Under the bill, parental consent for children to use social media does not override the ban.",
      "Lizzie O\u2019Shea, chair of the Digital Rights Watch charity, which aims to uphold the digital rights of Australians, said she was appalled by the process and limited timeframe the government used to pass such significant and contentious legislation.",
      "She said she was very aware of the serious risks posed by social media platforms, \"but I do not support a ban personally because I understand both the limits of that particular policy and the expert evidence that is coming out from people who work in this space about the problems for young people being excluded from those spaces,\u201d O'Shea said.",
      "Her concerns centered on privacy, negative mental health impacts on excluded children and the possibility that young children would find ways to access social media spaces that would become even less child friendly as a result of the ban.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m profoundly aware of the dangers of large social media platforms running a certain kind of business model that prioritizes data extraction and exploitation of vulnerability over the public interest or the building of community and the protection of democracy,\" she said.",
      "Swinburne University digital media expert Belinda Barnet, who supports the ban, feels she is part of a minority among professionals in the digital field.",

      "TOKYO -- The engine for a new flagship small Japanese rocket burst into flames Tuesday during a combustion test, causing no injury or damage to the outside but destroying the engine and extensively damaging its test facility, officials said.",
      "The second failure in a row raises concern about the progress of the Epsilon S rocket, whose debut flight is expected by March.",
      "The test was conducted inside of the restricted area at Japan\u2019s Tanegashima Space Center in southwestern Japan, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is investigating, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters.",
      "An Epsilon project manager, Takayuki Imoto, told an online press conference from Tanegashina that the explosion occurred 49 seconds into the planned two-minute test, causing fire and scattering broken parts of the engine and damaging the facility.",
      "\u201cWe are very sorry to have failed to live up to expectations,\u201d Imoto said. He said the cause of the explosion was still under investigation. Project staff are trying to recover broken pieces to analyze and determine the cause as soon as possible to minimize the delay of the program, Imoto said.",
      "He said repairs to the test facility would take several months.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s failure comes just over a year after the explosion last year of another Epsilon S engine during a test, according to JAXA.",
      "Last year\u2019s explosion was related to damage to the ignition systems of the engine and JAXA has since taken the necessary steps, the agency has said.",
      "The triple-stage, 27-meter (88-foot) -long Epsilon S rocket is meant to improve Japan\u2019s position in the growing satellite launch market by using solid fuel for more flexibility and mobility.",
      "Japan\u2019s much larger H3 rocket, failed in its debut launch in February 2023 but has since made three consecutive successful flights, most recently earlier in November.",
      "\u201cDevelopment of flagship rockets such as Epsilon S is extremely important from the perspective of ensuring autonomy of Japan\u2019s space development,\u201d Hayashi told reporters. \u201cJAXA will thoroughly investigate and take steps.\u201d"

The petition, a precursor to a potential lawsuit, seeks depositions from corporate representatives of both companies.",

      "Scientists are using used fossilized feces and vomit from Poland to reconstruct how dinosaurs came to dominate the Earth",
      "NEW YORK -- Using fossilized feces and vomit samples from Poland, scientists have reconstructed how dinosaurs came to dominate the Earth millions of years ago.",
      "Researchers aren't sure whether dinosaurs' rise over the course of 30 million years happened because of luck, skill, climate or some combination. But they came away knowing this: \u201cIt was not a sudden thing,\u201d said study co-author Martin Qvarnstr\u00f6m from Uppsala University.",
      "The new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, analyzed hundreds of dino droppings to reconstruct who was eating whom 200 million years ago.",
      "The first dinosaurs were go-getters, Qvarnstr\u00f6m said, eating whatever they could \u2014 including insects, fish and plants.",
      "When climate conditions changed, they were quick to adapt. Plant-eating dinosaurs, for example, ate a greater variety of greens than other vegetarians of the time, so it was easier to expand their palates when wetter conditions gave rise to new plant species.",
      "Since the study\u2019s findings were limited to Polish fossils, Qvarnstr\u00f6m said he\u2019d like to see if their ideas hold steady against fossil records from around the world.",
      "It's not uncommon for scientists to study ancient fecal matter to understand creatures of the past, said Emma Dunne, a paleobiologist at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. But fossilized feces can resemble blobs or chunks of rock, and they are not always found near fossils of the animal that made them \u2014 which makes it hard for scientists to know where they came from.",

      "WASHINGTON -- With artificial intelligence at a pivotal moment of development, the federal government is about to transition from one that prioritized AI safeguards to one more focused on eliminating red tape.",
      "That\u2019s a promising prospect for some investors but creates uncertainty about the future of any guardrails on the technology, especially around the use of AI deepfakes in elections and political campaigns.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to rescind President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping AI executive order, which sought to protect people\u2019s rights and safety without stifling innovation. He hasn\u2019t specified what he would do in its place, but the platform of the Republican National Committee, which he recently reshaped, said AI development should be \u201crooted in Free Speech and Human Flourishing.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s an open question whether Congress, soon to be fully controlled by Republicans, will be interested in passing any AI-related legislation. Interviews with a dozen lawmakers and industry experts reveal there is still interest in boosting the technology\u2019s use in national security and cracking down on non-consensual explicit images.",
      "Yet the use of AI in elections and in spreading misinformation is likely to take a backseat as GOP lawmakers turn away from anything they view as potentially suppressing innovation or free speech.",
      "\u201cAI has incredible potential to enhance human productivity and positively benefit our economy,\u201d said Rep. Jay Obernolte, a California Republican widely seen as a leader in the evolving technology. \u201cWe need to strike an appropriate balance between putting in place the framework to prevent the harmful things from happening while at the same time enabling innovation.\u201d",
      "Artificial intelligence interests have been expecting sweeping federal legislation for years. But Congress, gridlocked on nearly every issue, failed to pass any artificial intelligence bill, instead producing only a series of proposals and reports.",
      "Some lawmakers believe there is enough bipartisan interest around some AI-related issues to get a bill passed.",
      "\u201cI find there are Republicans that are very interested in this topic,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, singling out national security as one area of potential agreement. \"I am confident I will be able to work with them as I have in the past.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s still unclear how much Republicans want the federal government to intervene in AI development. Few showed interest before this year's election in regulating how the Federal Election Commission or the Federal Communications Commission handled AI-generated content, worrying that it would raise First Amendment issues at the same time that Trump\u2019s campaign and other Republicans were using the technology to create political memes.",
      "The FCC was in the middle of a lengthy process for developing AI-related regulations when Trump won the presidency. That work has since been halted under long-established rules covering a change in administrations.",
      "Trump has expressed both interest and skepticism in artificial intelligence.",
      "During a Fox Business interview earlier this year, he called the technology \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and \u201cso scary\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s no real solution.\u201d But his campaign and supporters also embraced AI-generated images more than their Democratic opponents. They often used them in social media posts that weren\u2019t meant to mislead, but rather to further entrench Republican political views.",
      "Elon Musk, Trump's close adviser and a founder of several companies that rely on AI, also has shown a mix of concern and excitement about the technology, depending on how it is applied.",
      "Musk used X, the social media platform he owns, to promote AI-generated images and videos throughout the election. Operatives from Americans for Responsible Innovation, a nonprofit focused on artificial intelligence, have publicly been pushing Trump to tap Musk as his top adviser on the technology.",
      "\u201cWe think that Elon has a pretty sophisticated understating of both the opportunities and risks of advanced AI systems,\u201d said Doug Calidas, a top operative from the group.",
      "But Musk advising Trump on artificial intelligence worries others. Peters argued it could undercut the president.",
      "\u201cIt is a concern,\u201d said the Michigan Democrat. \u201cWhenever you have anybody that has a strong financial interest in a particular technology, you should take their advice and counsel with a grain of salt.\u201d",
      "In the run-up to the election, many AI experts expressed concern about an eleventh-hour deepfake \u2014 a lifelike AI image, video or audio clip \u2014 that would sway or confuse voters as they headed to the polls. While those fears were never realized, AI still played a role in the election, said Vivian Schiller, executive director of Aspen Digital, part of the nonpartisan Aspen Institute think tank.",
      "\u201cI would not use the term that I hear a lot of people using, which is it was the dog that didn\u2019t bark,\u201d she said of AI in the 2024 election. \u201cIt was there, just not in the way that we expected.\u201d",
      "Campaigns used AI in algorithms to target messages to voters. AI-generated memes, though not lifelike enough to be mistaken as real, felt true enough to deepen partisan divisions.",
      "A political consultant mimicked Joe Biden\u2019s voice in robocalls that could have dissuaded voters from coming to the polls during New Hampshire's primary if they hadn\u2019t been caught quickly. And foreign actors used AI tools to create and automate fake online profiles and websites that spread disinformation to a U.S. audience.",
      "Even if AI didn\u2019t ultimately influence the election outcome, the technology made political inroads and contributed to an environment where U.S. voters don\u2019t feel confident that what they are seeing is true. That dynamic is part of the reason some in the AI industry want to see regulations that establish guidelines.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and people on his team have said they don\u2019t want to stifle the technology and they do want to support its development, so that is welcome news,\u201d said Craig Albright, the top lobbyist and senior vice president at The Software Alliance, a trade group whose members include OpenAI, Oracle and IBM. \u201cIt is our view that passing national laws to set the rules of the road will be good for developing markets for the technology.\"",
      "AI safety advocates during a recent meeting in San Francisco made similar arguments, according to Suresh Venkatasubramanian, director of the Center for Tech Responsibility at Brown University.",
      "\u201cBy putting literal guardrails, lanes, road rules, we were able to get cars that could roll a lot faster,\u201d said Venkatasubramanian, a former Biden administration official who helped craft White House principles for approaching AI.",
      "Rob Weissman, co-president of the advocacy group Public Citizen, said he's not hopeful about the prospects for federal legislation and is concerned about Trump\u2019s pledge to rescind Biden\u2019s executive order, which created an initial set of national standards for the industry. His group has advocated for federal regulation of generative AI in elections.",
      "\u201cThe safeguards are themselves ways to promote innovation so that we have AI that\u2019s useful and safe and doesn\u2019t exclude people and promotes the technology in ways that serve the public interest,\u201d he said.",

      "E-cigarettes and vapes, which deliver nicotine without some of the harmful effects of smoking, have been booming in popularity. Kid-friendly flavors, such as fruit, candy, mint, menthol and desserts, are not approved by the FDA and are on the market illegally.",
      "While vaping among youth is declining, more than 1.6 million children use the products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 90% of them consume illicit flavored brands.",
      "Manufacturers have acknowledged that their products may appeal to youth but insist that a \u201cgrowing body of scientific evidence\u201d shows that \u201cflavors are crucial to getting adult smokers to make the switch and stay away from combustible cigarettes.\u201d",
      "A federal appeals court sided with the companies last year, saying the agency had acted arbitrarily. If the Supreme Court upholds that ruling, it could clear the way for broader marketing and sale of flavored nicotine products.",
      "The Court's three liberal justices all seemed to share the government's view that FDA did not illegally move the goal posts during the process and that the companies simply lacked the evidence to win approval.",
      "Since 2009, when Congress passed legislation aimed at curbing tobacco use among young people, the government has almost universally denied tobacco company requests to sell flavored nicotine e-liquids, citing risks of addiction among minors.",
      "The FDA said the two companies in this case provided insufficient evidence that the benefits of their flavored e-products in helping tobacco smokers quit exceed the dangers of hooking children.",
      "\"I'm so totally confused,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor told Heyer. \"What [FDA] said is what you provided wasn't sufficient.\"",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she was \"baffled\" by Heyer's argument because the FDA had explicitly articulated its standard.",
      "\"I guess I'm not really seeing what the surprise is here, or what the change is here,\" said Justice Elena Kagan. \"There's just not a lot of mystery here about what FDA was doing. You might disagree with that, because you think that, in fact, the world of 40-year-olds really wants to do blueberry vaping, but you can't say that FDA hasn't told you all about what it's thinking in this respect.\"",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who could be a critical vote in the case, signaled sympathy to the industry's complaint about discretionary government regulation but suggested he wasn't convinced FDA had acted unreasonably.",
      "\"If the agency says [your claims of benefits to adult smokers] that doesn't outweigh the harm to youth, we've reviewed everything, we're aware of everything, of course they're aware of everything that's out there, that's kind of the end of it, isn't it?\" Kavanaugh asked.",
      "Even if they lose the case, several justices noted, the vape manufacturers could reapply for approval with the FDA in a new application.",
      "While the first Trump administration had taken a hard line against the marketing and sale of sweet and candy-flavored vapes, president-elect Donald Trump said during the campaign that he wants to \"save\" flavored vapes.",
      "\"We don't know exactly what that's going to look like,\" said Heyer. But, he added, that his clients \"can't afford to wait that out.\"",
      "Nearly a quarter of high school students who use e-cigarettes consume illicit menthol-flavored varieties, according to the 2023 National Youth Tobacco Survey.",
      "Josie Shapiro, the 2024 national youth ambassador for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids who testified before Congress on the dangers of nicotine addiction, said illicit flavored vapes hooked her at age 14.",
      "\u201cI think that by marketing any sort of flavored product as bubble gum or any of the genres of candy, it's going to catch the eyes of children,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cI'm still addicted, and I'm still trying to fight my addiction. Honestly, the FDA needs to regulate all flavored tobaccos to flavor \u2018tobacco\u2019 products and get them off the market.\u201d",
      "Public health experts have credited the FDA\u2019s restrictions on flavored nicotine products with helping to drive down the number of teenagers who vape gradually from an \u201cepidemic\u201d level just five years ago.",
      "The case, Food and Drug Administration v. Wages and White Lion Investments, LLC, will be decided before the end of the Supreme Court\u2019s term in June 2025.",

      "NEW YORK -- Nearly a month after a devastating election loss that exposed cracks in the very foundation of their party, Democrats remain deeply divided over the extent of their political problem \u2014 or even if they have one.",
      "A number of Democratic leaders are downplaying the strength of Donald Trump's victory over Vice President Kamala Harris as the inevitable result of an inflation-fueled anti-incumbent backlash that shaped elections worldwide. But others are convinced that the Democratic Party is facing an acute crisis that requires an urgent overhaul of its brand, message and economic policies.",
      "Trump swept every battleground state on Nov. 5, becoming the first Republican candidate to win the national popular vote since George W. Bush in 2004. Yet nearly half the country voted against him. With the final votes still being counted in some places, Trump won the popular vote by just 1.6 percentage points. He carried the seven top swing states by about 760,000 votes combined out of more than 151 million cast nationwide.",
      "\u201cThe glass is half full. It was close. If we get another 2% or 3% of American voters, it would have successfully led to victories from the presidency on down,\u201d says Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is leading a group called Governors Safeguarding Democracy.",
      "But for Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Labor-Farmer Party and a candidate to lead the Democratic National Committee next year, the election represented \u201ca damning indictment\u201d for the Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cPeople do not believe that the Democratic Party is fighting for them or for their families or gives a damn about their lives,\u201d Martin told The Associated Press. \u201cWe lost ground with almost every group except wealthy households and college-educated voters.\u201d",
      "The internal debate over the health of the party comes at a critical moment.",
      "Trump will return to the White House on Jan. 20, claiming a mandate to enact a dramatic \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda led by the mass deportation of millions of immigrants in the country illegally; an overhaul of the federal departments of health, education and justice, and major import tariffs that threaten to strain the U.S. economy and international alliances alike.",
      "Democrats, even diminished and divided, stand as the only organized resistance to Trump and his emboldened MAGA allies. But for now, at least, the Democratic Party has no leader and no agreement on the political problems that need to be fixed or how to fix them.",
      "Many Democratic groups and leaders are working through post-election analyses to better understand what went wrong on Nov. 5, but few are working together. And already, some fear that the disparate post mortems will produce competing recommendations likely to be lost in a rush to leave the pain of 2024 behind.",
      "Priorities USA, one of the Democratic Party's leading super PACs, is set to unveil its post-election findings this week. The group will recommend, among other things, that Democrats do a better job listening to voters instead of pollsters, while offering a more forward-looking positive alternative to Trump's MAGA movement.",
      "If they do not make significant changes, according to a preview of that briefing, Priorities believes there is no guarantee that key elements of the Democratic base \u2014 especially young people and voters of color \u2014 will return to the party in future elections.",
      "Some of the loudest voices calling for dramatic changes represent the party's far-left wing, which is often ignored by establishment Democrats who control the party's messaging, strategy and policy platform. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders irked some party leaders the day after the election with a scathing critique: \u201cIt should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change,\u201d Sanders continued. \u201cAnd they\u2019re right.\u201d",
      "In the weeks since, California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Sanders ally and a potential future presidential contender, has been urging his party to overhaul its economic message. Specifically, he's advocating for a \u201cNew Economic Deal\u201d focused on creating high-paying jobs for the middle class.",
      "Khanna's chief of staff, Marie Baldassarre, said that some Democrats may be coming around to Khanna's message and his willingness to share it on podcasts and right-leaning outlets such as Fox News.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how you look at this election and don\u2019t take a beat. This is the time to change,\" Baldassarre said. \"Why wouldn\u2019t we do some work right now? We didn\u2019t resonate.\u201d",
      "Democratic strategist Waleed Shahid, a former spokesperson for Justice Democrats and the \u201cUncommitted\u201d group that was critical of Joe Biden's primary nomination, said Harris' loss revealed that the party \u201chas a major problem with bleeding working-class, low-information, non-college voters.\u201d",
      "He notes that some Democratic leaders have responded with a collective shrug.",
      "\u201cMany of the people at the highest levels of the party feel pretty lost,\u201d Shahid said. \u201cI\u2019m skeptical that they\u2019ll be able to create the kind of coalition they need for transformative change over our lifetimes.\u201d",
      "The national committee's upcoming election to select a new leader serves as a litmus test for the party\u2019s direction.",
      "The DNC is expected to elect a new chair in February after a series of four candidate forums in January, according to an internal memo released last week. It remains unclear if delegates will embrace a high-profile outsider or an insider more familiar with the intricate workings of the party's political apparatus.",
      "Few are calling for wholesale changes.",
      "Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, who announced his candidacy for DNC chair on Sunday, said Democrats must embrace a new communication strategy to connect with voters who don't pay close attention to politics. He complimented Trump's command of the media landscape and suggested that his own party pay more attention to non-political and right-leaning podcasts and news networks.",
      "Wikler was skeptical, however, that the 2024 election results signal a political crisis for his party.",
      "\u201cWhat we saw was a narrow shift to the right driven the most by the people most affected by inflation, who were paying the least attention to the news,\u201d he said. \u201cThat does not suggest a permanent shift towards Trump. I think that there\u2019s a very real opportunity for Democrats to win back ground.\"",

      "The loan still must be finalized, but the government said the commitment shows its intent to finance the project. To get the loan, StarPlus must develop a plan to engage with community and labor leaders to create good paying jobs. It also has to meet technical, legal, environmental and financial conditions before the government will fund the loan.",
      "It's unclear whether the loan will be finalized before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to end funding for such projects, which he called the \u201cgreen new scam.\u201d A message was left Monday seeking comment from the Trump transition team.",

      "The plants would make battery cells and modules for electric vehicles to be sold in North America, the department said. At full capacity, the plants will produce enough batteries to supply about 670,000 vehicles per year.",

      "Fresh off his gubernatorial victory, Stein pointed to Democrats winning North Carolina's secretary of state and attorney general races.

      "Stein outperformed Harris in North Carolina, winning 55% of the vote to Harris' 48%. In the statehouse, Democrats won enough seats to stave off a Republican supermajority. Stein heavily outraised his opponent and used social media to highlight Robinson's incendiary remarks.",

      "\"The president has the right to make nominations, but normally these are for a 10-year term,\" Rounds explained. \"We'll see what his process is and whether he actually makes that nomination.\"",
      "Rounds reiterated that although the Senate will give Trump the \u201cbenefit of the doubt,\u201d it will uphold its \u201cconstitutional role.\u201d",
      "\"We still go through a process, and that process includes advice and consent, which, for the Senate, means advice or consent sometimes,\" Rounds promised.",
      "Turning to the global stage, Rounds \u2014 a staunch supporter of the U.S. aiding Ukraine in its war against Russia \u2014 called Russian President Vladimir Putin a \u201ctyrant\u201d and suggested that negotiating with him may be futile.",
      "\u201cI think Mr. Putin is a tyrant. I think dealing with him is going to be extremely difficult,\u201d Rounds said, expressing hope for Trump to succeed but recognizing that this would present a challenge for \u201cany president.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want to see Ukraine with its sovereignty protected,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think it's going to be a major, major task to overcome what Putin is offering\u201d on Ukraine giving up territory to end the war.",
      "He added that you cannot trust \u201ca guy that doesn't honor their word,\u201d which he says Putin has done.",
      "In regard to Trump\u2019s promise to slap 25% tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico, Rounds said the president-elect is a \u201csuccessful businessman\" who \"really does believe that tariffs can be a great tool.\"",
      "\u201cHe thinks that by suggesting these tariffs right now, he's going to get the attention of the leaders in the other countries,\u201d Rounds said, adding that Trump believes the tariffs will \u201cfix our borders.\u201d",
      "However, Rounds also recognized the potential impact tariffs could have on his constituents, particularly South Dakota farmers who could be affected by the tariffs.",
      "In 2018, China retaliated against Trump\u2019s tariffs by implementing its own on U.S. soybean exports that hurt U.S. farmers.",
      "\u201cLook, we're an [agricultural] state. And when I talk to my farmers and to my ranchers about that, they're concerned about retaliation,\u201d Rounds said, though he added that they understand the importance of tariffs, especially when it comes to the border.",
      "\u201cIf we've got to have tariffs, so be it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to support the president.\u201d",

      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he plans on firing FBI director Christopher Wray and replacing him with longtime ally Kash Patel.",
      "The appointment must be approved by the Senate.",
      "Patel has been a staunch supporter of Trump for years and served in his first administration under a number of roles. He has vocally defended many Jan. 6 rioters who were charged for their actions that day.",
      "Patel has said he would target journalists, former senior FBI and Department of Justice officials and turn the FBI into a museum for the \"deep state\" on Day 1.",
      "\"This FBI will end the growing crime epidemic in America, dismantle the migrant criminal gangs, and stop the evil scourge of human and drug trafficking across the Border,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post, announcing his pick.",
      "Patel did not immediately comment about Trump's announcement. Trump can not make personnel changes to the FBI until he is sworn in.",
      "Wray, the current agency director, was appointed in 2017 after Trump fired Director James Comey, less than four years into his 10-year term. Trump claimed Comey \"wasn't doing a good job.\"",
      "In a statement to ABC News, the FBI said \"Every day, the men and women of the FBI continue to work to protect Americans from a growing array of threats. Director Wray's focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for.\"",
      "Patel, 44, grew up in Long Island and earned a law degree from Pace University Law School. He first served as a public defender in Miami for nine years before moving to Washington, D.C., in 2013 to work at the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division.",
      "Patel left the Justice Department in 2017 claiming frustration with the agency, especially with the handling of the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya, that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans.",
      "He went on to lead the \u201cRussia Gate\u201d investigation for House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, with a promise from Nunes that after the investigation he would help Patel get a job at the National Security Council in the White House.",
      "As the self-described \u201clead investigator of the Russia Gate hoax,\u201d Patel authored the so-called \u201cNunes memo\u201d alleging that the FBI improperly eavesdropped on former Trump adviser Carter Page.",
      "A major report by the Justice Department's inspector general released in late 2019 found that the FBI was not impacted by political bias when it opened the investigation -- though it outlined what it called \"serious performance failures\" on the part of agents as they vetted information from sources and sought surveillance warrants against Page.",
      "In February 2019, Patel became deputy assistant to the president and senior director for counterterrorism on the White House\u2019s National Security Council.",
      "In February 2020, Patel took on a \u201ctemporary duty assignment\u201d as deputy to the newly installed acting director of national intelligence. That November, after Trump lost the election, Patel was named chief of staff for the Defense Department, despite some critics saying he was unqualified for the role.",
      "After Trump left the White House, Patel held a number of jobs including hosting shows on far-right media outlets.",
      "In Patel's book, \"Government Gangsters,\" which Trump said would serve as a \"blueprint\" for his next administration, Patel called for a \"comprehensive housecleaning\" of the Justice Department. He also promoted an eradication of \"government tyranny\" within the FBI by firing \"the top ranks\" and prosecuting \"to the fullest extent of the law\" anyone who \"in any way abused their authority for political ends.\"",
      "\"[T]he FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken,\" Patel claimed in his book. Democrats \"should be very afraid,\" Patel wrote.",
      "He alleged that there were \"abuses of prosecutorial discretion\" by the Justice Department in declining to charge Hillary Clinton for allegedly compromising classified information through her use of a private email server, and in declining to charge President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, for what Patel describes as influence-peddling. At the same time, he argued the department indicted Trump ally Steve Bannon over his refusal to comply with a subpoena from the House panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and also charging so many of the Trump supporters who were at the Capitol that day.",
      "On a podcast two months ago, Patel said anyone involved in \"Russiagate\" should be stripped of their security clearances.",
      "According to Patel, there is a \"massive\" list of such government officials, from the FBI and Justice Department to the CIA and U.S. military.",
      "\"They all still have clearances,\" including those who left government for private sector jobs, so \"everybody\" should lose their clearances, Patel said.",
      "Patel said he has personally \"recommended\" to Trump that the new administration also strip any security clearances still held by the 51 then-former intelligence officials. This includes former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA director John Brennan, who in October 2020, just weeks before the 2020 presidential election, signed onto a letter dismissing the public release of emails from Hunter Biden's laptop as part of a \"Russian information operation.\"",
      "Patel has also come to the defense of Jan. 6 rioters who were charged for their actions.",
      "He\u2019s raised money for Jan. 6 defendants and their families, including by promoting the \u201cJ6 Prison Choir,\u201d featuring Jan. 6 defendants still in jail, and co-producing their fundraising song \u201cJustice for All,\u201d which Trump played at some of his campaign rallies. And Patel once suggested Jan. 6 was \u201ca free speech movement.\u201d",
      "Patel also became a part of the investigation into Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "After news surfaced that the National Archives found some classified documents in boxes previously stored at Mar-a-Lago, Patel called the news \u201cdisinformation\u201d and insisted he was there when Trump \u201cdeclassified whole sets of materials in anticipation of leaving government that he thought the American public should have the right to read themselves.\u201d",
      "Four weeks later, Trump named Patel as one of his official representatives to the National Archives, and Patel promised to \u201cmarch down there\" and \u201cidentify every single document that they blocked being declassified at the National Archives, and we are going to start putting that information out.\u201d",
      "Two months later, Patel\u2019s claimed Trump declassifying documents were included in the FBI\u2019s affidavit laying out why the FBI believed a broad search of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate was warranted. And Patel was subpoenaed to testify to the grand jury investigating the matter, but at first he refused to answer key questions.",
      "He later returned to the grand jury and answered those questions only after being granted limited-use immunity. He has blasted the entire probe as unlawful overreach by a politically corrupted Justice Department.",

      "Billionaire businessman Massad Boulos, father of Trump's son-in-law Michael Boulos, will serve as White House senior adviser on Arab and Middle East affairs, Trump announced on his Truth Social media platform. Born in Lebanon, Massad Boulos runs Nigeria-based Boulos Enterprises, which produces and distributes mechanical equipment and motorcycles.",
      "\"Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the International scene,\" Trump wrote. \"He has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community.\"",
      "Trump added, \"Massad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East. He will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests, and I am pleased to have him on our team.\"",
      "During the final stretch of Trump's victorious presidential campaign, Boulos appeared with him at campaign stops in Dearborn, Michigan, an Arab American stronghold, and was praised by Trump for helping him flip Michigan from a blue to a red state.",
      "\u201cObviously the No. 1 point that is of high priority within the Arab American community is the current war in the Middle East,\" Boulos told The Associated Press in June. \"And the question is, who can bring peace and who is bringing war? And they know the answer to that.\"",
      "In September, Boulos met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, the New York Times reported. Palestinian officials told the Times the meeting was part of an outreach effort to Trump, but Boulos told the newspaper that it was \"purely personal\" and that he didn't inform Trump about it before or after.",
      "Boulos also has close contacts in the Lebanon political world and made an unsuccessful run in 2018 for a seat in Lebanon's Parliament.",
      "As a young man, Boulos moved to Texas, where he obtained a doctorate in jurisprudence at the University of Houston. After earning his law degree, he joined his family\u2019s business, rising to CEO.",
      "Michael Boulos and Tiffany Trump, the daughter of Trump and his second wife, Marla Maples, were married in November 2022 at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. While campaigning in Detroit in October, Donald Trump announced the couple was expecting their first child.",
      "The announcement of Boulos being picked as a White House senior adviser came a day after Trump picked billionaire real estate developer Charles Kushner to serve as ambassador to France. Kushner is the father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who served as a senior White House adviser during Trump's first term as president.",
      "Jared Kushner is married to Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, Ivanka.",
      "Charles Kushner pleaded guilty in March 2005 to assisting in the filing of false tax returns, retaliating against a cooperating witness and making false statements to the Federal Election Commission. He was sentenced to two years in prison.",
      "Trump granted Kushner a pardon in December 2020.",

      "Behind the Bidens, a giant red ribbon hung on the South Portico and the AIDS Memorial Quilt was placed across the South Lawn. The quilt now with 50,000 panels with 110,000 names and weighs 54 tons. This was the first time it has been displayed on the lawn.",
      "\u201cLike the first threads of this quilt\u2026 this movement is fully woven into the fabric and history of America,\u201d Biden said. \u201cShining a light on the memory and the legacy of all the sisters and brothers, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, moms and dads, partners and friends who have lost, we've lost to this terrible disease.\u201d",

      "Biden pointed out the \u201cstigma of misinformation\u201d and failures of the U.S. government to act when the epidemic was raging, saying it \u201ccompounded pain and trauma for a community watching a generation of loved ones and friends perish.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was horribly, horribly wrong,\u201d he said.",
      "Biden highlighted the progress that\u2019s been made under his administration in the fight against HIV/AIDS and fighting the stigma of discrimination against the HIV community. He also called attention to Dr. Anthony Fauci, who attended the event, for his leading efforts to advance the fight over his career.",
      "As he prepared to leave for Africa in the evening, Biden credited former President George W. Bush for creating PEPFAR, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which has improved outcomes for people living with HIV on the African continent and saved more than 26 million lives globally.",
      "Biden said he plans to call on Congress to pass a five-year PEPFAR reauthorization to sustain this progress before he leaves office in January.",

    "story": [
      "Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker that owns brands like Jeep and Ram and Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot",
      "NEW YORK -- Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the automaker, which owns car brands like Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, amid an ongoing struggle with slumping sales.",
      "The world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker announced that its board accepted Tavares' resignation Sunday, effective immediately.",
      "Stellantis noted Sunday that the process of finding a new, permanent CEO is \u201cwell under way.\u201d In the meantime, the company says a new interim executive committee, led by chairman John Elkann, will be established.",
      "As head of PSA Peugeot, Tavares took control of the Netherlands-based company in January 2021 \u2014 when it merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, creating an automotive giant that is the parent to several well-known brands today. Beyond Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, the company portfolio includes Dodge, Chrysler, Fiat, Peugeot, Maserati and Opel.",
      "Stellantis' North American operations had been the company\u2019s main source of profits for some time, but struggles piled up this year, with the company citing rising competition and larger market changes. As a result of lofty sticker prices and fewer affordable options, many high-priced vehicles have been left unsold on dealers' lots.",
      "For its third quarter, Stellantis posted 27% plunge in net revenues, as gaps in launching new products and action to reduce inventories also slashed global shipments of new vehicles by 20%.",
      "The carmaker reported net revenues of 33 billion euros (nearly $36 billion ) in the three-month period ending Sept. 30, down from 45 billion euros in the same period last year. All regions except South America reported double-digit dips in revenues \u2014 led by North America, which plunged 42% to 12.4 billion euros ($13.1 billion).",
      "In recent months, Tavares had come under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union after the release of dismal financial performance reports. He also oversaw cost-cutting efforts that included delaying factory openings and laying off union workers \u2014 further straining the company's relations with the UAW, which filed several grievances against Stellantis and threatened to strike in recent months.",
      "The UAW welcomed Tavares' resignation with president Shawn Fain calling the move \u201ca major step in the right direction for a company that has been mismanaged and a workforce that has been mistreated for too long.\u201d He noted that thousands of UAW members had been calling for Tavares' firing for weeks for what Fain called the CEO's \u201creckless mismanagement of the company.\u201d",
      "\u201cTavares is leaving behind a mess of painful layoffs and overpriced vehicles sitting on dealership lots,\u201d Fain said in a statement. He added that the union looks forward to sitting down with Stellantis\u2019 new chief executive and \u201cwill keep using all means available\u201d to hold the company accountable.",
      "Beyond the U.S., Stellantis has faced pressure in Italy \u2014 where lawmakers questioned the former chief executive over the company's production plans in October, with the far-right government accusing the company of relocating assembly plants to low-cost countries. Tens of thousands of autoworkers in the country also held a one-day walkout, calling for more employment certainty and protections.",
      "In efforts to revive sales, Stellantis previously made a number of leadership changes in October, which included naming new heads of operations in North America and Europe. At the time, the company expected Tavares to step down in early 2026, closer to the end of his five-year contract.",
      "The company confirmed in September that it was searching for a CEO to eventually succeed Tavares, but it maintained those efforts were part of standard leadership transition plans.",
      "In a statement Sunday, Stellantis\u2019 senior independent director Henri de Castries said that Stellantis' success is \u201crooted in a perfect alignment\u201d between shareholders, the company's board and the CEO \u2014 but noted \u201cdifferent views\u201d had emerged in recent weeks, resulting in the decision to approve Tavares' resignation.",
      "Elkann, the chairperson of Stellantis' board, thanked Tavares for \u201chis years of dedicated service and the role he has played in the creation of Stellantis\u201d in an additional statement. He added that he looks forward to appointing a new CEO.",
      "Stellantis did not comment further beyond Sunday's release. The announcement arrived shortly after Bloomberg reported Tavares' plans to step down, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter."

      "Republicans will control the White House and both houses of Congress come January",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republicans will control the White House and both houses of Congress come January. But President-elect Donald Trump's intent to nominate loyalists to fill key Cabinet posts has set up a possible confrontation with the Senate, which has the constitutional responsibility for \u201cadvice and consent\u201d on presidential nominees.",
      "Trump and his Republican allies are talking about going around the Senate and using temporary recess appointments, which last no more than two years.",
      "Invoking that authority could result in a fight that lands at the Supreme Court. Trump might also have to claim another, never-before-used power to force the Senate into a recess, if it won't agree to one.",
      "In its 234 years, the Supreme Court has decided only one case involving recess appointments. In 2014, the justices unanimously ruled that Democratic President Barack Obama's recess appointments to the National Labor Relations Board were illegal.",
      "But they disagreed sharply over the reach of the decision. Five justices backed a limited ruling that held the Senate wasn't actually in recess when Obama acted and, in any event, a break had to be at least 10 days before the president could act on his own.",
      "Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the other four justices, would have held that the only recess recognized by the Constitution occurs between the annual sessions of Congress, not breaks taken during a session. That would have ruled out the appointments Trump may be considering after the new Congress begins in January and he is sworn into office.",
      "Just two justices, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, remain from the five-justice bloc that took the view that preserved the president's power to make recess appointments during a session of Congress. Three others, John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, joined the Scalia opinion that would have made it virtually impossible for any future president to make recess appointments.",
      "The rest of the court has become more conservative since then, a result of Trump's three high court appointments in his first term. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett have no record on this issue, which rarely arises in the courts. Nor does Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, a 2022 appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "A more conservative Supreme Court might come out differently today, though it\u2019s by no means certain. Once the court decides a case, the ruling is regarded as precedent that is not lightly discarded. So even some justices who initially dissent from a ruling will go along in later cases on a similar topic.",
      "Scalia, an icon of the right, applied his originalist approach to the Constitution to conclude that there was little doubt what the framers were trying to do.",
      "The whole point of the constitutional provision on recess appointments, adopted in 1787 in the era of horse and buggy, was that the Senate could not quickly be summoned to fill critical vacancies, he wrote.",
      "Reading a summary of his opinion aloud in the courtroom on June 26, 2014, Scalia said the power to make recess appointments \u201cis an anachronism.\u201d",
      "The Senate always can be convened on short notice to consider a president\u2019s nominations, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only remaining practical use for the recess appointment power is the ignoble one of enabling presidents to circumvent the Senate\u2019s role in the appointment process, which is precisely what happened here,\u201d Scalia said.",
      "It's not likely to happen quickly. Only someone who has been affected by an action taken by an official who was given a recess appointment would have the legal right, or standing, to sue. In the NLRB case, Obama made his recess appointments in January 2012.",
      "The board then ruled against Noel Canning, a soft drink bottling company in Yakima, Washington, in a dispute over contract negotiations with a local Teamsters union. The company sued, claiming that the NLRB decision against it was not valid because the board members were not properly appointed and that the board did not have enough members to do business without the improperly appointed officials.",
      "The Supreme Court's ultimate decision came nearly 2 1/2 years later.",
      "Among the most prominent people who were first given recess appointments and later confirmed by the Senate are Chief Justice Earl Warren, Justice William Brennan and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Among those who left office after failing to win a Senate vote is John Bolton, who was given a recess appointment as U.N. ambassador under Republican President George W. Bush.",
      "A separate novel legal issue could arise if Trump were to invoke a constitutional provision that his allies suggested would allow him to force the Senate to adjourn, even if doesn't want to, and enable him to make recess appointments.",
      "Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution includes a clause about congressional adjournments that has never been invoked. Trump's allies read it as giving the chief executive the power step in when the House and Senate can\u2019t agree on when to adjourn. The provision reads that \u201cin case of disagreement between them, with respect to the time of adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper.\u201d",
      "But some scholars, including conservative ones, argue that the House has no power to force the Senate to adjourn, and vice versa. Congressional adjournments are spelled out in Article I, which requires one chamber to consent when the other wants to take a break of more than three days. Under this view, the president could intervene only when one house objects to the other's adjournment plan.",

      "Boulos arranged Trump campaign efforts to engage the Arab American community in Michigan, organizing dozens of meetings in areas with large Arab American populations angered by Democratic President Joe Biden's backing of Israel's offensives in Gaza and Lebanon. Trump won the majority Arab American city of Dearborn Heights on his way to sweeping Michigan and other swing states.",
      "\u201cHe has been a longtime proponent of Republican and Conservative values, an asset to my Campaign, and was instrumental in building tremendous new coalitions with the Arab American Community,\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social.",
      "Trump and Boulos said the Republican president-elect would bring peace to the Middle East, but neither has publicly offered concrete details on Trump's plans for the region.",
      "Boulos has previously sought office in Lebanon and has long-standing ties to political figures in the country. Other Trump picks for key national security positions are staunch supporters of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a Trump ally.",
      "Mike Huckabee, Trump's pick for ambassador to Israel, has consistently rejected a Palestinian state in territories seized by Israel. He has claimed \u201cthere really isn\u2019t such a thing\u201d as Palestinians, in referring to the descendants of people who lived in Palestine before the establishment of Israel.",
      "Trump's pick for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, advocated for rebuilding a biblical Jewish temple on the site of Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam\u2019s holiest sites.",
      "Boulos helped capitalize on dissension within the Democratic base over support for the Israeli offensive in Gaza, where more than 44,000 people have died since Hamas\u2019 attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, according to health officials in the Hamas-run territory who don't separate civilians and fighters in their totals.",
      "Trump won Michigan by just over 10,000 votes in 2016 and Biden retook the state for the Democrats in 2020 by roughly 154,000 votes. Trump carried Michigan in November over Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, with 49.7% of the vote.",
      "\u201cMassad is a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump, who has long installed family members and their relatives in key positions, is signaling that he will run his second administration the same way. On Saturday, he announced that he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner, father of Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France.",

      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year",
      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year? Artificial intelligence chatbots might help, but don't expect them to do all the work or always give you the right answers.",
      "Anyone scouring the internet for Cyber Monday deals is likely going to encounter more conversational iterations of the chatbots that some retailers and e-commerce sites have built to provide shoppers with enhanced customer service.",
      "Some companies have integrated models infused with newer generative AI technologies, allowing shoppers to seek advice by asking naturally phrased questions like \u201cWhat's the best wireless speaker?\u201d",
      "Retailers hope consumers use these chatbots, which are typically called shopping assistants - as virtual companions that help them discover or compare products. Prior chatbots were mostly used for task-oriented functions such as helping customers track down online orders or return ones that didn't meet expectations.",
      "Amazon, the king of online retail, has said its customers have been questioning Rufus - the generative AI- powered shopping assistant it launched this year - for information such as whether a specific coffee maker is easy to clean, or what recommendations it has for a lawn game for a child's birthday party.",
      "And Rufus, which is available for holiday shoppers in the U.S. and some other countries, is not the only shopping assistant out there. A select number of Walmart shoppers will have access this year to a similar chatbot the nation's largest retailer is testing in a few product categories, including toys and electronics.",
      "Perplexity AI added something new to the AI chat-shopping world last month by rolling out a feature on its AI-powered search engine that enables users to ask a question like \u201cWhat's the best women's leather boots?\" and then receive specific product results that the San Francisco-based company says are not sponsored.",
      "\u201cIt has been adopted at pretty incredible scale,\u201d Mike Mallazzo, an analyst and writer at retail research media company Future Commerce, said.",
      "Retailers with websites and e-commerce companies started paying more attention to chatbots when use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence text chatbot made by the company OpenAI, went mainstream in late 2022, sparking public and business interest in the generative AI technology that powers the tool.",
      "Victoria\u2019s Secret, IKEA, Instacart and the Canadian retailer Ssense are among other companies experimenting with chatbots, some of which use technology from OpenAI.",
      "Even before the improved chatbots, online retailers were creating product recommendations based on a customer's prior purchases or search history. Amazon was at the forefront of having recommendations on its platform, so Rufus' ability to provide some is not particularly groundbreaking.",
      "But Rajiv Mehta, the vice president of search and conversational shopping at Amazon, said the company is able to offer more helpful recommendations now by programming Rufus to ask clarifying or follow-up questions. Customers are also using Rufus to look for deals, some of which are personalized, Mehta said.",
      "To be sure, chatbots are prone to hallucinations, so Rufus and most of the tools like it can get things wrong.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, wrote in a November blog post that his firm tested Rufus by requesting gaming TV recommendations. The chatbot's response included products that were not TVs. When asked for the least expensive options, Rufus came back with suggestions that weren't the cheapest, Kaziukenas said.",
      "An Associated Press reporter recently asked Rufus to give some gift recommendations for a brother. The chatbot quickly spit out a few ideas for \u201cthoughtful gifts,\" ranging from a T-shirt and a keychain with charms to a bolder suggestion: a multifunctional knife engraved with the phrase \u201cBEST BROTHER EVER.\u201d",
      "After a 5-minute written conversation, Rufus offered more tailored suggestions - a few Barcelona soccer jerseys sold by third-party sellers. But it wasn\u2019t able to say which seller offered the lowest price. When asked during another search for a price comparison on a popular skin serum, Rufus showed the product's pre-discounted price instead of its present one.",
      "\u201cRufus is constantly learning,\u201d Amazon's Mehta said during an interview.",
      "Shop AI, a chatbot that Canadian e-commerce company Shopify launched last year, can also help shoppers discover new products by asking its own questions, such as soliciting details about an intended gift recipient or features the buyer wants to avoid. Shop AI has trouble, however, recommending specific products or identifying the lowest-priced item in a product category.",
      "The limitations show the technology is still in its infancy and has a long way to go before it becomes as useful as the retail industry - and many shoppers - wish it could be.",
      "To truly transform the shopping experience, shopping assistants will \u201cneed to be deeply personalized\u201d and be able - on their own - to remember a customer\u2019s order history, product preferences and purchasing habits, consulting giant McKinsey & Company said in an August report.",
      "Amazon has noted that Rufus' answers are based on information contained in product listings, community Q&As and customer reviews, which would include the fake reviews that are used to boost or diminish sales for products on its marketplace.",
      "The large language model that powers the chatbot was also trained on the company's entire catalog and some public information on the web, Trishul Chilimbi, an Amazon vice president who oversees AI research, wrote in the electrical engineering magazine IEEE Spectrum in October.",
      "But its unclear how Amazon and other companies are weighting different training components - such as reviews - in their recommendations, or how exactly the shopping assistants come up with them, according to Nicole Greene, an analyst at management consulting firm Gartner.",
      "Perplexity AI's new shopping feature allows users to enter search queries such as \u201cbest phone case\" and to receive answers derived from various sources, including Amazon and other retailers, such as Best Buy. Perplexity also invited retailers to share data about their products and said those that do would have an increased chance of having their items recommended to shoppers.",
      "But Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, suggested in a recent interview with Fortune magazine that he didn't know how the new shopping feature recommended products to customers. But in an interview with the AP, Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko pushed back on that characterization, saying Srinivas' comment \u201cwas probably taken out of context.\u201d",
      "The context, he said, is that with generative AI technology \u201cYou can\u2019t know in advance exactly what the output will be just based off of knowing what the inputs\u201d are from the training materials.",
      "Shevelenko said retailers and brands need to know they can't have their products recommended in Perplexity's search engine because they're \u201cjamming key words\u201d into their websites or using different techniques to show up better on search results",
      "\u201cThe way you show up in an answer is by having a better product and better features,\u201d he said."

      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning such care for minors, and most of those states face lawsuits.",
      "The nation's top court will be weighing whether Tennessee\u2019s law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, requiring that people in similar circumstances be treated the same under the law. Both sides in the case claim they are acting to protect minors from harm.",
      "Gender-affirming care is supported by the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical groups. Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s typically involved:",
      "Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are often referred to clinics where teams from various medical specialties provide gender-affirming care.",
      "Such care begins with an evaluation, which can include a pediatrician and a mental health specialist who assess the degree of distress, if any, the young person is experiencing.",
      "Those who meet defined criteria may be diagnosed with what\u2019s called gender dysphoria if their distress is continuous and significant.",
      "Some young people and their families may decide to try a social transition involving a new hairstyle, clothing, name or pronouns. Experts agree that allowing children to express their gender in a way that matches their identity is beneficial.",
      "Chazzie Grosshandler, 18, of Chicago, said she was 9 years old when she told her parents she was a girl and \u201cnot just a boy who likes girly things.\u201d She started receiving care two years later.",
      "\u201cThe first-ever step of gender-affirming care for me was when I told my parents that I was a girl and that I had felt this way for a long time and that they accepted me,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people get really confused when they hear the word \u2018care\u2019 that it has to be something medical. But the truth is that it\u2019s more than just medical. It\u2019s love and acceptance.\u201d",
      "A subset of young people may be offered additional interventions such as puberty blockers to ease distress and give them time to explore their gender identity.",
      "The drugs, known as GnRH agonists, block the release of key hormones involved in sexual maturation. They\u2019ve been used for decades to treat precocious puberty, an uncommon medical condition that causes puberty to begin abnormally early.",
      "The medication starts after a young person show early signs of puberty \u2014 enlargement of breasts or testicles. This typically occurs around age 8 to 13 for those assigned female at birth and a year or two later for those assigned male at birth.",
      "The drugs can be given as injections every few months or as arm implants lasting up to a year or two. Many of the effects are reversible \u2014 puberty and sexual development resume as soon as the drugs are stopped. Researchers are exploring the effects of puberty blockers on bone development, but no research has shown an increased risk for bone fractures.",
      "Young people can stay on puberty blockers for several years.",
      "After puberty blockers, trans adolescents go through puberty either with or without hormone treatment.",
      "Some may choose to take hormones to make their bodies more closely match their gender identity. They take manufactured versions of either estrogen or testosterone \u2014 hormones that prompt sexual development in puberty. Estrogen comes in skin patches and pills. Testosterone is available in injections, implants or gels.",
      "Guidelines recommend starting these when teens are mature enough to make informed medical decisions. Many transgender people take the hormones for life.",
      "If the medication is stopped, some physical changes remain. Testosterone generally leads to permanent voice-lowering, facial hair and development of the Adam\u2019s apple. Estrogen can lead to permanent breast development.",
      "Research on long-term hormone use in transgender adults has found potential health risks including a modest risk for blood clots with estrogen and negative cholesterol changes with testosterone.",
      "Gender-affirming surgery in transgender teens is far less common than hormone treatment. When it is done among transgender youth, it\u2019s almost always breast reduction surgery in older transgender males.",
      "Even so, that type of surgery is extremely rare. Perhaps surprisingly, breast reduction among minors is most frequently performed in males who are not transgender. This is for a condition called gynecomastia, which means having more breast tissue than usual.",
      "A study looking at millions of 2019 insurance claims found 151 breast reductions performed for U.S. minors. Nearly all \u2014 97% \u2014 were not transgender.",
      "Research suggests that transgender youth are prone to stress, depression and suicidal thoughts. Some studies suggest treatment for gender dysphoria can improve young people\u2019s well-being, but some nuances remain unclear.",
      "In one study, researchers spent two years testing and tracking 315 transgender youth who received hormone therapy. Depression and anxiety symptoms eased and life satisfaction increased among those designated female at birth, but not among those designated male at birth. The researchers speculated that the youth designated male at birth might be more affected by stress from being different from most of their peers.",

      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That would make it the season's \u2014 and the year's \u2014 biggest \u2014 shopping day for e-commerce.",
      "Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday night, per Adobe \u2014 reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent every minute.",
      "For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales event right after midnight Pacific time on Saturday. Target's two days of discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday. Walmart rolled out its Cyber Monday offers for Walmart+ members on Sunday afternoon and opened it up to all customers three hours later, at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "Consumer spending for Cyber Week \u2014 the five major shopping days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday \u2014 provides a strong indication of how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays.",
      "Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a healthy pace.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",
      "Many economist have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing to automobiles.",
      "The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5% to 3.5% \u2014 compared to 3.9% in 2023.",
      "A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season won\u2019t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period. But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging signs for retailers.",
      "Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that discounts from Thanksgiving onward have \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d \u2014 and online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40 billion mark combined.",
      "U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2% increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That's also more than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1\u202fbillion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said.",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double-digits while in-store purchase rose a modest 0.7%.",
      "E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $4.6 million per minute \u2014 with top categories by volume including clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to Adobe. \u201cHot products\u201d included Lego sets, espresso machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care.",
      "Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the comfort of their homes.",
      "RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the Midwest.",
      "Sensormatic Solutions, which also tracks store traffic, said its preliminary analysis showed retail store traffic on Black Friday was down 8.2% compared to 2023.",

      "While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more \u201cexperience-driven spending\u201d in recent years, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic waned.",
      "Jie Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H.

      "Adobe notes that shoppers are also buying higher-ticket items this season \u2014 with consumers opening their wallets to invest or \u201ctrade up\u201d to more premium versions of products like electronics, appliances and sporting goods.",
      "Brie Carere, executive vice president and chief customer officer at FedEx, cited strong shipping volume for Thanksgiving weekend, and CyberMonday has had a good start. She anticipated that FedEx\u2019s shipping volume on the online shopping holiday will be slightly up over the 19 million items shipped a year ago on the holiday.",
      "But she said the truncated season \u2014 there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day \u2014 is making it harder for her retail customers to forecast.",
      "In fact, Carere said only four of FedEx\u2019s top 20 holiday e-commerce customers got their shipping predictions correct for the week before the Thanksgiving weekend. And she also noted that while FedEx predicts low single-digit percentage growth in shipping volume each day, she thinks that many retail customers will see a decline for the overall holiday period because of the truncated season.",
      "\u201cI do think that we\u2019re going to see some retailers be disappointed in their volume numbers,\u201d she said.",
      "Carere also doesn\u2019t anticipate much of a lull in shipping between Thanksgiving weekend and last two weeks before Christmas because of the shorter season.",
      "Jim Katsafanas, president of U.S. Small Business Sales, UPS, agreed, noting last week \u201cwe are going to see a pretty consistent surge of volume right through the end. \u201d",

A Republican victory in a special election could shift that balance to a one-vote GOP majority.",
      "Democrats have a one-vote majority in the state Senate. So regardless of the outcome in the disputed race, Minnesota will be returning to some degree of divided government in 2025 after two years of full Democratic control.",
      "\u201cThe actions of Scott County elections officials constitute a serious breach of not only Minnesota Election Law, but the public trust in our electoral system,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "Democratic Rep. Brad Tabke was declared the winner last week of the swing suburban Shakopee-area District 54A race by 14 votes after a recount and the official canvass. But Scott County election officials had said earlier, after a post-election audit, that they were unable to account for 21 absentee ballots in the district southwest of Minneapolis.",
      "County Attorney Ronald Hocevar reported last Wednesday that his preliminary investigation determined that election workers most likely threw at least 20 of those absentee ballots away, and that they may have been in a paper bale that a recycler had already sent away for shredding. He wrote that they \u201cmost likely will not be recovered,\u201d and that even if they were found, it's unlikely that an unbroken chain of custody could be proven to assure that they weren't tampered with.",
      "In Minnesota, absentee voters complete their ballots, place them in a security envelope to protect their privacy, then place that envelope inside a signature envelope with identifying information on the outside so that election workers can check those ballots in. Once the counting begins, the ballots are supposed to be removed from the security envelopes and tabulated.",
      "The county attorney concluded that the 20 ballots, all from the same precinct, were properly accepted for counting on Oct. 17, but \u201cmost likely were never removed from their secrecy envelopes,\u201d and were probably still in them when those envelopes were thrown away. The investigation didn\u2019t determine what happened to the 21st ballot, which was cast in a different precinct.",
      "It\u2019s not the first time in recent years that absentee ballots have gone missing.",
      "When a small number of military ballots in Pennsylvania ended up in a trash can in 2020, President Donald Trump repeatedly seized on the case to support his claims of fraud heading into that election. After investigating, authorities found a temporary county election worker had mistakenly discarded seven military ballots in the trash and mishandled two others. The ballots were later retrieved from a garbage dumpster and counted, and the worker was fired.",
      "Minnesota House Republicans filed Monday's lawsuit on behalf of GOP candidate Aaron Paul, asking a court to declare the results invalid and Tabke's seat vacant, saying the \u201cundisputed facts\u201d make it impossible to rely on the results.",
      "The current House minority leader, Rep. Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring, said a new election is the best way to protect the integrity of the process.",
      "\"We appreciate the efforts by Scott County to investigate this matter and be transparent about their findings,\u201d Demuth said in a statement.",
      "But House Democrats said they believe they will win the court challenge.",
      "\u201cRep. Brad Tabke won the election in District 54A by the count on Election Night and in the recount,\" current Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, said in a statement. \"We expect Rep. Tabke will prevail again in the election contest.\u201d",
      "Republicans also filed a lawsuit last month over a different House race, in the suburban Roseville area, where they allege the winner doesn't live in the district. Democrats deny that, and the district is heavily Democratic, so that case is unlikely to change the balance of power even if there's a special election.",

      "Struggling chipmaker Intel says in a surprise announcement that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired",
      "Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired, the struggling chipmaker said Monday in a surprise announcement.",
      "Two company executives, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, will act as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a replacement for Gelsinger, who also stepped down from the company's board.",
      "The departure of Gelsinger, whose career spanned more than 40 years, underscores the turmoil at Intel. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Gelsinger started at Intel in 1979 and was its first chief technology officer. He returned to the company as chief executive in 2021.",
      "Gelsinger said his exit was \u201cbittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.\u201d",
      "Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer at Intel. Holthaus was appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, which includes the client computing, data center and AI groups.",
      "Frank Yeary, independent chair of Intel's board, will become interim executive chair.",
      "\u201cPat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021,\u201d Yeary said in a statement. \"As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.\u201d",
      "Gelsinger's departure comes as Intel\u2019s financial woes have been piling up. The company posted a $16.6 billion loss and halted its dividend in the most recent quarter, and its shares have fallen by about 60% since he took over as CEO. Gelsinger announced plans in August to slash 15% of its huge workforce \u2014 or about 15,000 jobs \u2014 as part of cost-cutting efforts to to save $10 billion in 2025.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s ascendance, meanwhile, was cemented earlier this month when it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",
      "Unlike some of rivals, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them. Under Gelsinger, the company has been working to build up its foundry business making semiconductors in the U.S. designed by other firms, in a bid to compete with rivals such as market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or TSMC.",
      "Intel has benefited from tens of billions of dollars that the administration has pledged to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness.",
      "After taking over as CEO, Gelsinger unveiled plans to build a $20 billion chipmaking facility in central Ohio, and poured billions more into expanding in Europe, where leaders were also worried about dependence on Asia.",
      "The Biden administration had said it would give Intel up to $8.5 billion in federal funding for semiconductor plants around the country, but last week it trimmed that amount, according to three people familiar with the grant who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Shares of the Santa Clara, California, company, were up less than 1% in afternoon trading after being up more than 5% earlier in the day.",

      "Ultra low-cost online retailers Temu and Shein are giving Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season",
      "Shopping on Temu can feel like playing an arcade game. Instead of using a joystick-controlled claw to grab a toy, visitors to the online marketplace maneuver their computer mouses or cellphone screens to browse colorful gadgets, accessories and trinkets with prices that look too good to refuse.",
      "A pop-up spinning wheel offers the chance to win a coupon. Rotating captions warn that a less than $2 camouflage print balaclava and a $1.23 skeleton hand back scratcher are \u201cAlmost sold out.\u201d A flame symbol indicates a $9.69 plush cat print hoodie is selling fast. A timed-down selection of discounted items adds to the sense of urgency.",
      "Welcome to the new online world of impulse buying, a place of guilty pleasures where the selection is vast, every day is Cyber Monday, and an instant dopamine hit that will have faded by the time your package arrives is always just a click away.",
      "By all accounts, we\u2019re living in an accelerating age for consumerism, one that Temu, which is owned by the Chinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings, and Shein, its fierce rival, supercharged with social media savvy and an interminable assortment of cheap goods, most shipped directly from merchants in China based on real-time demand.",
      "The business models of the two platforms, coupled with avalanches of digital or influencer advertising, have enabled them to give Western retailers a run for their money this holiday shopping season.",
      "Software company Salesforce said it expects roughly one in five online purchases in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada to be made through four online marketplaces based or founded in Asia: Shein, Temu, TikTok Shop - the e-commerce arm of video-sharing platform TikTok - and AliExpress.",
      "Analysts with Salesforce said they are expected to pull in roughly $160 billion in global sales outside of China. Most of the sales will go to Temu and Shein, a privately held company which is thought to lead the worldwide fast fashion market in revenue.",
      "Lisa Xiaoli Neville, a nonprofit manager who lives in Los Angeles, is sold on Shein. The bedroom of her home is stocked with jeans, shoes, press-on nails and other items from the ultra-fast fashion retailer, all of which she amassed after getting on the platform to purchase a $2 pair of earrings she saw in a Facebook ad.",
      "Neville, 46, estimates she spends at least $75 a month on products from Shein. A $2 eggshell opener, a portable apple peeler and an apple corer - both costing less than $5 - are among the quirky, single-use kitchen tools taking up drawer space. She acknowledges she doesn\u2019t need them because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t even cook like that.\u201d Plus, she\u2019s allergic to apples.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t eat apples. It will kill me,\u201d Neville said, laughing. \u201cBut I still want the coring thing.\u201d",
      "Shein, now based in Singapore, uses some of the same web design features as Temu\u2019s, such as pop-up coupons and ads, to persuade shoppers to keep clicking, but it appears a bit more restrained in its approach.",
      "Shein primarily targets young women through partnerships with social media influencers. Searching the company's name on video platforms turns up creators promoting Shein's Black Friday sales event and displaying the dozens of of trendy clothes and accessories they got for comparatively little money.",
      "But the Shein-focused content also includes videos of TikTokers saying they're embarrassed to admit they shopped there and critics lashing out at fans for not taking into account the environmental harms or potential labor abuses associated with products that are churned out and shipped worldwide at a speedy pace.",
      "Neville has already picked out holiday gifts for family and friends from the site. Most of the products in her online cart cost under $10, including graphic T-shirts she intends to buy for her son and jeans and loafers for her daughter. All told, she plans to spend about $200 on gifts, significantly less than $500 she used to shell out at other stores in prior years.",
      "\u201cThe visuals just make you want to spend more money,\u201d she said, referring to the clothes on Shein's site. \u201cThey're very cheap and everything is just so cute.\u201d",
      "Unlike Shein, Temu's appeal cuts across age groups and gender. The platform is the world\u2019s second most-visited online shopping site, software company Similarweb reported in September. Customers go there looking for practical items like doormats and silly products like a whiskey flask shaped like a vintage cellphone from the 1990s.",
      "Temu advertised Black Friday bargains for some items at upwards of 70% off the recommended retail price. Making a purchase can quickly result in receiving dozens of emails offering free giveaways. The caveat: customers have to buy more products.",
      "Ellen Flowers, 36, a lifestyle blogger who lives in Dallas, recently decided to pair a $3,500 dining table with $25 dining chairs from Temu to save money. She's also purchased clothes from Temu. The quality or fit wasn't always always great, so Flowers donated some unwanted pieces to thrift stores to avoid paying return shipping fees that would cost almost as much as the clothes.",
      "Flowers planned to buy stocking stuffers on Temu as well as baubles for an ornament-swapping party in early December. She also wanted to buy necklaces and bracelets for an activity at her 5-year-old niece's upcoming birthday party.",
      "\u201cI love buying my nieces presents,\u201d Flowers says. \u201cSince they\u2019re young, they don\u2019t need the Louis Vuitton handbag. I can give them a cute handbag from Temu. Then they\u2019ll lose interest in a month and I\u2019ll buy them another one.\u201d",
      "Despite their rise, Temu and Shein have proven particularly ripe for pushback. Last year, a coalition of unnamed brands and organizations launched a campaign to oppose Shein in Washington. U.S. lawmakers also have raised the possibility that Temu is allowing goods made with forced labor to enter the country.",
      "More recently, the Biden administration put forward rules that would crack down on a trade rule known as the de minimis exception, which has allowed a lot of cheap products to come into the U.S. duty-free. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to slap high tariffs on goods from China, a move that would likely raise prices and across the retail world.",
      "Both Shein and Temu have set up warehouses in the U.S. to speed up delivery times and help them better compete with Amazon, which is trying to erode their price advantage through a new storefront that also ships products directly from China.",
      "Meanwhile, Temu is onboarding Chinese merchants to store inventory in the U.S., a move that would allow the company to not be as exposed to changes around the de minimus trade rule, said Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse.",
      "The change comes as both Shein and Temu are attempting to expand beyond the bargain-hungry shoppers who popularized their platforms. Temu is allowing sellers to ship products to customers from local U.S. warehouses and says the move will allow it to sell larger items like furniture as it expands its selection of big-ticket items.",
      "Meanwhile, American children's clothing retailer The Children\u2019s Place signed a deal last month to distribute its products through Shein\u2019s platform. Last year, Shein went into business with women's fashion retailer Forever 21. It has been working to recruit other brands and reportedly has hopes of getting listed on the London Stock Exchange."

      "A clemency petition for a Missouri man facing the death penalty for sexually assaulting and killing a child says he was a frequent victim of physical and sexual abuse in his youth and has a \u201cstructurally abnormal\u201d brain that impairs his judgment",
      "ST. LOUIS -- A Missouri man facing the death penalty for sexually assaulting and killing a child was a frequent victim of physical and sexual abuse in his youth and has a \u201cstructurally abnormal\u201d brain that impairs his judgment, according to a clemency petition filed on his behalf.",
      "Christopher Collings, 49, is scheduled to die by an injection of pentobarbital Tuesday evening at the state prison in Bonne Terre. It would be the 23rd execution in the U.S. this year and the fourth in Missouri.",
      "Collings was convicted of killing 9-year-old Rowan Ford, a fourth-grader from the tiny southwestern Missouri town of Stella, on Nov. 3, 2007. Her body was found in a sinkhole six days later. She had been strangled. Collings confessed to the crimes.",
      "Republican Gov. Mike Parson was still weighing the clemency petition on Monday, but history is not on Collings' side: Parson, a former county sheriff, has overseen 12 executions and has never granted clemency.",
      "Collings' attorney, Jeremy Weis, said another appeal is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, but various courts have rejected several of his previous appeals.",
      "The clemency petition states that the abnormality of Collings\u2019 brain causes him to suffer from \u201cfunctional deficits in awareness, judgment and deliberation, comportment, appropriate social inhibition, and emotional regulation.\u201d It also notes that he suffered from frequent and often violent abuse as a child.",
      "\u201cThe result was a damaged human being with no guidance on how to grow into a functioning adult,\u201d the petition states.",
      "The petition also challenges the fairness of executing Collings when another man charged in the crime, Rowan's stepfather, David Spears, also confessed but was allowed to plead to lesser crimes. Spears served more than seven years in prison before his release in 2015.",
      "Collings told authorities that he drank heavily and smoked marijuana with Spears and another man in the hours before the attack on Rowan, according to court records. Collings said he picked up the sleeping child from a home and took her to the camper where he lived, where he assaulted her. He said he strangled the child with a rope when he realized she recognized him.",
      "Collings told investigators that he took the girl's body to a sinkhole. He burned the rope used in the attack, along with the clothes he was wearing and his blood-stained mattress, prosecutors said.",
      "Spears also implicated himself in the crimes, according to court documents and the clemency petition. A transcript of Spears\u2019 statement to police, cited in the petition, said he told police that Collings handed him a cord and that he killed Rowan.",
      "\u201cI choke her with it. I realize she\u2019s gone. She\u2019s ... she\u2019s really gone,\u201d Spears said, according to the transcript. It was Spears who led authorities to the sinkhole where her body was found, according to court documents.",
      "No phone listing could be found for Spears.",
      "The clemency petition and the Supreme Court appeal both challenge the reliability of the key law enforcement witness at Collings' trial, a police chief from a neighboring town who had four AWOL convictions while serving in the Army. Failure to disclose details about that criminal history at trial violated Collings\u2019 right to due process, Weis contends.",
      "\u201cHis credibility was really at the heart of the entire case against Mr. Collings,\" Weis said in an interview.",
      "Three men have been executed in Missouri this year \u2014 Brian Dorsey on April 9, David Hosier on June 11 and Marcellus Williams on Sept. 24. Only Alabama, with six, and Texas, with five, have performed more executions than Missouri in 2024."

      "President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to go back on his word and pardon his son Hunter wasn't all that surprising to those who are familiar with the president's devotion to his family",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to go back on his word and issue a categorical pardon for his son, Hunter, just weeks before his scheduled sentencing on gun and tax convictions was a surprise that wasn't all that surprising.",
      "Not to those who had witnessed the president\u2019s shared anguish over his two sons after the boys survived a car crash that killed Biden's first wife and a daughter more than a half-century ago. Or to those who heard the president regularly lament the death of his older son, Beau, from cancer or voice concerns \u2014 largely in private \u2014 about Hunter\u2019s sobriety and health after years of deep addiction.",
      "But by choosing to put his family first, the 82-year-old president \u2014 who had pledged to restore a fractured public\u2019s trust in the nation\u2019s institutions and respect for the rule of law \u2014 has raised new questions about his already teetering legacy.",
      "\u201cThis is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation,\u201d Colorado's Democratic Gov. Jared Polis wrote in a post on X. He added that while he could sympathize with Hunter Biden\u2019s struggles, \u201cno one is above the law, not a President and not a President\u2019s son.\u201d",
      "Biden aides and allies had been resigned to the prospect of the president using his extraordinary power in the waning days of his presidency to ensure his son wouldn't see time behind bars, especially after Donald Trump \u2019s win. The president's supporters have long viewed Biden's commitment to his family as an asset overall, even if Hunter's personal conduct and tangled business dealings were seen as a persistent liability.",
      "But the pardon comes as Biden has become increasingly isolated since the loss to Trump by Vice President Kamala Harris, who jumped in to the race after the president\u2019s catastrophic debate against Trump in June forced his exit from the election.",
      "He is still struggling to resolve thorny foreign policy issues in the Middle East and Europe. And he must reckon with his decision to seek reelection despite his advanced age, which helped return the Oval Office to Trump, a man he had warned time and again was a threat to democratic norms.",
      "Trump has gleefully planned to undo Biden\u2019s signature achievements on climate change and reverse the Democrat's efforts to reinvigorate the country\u2019s alliances, all while standing poised to take credit for a strengthening economy and billions in infrastructure investments that are in the pipeline for the coming years.",
      "And now, Biden has handed the Republican a pretext to carry through with sweeping plans to upend the Department of Justice as the Republican vows to seek retribution against supposed adversaries.",
      "\u201cThis pardon is just deflating for those of us who\u2019ve been out there for a few years yelling about what a threat Trump is,\u201d Republican Joe Walsh, a vocal Trump critic, said on MSNBC. \u201c\u2018Nobody\u2019s above the law,\u2019 we\u2019ve been screaming. Well, Joe Biden just made clear his son Hunter is above the law.\u201d",
      "Jean-Pierre said Monday from Air Force One that the president wrestled with the decision but ultimately felt his son\u2019s case had been tainted by politics, though she tried to thread the needle \u2014 insisting he had faith in the Justice Department.",
      "\u201cHe believes in the justice system, but he also believes that politics infected the process and led to a miscarriage of justice,\u201d she said.",
      "But Trump has already made very clear his intent to disrupt federal law enforcement with his initial nomination of outspoken critics like former Rep. Matt Gaetz to be attorney general and Kash Patel to replace FBI Director Christopher Wray, who nominally still has more than two years left in his term. (Gaetz ended up quickly withdrawing his name amid scrutiny over sex trafficking allegations.)",
      "Reacting to the pardon, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement: \u201cThat system of justice must be fixed and due process must be restored for all Americans, which is exactly what President Trump will do as he returns to the White House with an overwhelming mandate from the American people.\"",
      "In a social media post, the president-elect himself called the pardon \u201csuch an abuse and miscarriage of Justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cDoes the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?\u201d Trump asked. He was referring to those convicted in the violent Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by his supporters aiming to overturn the 2020 presidential election result.",
      "Biden and his spokespeople had repeatedly and flatly ruled out the president granting his son a pardon.",
      "In June, Biden told reporters as his son faced trial in the Delaware gun case, \u201cI abide by the jury decision. I will do that and I will not pardon him.\u201d",
      "In July, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters: \u201cIt's still a no. It will be a no. It is a no. And I don\u2019t have anything else to add. Will he pardon his son? No.\"",
      "In November, days after Trump's victory, Jean-Pierre reiterated that message: \u201cOur answer stands, which is no.\"",
      "Neither Biden nor the White House explained the shift in the president's thinking, and it was his broken promise as much as his act of clemency that was a lightning rod.",
      "He is hardly the first president to pardon a family member or friend entangled in political dealings. Bill Clinton pardoned his brother Roger for drug charges after he had served his sentence roughly a decade earlier. In his final weeks in office, Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in law, Jared Kushner, as well as multiple allies convicted in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.",
      "Yet Biden held himself up as placing his respect for the American judicial system and rule of law over his own personal concerns \u2014 trying to draw a deliberate contrast with Trump, who tested the bounds of his authority like few predecessors.",
      "Inside the White House, the timing of the pardon was surprising to some who believed Biden would put it off as long as possible, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke to The AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. It came just after Biden spent extended time over the past week with Hunter and other family members on Nantucket in Massachusetts, a family tradition for Thanksgiving.",
      "\u201cI believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice \u2013 and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further,\u201d Biden said in a statement announcing the pardon.",
      "Some in the administration have privately expressed anguish that the substance of Biden\u2019s statement, including his claim of an unfair politically-tinged prosecution of his son resembled complaints Trump \u2014 who faced now-abandoned indictments over his role in trying to subvert the 2020 election \u2014 has been making for years about the Justice Department.",
      "Biden said the charges in his son's cases \"came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.\u201d Many legal experts agreed that the charges against the younger Biden were somewhat unusual, but the facts of the offenses were hardly in dispute, as Hunter wrote about his gun purchase while addicted to illegal drugs in his memoir and ultimately pleaded guilty to the tax charges.",
      "The pardon too was unusual, coming before Hunter Biden was even sentences and covering not just the gun and tax offenses against his son, but also anything else he might have done going back to the start of 2014.",
      "It's a move that could limit the ability of the Trump Justice Department to investigate the younger Biden's unsavory foreign business dealings, or to find new ground on which to bring criminal charges related to that time period.",
      "Biden, in his statement, asked for consideration: \u201cI hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.\"",

      "David Prosser, who rose to become speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly before an 18-year tenure on the state Supreme Court that was marked by a heated altercation with another justice, has died",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- MADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 David Prosser, who rose to become speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly before an 18-year tenure on the state Supreme Court that was marked by a heated altercation with another justice, has died. He was 81 years old.",
      "Prosser died on Sunday after battling cancer for several months, his family said in a statement Monday. A Republican, Prosser served 18 years in the Assembly, the last two as speaker, and the same amount of time on the state Supreme Court. He retired from the court in 2016.",
      "Prosser was involved in some of Wisconsin's most contentious political battles, most notably the 2011 law championed by then-Republican Gov. Scott Walker that effectively ended collective bargaining for most public workers. Prosser ran for reelection that year, which turned that contest into a referendum of sorts on Walker and the proposed law.",
      "Prosser's narrow victory that April, by 7,006 votes, survived a recount. A couple of months later, he got into a physical altercation with a liberal justice when they were arguing in her office about the court\u2019s ruling that would uphold the anti-union law known as Act 10.",
      "Justice Ann Walsh Bradley accused Prosser of putting his hands around her neck \u201c in a chokehold \u201d while the justices were discussing the case in June 2011. The court issued a split decision upholding the law, with Prosser siding with the conservative majority.",
      "The incident was investigated but no charges were filed. The Wisconsin Judicial Commission filed an ethics complaint against Prosser, but the court did not have a quorum to consider it after the three other conservative justices recused themselves.",
      "In 2023, Prosser and two other retired justices were tapped by Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos to advise him on whether liberal Justice Janet Protasiewicz could be impeached for comments she made while running for a seat on the court. Prosser advised against impeachment and Vos didn't pursue it.",
      "Prosser graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison law school in 1968. He worked as an attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice and as a lecturer at the Indiana University-Indianapolis law school during the late 1960s and early 1970s.",
      "He was elected to the state Assembly as a Republican in 1978 after a stint as Outagamie County district attorney. A baseball fan, he helped lead the push to provide funding for Miller Park, the Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 stadium now known as American Family Field.",
      "After nearly two years as a member of the Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission, Prosser was appointed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in 1998 by then-Gov. Tommy Thompson. Prosser won election to 10-year terms in 2001 and again in 2011. He retired midway through that term, in 2016.",
      "Thompson, who was governor when Prosser was speaker of the Assembly, said in a statement Monday that Prosser \u201cbrought common sense solutions to the issues our state faced.\u201d",
      "\u201cI could always count on him to be candid in discussions and results oriented in action,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cDavid could count votes, and delivered when it mattered.\u201d",
      "Wisconsin Supreme Court Chief Justice Annette Ziegler said Prosser \u201cprofoundly shaped the legal, legislative, and judicial landscape of Wisconsin.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis exemplary service in all three branches of government demonstrated his unparalleled versatility and dedication to the public good,\u201d she said.",
      "Prosser's time on the high court was marked by his altercation with Bradley and feuds between the conservative and liberal justices, most notably former Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson.",
      "Emails emerged in 2011 showing Prosser used an expletive to describe Abrahamson in 2010 and threatened to \u201cdestroy\u201d her as the justices debated whether to remove conservative-leaning Justice Mike Gableman from a criminal case.",
      "Upon his retirement, the state Supreme Court named the Wisconsin Law Library across the street from the Capitol for Prosser. But in June, the Wisconsin Supreme Court removed his name in favor of Lavinia Goodell, Wisconsin\u2019s first female lawyer."

    "story": [
      "House prices grew at the fastest annual pace for two years in November, according to the latest survey from Nationwide.",
      "The lender said the price of a typical UK home rose by 3.7% last month compared to a year earlier, with property values close to a record high.",
      "It said the acceleration in house price growth was \"surprising, since affordability remains stretched by historic standards\".",
      "Housing experts predict the market will see the number of sales increase over the next few months, ahead of changes to stamp duty due to take place in April.",
      "House prices rose by 1.2% between October and November, Nationwide said, the biggest month-on-month increase since March 2022.",
      "The average property now costs \u00a3268,144, according to the building society, close to the record high of \u00a3273,751 reached in August 2022.",
      "Nationwide noted that the housing market had remained \"relatively resilient\" in recent months, with the number of mortgages approved at near pre-pandemic levels.",
      "Mortgage approvals in October hit the highest monthly level since August 2022, according to Bank of England figures released last week.",
      "Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said low levels of unemployment combined with pay increases that were outstripping inflation had helped to \"underpin\" the housing market.",
      "Stamp duty",
      "In the Budget in October, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said that reduced stamp duty rates in England and Northern Ireland would end in April next year.",
      "Some housing market analysts said this announcement was behind the big rise in prices last month. However, Mr Gardner said it was \"unlikely\" this had been the case \"since the majority of mortgage applications commenced before the Budget announcement\".",
      "The changes will mean that house buyers will start paying stamp duty on properties over \u00a3125,000, instead of over \u00a3250,000 at the moment.",
      "First-time buyers currently pay no stamp duty on homes up to \u00a3425,000, but this will drop to \u00a3300,000 in April.",
      "Nationwide said it expected a jump in house sales in the first three months of 2025 as people tried to beat the deadline, followed by a decline in activity in the following few months.",
      "Overall, Mr Gardner said he expected the housing market to strengthen gradually as consumers' spending power was boosted by lower interest rates and higher pay.",
      "However, Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that with prices near record highs and mortgage rates remaining \"relatively high\", there was a \"a growing chance that affordability raises its ugly head again\".",
      "Mortgage rates",
      "Mortgage rates started falling in the summer after the Bank of England began cutting its key interest rate.",
      "However, mortgage rates have edged up in recent weeks on expectations that the Bank will not cut rates as quickly as had been previously expected.",
      "In addition, there are still millions of people who are set to see their mortgage repayments increase over the next few years, as their current fixed-rate deals come to an end.",
      "Last week, the Bank of England estimated that about 4.4 million mortgage holders are expected to see payments rise by 2027.",
      "It said a typical owner-occupier coming off a fixed rate in the next two years would see their monthly mortgage repayments increase by around \u00a3146.",
      "According to financial information website Moneyfacts, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate is currently 5.52%, while the average five-year fixed rate is 5.28%.",
      "To get over the problem of mortgage affordability, an increasing number of homebuyers are taking out deals over longer-than-usual time periods.",
      "Ultra-long, or extended, mortgages have become more popular as people aim to spread the cost of buying a house.",
      "More than a million mortgages have been issued in the past three years which homebuyers are set to still be repaying into pension age.",

      "\u201cTyphoo is such an iconic brand,\u201d said Supreme chief executive Sandy Chadha. The company said the decision to buy it was a mix of \"sound business rationale and personal affinity\".",

      "Before his resignation, Mr Tavares was one of the most powerful people in the global motor industry.",

      "\"However, in recent weeks different views have emerged which have resulted in the board and the chief executive coming to today\u2019s decision.\"",
      "Mr Tavares had a reputation as a ruthless cost-cutter.",
      "He made his name at Renault, working with the colourful and controversial chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, before taking the top job at PSA Group.",
      "At the time, the French group was close to bankruptcy. He was credited with turning it around before orchestrating a merger with Fiat Chrysler to form Stellantis in 2021, creating a global giant.",
      "\"He was known for being able to turn around companies that were troubled,\" Hans Greimel, Asia editor at Automotive News, told the BBC.",
      "However, Mr Tavares\u2019 position has been undermined recently by a dramatic fall in sales and profits at the company.",
      "\"Critics would say he was just cost-cutting too much and delaying products and also hurting quality,\" said Mr Greimel.",

      "He said: \u201cWhat\u2019s really, really driving that, I think, is the situation in North America where they\u2019ve had appalling results, a very dated product line-up, rising inventories and slipping market share as a result of which all the stakeholders involved \u2013 suppliers, dealers, workers, investors  - are deeply unhappy.",

      "Mr Tavares already agreed to step down in 2026, rather than extending his contract \u2013 a move that arguably weakened his position significantly.",
      "Stellantis said it now expects to appoint a new boss by the middle of next year.",
      "In the meantime, it will set up a new interim executive committee, headed by the firm's chair John Elkann who is a member of the powerful Agnelli family of Italian industrialists.",
      "Mr Elkann controls a significant voting stake in the group on behalf of his family.",
      "He is the one currently leading the search for Mr Tavares\u2019 successor and his views will be crucial in shaping the future of the automotive giant.",
      "Mr Tavares frequently made headlines in the UK by casting doubt over the future of Vauxhall operations, linking it to issues such as Brexit and government plans to force carmakers to build more electric cars.",
      "It is not yet clear whether his departure will affect the planned closure of Stellantis' Luton plant.",
      "Stellantis's Vauxhall plant in Luton currently builds petrol and diesel vans and had been due to start making its medium-sized Vivaro electric van from 2025, before the decision to close it.",

      "On what the change at the top means for Luton, Prof Bailey said: \"I think everything is up in the air. Whether or not that could be reversed I don\u2019t know. One would hope but I suspect that that has gone sadly.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think there are any guarantees about the future whatsoever of Stellantis\u2019s operations in the UK.\""

      "It\u2019s a controversial topic that divides opinion: should people with bigger cars pay more for parking?",
      "Cardiff has become the latest council to ponder the question. As part of a public consultation, it\u2019s asking for views on whether residents with larger vehicles should pay more for permits.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re consulting on the principle of whether it\u2019s right... if you're driving a larger or more polluting vehicle, to pay a bit more,\u201d council leader Huw Thomas told the BBC this week.",
      "\u201cThese are vehicles that take up more space, they cause more damage to our roads, and if they happen to hit a pedestrian they\u2019re likely to cause more serious injuries,\u201d he said.",
      "Other councils, including Bristol, Oxford and Haringey in north London are also looking into the option of charging larger vehicles more.",
      "So, back to Mr Thomas\u2019s question: is it right?",
      "We headed to Haringey to see what local residents thought.",
      "\"I think it's a load of crap,\u201d Nev says, adding he has grown weary of traffic-reducing and environmental policies in the borough.",
      "\"We're already paying more if you\u2019ve got a big car. You're paying more tax, you pay more for petrol to fill it. That's your business.\"",
      "But fellow resident Gary Oliva says: \"If you can afford a large car, then you can afford to pay for it.",
      "\"Public transport in London is very, very good. If you want to get from A to B get on a bus, get on a train, get on the tube.\"",
      "However, Selin Akdenez, who is a single mum and drives an SUV, says parking in London is already expensive, and the prospect of paying more for residential parking is something that she couldn\u2019t afford.",

      "A YouGov poll last year found 39% of adults thought there should be higher parking fees for bigger and heavier cars, while 53% thought all cars should have the same parking fees.",
      "The split was much closer in London than in any other region, with 45% thinking bigger cars should pay higher fees, and 44% thinking they shouldn\u2019t.",
      "Heavier or longer?",
      "But what do we actually mean by bigger?",
      "In Haringey, where the price of a permit already varies depending on your car\u2019s emissions, the council proposed adding a 5% surcharge for medium vehicles 4-4.49m long, and a 10% surcharge for large vehicles over 4.5m long.",
      "To put that in context, a Kia Picanto would count as a small car, a Volvo V40 or BMW 1 Series medium, and an MG5 or Land Rover Discovery large.",
      "Haringey's public consultation has just closed. The council says no decisions have been taken on any of the proposals.",
      "In Belgium, Brussels has a length-based system in place in certain parts of the city. A residential permit costs \u20ac25 (\u00a321) per year but if your vehicle is over 4.9m long you pay an additional charge of \u20ac120 per year.",
      "In Cardiff, weight is the factor under consideration, whether vehicles over 2.4 tonnes revenue weight should pay more, although no price has been suggested. Revenue weight refers to the maximum weight of a vehicle, including passengers, fuel and luggage.",
      "In Autocar\u2019s list of the best family SUVs, four out of the top five would exceed this limit - the Kia EV9, Land Rover Discovery Sport, Hyundai Santa Fe, and Volvo XC60.",

      "\u201cThese bigger cars not only burn more fuel, they take up more space,\" he says.",
      "Even big electric cars have issues because they take up more room and are more dangerous than smaller electric cars, he adds.",

      "\u201cIf you look at key workers or people who live outside the city - these are not two-car families, these are one car [households] because that\u2019s what the family budget allows for. So it will be big - an estate or an SUV.\u201d",
      "Luke Bosdet from motoring organisation the AA says it is reasonable to charge more for vehicles that exceed the length of a standard parking space.",
      "\u201cI would think that vehicle length is a measure that residents would understand better and go along with, particularly with the squeeze on parking in residential streets.\u201d",
      "However, he says: \u201cOther reasons for increased permit costs, such as fuel type or level of CO2 emissions are not. Other taxes, such as vehicle excise duty, company car tax, ULEZ (Ultra Low Emission Zone) and CAZ (Clean Air Zone) charges do that.\u201d",

      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",

What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",

    "summary": "Two in five new mortgages have terms that will see homeowners still making payments in retirement.",
    "story": [
      "More than a million mortgages have been issued in the past three years which home-buyers are set to still be repaying into pension age.",
      "The latest data shows that two in five new mortgages have terms that see homeowners still making payments in retirement.",
      "Ultra-long, or extended, mortgages have become more popular during a time of higher interest rates as people aim to spread the cost.",
      "But this will ultimately make the loan more expensive, and experts say it raises serious questions over financial planning for retirement.",
      "At the end of 2021, about three in 10 mortgages took repayments into pension age, according to Bank of England figures obtained by the pension consultancy LCP.",
      "That proportion grew as interest rates rose. Despite interest rates having fallen from their peak, LCP said the trend appeared to have continued.",
      "\u201cThere is increasing evidence that taking out a mortgage which runs past pension age is an entrenched feature of the mortgage market rather than a temporary blip,\" said Steve Webb, a former pensions minister who is now a partner at LCP.",
      "\"This has profound implications for retirement planning, as it is likely to mean that savers may end up using already inadequate pension pots to clear a mortgage balance.\"",
      "The temptation for young homeowners is obvious. A longer mortgage term would reduce monthly repayments.",
      "But with the average age of first-time buyers rising - it now stands at nearly 34 - the question of how people will be able to afford mortgage payments when they hope to retire becomes increasingly important.",
      "Why mortgage costs are rising despite interest rate cut",
      "Will UK interest rate cut make mortgages and loans cheaper?",
      "'I'm trapped in a joint mortgage with my abuser'",
      "UK Finance, the banking and lenders' trade body, said only 3% of mortgage-holders were currently paying off a mortgage after the age of 65.",
      "While many young homeowners have chosen longer mortgage terms to make repayments more manageable, they may opt for shorter terms in the future if their salaries improve or they move house.",
      "That is why UK Finance expects only a small fraction of the mortgages taken out now to ultimately go into borrowers' retirement years.",
      "However, it does also raise the prospect of some people having to work longer until a mortgage is paid off, or they may choose to downsize.",
      "Lenders set limits",
      "Lenders are relatively flexible on allowing people to take out these longer-term mortgages, but there are constraints, according to David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker L&C.",
      "\"There will often still be maximum age limits at the end of the mortgage term and lenders will need to be sure that the borrowing will be affordable,\" he said.",
      "\"That will require borrowers to show that their post-retirement income is adequate.\"",
      "Affordability checks became stricter after the financial crisis of nearly 20 years ago, with lenders needing proof that mortgage applicants could cope with rising interest rates.",
      "The reality for many people is that getting any kind of mortgage remains unaffordable.",
      "Data published earlier in the week shows the dynamics of renting and owning, and their effect on financial strains and life satisfaction.",
      "\"The proportion of people renting privately doubled during the 2000s, and while it has levelled off at around a fifth of households, or a third in London, we\u2019re seeing people renting later in life,\" said Sarah Coles, from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown.",

    "title": "Five ways to persuade more people to buy electric cars",
    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:20:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Demand for electric cars is lower than expected, the industry says. What might help to boost sales?",
    "story": [
      "The government is facing a backlash from car manufacturers, who claim that current rules designed to promote electric vehicles are too harsh.",
      "They say consumer demand for electric cars has fallen far short of what was expected, meaning they are struggling to sell enough.",
      "Ford insists this was a factor in its recent decision to cut 800 UK jobs.",
      "Vauxhall's owner Stellantis is to close its van-making plant in Luton - partly, it says, because of the new rules.",
      "So what could be done to encourage more consumers to buy electric?",
      "1. Subsidise the cost",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) are generally more expensive to buy than their petrol or diesel equivalents. This is partly because they still represent a relatively small proportion of cars being built, so economies of scale \u2013 when the cost comes down the more you build \u2013 have not yet properly kicked in.",
      "The government already offers some subsidies to make EVs cheaper. They attract a low rate of company car tax, for example. Salary sacrifice schemes allow workers to lease cars cheaply through their employers, using their untaxed income, which can offer significant savings.",
      "But since the abolition of the plug-in grant for cars in 2022, there has not been a similar incentive for people who cannot get a car through their company. People within the industry believe that should change.",
      "Automotive journalist Quentin Willson, who now fronts the campaign group FairCharge, thinks the government should consider \u201cinterest free loans on used electric vehicles for lower income drivers and halve the VAT on new cars\u201d. This, he suggests, could be funded by abandoning the current freeze on fuel duty.",
      "2. Make cheaper electric cars",
      "The price of electric cars is coming down, partly due to cheaper battery packs. Despite sharp fluctuations in the value of metals used to make them, such as lithium and cobalt, battery pack prices have fallen by about 70% since 2015.",
      "This has helped reduce the price gap between electric and conventional cars. Earlier this year, Stellantis began offering the electric version of its Frontera model at the same price as the petrol hybrid model.",
      "However, that doesn\u2019t mean it is easy to find a low-budget electric car. There is a shortage of truly cheap options on the market.",
      "That is partly because a number of manufacturers have preferred to focus on more expensive and potentially more profitable models. But as Roger Atkins, founder of the Electric Vehicles Outlook consultancy, puts it, \u201ccars that cost \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000 are not the kind of cars everyone can buy\u201d.",
      "However, change is around the corner. The Dacia Spring went on sale in the UK a few weeks ago, with a starting price of \u00a314,995. The newly launched Leapmotor T03 costs very little more, while Chinese giant BYD has said it will bring a version of its super-budget Seagull model to the UK next year.",
      "Vauxhall owner to close Luton factory",
      "Ford calls for incentives to buy electric cars as backlash grows",
      "3. Cut out the confusion",
      "The government says the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2030 \u2013 but will it?",
      "Plans to force conventional cars off the market were originally meant to take effect in 2040, under plans introduced by Theresa May's government. But the target was brought forward to 2030 under Boris Johnson, then delayed to 2035 under Rishi Sunak.",
      "People within the industry claim the changing target has sent out mixed messages and confused consumers, leading some people to delay buying an electric car until the situation becomes clearer.",
      "According to Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of electric charging guide Zapmap, many drivers are \u201cconfused about dates, concerned on costs and have questions about charging.\u201d She says \u201ca consistent factual communication programme\" is needed, supported by government.",
      "4. Cut VAT on public charging points",
      "Although the cost of using public charging points can vary widely depending on the provider and the charging speed you choose, public chargers are usually more expensive than charging at home.",
      "This is partly due to tax. An EV owner charging a car on their drive will pay 5% VAT on the electricity they consume. But if they use a public charger they will pay 20%. People who are unable to charge at home are left with no choice but to pay the higher rate.",
      "The industry, EV advocates and even a House of Lords committee have called for the public rate to be reduced to 5%",
      "Consultant Roger Atkins claims the current policy is \u201cdivisive\u201d, because it \u201cfavours better-off people who can charge at home on their driveways\u201d.",
      "5. Sort out the public charging network",
      "Read any survey of potential buyers\u2019 attitudes towards electric cars, and concerns about charging infrastructure will be at or near the top. People worry about whether they will be able to find a charger at a busy service station, or in a rural area.",
      "The number of charging points is growing. According to ZapMap, as of October this year, there were 71,459 charging points across the UK, at 36,060 locations. This was a 38% increase on the year before.",
      "But not everyone is happy. Complaints from existing owners struggling to find a charging point, having to queue for a long time or arriving to find it broken are not hard to find.",
      "As more EVs come onto the roads, many more charging points will be needed. The government wants 300,000 in place by 2030 \u2013 but the current rate of expansion is not fast enough to reach it.",
      "Part of the blame appears to lie with local authorities, who are responsible for granting planning permission for new rapid charging hubs. According to Roger Atkins, the process simply takes too long.",
      "Simon Smith, of charging firm Instavolt agrees that red tape is a problem. He thinks that difficulties getting grid connections for rapid charging stations is also a \"critical barrier\" to expanding the network.",
      "\"We need greater support to address planning delays, local council resistance and grid connectivity challenges\", he says."

      "Her life would have been much easier had she had a right to maternity leave, paid by her employer.",
      "Under a new law in Belgium - the first of its kind in the world - this will now be the case. Sex workers will be entitled to official employment contracts, health insurance, pensions, maternity leave and sick days. Essentially, it will be treated like any other job.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to exist as people,\u201d Sophie says.",
      "There are tens of millions of sex workers worldwide. Sex work was decriminalised in Belgium in 2022 and is legal in several countries including Germany, Greece, the Netherlands and Turkey. But establishing employment rights and contracts is a global first.",
      "\u201cThis is radical, and it\u2019s the best step we have seen anywhere in the world so far,\u201d says Erin Kilbride, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cWe need every country to be moving in that direction.\u201d",

      "For many sex workers, the job is a necessity, and the law could not come soon enough.",
      "Mel was horrified when she was forced to give a client oral sex without a condom, when she knew a sexually transmitted infection (STI) was going round the brothel. But she felt she had no option.",
      "\u201cMy choice was either to spread the disease, or make no money.\u201d",
      "She had become an escort when she was 23 - she needed money, and quickly started earning beyond expectations. She thought she had struck gold, but the experience with the STI brought her sharply back to earth.",

      "\u201cI could have pointed the finger at my madam [employer] and said: \u2018You're violating these terms and this is how you should treat me.\u2019 I would have been legally protected.\u201d",
      "Belgium\u2019s decision to change the law was the result of months of protests in 2022, prompted by the lack of state support during the Covid pandemic.",
      "One of those at the forefront was Victoria, president of the Belgian Union of Sex Workers (UTSOPI) and previously an escort for 12 years.",
      "For her, it was a personal fight. Victoria regards prostitution as a social service, with sex being only about 10% of what she does.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s giving people attention, listening to their stories, eating cake with them, dancing to waltz music,\u201d she explains. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about loneliness.\u201d",
      "But the illegality of her job before 2022 raised significant challenges. She worked in unsafe conditions, with no choice over her clients and her agency taking a big cut of her earnings.",
      "In fact, Victoria says she was raped by a client who had become obsessed with her.",
      "She went to a police station, where she says the female officer was \u201cso hard\u201d on her.",
      "\"She told me sex workers can't be raped. She made me feel it was my fault, because I did that job.\u201d Victoria left the station crying.",
      "Every sex worker we spoke to told us that at some point they had been pressured to do something against their will.",
      "Because of that, Victoria fiercely believes this new law will improve their lives.",
      "\u201cIf there is no law and your job is illegal, there are no protocols to help you. This law gives people the tools to make us safer.\u201d",
      "Pimps who control sex work will be allowed to operate legally under the new law - provided they follow strict rules. Anyone who has been convicted of a serious crime will not be allowed to employ sex workers.",
      "\u201cI think many businesses will have to shut down, because a lot of employers have a criminal record,\u201d says Kris Reekmans. He and his wife Alexandra run a massage parlour on Love Street in the small town of Bekkevoort.",

    "story": [
      "\"It's not just about brewing a good cup of coffee but connecting with customers on a deeper level.\"",
      "It was this one thought that made Harmanpreet Singh leave his family bakery to open a specialty coffee shop in the northern Indian city of Jalandhar.",
      "It was an unexpected decision - coffee has always been popular in southern states, traditionally served strong and frothy in a steel tumbler. But it's still not the first choice of beverage in the vast swathes of north India, where drinking tea is an intrinsic part of the culture.",
      "For Mr Singh, the journey began in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic when he saw a growing demand for specialty coffee, particularly among the city's youth and the overseas residents who returned to the country at that time.",
      "Recognising this shift, he moved to the southern city of Bengaluru to learn brewing techniques. \"I studied everything - from the way coffee is served to the role things like decor, cutlery, music and even packaging played in the overall experience,\" he said.",
      "Three months later, Mr Singh put his learnings to test and opened Buland Caf\u00e9 in Jalandhar.",
      "Today, the cafe has 40 outlets across the city and has become a favourite spot for the city's youth, who come here to relax or work over piping cups of coffee.",
      "The beans, roasted in various blends, are sourced from the famed coffee estates of  Karnataka. Mr Singh says he personally trained his staff on how to brew the perfect cuppa and take care of the coffee machine.",
      "\"It's a thriving scene,\" he says.",
      "Mr Singh is among a crop of young entrepreneurs that are benefitting from a wave of specialty coffee consumption in small north Indian towns and cities.",
      "India has had a vibrant cafe culture for years - but it has been largely restricted to big cities where homegrown specialty and international coffee chains dominate the market.",
      "However, post-Covid, several tier-two cities are also seeing a boom in demand for such spaces as people embrace practices like remote working and look for new places to meet their friends and families.",
      "Cafe owners say more Indians are now willing to pay more for coffee that's roasted in smaller batches and customised as per their preferences.",
      "\"Clients have become more knowledgeable about the roasts and are interested in the origins of their coffee,\" says Bharat Singhal, the founder of Billi Hu roasteries.",
      "In fact, more than 44% of the Indian population now drinks coffee, a 2023 report by CRISIL, a marketing analytical company, shows.",
      "While a lot of it comes from home consumption, the growing demand for specialty coffee in small cities plays a big part, says Bhavi Patel, a coffee consultant and dairy technologist.",
      "Roastery owners say the growth is also evident in numbers. \"Subscription based orders have surged by 50% in one year,\" says Sharang Sharma, the founder of Bloom Coffee Roasters. \"Customers have moved from French presses to pour-over or espresso machines, adopting more sophisticated brewing methods.\"",
      "While India is often associated with tea, it also has a long coffee-drinking history.",
      "The culture took shape in the 1900s when Indian Coffee Houses emerged as a hangout spot for the intellectual and elite class. Housed in colonial-styled buildings, these cafes served English breakfasts with steaming hot coffee and offered a space to discuss politics and mobilise support during pivotal periods in history.",
      "A shift occurred in the 1990s when economic reforms opened India to the world, allowing entrepreneurs to open private coffee shops frequented by young peeople, who saw it as a hip experience.",
      "Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day (CCD), which opened in 1996, quickly became one of India\u2019s most popular and widespread coffee chains. At its peak, CCD boasted over 1,700 outlets, serving as a popular gathering spot for students and young adults. But mounting debt, management issues and the untimely death of its founder led to a closure of most of its outlets across India.",
      "In 2012, the arrival of international giant Starbucks spurred the rise of homegrown specialty coffee brands like Blue Tokai Roasters, Third Wave Coffee and Subko Coffee.",
      "Mr Singhal says that while big cities like Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai, and Bengaluru still dominate the scene, smaller cities are quickly catching up.",
      "However, it's not just changing palettes that's driving consumption. \"Often it's social media,\" Mr Singh says. \"People want good coffee but they also want to be in a space that's trendy and which they can post online.\"",
      "Nishant Sinha from Lucknow city is among those who understood the trend early on.",
      "His Roastery Coffee House offers trendy ambience, free wi-fi and cosy seating options along with an array of coffee roasts. While the beans are sourced from coffee estates in the south, the food is distinctively north Indian.",
      "Others like Jatin Khurana in the northern city of Ludhiana are experimenting with flavours.",
      "At his Urban Buhkkad cafe, Mr Khurana serves the \"Shadi Wali Coffee [the wedding coffee]\" - a wedding favourite in the 1990s, which became famous for its blend of instant coffee, milk, sugar, and a sprinkle of chocolate powder.",
      "But instead of coffee powder, Mr Khurana uses freshly grounded beans, available in different roasts and varieties, to enhance its flavours. \"The idea is to capture the essence of the beverage that many Indians grew up drinking,\" he says.",
      "It's an exciting time to be in the business - but growth comes with its own set of challenges.",
      "\"Demand is growing, but a smaller coffee shop owners tend to cut corners, whether it\u2019s by opting for substandard machines, serving weaker coffee shots, or hiring inexperienced baristas,\" Mr Singhal says.",
      "And running the business is not always profitable given the high price of coffee and the infrastructural costs involved in running such spaces.",
      "When Neha Das and Nishant Ashish opened The Eden\u2019s caf\u00e9 in Ranchi in 2021, they wanted to create a safe and relaxed space for young students to get together in the city.",
      "Today, their hazelnut coffee and cold brews have become a favourite of many.",
      "\"It took some time but longevity requires more than profit,\" Ms Das says.",

      "Four other former directors have anonymously confirmed elements of this picture.",
      "A US citizen, Mr Brilliant was 36 when he joined the firm in August 2000. He was hired to relaunch the Harrods online business.",
      "He says that shortly before his first business trip to visit Microsoft in Seattle, Al Fayed gave him a brown envelope containing $5,000 (\u00a33,993) in $50 notes.",
      "After the trip he tried to return the full amount. He says Al Fayed refused, asking him, \u201cYou didn't need any entertainment?\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant replied that he did not need it - he had been too busy to visit the cinema or theatre, and someone else had paid for dinner.",
      "Receiving cash ahead of business trips - large-value notes of pounds, francs or dollars depending on his destination - continued over the following six months.",
      "Three senior colleagues suggested to Mr Brilliant at the time that Al Fayed was trying to get him to compromise himself.",
      "Mr Brilliant says they told him: \u201cHe was trying to get you to come back and say \u2018oh, I spent money on drugs or I spent money frolicking, doing something that I shouldn't have been doing,\u2019 and that he would then use that information against you if you should ever turn on him.\u201d",
      "He adds: \u201cI am certainly aware of people who... succumbed to the temptation.\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant continued trying to return the money, until his family arrived in London and he started looking for a home. With Al Fayed\u2019s consent, he put it towards the purchase of a property.",
      "Al Fayed had form for using envelopes of cash as a tool of power and control. It had caused a scandal in the 1990s after he paid MPs to ask questions in the House of Commons - and then exposed those who had accepted his gifts.",
      "Mr Brilliant believes he was not immune to Al Fayed\u2019s extensive use of bugging and surveillance, carried out by the Harrods owner\u2019s large team of security guards.",
      "\u201cEven when I tell this story to you right now, I get kind of goosebumps and the hair stands up on the back of my neck, realising that my phones were being listened in on,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant\u2019s first suspicion that he may have been bugged came in 2002, shortly before he was fired. After a disagreement about the funding of Fulham FC, words from a private phone conversation with someone in the US were quoted back to him in a meeting.",
      "Another former Harrods director, who wanted to remain anonymous, told us he had moved into an Al Fayed-owned property when he started at the store and one of the security team warned him it was bugged.",
      "The director says he and his wife would jokingly say \u201cgood morning\u201d to the security guards who might be listening when they woke up.",
      "He noticed that many directors kept a personal mobile phone as well as a work phone, because they feared the Harrods phone might be bugged.",
      "Mr Brilliant, who has returned to the US, says he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d when he first heard the BBC investigation.",
      "\u201cI do look back and say, \u2018should I have seen something? Did I miss something?\u2019 And I've gone over it and over it,\u201d he says.",
      "He worked in Al Fayed\u2019s \u201cring of steel\u201d office suite on the fifth floor of Harrods, protected by two sets of security doors. There was a group of administrative assistants who were all young, blonde and attractive - he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant recalls them as \u201cobedient\u201d. He explains: \u201cThere was this notion of \u2018do this, jump, how high should I jump?\u2019 - and really being on the ball. Mohamed demanded a lot of people, and they were serving their role.\u201d",
      "He adds that he now questions whether the women acted in that way because of what may had been happening.",
      "When challenged on whether he should have done more to protect the women he says he asks himself whether he could have.",
      "\u201cI wasn't privy to that amount of information that would otherwise suggest that there was something deeper going on.\u201d",
      "'Frontal lobotomy'",
      "Mr Brilliant says Harrods\u2019 managers were set in opposition to each other and then expected to keep a watchful eye on their rivals.",
      "In addition to his core role, he was given partial oversight of a range of Al Fayed\u2019s interests, including Fulham FC and the Paris Ritz.",
      "\u201cI was asked to oversee people I had no right overseeing,\u201d says Mr Brilliant. In turn, he found that \u201cpeople were looking over my shoulder\u201d.",
      "Information was treated like a \u201ccurrency\u201d and people would jockey to share it to \u201ccurry favour\u201d with the boss, he says.",
      "This has been corroborated by an anonymous director. \u201cThere was no trust between directors,\u201d he told us. \u201cEveryone was on the defensive.\u201d",
      "In his 1997 biography of Al Fayed, journalist Tom Bower described Harrods as a \u201cmedieval court\u201d where executives\u2019 survival depended on \u201cutter loyalty\u201d and \u201ca drip of salacious gossip to sow doubts about rivals\u201d.",
      "Senior managers at Harrods were sacked with such regularity that Mr Brilliant says it was a \u201crunning joke\u201d in the store.",
      "Managers were sacked or quit so frequently that The Sunday Times began to publish a regular count, which reached 48 in 2005 - before a legal letter put a stop to it.",
      "Many dismissals ended in legal action or employment tribunals. Some were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), although Mr Brilliant was not.",
      "But some managers lasted for more than a decade. And to do that, you had to have a \u201cfrontal lobotomy\u201d said Mr Brilliant.",
      "Some, he felt, were compromised and couldn\u2019t speak out. For the others, \u201cI think you had to just do what you were told to do, do it with a smile\u2026 No original thought, no willing to challenge the status quo, just willing to accept.\u201d",
      "The BBC has tried to contact as many long-serving former Harrods directors as possible, but none were willing to give an interview.",
      "Although he only worked there for 18 months, Mr Brilliant said he wanted to speak to the BBC for two reasons.",
      "\u201cOne, if there's anything that I'm able to say or do that shows support for these women who have been horrifically treated, traumatised, I want to do whatever I can.",
      "\u201cSecondly, my hope is that by my willingness to speak out, others will come and speak out themselves.\u201d",

    "title": "Could a thermal camera reveal your home's hidden heat loss?",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Thermal imaging tech has become cheaper and homeowners are using it to track down heat loss.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s like X-ray vision \u2013 for heat loss. Last year, web engineer Jamie Matthews bought a thermal imaging camera. His home, in the southeast of England, was about to give up some of its secrets.",
      "The colourful images on the device\u2019s small screen soon revealed how his loft hatch was letting him down.",
      "\u201cThat was really obvious on the camera,\u201d he says, explaining that he could see cool areas on the hatch, where heat was apparently escaping.",
      "Mr Mathews, who runs a software company that supplies the clean tech industry, also found some other small gaps in external walls and parts of his roof that appeared less well insulated than others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good fun and it certainly shows up things that may not be immediately obvious,\u201d he says.",
      "While Mr Matthews was able to draught-proof some areas himself, he says he would take a more methodical approach if he were planning any major changes to his home. The web engineer later had a professional heat loss survey carried out when he installed a heat pump, for example.",
      "That approach is sensible, according to building physics researchers who spoke to the BBC. There are signs that thermal cameras are becoming more popular, as homeowners seek to slash their heating bills and carbon emissions. Local councils are increasingly allowing residents to borrow the devices for free, for example.",
      "But there is no substitute for professional advice if you are planning big works or interventions, experts say.",
      "Thermal cameras work by using a sensor to detect infrared light, which we cannot see, but which we can sometimes feel as heat. Such devices aren\u2019t cheap. Mr Matthews spent roughly \u00a3160 on his, though organisations including local councils and energy supplier Octopus Energy do loan them out to people free of charge so that they can gain a basic understanding of heat loss in their homes.",
      "Wiltshire Council recently made 11 devices available to borrow from local libraries, as well as a brief guide on how to use them. There has been \u201chuge uptake\u201d says Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, such that the council now has a waiting list for interested residents.",
      "\"Expert advice, combined with a measured approach to the findings from thermal imaging, will give residents the best chance of making informed decisions about energy-saving home improvements,\" says Cllr Blair-Pilling.",
      "Small interventions could help people keep their homes warm and reduce the risk of cold-related health conditions, he adds.",
      "However, Jo Atkinson, senior consultant in buildings decarbonisation at Energy Systems Catapult, a research organisation, expresses concern over the growing availability of thermal cameras: \u201cIn my opinion, the risks are too great for making the wrong choices.\u201d",
      "It is possible to misinterpret thermal camera images, she says, noting that if a wall has been warmed by the sun, an image of that wall taken outside could make it look as though heat is escaping, when it is not. Reflective surfaces can also appear, misleadingly, to be leaking heat.",
      "While using a thermal camera as a starting point for understanding your home is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, according to Ronita Bardhan at the University of Cambridge, it is important to ask for independent expert advice when planning any renovation works.",
      "Thermal camera imagery can make it look as though some areas of your home are losing a lot of heat, but this might simply be a result of how the camera has been calibrated, how the user holds it and moves it around, and which colour palette was chosen for the display.",
      "Dr Bardhan adds that there is a risk of triggering \u201cretrofit anxiety\u201d in homeowners.",
      "Plus, if people go on to alter their insulation, for example, such measures should be taken with great care as improper installation can cause damp and mould.",
      "North Somerset Council provides thermal cameras to residents, on loan, and this scheme is also currently operating on a waiting list basis due to its popularity. The Council has published introductory advice on how to use the cameras, including an online video.",
      "The Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a charity, highlights a more detailed guide from the National House-Building Council, which describes how to use thermal cameras. However, a CSE spokeswoman adds that the organisation still recommends people seek expert advice.",
      "Phil Steele, future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy, agrees: \u201cYou have got to be careful.\u201d Thermal cameras can, for instance, make the corners of rooms look very cold but this is simply a reflection of reduced air circulation in those areas, rather than an insulation problem, he explains.",
      "Octopus Energy has around 500 cameras that it loans out to customers every winter. Last year, the firm distributed the devices roughly 3,800 times.",
      "Thermal camera-wielding homeowners who have spoken to the BBC, such as Mr Matthews, say they have treated the imagery with caution.",
      "Louise Green, a designer in London, says she read online training materials before using a thermal camera to search for points of heat loss in a house shortly after she and her partner moved in.",
      "In her case, Miss Green rented the camera from Library of Things, a community-focused organisation that makes various items available for people to borrow. The device indicated loss of heat around windows and doors in Miss Green\u2019s home. She and her partner were able to compare the results to their neighbour\u2019s better-insulated property.",
      "\u201cIt just confirmed what we knew already, but it was still interesting to see, you know, were there any other areas?\u201d she explains.",
      "Darrell Taylor at Flir, a firm that makes thermal cameras, says that members of the public can access some free training materials on his company\u2019s website.",
      "He adds that Flir aims to make thermal images as clear and easy to interpret as possible \u2013 including by merging optical imagery with thermal imagery, to add more detail to the final picture. And he suggests that, in the future, Flir cameras may offer machine learning-based instructions and advice as people use the devices.",
      "Those who know how best to interpret thermal camera imagery can find extraordinary hidden problems in a building, though.",
      "Dr Bardhan recently took a very high resolution camera to a viewing of a house she was considering buying. But the thermal images revealed cracks in a wall, which later proved to be signs of subsidence.",
      "\u201cThat would probably not have been exposed unless I had gone in and seen it,\u201d she says. Dr Bardhan decided not to make an offer on the property.",

    "story": [
      "The most popular mobile games in the UK are being advertised without disclosing they contain loot boxes - random in-game purchases which critics say are \"exploitative\" and \"foster addiction\".",
      "The regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), says it bans and removes ads which fail to make the clear whether or not a game contains a loot box.",
      "But a BBC investigation found only two of the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store actually followed those rules.",
      "Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers & Gamblers Education Trust (Ygam), called the findings \"deeply concerning\".",
      "\"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the ASA said: \"This is an ongoing area of our work, and we\u2019re closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly.\"",
      "However, some say the regulator lacks the teeth to deal with the problem.",
      "\"The ASA, although it has upheld some complaints, it takes so long to properly process all of these things - they will go to a company and say, 'you should comply', but they don't comply,\" said Leon Y  Xiao, a video game regulation researcher at the IT University of Copenhagen.",
      "\"People are walking into a video game not knowing the potential risks, and this is assuming that people have even understood the risk of loot boxes to begin with.\"",
      "What is a loot box?",
      "Loot boxes contain random digital items that gamers can only reveal through gameplay or - more controversially - by making a payment.",
      "Game-makers have previously defended them as being akin to a chocolate egg containing a plastic toy, with children not knowing exactly what they are getting until the egg is bought and opened.",
      "But critics say they are in fact a form of gambling, with a report in 2022 by the Norwegian Consumer Council concluding they \"often involve exploiting consumers through predatory mechanisms, fostering addiction, targeting vulnerable consumer groups and more.\"",
      "The same year, the UK government resisted pressure to regulate loot boxes, saying the video game industry could self-regulate instead.",
      "Trade body Ukie published guidance in July 2023, including the requirement to disclose loot boxes prior to games being purchased, which the industry was given a year to comply with.",
      "But, more than 12 months later, the BBC has discovered the vast majority of major mobile games containing loot boxes are still flouting the rules, with most games only disclosing their presence if would-be players tap a small information button on the Play Store.",
      "Adrian Hon, head of game developer Six to Start, said the games industry had a track record of \"conveniently ignoring or forgetting regulations that might interfere with their ability to sell to players\".",
      "\"We know that many people, including children, struggle with overspending on loot boxes,\" he said, adding they were deliberately designed to be \"habit-forming\".",
      "\"The least that games companies could do is disclose the presence of loot boxes, but they won't even do that - it's an indictment of their priorities and lack of care towards vulnerable players.\"",
      "Non-compliance",
      "The BBC checked the adverts for the top 45 highest grossing games on Google's Play Store, which along with Apple's App Store are where the vast majority of people access mobile games.",
      "Of those 45, 26 were labelled as including loot boxes - 22 of which were being actively advertised at the same time.",
      "However, only two of those titles spelt out the presence of the loot boxes in their ads.",
      "The highest-grossing game on the Play Store to contain loot boxes, Monopoly GO, was among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts.",
      "The game has been downloaded more than 50 million times, generating more than $3bn (\u00a32.37bn) in revenue according to the IP's owner Hasbro.",
      "Mr Xiao told the BBC the findings were in line with preliminary results of his own research, which has also found around 90% of games containing loot boxes are not disclosing this in their ads.",
      "The BBC has approached Hasbro, Meta and the ASA for comment.",
      "Zo\u00eb Osmond, CEO of GambleAware, said she was \"extremely concerned\" about \"gambling-like activities\" becoming normalised for children.",

      "He added that for the ZEV mandate the government \"has to decide: is this a tax, a \u00a36bn tax on the car companies, or is it their mandate to go green?\"",

      "Drivers are paying more for fuel than they should because retailers' profit margins remain \"stubbornly high\", the competition watchdog has said.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said sellers' margins - the difference between what a retailer pays for its fuel and what it sells at - remained higher than historic levels, although fuel prices have fallen since July.",
      "It said supermarkets' margins had risen to 8.1% in August from 7% in April.",
      "The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said sellers were pricing fuel as \u201clow as possible in a highly competitive market\u201d while also grappling with increasing costs.",
      "But the CMA said the \"sustained\" increase in fuel prices was concerning and there was not enough competition in the fuel market, which continued to drive prices up.",
      "Non-supermarket fuel margins had risen to 10.2% in August from 7.8% in April, the watchdog said.",
      "\u201cWhile fuel prices have fallen since July, drivers are paying more for fuel than they should be as they continue to be squeezed by stubbornly high fuel margins,\" said Dan Turnbull, senior director of markets at the CMA.",
      "\"We therefore remain concerned about weak competition in the sector and the impact on pump prices,\" he added, especially while costs of living remain high.",
      "\"The more people save on fuel, the more they have to spend in other areas\", he said.",
      "The average petrol price at the end of October was 134.4p per litre, and for diesel it was 139.7p.",
      "However, the PRA's executive director, Gordon Balmer, said it was crucial that the  increasing costs facing retailers - notably business rates, National Insurance and the minimum wage  - were included in future analysis to \"give a complete picture\".",
      "\"The CMA reporting that retailers continue to pump their fuel margins for extra profit will stir anger once again \u2013 particularly when set against the background of the government continuing the fuel duty freeze,\u201d says Luke Bosdet, the AA\u2019s spokesman on road fuel prices.",
      "He added that as retailers now have to pay increased National Insurance contributions, higher wages and increased energy bills, it was hard to see what a \"reasonable addition\" was to fuel prices, and what counted as \"bloated margins\".",
      "Motoring group RAC said the CMA's findings were \"disappointing\", especially after the regulator said in July that drivers had been overcharged on fuel by \u00a31.6bn in 2023.",
      "\u201cWe hope the introduction of the government-backed fuel finder scheme next year will succeed in driving greater competition and enable drivers all around the UK to benefit from fairer prices\", said the RAC's Simon Williams.",
      "The fuel finder scheme will allow drivers to compare real-time fuel prices and is due to be introduced by the end of 2025.",

      "Boeing, Nike and Starbucks have all changed their chief executives in recent months. But just how important is the person in the top job for the successful running of such huge companies?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only one cat who\u2019s on the hot seat,\u201d says Alan Lafley, who was CEO of global consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble from 2000 to 2010, and then again from 2013 to 2015.",
      "With P&G selling everything from Pampers nappies, to Head & Shoulders shampoo, and Fairy washing up liquid, it has more than five billion customers around the world. And its workforce now exceeds 107,000 people.",
      "Mr Lafley equates leading a firm of that vast size with being the manager of one of England\u2019s Premier League football teams. Specifically, he says the job comes with the same risk of being sacked if results are not as good as expected.",
      "\u201cWith the football players, if they have a bad season, they're not gone,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead it is the coach or manager that\u2019s going to go.\u201d",
      "Coffee giant Starbucks announced a change of CEO in August, following falling sales caused by factors including a complicated menu, tough competition in China, and boycotts linked to the war in the Middle East. The hope is that new boss Brian Niccol can transform the firm\u2019s fortunes.",
      "To lure him away from the success he was enjoying running US restaurant chain Chipotle, Starbucks is paying him more than $100m (\u00a379m) in his first year, plus the use of a private jet to allow him to commute 1,000 miles from his home in California to the firm\u2019s head office in Seattle, Washington state.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty obvious that there's a big hope for him and his ability to turn that company around,\u201d says executive coach Alisa Cohn, who explains that top pay packages are set by a company\u2019s board of directors, and reflect their expectations of the CEO they\u2019re appointing.",
      "Investors welcomed Mr Niccol\u2019s appointment  with a 24.5% jump in Starbucks share price the day it was announced. The same day Chipotle fell 7.5%.",
      "Mr Niccol is now continuing efforts to simplify Starbucks\u2019 menu.",
      "\u201cCEOs are the ones who are setting the strategy for the company,\u201d adds Ms Cohn. \u201cThey're the ones setting the culture for the company, and, truthfully, the buck stops with them in terms of their accountability.\u201d",
      "Marcia Kilgore is a Canadian entrepreneur behind skincare brands Soap & Glory and Beauty Pie, plus footwear firm Fitflop. She says that the role of CEO is complicated, demanding, and critical to a company\u2019s success.",
      "\u201cYou need to have somebody who can really look at the different streams of work that need to be done, and make those organised and prioritised,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cAnd someone who can make sure that the different teams in the company are working together harmoniously, and ensuring that time is not wasted, money is not wasted, and energy is not wasted on things that are not going to move the dial for the company.\u201d",
      "The failure to make the right choices and lead teams in the right direction was why Mr Lafley became the boss of P&G in 2000.",
      "His predecessor Durk Jager resigned as a result of the failure of a huge global restructuring that he led. Cutting 15,000 jobs and 10 factories was meant to increase profits, but instead led to repeated profit warnings and a steep share price collapse.",
      "Mr Lafley says that as CEO it\u2019s not about doing everything yourself, but \u201cenabling and empowering everybody in the organisation\u201d to do what needs to be done.",
      "\u201cWe had 100,000 people looking to the new CEO to tell them two things \u2013 \u2018what happened?\u2019, and \u2018what are we going to do next?\u2019.\u201d",
      "He explains that he decided to refocus the firm on serving customers and innovating new products, telling staff that \u201cI have confidence that we\u2019re all going to get us out of where we are and back on track\u201d.",
      "Mr Lafley adds that clearly communicating his plans with employees was so \u201chugely important\u201d that in those pre-Zoom days he flew around the world to meet staff in person.",
      "Inspiration and communication are also seemingly at the heart of the approach of new Nike CEO Elliott Hill. On getting the job in September he wrote to staff telling them he had \u201cgreat confidence in his team and our future together\u201d despite years of falling sales.",
      "Ms Cohn who has worked with companies including Google, Etsy and Johnson & Johnson says that whatever the plans of a new CEO, confidence is vital for any success.",
      "\u201cThe most important quality that you need to be the CEO is knowing that you will be able to be the CEO,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a sense of confidence, and healthy ego that you need to bring to the table.",
      "\u201cThe second thing you need to bring to the table is an ability to adapt. You've got to be able to assess the situation, make some important decisions, and then adapt them as you go\u201d.",
      "It\u2019s not something she thinks can always be taught, which is why she says so many people get \"stuck\" at lower levels in a company. Ms Cohn adds: \u201cYou need to develop your own sort of internal state to know that you can handle the pressure, the difficulty, the spotlight\u201d.",
      "That pressure is one the reasons why top CEO\u2019s are often compensated with huge pay packages. When it comes to the S&P 500 group of the US\u2019s biggest companies last year, the top earner was Hock Tan at Broadcom who got $162m, followed by Nikesh Arora with $151m at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, and Stephen Schwarzman with $120m at investment giant Blackstone.",
      "The average for an S&P500 CEO last year was a record $16.3m, according to executive consultants Equilar. It means they are getting 196 times as much as the average worker at their companies and critics says CEO\u2019s aren\u2019t worth that much more than their staff.",
      "\u201cThis is based on the foolish notion that the person in the corner office is somehow almost single-handedly responsible for corporate value,\u201d says Sarah Anderson from the Washington based progressive think tank the Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "She think it\u2019s a problem that is getting worse, and spreading around the world.  \u201cI think runaway CEO pay is bad for our economy, bad for democracy and bad for business,\u201d she adds.",
      "Mr Lafley agrees that the ratio between staff and CEOs\u2019 pay is \u201ctoo high\u201d, but reasons that firms are having to compete to attract the best talent.",
      "He thinks the answer lies in paying CEOs \u201ca rather modest basic salary, and then everything else is incentive\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn the end, it's sort of like a coach. If you're not motivating people, and you're not enabling them to do what you're asking them to do, then you're not doing the job.\u201d",

      "Introduced by the previous Conservative government, shared parental leave is a state-funded scheme that allows parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay after the birth or adoption of a child.",
      "But new analysis, seen exclusively by BBC News, shows it might not benefit all dads equally.",

      "Just 5% of those who took up shared parental leave came from the bottom 50% of earners.",
      "And since its introduction in 2014, the government has paid \u00a340m in shared parental leave payments to families in London - almost 10 times more than in the north-east of England.",
      "George Gabriel, co-founder of The Dad Shift says: \"There's a big awareness gap, there's a complexity problem and there's a challenge about most men feeling uncomfortable taking leave off the mother of their child.\"",
      "A government review from 2023 suggests almost half (45%) of all dads weren't even aware shared parental leave was an option.",
      "And it was used in fewer than 2% of all births last year.",
      "Those who have used the scheme are positive about its benefits, though.",

      "Those eligible receive \u00a3184.03 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower.",
      "It meant Josh's earnings dipped immediately after his twin girls were born.",

      "The government has committed to reviewing parental leave during its first year in office.",

      "Blair McDougall, a father of two, is one of a number of Labour MPs backing The Dad Shift's campaign for more generous parental leave.",
      "While he says the government is right to \"keep one eye on the economic reality\", he is in discussions with a group of fellow backbench Labour MPs to discuss whether future changes can go even further than those already outlined.",
      "\"Society has moved on but the rules around paternity haven't,\" he says.",
      "\"We need to bring those up to date to help fathers be the type of dads that most of us want to be.\"",
      "Some businesses pay out of their own pocket to offer enhanced paternity leave and shared parental-leave packages.",
      "This can include more time off and pay that is boosted to full earnings or a higher rate than the statutory offer.",

      "Tamuna\u2019s search had begun in 2016, after the woman who raised her died. Clearing out her house, Tamuna found a birth certificate with her own name on it but the wrong birth date, and she started to suspect she was adopted. After doing some research, she set up a Facebook group called Vedzeb, or I\u2019m Searching, hoping to find her birth parents.",

      "When the 72-year-old appeared, they hugged, then stopped to take a moment to look at each other, smiling.",
      "\u201cIt was strange, the moment he looked at me, he knew that I was his daughter,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI had so many mixed emotions.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey both love dancing, and so does my husband,\u201d she says with a smile.",
      "Gurgen invited his entire family to his home to meet Tamuna, introducing her to a large group of new relatives - half siblings, cousins, aunts, and uncles. The family agreed there was a strong resemblance between them. \u201cOut of all his children, I look the most like my father,\u201d she says.",
      "They spent an evening sharing stories, eating traditional Georgian food, and singing while Gurgen played the accordion.",
      "Even though she had now met her father, Tamuna still had a niggling question: had she - like thousands of other Georgians - been stolen from her mother at birth and sold? Her adoptive parents were no longer alive so she couldn\u2019t turn to them for answers.",
      "She finally got a chance to ask her birth mother in October. A Polish TV company was filming a documentary about Tamuna and took her to meet her mother, who agreed to talk to her in private.",
      "Unlike many people Tamuna has helped to reunite, she discovered that she had not been a stolen child herself. Instead, her mother had given her up and kept the secret for 40 years.",
      "Her mother and father were not in a relationship and had only had a brief encounter. Her mother - overwhelmed by shame - chose to hide her pregnancy. In September 1984, she travelled to Tbilisi, telling people she was going for surgery, and instead gave birth to a daughter. She stayed there until arrangements were made for Tamuna\u2019s adoption.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to learn that I spent 10 days alone with her before the adoption. I try not to think about that,\u201d Tamuna reflects.",
      "She says that her mother asked her to lie and tell people she had been stolen. \u201cShe told me that if I would not say that I was stolen, everything would end between us\u2026 and I said that I couldn\u2019t do that.\"",
      "Tamuna feels this would be unfair to all the parents whose babies were stolen. \u201cIf I lie, nobody's going to believe those mothers any more,\u201d she explains.",

      "\"You have to be open if you're a public figure and if you're telling people to vote for you, you have to tell them who you are and what you're about,\" he says. \"And, of course, I thought it would be fun.\"",
      "In his 14 years as an MP, the former minister came to be viewed as one of the most controversial politicians of recent times thanks to some of his hardline views. These include total opposition to abortion (even in cases of incest and rape) and a belief that there should be no climate change legislation.",
      "In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed 72 people, Sir Jacob said it would have been \"common sense\"  for residents to flee the building, ignoring fire brigade advice.

    "story": [
      "Gregg Wallace's defence of his actions on MasterChef was \"inappropriate and misogynistic\", Downing Street has said.",
      "On Sunday, Wallace said accusations relating to his behaviour on the show had come from a \"handful of middle-class women of a certain age\".",
      "Wallace, 60, has denied behaviour of a sexually harassing nature, after 13 people came forward last week with allegations of inappropriate comments.",
      "No 10 has also confirmed Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy held talks with BBC bosses in the wake of the row about his behaviour.",
      "Asked whether MasterChef should be taken off air, the prime minister's official spokesperson said: \"It's right that a thorough investigation is conducted. Obviously that's for the BBC and the production company.\"",
      "This follows calls from a senior MP for the current MasterChef series to be paused ahead of the next episode, which is due to air later on Monday.",
      "Just over an hour after the comments from Downing Street, Wallace issued an apology for his remarks, saying he \"wasn't in a good head space\" when he posted the video on Instagram.",
      "In the video shared on Sunday, the MasterChef presenter said there had been \"13 complaints\" from \"over 4,000 contestants\" he had worked with in 20 years on the BBC One show.",
      "His response was criticised by his accusers, one of whom said the comments showed he \"clearly hasn't learnt his lesson\".",
      "Ulrika Jonsson, who claimed she was told that Wallace made a \u201crape joke\u201d during her time on Celebrity MasterChef, told the Daily Telegraph that she felt Wallace's response showed \u201cthe arrogance of a man who has zero introspection or self-awareness\u201d.",
      "\u201cWhen he made reference to women of a certain age I was just seething... I was just absolutely wild,\u201d she said.",
      "Wallace stepped aside last week after a BBC News investigation revealed allegations of inappropriate sexual comments and inappropriate behaviour against him.",
      "The investigation heard from 13 people spanning a range of ages, who worked across five different shows.",
      "Earlier, Rupa Huq MP said the BBC should consider pausing MasterChef while Wallace is investigated.",
      "Huq is a member of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee and said the continued broadcast of MasterChef could be \"triggering\" for the women involved.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today, she said: \"I think possibly there is an argument for pausing while this investigation takes its course, and maybe not airing it tonight.\"",
      "The next episode of MasterChef: The Professionals is scheduled to air at 21:00 GMT on Monday on BBC One.",
      "It will be the 16th episode of the 21 which have been recorded for the current series. The next two episodes are scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday.",
      "All three of this week's episodes have already been made available to watch on BBC iPlayer.",

      "\"I understand it's scheduled for 9pm today, and it's already in the Christmas schedules, but it seems to be not going away from the news.\"",
      "She added that the broadcast of further episodes of MasterChef \"could be massively triggering for the women involved, in fact any woman involved in any type of similar incidents\", and said the BBC should consider pausing the series \"out of sensitivity\".",
      "Huq, the sister of TV presenter Konnie, acknowledged that Wallace had stepped back from presenting the show, but noted the pre-recorded episodes are still scheduled to air.",
      "\"To the casual viewer, there's not going to be any difference,\" she said. \"If it's on TV tonight, it looks like he sort of got away with it, and I think the BBC should send a strong signal [about] this sort of behaviour.\"",
      "She added: \"We need to let the investigation do its work, but at the same time, if he's being dangled on our screens while this is going on, I just think at the moment maybe pause it.\"",
      "Another former Celebrity MasterChef contestant, the Times Radio presenter Aasmah Mir, said on Sunday she had raised concerns about Wallace in 2017.",
      "She told the Sunday Times that Wallace had made inappropriate comments during filming.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve not watched MasterChef since, because of him,\" she said. \"To make someone feel that uncomfortable, or not to know that you\u2019re making someone that uncomfortable - why would I want to watch someone like that?\"",
      "Production company Banijay UK said it has launched an investigation, with which Wallace was co-operating, while the BBC has said it will \u201calways listen if people want to make us aware of something directly\u201d.",
      "The BBC News investigation also found that Wallace was warned by the BBC after a complaint was raised about him in 2018 about the show Impossible Celebrities, something Huq referred to on Monday.",
      "\"Apparently this is not the first time, there were warnings before,\" she said.",

      "Former Harry Potter star Rupert Grint has been ordered to pay \u00a31.8m in tax after losing a legal battle with HM Revenue & Customs.",
      "Grint, who played Ron Weasley in the films, was originally told to pay the sum in 2019 after an HMRC investigation disputed one of his tax returns.",
      "Lawyers for the 36-year-old appealed, arguing that money he received from a company had been correctly taxed as a capital asset, but HMRC said it should have been taxed as income at a higher rate.",
      "However, Grint's argument has been dismissed by a tax tribunal judge.",
      "During the 2011-2012 tax year, Grint received \u00a34.5m from a company that managed his business, and of which he was the only shareholder.",
      "This payment was described as being for \"likely residual income and bonuses\" resulting from the Harry Potter films.",
      "He argued he could pay capital gains tax on it at a rate of 10% rather than income tax and national insurance at a top rate of 52%.",
      "In the ruling, tribunal judge Harriet Morgan dismissed Grint's appeal and said the money \"derived substantially the whole of its value from the activities of Mr Grint\", which was \"otherwise realised\" as income.",
      "He previously lost another, separate court case in 2019 that involved a \u00a31m tax refund.",
      "Grint appeared in all eight Harry Potter films from 2001 until 2011.",

      "In a statement, the band said Badenoch and her department had \"tried to silence us and they have failed\".",
      "The band said it would split the \u00a314,250 equally between two youth organisations who work with Protestant and Catholic communities in Northern Ireland \"to create a better future for our young people\".",

      "Kneecap have also antagonised unionists in Northern Ireland - one of their best known records is called Get Your Brits Out, a parody rap in which the band go on an imaginary, drug-fuelled night out with prominent members of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).",

    "story": [
      "One of Africa's best known musicians - the Malian singer Rokia Traor\u00e9 - has reportedly been imprisoned in Belgium as part of an ongoing child custody dispute.",
      "The 50-year-old is being held after being extradited from Italy, over an outstanding two-year prison sentence, according to the AFP news agency.",
      "The long-running saga dates back to 2020 when Traor\u00e9 was initially detained in France on a Belgian arrest warrant after failing to heed a court order to hand over her daughter to the girl's Belgian father.",
      "Months after she was conditionally released, Traor\u00e9 flew out to Mali on a private flight, defying a ban from leaving France until her extradition to Belgium.",
      "Last October, Traor\u00e9 was sentenced in absentia to two years in prison by a court in Belgium on charges of parental abduction for \"failing to hand over a child to the person entitled to custody\".",
      "In June, Traor\u00e9 was arrested at Fiumicino airport in Rome as she flew in for a concert, over the outstanding child custody conviction, for which there was a European arrest warrant. Two months later, a court in the Italian capital approved her extradition.",
      "An appeal by the singer was rejected last week, paving the way for the extradition to take place. Traor\u00e9 has been held in prison since her arrest, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "Traore\u2019s support campaign says her daughter, now aged nine, has lived in Mali since the age of four months.",
      "A lawyer for the child's father, Traor\u00e9's former partner Jan Goossens, reportedly said he had not had any contact with his daughter since then.",
      "When she was initially arrested in 2020, she had been travelling from Mali to Brussels intending to appeal against the custody ruling, her lawyers had said.",
      "Mali's government previously came out in support of the singer, saying that she had a diplomatic passport.",
      "Traor\u00e9's lawyer, Vincent Lurquin, is reported to have told AFP that the singer plans to appeal the two-year prison sentence, which would trigger a new trial.",
      "He also said both Traor\u00e9 and Goossens were hoping to \"find an agreement in the interests of the child\", thus averting a new prison sentence.",
      "AFP reported that the state prosecutor's office in Belgium confirmed that Traor\u00e9 would remain in detention throughout the new trial.",
      "Traor\u00e9 is one of Africa's best known vocalists. She has won several awards, including the BBC Award for World Music in 2004 and the 2009 World Music Album of the year in the Victoires de la Musique, the French equivalent of the Grammys.",
      "She is also known for her advocacy work for refugees, becoming a goodwill ambassador for the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees in 2015 in West and Central Africa.",
      "Update 2 December: We have amended this story to clarify the date when the daughter moved to Mali, according to Traore\u2019s support campaign."

      "However, Westminster City Council's planning committee has voted unanimously to end the practice after hearing the BBC\u2019s concerns over terrorism and disruptive protests, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reported.",
      "Councillors heard Broadcasting House had been the target of 158 incidents this year, with BBC staff harassed on the street.",
      "'Proportionate to increased threats'",
      "The BBC's application argued two reception areas, the Radio Theatre and the Media Cafe, should remain permanently closed to members of the public who had not received security checks upon entering the building, at Portland Place in central London.",
      "Access to the public had already been restricted since 2017 as a consequence of terrorist activity, according to the application, which also mentioned Covid as a factor.",
      "Lesley Smith, the BBC\u2019s in-house counsel, said: \u201cWe do try to be as open and as accessible as possible but there is also a responsibility to safeguard the continuity and availability of the services and the safety of staff and others.\"",

      "The corporation added it remained committed to allowing public access to New Broadcasting House and pointed out it allowed schools, family members of BBC staff, community groups and audience members to visit.",
      "However, it said a security assessment found that since 2019 Broadcasting House had been targeted by 119 protests and that reopening the reception areas would leave the building susceptible to protesters entering undetected.",
      "The assessment also cited instances of criminal damage, including to a statue above the entrance to Old Broadcasting House, and an incident in which red paint was thrown on to the doors at the entrance to New Broadcasting House.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been denied bail for the third time by a judge in New York City.",
      "Two judges previously denied Mr Combs's release from custody, primarily due to concerns about potential witness tampering, deeming it a significant risk if he was freed before trial, which is scheduled for May 2025.",
      "Mr Combs is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution.",
      "He has entered a plea of not guilty and has also denied more than two dozen sexual assault accusations lodged in a flurry of civil lawsuits.",
      "The judge cited evidence in the case showing Mr Combs\u2019s alleged attempts at witness tampering, his violation of prison regulations while behind bars and claims he ran a \"criminal enterprise\" including forced labour and kidnapping.",
      "US District Judge Arun Subramanian concluded the court could not trust Mr Combs if released on bail.",
      "\u201cThe Court finds that the government has shown by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of the community,\" the judge wrote in Wednesday's ruling.",
      "Prosecutors had opposed granting Mr Combs bail, citing his misconduct while in custody.",
      "In a recent court filing, prosecutors accused the rap mogul of misusing jail communications to influence witnesses in his case and coercing others in his orbit to post online in order to sway public opinion and benefit his defence.",
      "But defence attorneys for Mr Combs said he should be released so he has adequate time to prepare for his trial next year.",
      "Earlier this month, Judge Subramanian ordered prosecutors in the case to destroy all copies of nearly 20 pages seized during a recent search of the former hip-hop star\u2019s jail cell.",

      "But prosecutors said the information wasn't protected due to Mr Combs's alleged actions, which could be considered obstruction of justice and witness tampering.",
      "They claimed Mr Combs had encouraged his children to post a video on social media featuring their birthday celebration with the aim of swaying prospective jurors.",
      "Allegedly, Mr Combs sent hundreds of text messages using an app called ContactMeASAP, marketed as \"an innovative text messaging service for federal inmates to communicate with loved ones via real-time messages\".",
      "According to authorities, Mr Combs has maintained two accounts on the platform, communicating with dozens of individuals, including attorneys and others not listed on his approved contacts list at the jail.",
      "Lisa Bloom, an attorney for Dawn Richard, who filed a civil lawsuit against Mr Combs in September, also alleges that he was contacting witnesses from prison.",
      "In an interview with BBC's Newsnight, she said one person had called her client a liar, and that phone tracking showed this person had had more than 100 points of contact with Mr Combs from jail.",
      "\u201cThe strong implication there is that he talked her into making those statements, perhaps gave her money. We don't know. But that would be witness tampering,\" Ms Bloom told Newsnight.",
      "Prosecutors have stated their investigation is ongoing, leaving open the possibility of additional charges or defendants.",
      "Ms Bloom said she believes others could be charged in the investigation.",
      "\"He didn't do this by himself,\" Ms Bloom said. \"He had an operation that people were brought in by others, so he didn't do everything himself. And we think it's very important that not only do predators get brought to justice, but those who conspire with them, who help them, who are complicit.\"",
      "Dozens of civil lawsuits also have been filed against Mr Combs accusing him of coercing and abusing both men and women, blackmailing them with video recordings of sexual encounters, threatening witnesses, and in some cases, physically beating them.",
      "Several cases include accusations from people who were underage at the time of the alleged assaults.",
      "Mr Combs has vehemently denied all the allegations.",

      "Ador however has said its contract with NewJeans still stands, as the agency has not violated any terms.",

      "K-pop star gives tearful testimony on harassment",
      "NewJeans face uncertainty after failed ultimatum",
      "One of the group's members, Hanni, has alleged that she suffered workplace harassment while working with the label.",
      "\"This is not the type of work ethic we respect and not one we want to be a part of, and to continue working under a company with no intention of protecting NewJeans would only do us harm,\" Hanni said.",
      "She added the group had faced \"mistreatment, not just towards us but also including our staff\", and said the group had experienced \"deliberate miscommunications and manipulation in multiple areas\".",
      "Ador maintains that its contract with NewJeans remains valid as it has not violated its duty and has asked the group to \"continue their activities\" with the agency.",
      "\"A unilateral claim that trust has been broken does not constitute valid grounds for termination of a contract,\" Ador said in the statement after the group's announcement.",
      "\"We regret that the press conference on the termination of the contract took place without sufficient consideration, and even before we gave our response to the demand letter,\" the agency said.",
      "NewJeans said they would like to work with Min, the group's former mastermind  who left Ador in August following accusations that she had planned to split from Hybe, taking NewJeans with her.",
      "This would have made NewJeans and Ador independent of Hybe. Min has denied the accusations against her.",
      "She has previously accused Hybe of launching another girl group, Illit, that was copying NewJeans' music and appearance.",
      "On 13 November, NewJeans filed a legal notice to Ador demanding the company resolve breaches of their exclusive contracts within 14 days.",
      "They said that failure to meet their demands would result in the termination of their contracts.",
      "The group has asked for an apology for a comment allegedly made by an executive at Belift Lab, another subsidiary of Hybe, and accused the company of workplace bullying. They have also asked for the immediate reinstatement of Min.",
      "They added that they would fulfil their contractual obligations, but at the conference warned their fans they might not be able to use the band's name after the contract terminates.",
      "Prior to the NewJeans' announcement, the band were committed to a seven-year contract, which runs out in 2029.",
      "The contract includes a clause specifying that parties can unilaterally terminate the contract if the other has violated its duty. However, the matter is likely to go to court as both sides do not agree. In such a scenario, a judge would decide if the contract can be terminated and if one side owes the other any damages.",

      "She alleged that entertainment agency Hybe had deliberately undermined her band, and accused senior managers of deliberately ignoring her.",
      "Following several incidents, she said: \"I came to the realisation that this wasn\u2019t just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us.\"",

      "Instead, his lawyers claim, Universal \"executed a plan\" to make the song \"a viral mega-hit\", and used Lamar's incendiary lyrics \"to drive consumer hysteria and, of course, massive revenues\".",
      "It comes a day after Drake filed papers in New York, accusing the company of illegally boosting the song's profile on Spotify. Universal has called the claims \"offensive and untrue\".",

      "Drake and Kendrick Lamar's feud explained",
      "Like the earlier filing, the latest court document is not a lawsuit.",
      "Instead, it is a \"pre-action petition\", under which Drake\u2019s lawyers can ask the court to order Universal to preserve any relevant documents and information ahead of future legal action.",
      "It was filed in Texas and also involves the radio giant iHeartRadio, which operates more than 850 stations across the US.",
      "According to Drake's lawyers, Not Like Us was \"heard more than 25 million times\" by listeners to iHeart stations in the four months after its release.",
      "Citing a whistleblower, they claim Universal potentially made \"covert payments\" to iHeart as part of a \"pay-to-play scheme\" to promote the song.",
      "Drake's lawyers admit that they have been \"unable to confirm\" whether the payments went to iHeart stations, but argue that \"as the number one audio company in the country\", it was the most likely recipient.",
      "If approved, the court action would compel the companies to provide any evidence regarding the accusations.",
      "The BBC has contacted iHeartRadio for a response to the petition.",
      "As in his previous filing, Drake goes on to accuse Universal of using \"bots\" to falsely inflate Lamar's streaming numbers, and of paying influencers to promote Not Like Us online - all of which the company has denied.",
      "But the latest documents add detail about Drake\u2019s grievances toward Universal, the label where he has spent his entire career.",
      "The documents claim the company knew that Lamar\u2019s song \"falsely\" accused him of being a \"certified paedophile\", a \"predator\" and someone whose name should \"be registered and placed on neighbourhood watch\", but chose to release it anyway.",
      "The song was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between the two rappers, who had been trading barbs in their songs since the early 2010s.",
      "Debuting at number one on the US chart, it has also been nominated for four Grammy Awards, including song of the year.",
      "Drake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, in which he denied accusations of sexual misconduct and claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent. However, the musician later deleted the track from his Instagram feed.",
      "The Canadian star, who is one of the most-streamed musicians of all time, releases music through his own label, OVO Music, but licenses the songs to Universal's subsidiary label Republic for marketing and distribution.",
      "Lamar has a similar deal, licensing his records through Universal's Interscope imprint."

      "The single is just the latest in a series of headline-grabbing antics the Liberal Democrats have deployed in recent years.",

      "These days the Official Charts Company uses a formula to combine CD and vinyl sales with downloads, streams and YouTube views, giving greater weight to actual sales (physical or downloaded).",
      "As part of the formula, a song needs to be streamed 100 times on a paid-for subscription service to be worth the same as one download sale. For free video and audio streams, 600 plays are required.",
      "But so many classic songs are played relentlessly at parties and on people\u2019s playlists that those streams tot up quickly \u2013 which means the top of the festive charts tends to be dominated by the likes of Mariah Carey\u2019s All I Want for Christmas and the Pogues and Kirsty MacColl with Fairytale of New York.",
      "A year ago, Last Christmas by Wham! was the Christmas number one, 39 years after its release - and that song is the bookmakers\u2019 clear favourite to do so again this year.",
      "Wham! racked up 13.3 million streams a year ago to clinch that accolade \u2013 so if over the next few weeks we notice Sir Ed and his fellow Lib Dems frantically tapping at their phones, we will know the reason why."

      "Beatles scholars and cultural historians have long remarked upon how much of a lift the band gave to an America in mourning.",
      "But was McCartney right? Was the rise of the world's most famous band partly down to the murder of the 35th president of the United States?",
      "Did The Beatles crack America because Kennedy was killed?",
      "'Unstoppable force'",
      "When The Beatles landed at the recently-renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport on 7 February 1964, it was just 70 days after the the 46-year-old Democrat had been murdered.",
      "Kennedy was shot as his motorcade drove through Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963 and his death threw his country into a period of mourning.",
      "Dr Patrick Andelic, assistant professor of American History at Northumbria University, said it was a moment that shook the nation to its core, partially because of JFK's own pop culture persona.",
      "\"In a sense, Kennedy was the first TV president, which was relatively new at this point,\" he said.",
      "\"By the beginning of the '60s, 90% of American families had TVs, so the way news and media was consumed totally changed.\"",
      "He said the president was, like The Beatles, \"young, handsome, witty and energetic, which translated really well to TV\".",
      "\"He embraced television and was well suited to it,\" he said.",
      "\"And that makes the shock and trauma of his death sharper in the aftermath.",
      "\"It was the first killing of a sitting president in 60 years.\"",
      "It was, of course, TV which also helped The Beatles become a phenomenon in their homeland.",
      "Settling on their now final line-up of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr in 1962, the Liverpool four-piece had already scored two number one albums in 1963 with Please Please Me and With The Beatles.",
      "When that success was coupled with the famous 1963 Royal Variety Performance appearance during which Lennon asked \"the people in the cheaper seats to clap their hands\" and the rest to just \"rattle their jewellery\" they became a national sensation.",

      "Many British acts had tried and failed to mirror the transatlantic appeal of their US counterparts, who had seen great chart success in the UK, and crack the American market.",
      "There had been limited success for those that came before The Beatles.",
      "Lonnie Donegan, the titular \"King of Skiffle\", had two top ten hits, while Cliff Richard, then the biggest act in Britain, had only made it into the US top 40 on one occasion.",
      "Spencer Leigh, author of many books on The Beatles, said the trend of British acts failing to \"make it\" in the United States, had seen Capitol, one of the country's biggest record companies, even refuse to distribute The Beatles' music for fear of the same result.",
      "\"Artists from the UK didn't sell well in America and it seemed Capitol looked down its nose at the British work,\" he said.",
      "Capitol's concerns were understandable. The singles Please Please Me, From Me To You and She Loves You had all been released in the US in 1963 and seen limited success, so they were reluctant to put out I Want To Hold Your Hand.",
      "The band's manager Brian Epstein and Capitol's parent company EMI managed to change the label's minds and on Boxing Day 1963, about a month after Kennedy's assassination, the single hit America's stores.",
      "Its impact was huge and by the first week of February, it was at the top of the US charts, a position it would hold for seven weeks.",
      "The success meant more than 3,000 fans and a large press pack were at the airport when the band touched down.",
      "For Spencer Leigh, it was what came next, not what had happened before, that led to their global success.",
      "\"My view is the people screaming for The Beatles at the airport were young and didn't know much about politics,\" he said.",
      "\"For me, the turning point was the Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "'Fleeting at best'",
      "At 20:00 on 9 February 1964, The Beatles made the first of three appearances on the programme, which was one of America's most popular TV variety shows.",
      "The TV channel CBS reportedly received more than 50,000 requests for seats at its 700-capacity studio ahead of the band's visit and those who failed to get their hands on any huddled excitedly around TVs at home.",
      "\"More than 70 million people watched the first one and they performed so well,\" Leigh said.",
      "He said one of the moments that really caught the audience's attention was when cameras panned to each band member, flashing their names on the screen.",
      "\"They put a caption on John Lennon saying 'sorry girls he's married',\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not sure how much [the band] appreciated that.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:40:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician says winning the Mercury Prize helped put an end to his \"desperate\" search for approval.",
    "story": [
      "When Michael Kiwanuka was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2020, he thought he knew the deal.",
      "He'd been up for the prestigious album award twice before. Like most artists, he said it was an honour to be nominated. A win would be nice, but not particularly life-changing.",
      "He was wrong.",
      "When Annie Mac ambushed him on The One Show to reveal it was third time lucky, a switch was flipped.",
      "\"It sort of woke me up,\" the singer-songwriter reveals.",
      "\"I'd been desperately looking for approval from my peers and certain [media] outlets - and the Mercury freed me from that desperation.",
      "\"It allowed me to feel that, actually, I just want to make the records that come naturally.\"",
      "The realisation was particularly powerful because his winning album, simply titled Kiwanuka, had grappled with his sense of inferiority as a musician, a black man, a partner and a friend.",
      "External validation didn't silence the voices in his head - but it gave him a healthy dose of perspective.",
      "\"When you have impostor syndrome and you\u2019re busy beating yourself up, you're actually using up all your energy doing that, as opposed to being like, 'Wow, how amazing it is to be making my own record?', or, 'How amazing that I'm playing the Pyramid Stage [at Glastonbury]?'",
      "\"The list is so long of how cool this job is, and I spent most of my time moaning. Winning the Mercury kicked off that feeling of, oh, I've got to sort this out.\"",
      "You could see that newfound freedom when he played at Glastonbury in June. Basking in the late afternoon sun, the 37-year-old took to the stage wearing a bright white kanzu robe - a traditional tunic from Uganda, where his parents are from.",
      "And when a malfunctioning synthesizer forced him to abort a performance of his new song Small Changes, the former perfectionist just laughed it off.",
      "\"I could hear my friend Joe laughing, and I sort of forgot I was on the Pyramid Stage,\" he recalls.",
      "\"A second later, I heard the crowd cheer, and it lifted me up off the ground.",
      "\"It was an amazing feeling. I felt like I had a massive battery pack from these people. I could do no wrong. Wherever I went, they would hold me up.\"",
      "Afterwards, the musician realised that one simple moment of fallibility had put the audience on his side.",
      "\"They saw the real me for a second, rather than what I thought people wanted to see,\" he reflects. \"It was really eye-opening.\"",
      "It\u2019s a little odd to hear the musician describe himself as a people pleaser.",
      "Since the release of his debut album Home Again in 2012, his music has worked in opposition to the trend-chasing virality of modern pop. His grooves are unhurried and thoughtful, his lyrics deeply introspective, and his inspirations - such as Isaac Hayes, Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye - decidedly old-school.",
      "His second album, Love & Hate, brought him to international attention after its opening track, Cold Little Heart, was picked to be the opening theme for hit TV show Big Little Lies,  starring Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman.",
      "Kiwanuka, released in 2019, earned him the Mercury Prize and his first Grammy Award nomination. But the densely-arranged, sumptuous soul often pushed his voice back in the mix \u2013 something he has confronted on his latest record, Small Changes.",
      "\"I fell in love with my voice again, which sounds weird,\" he says. \"But I realised being able to sing, and to have a voice that sounds good on recording, is a blessing.",
      "\"So I started to want that to be heard more than all the other stuff - the drums or the guitars or the strings. And that really aided the sound of the record.\"",
      "Chart battle",
      "The result is his smallest, most understated album to date. Aided once again by producers Inflo and Danger Mouse, he has created a suite of spacious, slow-burning confessionals that compel you to lean in and pay attention, slowly revealing their beauty on repeated listens.",
      "Reviews have been ecstatic. Awarding a score of 9/10, Uncut magazine called it \"rich, moving and inventive\", while Dork said the \"perfectly-balanced\" collection was \"genuine, gracious, and absolutely first-class\".",
      "The record is locked in a two-way battle for this week's UK number one album with Kendrick Lamar\u2019s surprise release GNX \u2013 but you get the impression Kiwunka won't pay too much attention to chart positions.",
      "For him, fulfilment came in the studio, surrounded by some of his favourite musicians -  including legendary bassist Pino Palladino and Janet Jackson\u2019s producer Jimmy Jam, who popped in to say hello and ended up contributing organ parts to half of the record.",
      "Each song is about a small change Kiwanuka has made in his life - confronting depression, rediscovering the innocence of childhood, and weathering the ups and downs of marriage.",
      "His languorous voice can tend towards the melancholy, but the lyrics are full of hope. \u201cSmall changes solve the problems,\u201d he sings on the title track.",
      "Despite that, the album was written during a period of major upheaval, as Kiwanuka moved away from London, became a father, and stared down the barrel of middle age.",
      "\"I realised, at the age of 37, it\u2019s the first time I can talk about something that happened 10 years ago, and I was still an adult,\" he laughs.",

      "\"Some friendships are full season, some friendships are forever, but one isn't more important than the other.",
      "\"And that song, Small Changes, I just loved the feeling of it when I wrote it in the studio.",
      "\"It sounded the way I felt about change - part hopeful, part excited, but also with the melancholy of realising that, sometimes change is hard and it's overwhelming and you've got no control over it.\"",
      "The power of commitment",
      "The biggest development is the arrival of two children \u2013 a change that's simultaneously \"given me wings\" and raised questions about his own priorities.",
      "\"I find that difficult,\" he admits. \"When you're 18, music is all-encompassing. You don't really care about anything else. Now there's something in my life that's more important \u2013 and sometimes you worry about keeping the work up to a standard.",
      "\"You find that you can, but that's another big change.\"",
      "Family is one of the album's central themes.",
      "\"Back when I was lost, stumbling around / You found me / Now I can see / My feet won't touch the ground,\" Kiwanuka sings over the dreamy grooves of The Rest Of Me.",
      "\"Commitment is a funny word,\" he says. \"It's not really that exciting, but it does a lot.",
      "\"I feel like, in this day and age, it's almost revolutionary to stick something through to the very end. And, actually, it can negate that worried feeling the world is giving us right now.",
      "\"The last five years have been crazy, but that idea of committing to someone, whatever happens, until they leave the planet, is becoming rare. But it's something I want to hold on to.\""

If it does pass we will ask for this to be given greater attention.\u201d",
      "But Prof Sam Ahmedzai, a retired palliative care doctor and former NHS adviser on end-of-life care, said he had been to countries where both systems worked well in parallel with each other - and in some places where assisted dying had been introduced, palliative care had been improved.",

      "She witnessed her husband\u2019s death from liver cancer 30 years ago and does not want to go the same way. \u201cIt was a very difficult and very distressing death,\u201d she says.",
      "Under the proposed new law, people like Jan - who have been told they have less than six months to live - would be able to access drugs to end their lives, but only with the agreement of two doctors and a High Court judge who would review the decision.",
      "Jan would like to die at home with her son and daughter by her side but she knows that isn\u2019t likely, even if the bill does pass, because she only has months to live.",
      "\u201cIt leaves me with a very poor set of options,\u201d she says. \u201cWe should make it right for people, give them the opportunity to have a smooth passing \u2013 a comfortable death.\u201d",

      "\u201cMy absolute worry is that if I am in a position like I was two years ago, where I was in so much excruciating pain, and I don\u2019t have someone with me, I could potentially make the wrong decision,\u201d she tells us. \u201cAnd the wrong decision is not something you can come back from. You\u2019re dead.\u201d",
      "Her view is partly informed by her religious beliefs but also that the bill would be a danger to people with disabilities or terminal illnesses.",
      "It\u2019s an argument often made by opponents of the legislation and especially those who live with disabilities. They are concerned the proposed law would devalue the lives of many vulnerable people.",
      "Becki shares those fears. She says it would open the door to people being subjected to coercive control or being pressured to end their lives prematurely.",
      "\u201cThis law potentially puts people in a position where they think they are a burden and the easy option is to end their life. That\u2019s very worrying, especially at a time when people are at their most vulnerable.\u201d",
      "The proposed bill in England and Wales comes with safeguards supporters say will make it the strictest set of rules in the world",
      "But others worry that, if approved, the law on assisted dying could later become looser, meaning more people could have an assisted death.",
      "Mark Blackwell has Parkinson\u2019s disease and is cared for round the clock by his wife Eppie. He wouldn\u2019t be eligible for assisted dying under the terms of the bill - but he\u2019s still concerned about the impact the law could have on people like him who have progressive illnesses.",
      "Parkinson\u2019s is not considered a terminal illness. It is a condition affecting specific parts of the brain that become progressively damaged over many years.",

      "Asked by BBC News if assisted dying being legalised would make him feel a burden and a pressure to end his life, he indicates it would.",

      "For Mark and Eppie, the argument comes down to simply valuing life.",
      "'Prolonged and very unpleasant'",
      "Friday\u2019s vote is just the latest attempt to introduce assisted dying - it was first debated in Parliament in 1936.",
      "The current bill - called the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill - has been introduced by the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater.",
      "She came top of a ballot of MPs and so her bill - known as a Private Members\u2019 Bill - is the first to be considered and has probably the best chance of becoming law.",

      "For Sir Nicholas Mostyn, a retired High Court judge, the compassionate thing to do would be to give him the choice to end his life before his body deteriorates to the point he can no longer physically do everyday tasks.",
      "Like Mark, he has also been diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s but he is not yet in the advanced stages of the disease.",
      "\u201cThe likelihood, if you\u2019ve got Parkinson\u2019s disease, your ending is going to be prolonged and very unpleasant,\u201d he tells BBC News. He supports the bill \u2013 even though it would not give him the right to end his life.",
      "Symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s include parts of the body shaking uncontrollably and slow movement. In the most advanced stages, the disease people can find themselves unable to move and unable to speak.",
      "Sir Nicholas, and some sufferers of other debilitating conditions not considered terminal illnesses, would like the bill to be amended to cover them.",
      "For some critics, this is an important reason to vote against it.",
      "They fear, whether now or in the future, this bill could be widened to include sufferers of non-terminal conditions \u2013 this, they say, would be a danger to disabled people.",
      "The example most regularly cited is Canada, which opponents say is an example of a so-called \"slippery slope\".",
      "Legislation introduced there in 2016 was initially just for the terminally ill, but was extended in 2021 to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. There have been delays to further extensions, but it is still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years.",
      "Sir Nicholas says: \u201cI just don\u2019t understand the moral argument, which is that because I wish to exercise sovereignty over my own body, that I am in some way facilitating a 'slippery slope\u2019 for abusive treatment of people who don\u2019t actually want to [end their lives].\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s vote - if it passes - would just be the beginning of a long parliamentary process; weeks of scrutiny by a committee of MPs will follow, as they go through the legislation line-by-line.",
      "The bill will then return to the House of Commons and then the House of Lords where it could be amended in further votes.",
      "Even if MPs vote in favour of the bill - there is still a long way to go before these proposed changes become law.",
      "But if they do, it will mark another significant reform of the law that has seen our society change so much over the past 50 years."

Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease. Of the 367 patients who took a lethal dose of medication last year, the vast majority (91.6%) said loss of autonomy was a key concern, while others cited:",

      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",
      "Critics say the more the law is widened, the more disabled and vulnerable people will be put at risk. There has also been a dramatic growth in the number of people using Maid. Four in 100 deaths in Canada are now medically assisted, compared to about one in 100 in Oregon.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP who proposed the assisted dying bill in Westminster, says the Canadian system is not what is being debated for England and Wales, where eligibility would be restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Europe",
      "Across Europe, six countries have some form of legalised assisted dying: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. In all of them - unlike the proposals in England and Wales - help to die is not restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",
      "In both countries, patients can self-administer the lethal medication. But it can also be administered by a doctor or nurse, usually via an intravenous injection.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 01:36:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Wearable tech claims to help monitor our health, but many doctors remain sceptical.",
    "story": [
      "Wearable tech \u2013 currently dominated by smart watches - is a multi-billion dollar industry with a sharp focus on health tracking.",
      "Many premium products claim to accurately track exercise routines, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycle and sleep patterns, among others.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",
      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

      "Last week she was in the Kurdistan region of Iraq to sign a deal to try to tackle the gangs and ensure the speedy return of failed Iraqi asylum seekers.",

      "The vast majority of councils expressed concern about the plan in a consultation exercise carried out by Angela Rayner's housing department earlier this year.",
      "The responses, obtained by the BBC through Freedom of Information laws, potentially set local authorities on a collision course with Labour over one of its top priorities.",
      "The government has said it will respond to the consultation and publish revisions before the end of the year.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has put housebuilding at the heart of the government\u2019s mission to kickstart economic growth and tackle the housing crisis.",
      "But it relies on local authorities adopting targets for new privately-built housing developments in their areas.",
      "Many councils accept the need for more new homes \u2013 but they are concerned about whether the targets handed to each of the 317 authorities in England are realistic or achievable.",
      "The concerns are shared by Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat authorities, according to BBC analysis of 90% of the consultation responses.",
      "Many fear the algorithm used to calculate the targets has not taken into account strains on local infrastructure, land shortages, and a lack of capacity in the planning system and construction industry.",
      "Labour-run Broxtowe council in Nottinghamshire described the proposed changes as \u201cvery challenging, if not impossible to achieve\u201d.",
      "South Tyneside, another Labour-run council, said the plans were \u201cwholly unrealistic\u201d, while the independent-run council in Central Bedfordshire, said the area would be left \u201cabsolutely swamped with growth that the infrastructure just can not support\u201d.",
      "In some cases, the housing targets are radically different to those set by the previous government, with rural areas expected to shoulder more of the burden than inner city authorities. Some parts of London have seen their targets go down.",
      "In rural West Lancashire, the yearly housing target for the Labour-run borough council would jump from 166 new dwellings to 605 under the proposed new system.",
      "Deputy leader Gareth Dowling agrees with the general need for more housebuilding after \u201cyears of stagnation\u201d, but said his area was already building its \u201cfair share\u201d.",
      "\"I don't think the land is actually available here to build that much housing on,\u201d he said, \u201cunless you were to go and build specifically on arable farmland\u201d.",
      "Dowling claimed the new way of determining targets would not match the housing need in West Lancashire either and called on ministers to \u201chave a look at the responses\u201d to the consultation \u201cand see what's been said\u201d.",
      "Current housing targets are largely based on projections about how many people will live in a local area in the coming years.",

      "Rayner sets new housing targets in planning overhaul",
      "More tenants could be excluded from Right to Buy",
      "Instead of regularly updating targets whenever these projections changed, the last Conservative government chose to lock in housing targets based on projections made in 2014.",
      "The Labour government claims this has led to targets that would not solve the country\u2019s current housing crisis or provide significant economic growth.",
      "They want the targets for new homes to be based on the current number of houses in an area and how affordable those properties are, rather than the number of people expected to be living there in years to come.",
      "It\u2019s that change in methodology which has led Dowling to claim the new targets will not match housing need, a worry echoed in urban areas.",
      "Thirty miles east, in the city of Salford in Greater Manchester, the Labour-run local authority has warned the government that its approach \"loses any connection with future demographic change and is divorced from need\u201d.",
      "The city\u2019s mayor Paul Dennett told the BBC sensible housebuilding plans should not be based just on numbers.",
      "\u201cIt's about looking at your housing waiting list,\" he said, \u201cit's about looking at the impacts around homelessness and rough sleeping, and building the homes that communities and residents need.\u201d",
      "He called on the government not to \u201ccontrol this agenda from Westminster and Whitehall\u201d, and allow more flexibility in the new system so councils can consider specific issues in their area.",
      "Councils are responsible for granting planning permission for new homes - but they mostly rely on the private sector to build the properties, something many local authorities said the government\u2019s new targets did not take into account.",
      "Neil Jefferson, the chief executive of the Home Builders Federation, told the BBC the planning changes were \u201cvery positive\u201d.",
      "But he said ministers needed to \u201cdo more to support prospective buyers\u201d, give greater access to \u201csuitable\u201d mortgages, and ensure that local authority planning departments \u201chave sufficient capacity to process applications\u201d.",
      "Labour has warned it is willing to overrule local councils\u2019 objections to achieve its aim of delivering 1.5m homes by 2029, underlining the importance it places on housebuilding for economic growth.",
      "Many local authorities that took part in the consultation supported the principle of building more homes and a small number were in favour of the specific plans put forward by the government.",
      "In Oxford, the city council hopes the ambitious new targets will lead to the extra housing that councillors say the area needs.",
      "The planned changes would see Oxford having to build an additional 24,000 homes.",
      "Louise Upton, the local cabinet member for planning, said the council could accommodate 10,000 of those, and that it hoped the new rules would make it more likely that surrounding councils would take on the other 14,000 and allow the city to expand.",
      "\u201cWhen you are a tightly constrained city like ours is, actually bursting at the seams, you need your surrounding districts to collaborate with you to get the housing that you need,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cSo I think the government's plan for these new homes is ambitious, but it is achievable. It has to be achievable.\u201d",
      "In July, Housing Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner told MPs the government would be even more ambitious than first anticipated, and would \u201crise from some 300,000 a year to just over 370,000 a year\u201d.",
      "If all councils hit that target, it would result in significantly more homes than the 1.5m pledge that the government has made.",
      "But last Wednesday, housing minister Matthew Pennycook told a select committee the government would not be imposing national annual targets in the way suggested by Rayner.",
      "A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: \u201cThis is the worst housing crisis in living memory, and in order to fix this we need to build 1.5 million homes.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why we have introduced mandatory housing targets for councils and laid out clear plans to support their delivery, including by changing planning rules to allow homes to be built on grey belt land and recruiting 300 additional planning officers.\u201d",
      "The Local Government Association has called on the government to \u201cgive councils the tools we need to help build these much-needed new homes\u201d.",
      "Adam Hug, the LGA's housing spokesman, added that \u201cany national algorithms and formulas would strongly benefit from local knowledge\u201d provided by the people who \u201cknow their areas best\u201d.",

      "But former Downing Street adviser Dominic Cummings, who was working in No 10 during the Covid pandemic, criticised the appointment, writing on X: \"The Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change.\"",

      "In that role, he oversaw important policies and decisions made after Covid emerged. And also \u2013 crucially \u2013 in the years before the virus started spreading, when planning for a pandemic was meant to be taking place.",

      "Writing on X following Sir Chris's appointment on Monday, Cummings was fiercely critical of his role at the time.",

      "In 2018 Sir Chris did write letters of apology after it emerged two former health ministers were incorrectly told all documents linked to infected blood had been placed in the National Archives, when campaigners later established that was not the case.",
      "Three years later, in 2021, Sir Chris then recused himself from any decisions related to the scandal.",
      "It later emerged that his father Peter, who was himself a Department of Health official from 1978 to 1981, was involved in meetings and decisions related to Britain\u2019s Blood Products Laboratory and had provided written evidence to the infected blood inquiry.",

      "He studied at St John's College, Oxford and on graduating almost immediately joined the civil service, starting out as a fast stream trainee in the Department for Education.",
      "Over the next 20 years he rose through the ranks, serving across Whitehall including at the Department for Communities and Local Government and in the office of the then-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.",
      "Now at the pinnacle of his career, it had been widely-known that Sir Chris was on the final shortlist to be the prime minister's new cabinet secretary, alongside Antonia Romeo, who leads the Ministry of Justice, and Tamara Finkelstein, the top civil servant at the environment department.",
      "Nevertheless his appointment came as a bit of a surprise in Westminster, where there was a feeling that Sir Chris's time had been and gone.",
      "While some civil servants privately share Cummings' assessment of their new boss, those in the health department may welcome the fact that the top job has been given to someone who understands the NHS.",
      "Getting down NHS waiting lists is one of the prime minister's priorities and he may have had this in mind when picking Sir Chris.",

      "Under the plans, buildings higher than 18 metres - defined as high-rise - with dangerous cladding covered by government-funded schemes will be fixed by the end of 2029.",
      "By the same date, unsafe cladding in buildings over 11 metres should either be fixed or have a date for completion, otherwise landlords will face penalties.",
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner said she was taking \"decisive action\" but campaigners said the proposals were \"extremely disappointing\" and would \"only make a horribly complicated process worse\".",
      "The drive to remove certain types of cladding from buildings was triggered by the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people.",
      "An inquiry into the tragedy found that the building's cladding, made from combustible material, was the \"principal\" reason for the fire's rapid spread.",
      "In the years since the fire, there have been efforts to remove similar materials from other tower blocks.",

      "Sharon Graham, Unite's general secretary, told the BBC \"picking the pockets of pensioners is wrong at every level\".",
      "The government says it cannot comment on the legal action, but it was committed to supporting pensioners.",

      "Winter fuel payments cut makes sense, Starmer says",
      "How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it?",
      "Winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount of \u00a3200 a year for pensioners under 80, increasing to \u00a3300 for over 80s, paid in November or December.",
      "From this winter, it will be restricted to those who qualify for pension credit and other means-tested help, meaning an estimated 10 million pensioners will no longer be eligible to receive it.",
      "Among those are 200,000 Unite members, and the union says it is acting on behalf of retired members struggling to get by.",
      "It says many of them have modest private pensions, making them ineligible for pension credit.",
      "Juliet Jeater is one of 11 Unite members who have joined the union's legal action.",

      "Asked why she was backing potentially costly legal action, she said: \u2018\"What I want is for the courts to hear this quickly, and to say if the proper impact assessment wasn\u2019t done, then actually the government needs to go back to the beginning and in the interim, they need to pay the winter fuel allowance for this year\".",

      "\"This issue is not going away,\" she added.",
      "Official figures released on Thursday showed there has been a rise in the number of people applying for pension credit since the decision in July to link it to the winter fuel payment.",
      "About 150,000 people applied for the top-up in the 16 weeks following the announcement, compared to 61,300 in the 16 weeks before.",

      "But so far it has not indicated it is planning to do this.",

      "The prime minister, who voted for the bill, has said a government impact assessment will be carried out and published as the bill proceeds.",
      "Another issue is that the ministers who heads the two main departments that would have to implement the legislation - Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood - were among the MPs who opposed the bill on Friday.",
      "All bills must complete their parliamentary stages by the end of the year's parliamentary session. These are not set in stone.",
      "Report stage onwards needs to take place during the Friday sessions set aside for PMBs, and can run only from 25 April.",
      "In practical terms, that means the committee stage needs to be completed quite  quickly to leave sufficient time for the remaining stages of the bill to take place.",
      "A particular risk to the bill's passage could be at report stage where, if many  amendments are tabled, Parliament could run out of time to debate them all.",
      "Throughout the parliamentary process, lobbying from both sides will continue to shore up support and change MPs' minds, in time for the final vote."

    "story": [
      "For the first time in almost a decade, MPs will vote on Friday on giving terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death. While it\u2019s something that remains illegal in most countries, more than 300 million people now live in countries which have legalised assisted dying.",
      "Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Austria have all introduced assisted dying laws since 2015 \u2013 when UK MPs last voted on the issue \u2013 some allowing assisted death for those who are not terminally ill.",
      "The proposed bill in England and Wales comes with safeguards supporters say will make it the strictest set of rules in the world, with patients needing the approval of a High Court judge. Critics on the other hand say changing the law would be a dangerous step that would place the vulnerable at risk. They argue the focus should be on improving patchy access to palliative care.",

      "The US",
      "Across the US, assisted dying - which some critics prefer to call assisted suicide - is legal in 10 states, as well as in Washington DC. Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease. Of the 367 patients who took a lethal dose of medication last year, the vast majority (91.6%) said loss of autonomy was a key concern, while others cited:",

      "In Oregon, as in other US states that permit assisted dying, the lethal medication must be self-administered - the same is proposed in England and Wales. Around one in three of those prescribed a lethal dose don\u2019t go ahead with it.",
      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",
      "Critics say the more the law is widened, the more disabled and vulnerable people will be put at risk. There has also been a dramatic growth in the number of people using Maid. Four in 100 deaths in Canada are now medically assisted, compared to about one in 100 in Oregon.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP who proposed the assisted dying bill in Westminster, says the Canadian system is not what is being debated for England and Wales, where eligibility would be restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Europe",
      "Across Europe, six countries have some form of legalised assisted dying: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. In all of them - unlike the proposals in England and Wales - help to die is not restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",
      "In both countries, patients can self-administer the lethal medication. But it can also be administered by a doctor or nurse, usually via an intravenous injection.",

      "She wants to consult more on this.",
      "But the snag is the chancellor has already signed up to the same scale of welfare cuts that were pencilled in by the previous Conservative government.",
      "The work and pensions secretary has said on several occasions she will bring forward her own proposals \u2013 distinct from the last government.",

      "The previous government said that it aimed reach Jet Zero by focusing on \"the rapid development of technologies\u201d, as well as operational improvements and - among other things - more sustainable fuel types.",
      "This is not an entirely new quest. Aircraft around the world have been steadily getting cleaner since 1969 when the first high-bypass turbofan engines were used on the new Boeing 747 aircraft. In the years since there have been other innovations including sharklets, or upturned wing tips on modern planes that reduce drag and save, on average, 4% of fuel per trip.",
      "More developments are in the pipeline, including a new type of jet engine, developed by Rolls Royce, called the \u201cUltraFan\u201d, which will reduce average fuel consumption by 10%.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s a gearbox, the turbine can run very fast, much more efficiently, the fan can run slower and be much bigger,\u201c explains Simon Burr, a director at Rolls-Royce.",
      "The problem is that, though it was first tested in 2023, it\u2019s unlikely to be available on commercial aircraft until the 2030s because of production lead times - and even then, a 10% improvement is impressive but not a game changer.",
      "Aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions come primarily through jet engines using carbon-rich fossil fuels, which produce CO2 when burned, so there have been attempts to create an alternative type made from renewable biomass and waste resources, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).",
      "The first SAF flight ran between London and Amsterdam in 2008 using fuel derived from a mixture of Brazilian babassu nuts and coconuts.",
      "Now the British government says that 22% of all jet fuel from UK aviation has to come from sustainable sources by 2040. But this comes with further challenges.",
      "In the UK, SAF is mainly made from cooking oil, some of which is shipped from Asia, and shipping is responsible for 2% of global CO2 emissions.",
      "Alternative methods of creating SAF require large quantities of electricity as part of the manufacturing process. This would involve a vast amount of renewable energy to make it sustainable.",
      "\"It's very hard, to think there is such a thing as a sustainable aviation fuel,\u201d says Sir Dieter Helm. \u201cThere are aviation fuels that are less polluting than the ones being used at the moment, and you can use elements of biofuel and chip fat and so on.",
      "\"Think about the scale that's required to do it.\u201d",
      "Remapping the sky",
      "There is another more unexpected way that airlines could reduce emissions. That is, making their flight paths more direct to reduce fuel consumption.",
      "Currently most planes fly on routes determined by a network of beacons, many of which were put in place decades ago. As a result they don\u2019t always fly by the shortest route, but \"airspace modernisation\", as it is known, will allow for straighter paths to destinations.",
      "Satellite technology is required to do this: aircraft flying over the Atlantic used to have to fly at least 40 miles apart, but the satellite technology means that aircraft can in theory fly as close as 14 miles apart, allowing more aircraft to fly on the direct flight paths.",
      "The Jet Zero Strategy estimates that this, together with other fuel efficiency improvements, could cut emissions by as much as 15% by 2050.",
      "But the National Air Traffic Services (NATS), which control most flights in and out of England and Wales, caution that these changes are neither easy nor quick. \u201cIt's a very, very complicated thing to do,\u201d warns Chris Norsworthy, director of future planning.",
      "\u201cThe national infrastructure change of this type takes many years. The deployments we've made already are years in the making.\u201d",
      "The electric plane race",
      "Hidden away in a mini aircraft hangar of sorts, just outside Bristol, inventor Stephen Fitzpatrick has spent seven years working on a pioneering aircraft that could be the basis of another solution. His carbon fibre creation, known as VX4, has eight propellers and looks like a giant drone, but what's crucial is that it doesn\u2019t use fuel. Instead it is powered by lithium-ion batteries similar to those in electric cars.",
      "The batteries alone weigh 800kg, which brings the first challenge: the sheer weight limits how far it can fly.",
      "Mr Fitzpatrick says the VX4 will have a range of around 100 miles to begin with. \u201cEach year the batteries that we use will improve... Over time, we\u2019ll be able to develop a hybrid powertrain, probably using hydrogen fuel cells and batteries, and that will increase the range further.\u201d",
      "The prospect of replacing jet engine-powered long-haul flights is, however, remote. \u201cThere is no battery chemistry in the world that will give us the energy we need to take hundreds of passengers over the Atlantic,\u201d he concedes.",
      "Harnessing hydrogen in other ways may be a better bet.",
      "The British-American aircraft company, ZeroAvia, says it expects to have an 80-seater powered entirely by hydrogen in the air within two to three years. Airbus is developing something similar.",
      "Both are propeller planes, however, with limited speeds and ranges.",
      "The pricetag for passengers",
      "The reductions from SAF, fuel efficiency improvements and zero carbon aircraft will only cut aviation emissions by around a third, according to the previous government's estimates. So another part of the Jet Zero strategy involves a pricing scheme to charge airlines for CO2 emissions and carbon offsetting.",
      "Airlines already pay a duty for each flight someone takes in the UK, a cost that is passed to passengers. In much of the UK (excluding Scotland) this adds \u00a37 to each domestic flight, \u00a314 to short-haul ones and \u00a392 for long-haul. But carbon offsetting means paying another fee.",
      "Some schemes have been highly controversial, with questions around how to prove how many trees have been prevented from being cut down.",
      "Cait Hewitt, policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation, is concerned that the current informal offsetting projects may be counterproductive: \u201cThey could actually have made that problem a bit worse over time by giving consumers the false impression that the emissions from their flight [are] being cancelled out somehow by an offset.\u201d",
      "The Lebanon ceasefire is a respite, not a solution for the Middle East",
      "How service charges in flats spiralled out of control",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "Duncan McCourt, chief executive of Sustainable Aviation, an umbrella group for UK airlines, airports, manufacturers and others in the business, is optimistic that removing carbon from flying won\u2019t add much more than a few pounds to the cost of an airline ticket.",
      "\u201cWe think we can do it while enabling people to continue to fly and continue to get that benefit of flying, such as connecting people, such as being able to go on holiday,\u201d he says.",
      "But the Jet Zero plan says nothing directly about the knock-on cost to passengers. Instead, it refers to \u201cdemand management\u201d.",
      "Sir Dieter Helm has his own take on what Jet Zero means for holidaymakers and fully believes that it will lead to higher costs. As for the likelihood of the government hitting its Jet Zero target on time, he is unconvinced of this too, but he also suggests that this may not be the point.",
      "\u201cIt depends whether you think Jet Zero is\u2026 genuinely a target and they mean to achieve it. I'm really sceptical about the second.\u201d",
      "And now, the number of flights taken annually by people in the UK is projected to rise even further, translating into an additional 150 million more flights a year. So the scale of the government's challenge, which was large enough when it began, is only set to grow.",

      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",

      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years.

What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",

      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The most popular mobile games in the UK are being advertised without disclosing they contain loot boxes - random in-game purchases which critics say are \"exploitative\" and \"foster addiction\".",
      "The regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), says it bans and removes ads which fail to make the clear whether or not a game contains a loot box.",
      "But a BBC investigation found only two of the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store actually followed those rules.",
      "Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers & Gamblers Education Trust (Ygam), called the findings \"deeply concerning\".",
      "\"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the ASA said: \"This is an ongoing area of our work, and we\u2019re closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly.\"",
      "However, some say the regulator lacks the teeth to deal with the problem.",
      "\"The ASA, although it has upheld some complaints, it takes so long to properly process all of these things - they will go to a company and say, 'you should comply', but they don't comply,\" said Leon Y  Xiao, a video game regulation researcher at the IT University of Copenhagen.",
      "\"People are walking into a video game not knowing the potential risks, and this is assuming that people have even understood the risk of loot boxes to begin with.\"",
      "What is a loot box?",
      "Loot boxes contain random digital items that gamers can only reveal through gameplay or - more controversially - by making a payment.",
      "Game-makers have previously defended them as being akin to a chocolate egg containing a plastic toy, with children not knowing exactly what they are getting until the egg is bought and opened.",
      "But critics say they are in fact a form of gambling, with a report in 2022 by the Norwegian Consumer Council concluding they \"often involve exploiting consumers through predatory mechanisms, fostering addiction, targeting vulnerable consumer groups and more.\"",
      "The same year, the UK government resisted pressure to regulate loot boxes, saying the video game industry could self-regulate instead.",
      "Trade body Ukie published guidance in July 2023, including the requirement to disclose loot boxes prior to games being purchased, which the industry was given a year to comply with.",
      "But, more than 12 months later, the BBC has discovered the vast majority of major mobile games containing loot boxes are still flouting the rules, with most games only disclosing their presence if would-be players tap a small information button on the Play Store.",
      "Adrian Hon, head of game developer Six to Start, said the games industry had a track record of \"conveniently ignoring or forgetting regulations that might interfere with their ability to sell to players\".",
      "\"We know that many people, including children, struggle with overspending on loot boxes,\" he said, adding they were deliberately designed to be \"habit-forming\".",
      "\"The least that games companies could do is disclose the presence of loot boxes, but they won't even do that - it's an indictment of their priorities and lack of care towards vulnerable players.\"",
      "Non-compliance",
      "The BBC checked the adverts for the top 45 highest grossing games on Google's Play Store, which along with Apple's App Store are where the vast majority of people access mobile games.",
      "Of those 45, 26 were labelled as including loot boxes - 22 of which were being actively advertised at the same time.",
      "However, only two of those titles spelt out the presence of the loot boxes in their ads.",
      "The highest-grossing game on the Play Store to contain loot boxes, Monopoly GO, was among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts.",
      "The game has been downloaded more than 50 million times, generating more than $3bn (\u00a32.37bn) in revenue according to the IP's owner Hasbro.",
      "Mr Xiao told the BBC the findings were in line with preliminary results of his own research, which has also found around 90% of games containing loot boxes are not disclosing this in their ads.",
      "The BBC has approached Hasbro, Meta and the ASA for comment.",
      "Zo\u00eb Osmond, CEO of GambleAware, said she was \"extremely concerned\" about \"gambling-like activities\" becoming normalised for children.",
      "\"We know from our previous research that many children have reported how their online spaces are 'saturated' with content which often blurs the lines between gaming and gambling,\" she said.",

      "Interest elsewhere",
      "The Australian government has said it wants to bring in the legislation before the end of the parliamentary year.",
      "But experts have said the bill's timeframe and current composition fails to provide an opportunity for adequate scrutiny.",
      "Carly Kind, the country's privacy commissioner, said in a LinkedIn post on Monday after appearing at a public Senate hearing that she was concerned by \"the widespread privacy implications of a social media ban\".",
      "Human rights commissioner Lorraine Findlay called the one-day window for submissions of responses to the legislation \"entirely inadequate\" in a LinkedIn post on Thursday.",
      "\"We need actual consultation, not just the appearance of it,\" she said.",
      "Nonetheless, the Australian government's plans have sparked interest elsewhere.",
      "In the UK, the technology secretary, Peter Kyle, told the BBC this month that similar legislation was \"on the table.\"",
      "France has already introduced legislation requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental consent- though research indicates almost half of users were able to circumvent the ban using a simple VPN."

    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "But the company has been through financial challenges and recently agreed a rescue deal with its biggest creditor, US based Mudrick Capital.",
      "Under the deal, Mudrick will invest up to $50m in Verticial , meanwhile $130m of loans from Mudrick will be converted into shares.",
      "That will leave the US investment firm with a 70% stake in Vertical, while Mr Fitzpatrick's stake falls from 70% to 20%.",
      "\"This comprehensive deal - alongside the recent piloted flight campaign...  means Vertical is positioned to be a winner in one of the 21st century\u2019s most exciting technologies,\" Mr Fitzpatrick said in a statement accompanying the deal.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Thermal imaging tech has become cheaper and homeowners are using it to track down heat loss.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s like X-ray vision \u2013 for heat loss. Last year, web engineer Jamie Matthews bought a thermal imaging camera. His home, in the southeast of England, was about to give up some of its secrets.",
      "The colourful images on the device\u2019s small screen soon revealed how his loft hatch was letting him down.",
      "\u201cThat was really obvious on the camera,\u201d he says, explaining that he could see cool areas on the hatch, where heat was apparently escaping.",
      "Mr Mathews, who runs a software company that supplies the clean tech industry, also found some other small gaps in external walls and parts of his roof that appeared less well insulated than others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good fun and it certainly shows up things that may not be immediately obvious,\u201d he says.",
      "While Mr Matthews was able to draught-proof some areas himself, he says he would take a more methodical approach if he were planning any major changes to his home. The web engineer later had a professional heat loss survey carried out when he installed a heat pump, for example.",
      "That approach is sensible, according to building physics researchers who spoke to the BBC. There are signs that thermal cameras are becoming more popular, as homeowners seek to slash their heating bills and carbon emissions. Local councils are increasingly allowing residents to borrow the devices for free, for example.",
      "But there is no substitute for professional advice if you are planning big works or interventions, experts say.",
      "Thermal cameras work by using a sensor to detect infrared light, which we cannot see, but which we can sometimes feel as heat. Such devices aren\u2019t cheap. Mr Matthews spent roughly \u00a3160 on his, though organisations including local councils and energy supplier Octopus Energy do loan them out to people free of charge so that they can gain a basic understanding of heat loss in their homes.",
      "Wiltshire Council recently made 11 devices available to borrow from local libraries, as well as a brief guide on how to use them. There has been \u201chuge uptake\u201d says Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, such that the council now has a waiting list for interested residents.",
      "\"Expert advice, combined with a measured approach to the findings from thermal imaging, will give residents the best chance of making informed decisions about energy-saving home improvements,\" says Cllr Blair-Pilling.",
      "Small interventions could help people keep their homes warm and reduce the risk of cold-related health conditions, he adds.",
      "However, Jo Atkinson, senior consultant in buildings decarbonisation at Energy Systems Catapult, a research organisation, expresses concern over the growing availability of thermal cameras: \u201cIn my opinion, the risks are too great for making the wrong choices.\u201d",
      "It is possible to misinterpret thermal camera images, she says, noting that if a wall has been warmed by the sun, an image of that wall taken outside could make it look as though heat is escaping, when it is not. Reflective surfaces can also appear, misleadingly, to be leaking heat.",
      "While using a thermal camera as a starting point for understanding your home is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, according to Ronita Bardhan at the University of Cambridge, it is important to ask for independent expert advice when planning any renovation works.",
      "Thermal camera imagery can make it look as though some areas of your home are losing a lot of heat, but this might simply be a result of how the camera has been calibrated, how the user holds it and moves it around, and which colour palette was chosen for the display.",
      "Dr Bardhan adds that there is a risk of triggering \u201cretrofit anxiety\u201d in homeowners.",
      "Plus, if people go on to alter their insulation, for example, such measures should be taken with great care as improper installation can cause damp and mould.",
      "North Somerset Council provides thermal cameras to residents, on loan, and this scheme is also currently operating on a waiting list basis due to its popularity. The Council has published introductory advice on how to use the cameras, including an online video.",
      "The Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a charity, highlights a more detailed guide from the National House-Building Council, which describes how to use thermal cameras. However, a CSE spokeswoman adds that the organisation still recommends people seek expert advice.",
      "Phil Steele, future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy, agrees: \u201cYou have got to be careful.\u201d Thermal cameras can, for instance, make the corners of rooms look very cold but this is simply a reflection of reduced air circulation in those areas, rather than an insulation problem, he explains.",
      "Octopus Energy has around 500 cameras that it loans out to customers every winter. Last year, the firm distributed the devices roughly 3,800 times.",
      "Thermal camera-wielding homeowners who have spoken to the BBC, such as Mr Matthews, say they have treated the imagery with caution.",
      "Louise Green, a designer in London, says she read online training materials before using a thermal camera to search for points of heat loss in a house shortly after she and her partner moved in.",
      "In her case, Miss Green rented the camera from Library of Things, a community-focused organisation that makes various items available for people to borrow. The device indicated loss of heat around windows and doors in Miss Green\u2019s home. She and her partner were able to compare the results to their neighbour\u2019s better-insulated property.",
      "\u201cIt just confirmed what we knew already, but it was still interesting to see, you know, were there any other areas?\u201d she explains.",
      "Darrell Taylor at Flir, a firm that makes thermal cameras, says that members of the public can access some free training materials on his company\u2019s website.",
      "He adds that Flir aims to make thermal images as clear and easy to interpret as possible \u2013 including by merging optical imagery with thermal imagery, to add more detail to the final picture. And he suggests that, in the future, Flir cameras may offer machine learning-based instructions and advice as people use the devices.",
      "Those who know how best to interpret thermal camera imagery can find extraordinary hidden problems in a building, though.",
      "Dr Bardhan recently took a very high resolution camera to a viewing of a house she was considering buying. But the thermal images revealed cracks in a wall, which later proved to be signs of subsidence.",
      "\u201cThat would probably not have been exposed unless I had gone in and seen it,\u201d she says. Dr Bardhan decided not to make an offer on the property.",

      "Jeffrey Crouch, an assistant professor of politics at American University, told the BBC that it \"is highly unusual to have a presidential pardon that covers such a broad time span\".",
      "Another distinguishing factor is that Hunter Biden has yet to be sentenced and is due to appear in court later this month. According to the US justice department it is \u201chighly unusual\u201d for a president to pardon someone before they are sentenced for a federal offence.",
      "Jeffrey Crouch told the BBC that officials normally recommend a five-year waiting period before applying a pardon.",

    "summary": "Rebels have captured a swathe of land during their largest offensive against the government in years.",
    "story": [
      "Rebel forces have launched their largest offensive against the Syrian government in years.",
      "They have captured a swathe of land across the north-west of the country, including most of the second city of Aleppo, after the Syrian military rapidly withdrew its troops.",
      "The rebels are now battling the military near the central city of Hama, while the government\u2019s key ally Russia is carrying out air strikes against them.",
      "Why is there a war in Syria?",
      "A peaceful, pro-democracy uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 turned into a full-scale civil war that has devastated the country and drawn in regional and world powers.",
      "More than half a million people have been killed and 12 million have been forced to flee their homes, about five million of whom are refugees or asylum seekers abroad.",
      "Prior to the rebels\u2019 offensive, the war had felt as if it were effectively over after Assad\u2019s government regained control of cities with the help of Russia, Iran and Iranian-backed militias. However, large parts of the country remain out of the government\u2019s direct control.",
      "These include northern and eastern areas controlled by a Kurdish-led alliance of armed groups supported by the United States.",
      "The rebels\u2019 last remaining stronghold is in the north-western provinces of Aleppo and Idlib, which border Turkey and is home to more than four million people, many of them displaced.",
      "The north-west is dominated by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), but Turkish-backed rebel factions - known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) - also control territory there with the support of Turkish troops.",
      "What is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham?",
      "HTS was set up in 2012 under a different name, al-Nusra Front, and pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda the following year.",
      "Al-Nusra Front was regarded as one of the most effective and deadly of the groups ranged against President Assad. But its jihadist ideology appeared to be its driving force rather than revolutionary zeal - and it was seen at the time as at odds with the main rebel coalition known as the Free Syrian Army.",
      "In 2016, Al-Nusra broke ties with al-Qaeda and took the name Hayat Tahrir al-Sham when it merged with other factions a year later. However, the UN, US, UK and a number of other countries continue to consider HTS as an al-Qaeda affiliate and frequently refer to it as al-Nusra Front.",
      "HTS consolidated its power in Idlib and Aleppo provinces by crushing its rivals, including al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) group cells, and set up the so-called Syrian Salvation Government to administer the territory.",
      "The eventual goal of HTS is to topple Assad and establish some form of Islamic governance. But it had shown little sign of attempting to reignite the conflict on a major scale and renew its challenge to Assad\u2019s rule - until now.",
      "Why did the rebels launch an offensive?",
      "For several years, Idlib remained a battleground as Syrian government forces tried to regain control.",
      "But in 2020, Turkey and Russia brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake Idlib. The ceasefire largely held despite sporadic fighting.",
      "In October, the UN special envoy for Syria said HTS had carried out a significant raid into government-held areas, Russia had resumed air strikes for the first time in months, and pro-government forces had significantly accelerated drone strikes and shelling.",
      "On Wednesday, HTS and allied groups said they had launched an offensive to \u201cdeter aggression\u201d, accusing the government and allied Iran-backed militias of escalation in the north-west.",
      "But it came at a time when the Syrian government and its allies were preoccupied with other conflicts.",
      "The Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, which was crucial in helping Assad push back rebels in the early years of the war, has suffered recently from Israel\u2019s offensive in Lebanon, while Israeli strikes have eliminated Iranian military commanders in Syria and degraded supply lines to pro-government militias there. Russia is also distracted by the war in Ukraine.",
      "Without them, Assad\u2019s forces have been left exposed.",
      "How have the government and its allies responded?",
      "President Assad has vowed to \u201ccrush\u201d the rebels, referring to them as \u201cterrorists\u201d.",
      "In a call with his Iranian counterpart Massoud Pezeshkian on Monday, he blamed the US and other Western countries for the offensive, saying them were trying to \u201credraw the map\u201d of the region.",
      "Pezeshkian emphasised that Iran stood \u201cfirmly alongside the Syrian government and people\u201d, and that preserving Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity was a cornerstone of its regional strategy.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia also considered the situation around Aleppo as \u201can attack on Syrian sovereignty\u201d, and that it was \u201din favour of the Syrian authorities bringing order to the area and restoring constitutional order as soon as possible\u201d.",
      "What are Western powers and Turkey saying?",
      "The US, UK, France and Germany - which are opposed to Assad - issued a joint statement on Monday that urged \u201cde-escalation by all parties and the protection of civilians and infrastructure to prevent further displacement and disruption of humanitarian access\u201d.",
      "They also called for a \u201cSyrian-led political solution to the conflict\u201d as outlined in a 2015 UN Security Council resolution.",
      "On Saturday, White House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said Assad\u2019s refusal to engage in a political process and his \u201creliance on Russia and Iran\u201d had \"created the conditions now unfolding\u201d.",
      "He also insisted that the \u201cUnited States has nothing to do with this offensive\u201d.",
      "Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, also said \u201cit would be a mistake at this time to try to explain the events in Syria by any foreign interference\u201d and called on the Syrian government to \u201creconcile with its own people and the legitimate opposition\u201d."

      "\u201cIt did manage to divert some [Russian] forces from the Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv regions,\u201d he said.",
      "But some of the soldiers we spoke to said they felt they were in the wrong place, that it was more important to be on Ukraine\u2019s eastern front, rather than occupying part of Russia.",
      "\u201cOur place should have been there [in eastern Ukraine], not here in someone else\u2019s land,\u201d Pavlo said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need these Kursk forests, in which we left so many comrades.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "At least 56 people have been killed in a crush at a football match in Guinea's second-largest city, Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9, the government says.",
      "That death toll is disputed by many in the country, who believe the true number of dead is closer to 100.",
      "Some reports indicate that events unravelled following a decision by the referee, who sent off two players from the visiting team, Lab\u00e9, and awarded a controversial penalty kick.",
      "An inquiry is being launched to find those responsible, Prime Minister Oury Bah said in a statement, calling the events \"tragic\" and offering his condolences to the bereaved.",
      "One doctor, who did not want to be named, told AFP news agency there were \"bodies lined up as far as the eye can see in the hospital\".",
      "\"Others are lying on the floor in the hallways. The morgue is full,\" he added.",
      "Local media said police had used tear gas after supporters of the visiting team, Lab\u00e9, threw stones towards the pitch in anger at the referee.",
      "\"It all started with a contested decision by the referee. Then fans invaded the pitch,\" one witness told AFP.",
      "Videos and images on social media verified by the BBC show chaotic scenes outside the stadium, with large crowds attempting to climb over walls and numerous bodies on the ground.",
      "Some of those lying unresponsive on the ground appear to be children.",
      "Paul Sakouvogi, a local journalist in Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9, told the BBC that the stadium had been \"packed to the rafters\" with thousands of people.",
      "\"There was only one exit... some people climbed over the walls to get out and in the panic, all the spectators headed for the exit, which was very small. Those who couldn't hold on ended up on the floor,\" Mr Sakouvogi said.",
      "He added that internet access in the region had been restricted, and that police were guarding the entrance to the hospital where the injured were being treated.",
      "\"I observed six police pick-ups positioned in front of the three entrances to the hospital. They allowed only the medical staff to access the hospital, while the others were told to go back the way they came,\" he said.",
      "Prime Minister Bah has paid tribute to the dozens of people killed and promised full medical and psychological support to all those injured.",
      "Guinea's football body, Feguifoot, has called it a moment of \"intense pain\" and said that football is meant to \"unite hearts and bring minds closer\" not cause \"tragedy and grief\".",
      "\"May the souls of the departed rest in eternal peace,\" said the Confederation of African Football (Caf) in a statement from its president, Patrice Motsepe.",
      "Guinea is one of several countries - including Ethiopia, Gambia, Chad, Sierra Leone - that are currently banned from holding international football matches because Caf says its venues do not meet international standards.",
      "That meant that when Guinea took part in recent Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, all their home matches had to be held in neighbouring Ivory Coast.",
      "According to Mr Sakouvogi, the stadium in which Sunday's crush occurred is an unfinished project that was started decades ago.",
      "Sunday's match was part of a tournament in honour of President Mamady Doumbouya, who seized power in a coup in September 2021.",
      "The opposition says the matches are part of a wider campaign to drum up support for the junta leader ahead of a possible run for the presidency.",
      "On Monday, the opposition group National Alliance for Change and Democracy also accused the authorities of having \"significant responsibility for these grave events\".",
      "The government has not responded to this.",
      "In recent months there has been increased scrutiny of powerful figures in Guinean football.",
      "In July, Aboubacar Sampil, who is president of the country\u2019s football body Feguifoot, became the subject of an investigation into corruption and violence in football.",
      "A junior colleague accused Mr Sampil, who also leads the board of directors for local team ASK, of facilitating violence and trying to influence referees at a match that ASK was losing 1-0 to Milo FC.",
      "The latter team had to abandon the game and had trouble leaving the ground safely, according to documents filed to Feguifoot\u2019s ethics body.",
      "Among other things, Mr Sampil has also been accused of bypassing protocol and unliterally appointing people to jobs.",
      "He has always denied any wrongdoing.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 09:27:11 GMT",
    "summary": "After days of demonstrations and public resignations, Georgia's prime minister rejects a call for new elections.",
    "story": [
      "Georgia has seen a fourth night of street demonstrations and a string of public resignations, triggered by the ruling party's decision to suspend a push to start talks on joining the European Union.",
      "As tens of thousands of Georgians headed back to the streets of several cities, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze said they had fallen victim to opposition lies and he rejected calls for new elections.",
      "He confirmed reports that Georgia's ambassador to the US, David Zalkaliani, had become the latest senior diplomat to stand down, explaining that he had come under considerable pressure.",
      "But Kobakhidze sought to deny the reason for the protests, saying on Sunday that \"we have not suspended anything, it's a lie\".",
      "Only three days before, his party Georgian Dream had accused the EU of using talks on joining the union as \"blackmail\" and said the government had decided not to put that issue on the agenda until the end of 2028.",
      "Pro-EU protesters were out in big numbers again on Sunday night, and when fireworks were aimed at the parliament building as well as riot police, the police responded with water cannon.",
      "Large groups of riot police huddled in side streets beside parliament, and it was not until early on Monday that the protests on the main Rustaveli avenue were dispersed.",
      "As demonstrators fled the area, a number of people were detained, including Zurab Japaridze, one of the leaders of opposition alliance Coalition for Change.",
      "Georgia's interior ministry said later that 21 officers were injured in clashes overnight, while the pro-opposition president, Salome Zourabichvili, said arrested protesters had been subjected to beatings and cited lawyers who said the majority of them had sustained serious injuries.",
      "Georgia's increasingly authoritarian government has been accused by the EU and US of democratic backsliding. On Saturday, the US took the significant step of suspending its strategic partnership with Georgia.",
      "Kobakhidze insisted that Georgian Dream was still \"committed to European integration... and we are continuing on our path to the European dream\".",
      "And yet an increasing array of public officials do not appear to believe that is the case. Several ambassadors have resigned, and hundreds of civil servants and more than 3,000 teachers have signed letters condemning the decision to put EU accession on hold.",
      "Many Georgians have been shocked by the level of violence directed at Georgian journalists as well as protesters. Dozens of reporters have been beaten or pepper sprayed and some have needed hospital treatment.",
      "Georgia's human rights ombudsman Levan Ioseliani said \"this is brutality\", and he appealed to police not to abuse their power.",
      "The prime minister said it was opposition groups and not the police that had meted out \"systemic violence\".",
      "Georgian ex-ambassador to the EU Natalie Sabanadze, now at Chatham House in the UK, believes the level of violence, the string of resignations and civil disobedience indicate a \"qualitative change\" to the protests now taking place.",
      "\"Maybe [the government] thought people would be scared, but it's not working out like this,\" she told the BBC. \"Yesterday civil society activists and artists went to the public broadcaster and took it over and forced their way into the live stream. I've seen this before, in pre-revolutionary Georgia [in 2003].\"",
      "Georgia's pro-Western president is due to step down in a matter of weeks, however since last month's contested parliamentary elections which opposition parties have denounced as rigged, she has become a powerful figurehead, rallying protesters against the government and calling for a new vote.",
      "She and the protesters accuse the government of aiming to drag their country back into Russia's sphere of influence, even though an overwhelming majority of the population backs joining the EU.",
      "Georgia has a population of some 3.7 million and 20% of its territory is under Russian military occupation in two breakaway regions.",
      "During the day on Sunday, a small group of protesters occupied a traffic intersection in front of Tbilisi State University.",
      "\"I'm here for my country's future and the future of my three-year-old son,\" said one protester called Salome, aged 29. \"I don't want him to spend his life at protests and I don't want a Russian government.\"",
      "While Georgian Dream flatly denies any links to the Kremlin, it has in the past year adopted Russian-style laws that target civil society groups with funding from abroad as well as LGBT rights.",
      "Half an hour's walk away from the daylight protest, a small army of cleaners was trying to scrub off graffiti from a wall in front of the Georgian parliament.",
      "Some of the windows of the building were smashed on Saturday night, and an effigy was set alight of Bidzina Ivanishvili, the billionaire seen as the driving force behind Georgian Dream's 12 years in power.",
      "The question now is what will happen next in Georgia's deepening political and constitutional crisis.",
      "The Georgian Dream government's relations with its Western partners are very badly damaged.",
      "The EU's new foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, warned on Sunday that the government's actions would \"have direct consequences from EU side\", and the US decision to suspend its strategic partnership will also be widely felt.",
      "The Georgian prime minister had little time for the president or her call for new elections.",

    "story": [
      "The world\u2019s top court has begun hearing evidence in a significant case that may clarify the legal responsibilities of governments in relation to climate change.",
      "The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague will hear testimony from nearly 100 countries including Vanuatu, the Pacific island nation that initiated the effort to get a legal opinion.",
      "The hearing will attempt to answer key questions as to what countries should do to fight climate change and, critically, what should they do to repair damages linked to rising temperatures.",
      "While the outcome is not legally binding, it could give extra weight to climate change lawsuits all over the world.",
      "The idea to get the court to issue a legal opinion was originally proposed by law students in Fiji five years ago.",
      "It was then taken up by Vanuatu, an island nation with bitter experience of the impacts of rising temperatures and sea levels.",
      "Last year, around 80% of the population were directly impacted by a double cyclone.",
      "The extent of the damage prompted the government to declare a six-month state of emergency.",
      "Under pressure from Vanuatu and many other nations, the UN General Assembly referred two important climate questions to the international judges of the ICJ.",
      "These relate to the obligations that countries have under international law to protect the Earth's climate system from polluting greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "But they also asked the court to rule on the legal consequences of these obligations in cases where states \"by their acts and omissions, have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment.\"",
      "Vanuatu will be the first country to give evidence at today\u2019s hearing in the Netherlands.",

      "\"Our call for an advisory opinion from the ICJ on climate change is at a pivotal moment... one that sets clear the international legal obligations for climate action.\u201d",
      "While the decision of the court is non-binding, the outcome could be used in other legal cases where small island states are seeking financial recompense from the developed world over the loss and damage they have suffered as a result of historic emissions of planet warming gases.",
      "The court case comes just a week after the end of the COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan.",
      "The decision taken there by the richer world to provide $300bn a year in climate finance by 2035 provoked anger among developing nations who argued it was completely insufficient for their needs.",
      "In the Hague, the court will also hear from a range of countries including the US and China, as well as representatives of the oil producing group OPEC.",
      "The hearings will last until December 13 with the court\u2019s opinion expected in 2025."

    "story": [
      "Joe Biden has begun his long-anticipated maiden visit to sub-Saharan Africa as US president but it comes amidst uncertainty over future US-Africa relations as Donald Trump prepares to succeed him in January.",
      "Biden's visit to oil-rich Angola seeks to underline an attempt by America to focus more on trade and heavy investment in infrastructure, in what some analysts see as the most direct counter yet to China\u2019s influence on the continent.",
      "\"It\u2019s a perfect marriage of convenience,\" Angolan analyst Edmilson Angelo told the BBC.",
      "Biden\u2019s choice of Angola is significant - he is the first US president to visit the country, signalling a dramatic improvement in relations between the two nations.",
      "Angola was firmly in the political orbit of China and Russia after independence from Portuguese colonial rule in 1975, but since taking power in 2017, President Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o has steered it towards closer relations with the US.",
      "\"Louren\u00e7o\u2019s administration has seen Angolan foreign policy move away from ideology towards pragmatic multipolarity, becoming truly non-aligned,\" said Alex Vines, director of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a London-based think thank.",
      "Biden will highlight his signature initiative in the region \u2013 a railway line that will stretch for 1,344km (835 miles), connecting the cobalt, lithium and copper mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the copper-belt region of Zambia, to the Angolan port city of Lobito on the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Apart from oil, Angola is also rich in minerals, including cobalt and lithium, which are essential for making batteries for electric vehicles.",
      "Once completed, the Lobito Corridor will help transport these important minerals from the resource-rich heart of Africa across to Europe and the US.",
      "On its website, the Lobito Corridor Investment Promotion Authority (IPA), says the US involvement \"represents the first alternative from Washington DC to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative\" that is aimed at building a series of trade routes that tie several countries in Africa, and elsewhere, to the Asian giant.",
      "Biden's visit comes at the tail-end of his presidency, with no clarity yet on whether  the Trump administration will continue with the project.",
      "Dr Vines believes it \"may survive the Trump presidency as it is primarily aimed at competing against China\".",
      "However, he points out that both Western and Chinese firms will be able to use the infrastructure, and that \"may make its value questionable to Trump, a US president who will likely define his administration in large measure by competition with Beijing\".",
      "Louren\u00e7o expressed hope that the Trump administration would build on the initiative.",
      "\"Powers come and go, so, all we have to do is to be ready to work with those that will be in power,\" he told the New York Times ahead of Biden's visit.",
      "The Lobito Corridor is a joint project between the three African countries, the US, other G7 powers and private investors.",
      "\"We have a collective commitment for global support among the G7 countries of $600bn [\u00a3470bn] and over \u2013 through 2027,\" said Helaina Matza, the acting special coordinator for the project at the US Department of State.",
      "Louren\u00e7o defended the investment, dismissing concerns that it mimics the colonial-era exploitation of Africa\u2019s resources.",
      "\"Today, when we export the minerals, we export them in the interest of the African countries, different from what used to be in the colonial period when they were extracted without the consent of our indigenous people,\" he told the New York Times.",
      "But more and more African countries are considering reducing the export of raw materials to promote local processing.",
      "Anthony Carroll, a minerals expert at the US Institute of Peace, said that if this happens, it could derail the projected economic impact of the corridor.",
      "He is optimistic that the vast deposits of copper in DR Congo and Zambia will keep the Lobito Corridor viable as there exists \"a steady demand\" for it globally.",
      "Lithium and cobalt have a more \"cyclical\" demand, he says.",
      "The US Geological Survey estimates that DR Congo has nearly half the world's cobalt deposits.",
      "The vast central African country currently accounts for about 63% of the global supply of the mineral, the bulk of which is exported raw.",
      "Mr Angelo is optimistic that African countries will incrementally grow their industrial capabilities.",
      "He describes Biden's visit, and the investment in the Lobito Corridor, as a huge boost for Angola's efforts to change its image.",
      "\"He presents Angola as a safe place to invest,\" Mr Angelo says, adding: \"Where the US president goes, the whole world follows.\"",
      "Angola has been rebuilding its infrastructure following the end of an almost 30-year civil war in 2002.",
      "The conflict destroyed the colonial-era Benguela railway line, which is part of the corridor, with only 3% of it in use at the end of the conflict.",
      "Efforts to revive it then began, with China being the first to invest in it.",
      "Between 2006 and 2014, China invested about $2bn to renovate the railway through a rail-for-oil deal.",
      "But Louren\u00e7o has expressed regret over the deal, telling the New York Times that it was \"disadvantageous\" to Angola.",
      "\"If you would ask me now if I had to take a new loan under the same conditions, I would say: 'No',\" he said, adding that Angola would, nevertheless, pay off the debt.",
      "China\u2019s massive infrastructure investment, through its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative, has been criticised for driving countries in Africa, and Asia, into deep debt.",
      "The US' move into massive infrastructure investments in Africa would exist alongside Chinese-backed projects, representing a more multipolar approach.",
      "China already controls up to 80% of copper mines in DR Congo, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of the mineral.",
      "With the global focus moving to greener energy, including electric vehicles, the mines of central Africa will become more and more attractive.",
      "The American shift to investing in infrastructure in the region comes therefore as no surprise.",
      "Already, work has started along the Lobito Corridor, with the first phase of it encompassing the upgrading of the existing railway from the port to DR Congo's border, with funding from the US Development Finance Corporation.",
      "Ms Matza said the second phase would include 800km of new railway, starting in Angola.",
      "The goal is to eventually connect the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean through Tanzania.",
      "Beyond transporting minerals, the railway could also boost trade and agriculture across the route.",
      "The Africa Development Bank is already funding projects to the tune of $500m to boost domestic and cross-border trade through the development of small businesses, cooperatives and traders along the Lobito Corridor.",
      "In 2023, US trade with Angola was approximately $1.77bn, according to the State Department, making the oil-producer America\u2019s fourth-largest trade partner in sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "President Biden\u2019s visit fulfils a pledge he made to the continent in 2022, albeit belatedly.",
      "It also helps shape Angola\u2019s place in regional and global development for years to come, despite uncertainties about where the Trump administration will take the relationship.",

      "Charred homes and shops are peppered with bullet holes. Doors are wrecked. Metal shutters are smashed. Rusting Sudanese army tanks dot the streets.",
      "In this rare trip for international journalists into Darfur, we could still smell the fires which blazed here last year.",
      "\u201cIt was utterly chilling to drive through these smoked-out ruins and ghost towns,\u201d reflected the UN\u2019s new relief chief Tom Fletcher, whose visit to this hardscrabble capital of West Darfur marked the first time a senior UN official was able to visit this territory since Sudan\u2019s vicious war erupted 19 months ago.",
      "\u201cDarfur has seen the worst of the worst,\u201d is how Mr Fletcher, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, described its calamity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s facing this crisis of protection, including an epidemic of sexual violence, as well as the spectre of famine.\u201d",
      "His short but significant visit only became possible after extensive negotiations with Sudan\u2019s two main rival forces \u2013 those headed by Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), who heads the government recognised by the UN, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) of Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who are now in charge in most of Darfur.",
      "UN officials refer to the RSF as \u201cthose in control of the area\u201d.",
      "It was RSF fighters, along with allied Arab militias, who ran amok in el-Geneina last year, mainly targeting residents from the non-Arab Masalit community in what human rights groups, including UN experts, have described as ethnic cleansing and possible war crimes and crimes against humanity. Human Rights Watch concluded it was a possible genocide.",
      "The Sudanese army has also come under sharp criticism. Arab civilians were also reported to have perished in this turmoil, many from shelling by army tanks, or in blistering air raids.",
      "Both the RSF and the SAF deny accusations of war crimes and point accusing fingers at their rivals.",
      "Few journalists have made it to el-Geneina to see its plight, including the aftermath of what were two massacres over a period of several months last year, which the UN says killed up to 15,000 people.",
      "The frenzy of violence, rape and looting is regarded as one of the worst atrocities in Sudan\u2019s brutal conflagration, which has created the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis.",
      "We travelled from the Chadian border town of Adre, with the UN delegation, on a journey of less than an hour on a rippling dirt track enveloped in dust, which slices through the desolate semi-desert plateau dotted with half-built or abandoned clay-brick buildings.",
      "A small number of hulking lorries packed with the aid of the UN\u2019s World Food Programme, as well as rickety Sudanese carts driven by horses or donkeys, go back and forth across a border marked by not much more than a few wooden posts and ropes.",
      "But on the other side of the frontier, across the no-man\u2019s land in a dry sloping wadi and along our bleak route, gun-toting RSF fighters in camouflage uniforms patrol this part of Sudan. Some are just young boys who flash cheeky grins.",
      "But, before we left Adre, knowing how hard it may be to gather testimonies inside, we spent time in the sprawling informal camp run by the UN and Chadian authorities close to the border. A throng, mainly women of all ages, some cradling children, fill the vast field. It\u2019s a temporary settlement of startling proportions.",
      "Everyone we spoke with was from el-Geneina. And they all carried their stories with them as they escaped acute hunger and the horrors visited upon their homes.",
      "\u201cWhen we fled, our young brothers were killed,\u201d piped up a self-assured 14-year-old  Sudanese girl in a rose pink headscarf, who spoke calmly and quietly about  terrifying times.",
      "\u201cSome of them were still breastfeeding, too young to walk. Our elders escaping with us were killed too.\u201d",
      "I asked her how she managed to survive.",

      "In el-Geneina, our first stop is a modest health centre in the al-Riyadh displacement camp, where Sudanese women in brightly coloured veils sit in chairs along the wall, or huddle on bamboo mats on the floor.",
      "A delegation of mainly elderly men, some with crutches, sit closer to the front under the shade of the corrugated metal roof and wide-boughed trees which frame an open wall.",
      "It feels like a different el-Geneina. There's no visible presence of armed RSF men in a leafy neighbourhood lined with humble mud houses. Young boys turn cartwheels, women in vivid head-to-toe veils walk purposively past, and donkey carts ferrying water drums trot along dusty dirt roads.",
      "\u201cWe have suffered a lot,\u201d underlines a community elder, a white-turbaned teacher who is the first to address the visiting UN team in their signature blue vests. He speaks precisely and carefully.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s true that when the war started some people supported SAF, and some supported RSF. But as displaced people we are neutral and in need of every kind of assistance.\u201d",

      "The teacher listed a catalogue of basic needs \u2013 from food for malnourished women and children, to schools and clean water. He also explained that most women are now in charge of their families.",
      "Some of the young women, only their eyes visible, film the meeting on their phones, perhaps wanting some record of this rare event.",

      "\u201cYou must often feel that no-one is listening and that no-one understands what you have endured, more than anyone else in the population, and maybe more than anyone else in the world.\u201d They respond with vigorous clapping.",
      "The UN's next stop, behind closed doors, is even more forthright when Mr Fletcher and his colleagues sit in front of a gathering of Sudanese and international NGOs based in Darfur who are struggling to respond to this enormous catastrophe.",
      "Unlike the UN, they haven\u2019t waited for permissions from Gen Burhan\u2019s government to operate here; approval for the UN\u2019s international staff to be based here was recently revoked.",
      "Twenty NGOs, working without reliable internet or electricity or even phones, and struggling to obtain more Sudanese visas for staff, say they\u2019re trying to help the 99.9% of the population in need. Their message was clear \u2013 the UN system was failing them.",
      "\u201cMore needs to be done,\u201d Tariq Riebl, who heads the Sudan operations of the Norwegian Refugee Council, tells us after the meeting. But he says his worst fear \u201cis that no-one cares, that they\u2019re only paying attention to other crises such as Ukraine and Gaza\u201d.",

      "\u201cBut this week we\u2019ve got more flights coming in to regional airports, more hubs opening inside Sudan, and we're getting more people on the ground as well.\u201d",
      "During his week-long visit to Sudan and its neighbours, he met representatives of both the SAF and the RSF to push for more access across lines and across borders.",
      "He started his new job vowing \u201cto end impunity and indifference\u201d.",

Others are also weighing in, including Saudi Arabia and regional organisations including the Arab Union, with all sides saying they\u2019re working for peace, not war.",

    "summary": "Some products described as \u201cItalian\u201d appear to contain Chinese tomatoes, BBC investigation suggests.",
    "story": [
      "\u201cItalian\u201d tomato purees sold by several UK supermarkets appear to contain tomatoes grown and picked in China using forced labour, the BBC has found.",
      "Some have \u201cItalian\u201d in their name such as Tesco\u2019s \u201cItalian Tomato Pur\u00e9e\u201d. Others have \u201cItalian\u201d in their description, such as Asda\u2019s double concentrate which says it contains \u201cPur\u00e9ed Italian grown tomatoes\u201d - and Waitrose\u2019s \u201cEssential Tomato Pur\u00e9e\u201d, describing itself as \u201cItalian tomato puree\u201d.",
      "A total of 17 products, most of them own-brands sold in UK and German retailers, are likely to contain Chinese tomatoes - testing commissioned by the BBC World Service shows.",
      "Most Chinese tomatoes come from the Xinjiang region, where their production is linked to forced labour by Uyghur and other largely Muslim minorities. The UN accuses the Chinese state - which views these minorities as a security risk - of torture and abuse. China denies it forces people to work in the tomato industry and says workers\u2019 rights are protected by law. It says the UN report is based on \u201cdisinformation and lies\u201d.",
      "All the supermarkets whose products we tested dispute our findings.",
      "China grows about a third of the world\u2019s tomatoes. The north-western region of Xinjiang has the perfect climate for growing the fruit.",
      "It is also where China began a programme of mass detentions in 2017. Human rights groups allege more than a million Uyghurs have been detained in hundreds of facilities, which China has termed \u201cre-education camps\u201d.",
      "The BBC has spoken to 14 people who say they endured or witnessed forced labour in Xinjiang\u2019s tomato fields over the past 16 years. \u201c[The prison authorities] told us the tomatoes would be exported overseas,\u201d Ahmed (not his real name) said, adding that if the workers did not meet the quotas - as much as 650kg a day - they would be shocked with electric prods.",
      "Mamutjan, a Uyghur teacher who was imprisoned in 2015 for an irregularity in his travel documentation, says he was beaten for failing to meet the high tomato quotas expected of him.",
      "\u201cIn a dark prison cell, there were chains hanging from the ceiling. They hung me up there and said \u2018Why can\u2019t you finish the job?\u2019 They beat my buttocks really hard, hit me in the ribs. I still have marks.\u201d",
      "It is hard to verify these accounts, but they are consistent, and echo evidence in a 2022 UN report which reported torture and forced labour in detention centres in Xinjiang.",
      "By piecing together shipping data from around the world, the BBC discovered how most Xinjiang tomatoes are transported into Europe - by train through Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and into Georgia, from where they are shipped onwards to Italy.",
      "One company name repeatedly appeared as a recipient in the data. This was Antonio Petti, part of a group of major tomato-processing firms in Italy. It received more than 36 million kg of tomato paste from the company Xinjiang Guannong and its subsidiaries between 2020 and 2023, the data showed.",
      "The Petti group produces tomato goods under its own name, but also supplies others to supermarkets across Europe who sell them as their own branded products.",
      "Our investigation tested 64 different tomato purees sold in the UK, Germany and the US - comparing them in a lab to samples from China and Italy. They included top Italian brands and supermarket own-brands, and many were produced by Petti.",
      "We asked Source Certain, a world-renowned origin verification firm based in Australia, to investigate whether the origin claims on the purees\u2019 labels were accurate. The company began by building what its CEO Cameron Scadding calls a \u201cfingerprint\u201d which is unique to a country of origin - analysing the trace elements which the tomatoes absorb from local water and rocks.",
      "\u201cThe first objective for us was to establish what the underlying trace element profile would look like for China, and [what] a likely profile would look like for Italy. We found they were very distinct,\u201d he said.",
      "Source Certain then compared those country profiles with the 64 tomato purees we wanted to test - the majority of which claimed to contain Italian tomatoes or gave the impression they did - and a few which did not make any origin claim.",
      "The lab results suggested many of these products did indeed contain Italian tomatoes - including all those sold in the US, top Italian brands including Mutti and Napolina, and some German and UK supermarket own-brands, including those sold by Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer.",
      "But 17 appeared to contain Chinese tomatoes, 10 of which are made by Petti - the Italian company we found listed repeatedly in international shipping records.",
      "Of those 10 made by Petti, these were for sale in UK supermarkets at the time of testing from April-August 2024:",
      "These were for sale in German supermarkets, during our testing period:",
      "In response, all the supermarkets said they took these allegations very seriously and have carried out internal investigations which found no evidence of Chinese tomatoes. Many have also disputed the testing methodology used by our experts. Tesco suspended supply and Rewe immediately withdrew the products. Waitrose, Morrisons, Edeka and Rewe said they had run their own tests, and that the results contradicted ours and did not show the presence of Chinese tomatoes in the products.",
      "But one major retailer has admitted to using Chinese tomatoes. Lidl told us they were in another version of its Baresa Tomatenmark - made by the Italian supplier Giaguaro - sold in Germany last year \u201cfor a short time\u201d because of supply problems and that they are investigating this. Giaguaro said all its suppliers respected workers' rights and it is currently not using Chinese tomatoes in Lidl products. The BBC understands the tomatoes were supplied by the Xinjiang company Cofco Tunhe, which the US sanctioned in December last year for forced labour.",
      "In 2021, one of the Petti group\u2019s factories was raided by the Italian military police on suspicion of fraud - it was reported by the Italian press that Chinese and other foreign tomatoes were passed off as Italian.",
      "But a year after the raid, the case was settled out of court. Petti denied the allegations about Chinese tomatoes and the issue was dropped.",
      "As part of our investigation into Petti, a BBC undercover reporter posed as a businessman wanting to place a large order with the firm. Invited to tour a company factory in Tuscany by Pasquale Petti, the General Manager of Italian Food, part of the Petti group, our reporter asked him if Petti used Chinese tomatoes.",
      "\u201cYes\u2026 In Europe no-one wants Chinese tomatoes. But if for you it\u2019s OK, we will find a way to produce the best price possible, even using Chinese tomatoes,\u201d he said.",
      "The reporter\u2019s undercover camera also captured a crucial detail - a dozen blue barrels of tomato paste lined up inside the factory. A label visible on one of them read: \u201cXinjiang Guannong Tomato Products Co Ltd, prod date 2023-08-20.\u201d",
      "In its response to our investigation, the Petti group told us it had not bought from Xinjiang Guannong since that company was sanctioned by the US for using forced labour in 2020, but did say that it had regularly purchased tomato paste from a Chinese company called Bazhou Red Fruit.",
      "This firm \u201cdid not engage in forced labour\u201d, Petti told us. However our investigation has found that Bazhou Red Fruit shares a phone number with Xinjiang Guannong, and other evidence, including shipping data analysis, suggests that Bazhou is its shell company.",
      "Petti added that: \u201cIn future we will not import tomato products from China and will enhance our monitoring of suppliers to ensure compliance with human and workers\u2019 rights.\u201d",
      "While the US has introduced strict legislation to ban all Xinjiang exports, Europe and the UK take a softer approach, allowing companies simply to self-regulate to ensure forced labour is not used in supply chains.",
      "This is now set to change in the EU, which has committed to stronger laws, says Chloe Cranston, from the NGO Anti-Slavery International. But she warns this will make it even more likely that the UK will become \u201ca dumping ground\u201d for forced labour products.",
      "Outside the UK, watch the Eye Investigations documentary Blood on the Shelves on YouTube",
      "\u201cThe UK Modern Slavery Act, sadly, is utterly not fit for purpose,\u201d she says.",
      "A spokesperson for the UK Department for Business and Trade told us: \u201cWe are clear that no company in the UK should have forced labour in its supply chain\u2026 We keep our approach to how the UK can best tackle forced labour and environmental harms in supply chains under continual review and work internationally to enhance global labour standards.\u201d",
      "Dario Dongo, journalist and food lawyer, says the findings expose a wider problem - \u201cthe true cost of food\".",
      "\u201cSo when we see [a] low price we have to question ourselves. What is behind that? What is the true cost of this product? Who is paying for that?\u201d"

    "story": [
      "US President Joe Biden has issued a presidential pardon for his son Hunter, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases.",
      "The move has proven controversial, since the outgoing president previously ruled out such a move. But he claimed the cases against his son were politically motivated.",
      "His use of his pardoning powers continues a tradition of presidents on both sides of the American political divide granting clemency to people close to them.",
      "What did Hunter Biden do?",
      "Hunter Biden was awaiting sentencing later this month in two federal cases.",
      "In June, he became the first child of a sitting US president to be criminally convicted - in a case relating to his gun ownership. He was found guilty by a jury in Delaware of three charges for lying about his drug use on a form when buying a handgun.",
      "He was also awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in September in a federal tax case that centred on whether he paid enough tax from 2016-19. The nine charges included failure to file and pay his taxes, tax evasion and filing a false return.",
      "He faced up to 25 years in prison in the gun case and 17 years in the tax case, though he was likely to get much shorter tariffs and to serve the two sentences concurrently, experts told the New York Times.",

      "What has the president said in the past about pardoning his son?",
      "Analysis: Biden's pardon for son shows presidents now act differently",
      "Full story: Biden highlights 'miscarriage of justice'",
      "What is a presidential pardon?",
      "The US Constitution decrees that a president has the broad \"power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment\".",
      "In this case, the president's \"full and unconditional pardon\" is unusually sweeping.",
      "It covers any potential federal crimes the younger Biden may have committed during a period of more than 10 years from January 2014 to December 2024.",
      "That spans a period beyond Hunter Biden's tax and gun offences and dates back to the year he joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father, then US vice-president, had a key role in US policy towards Kyiv.",
      "The wording of the pardon also makes clear that it covers any offence that the younger Biden \"has committed or may have committed\".",
      "The pardon represents legal forgiveness, ends any further punishment and restores rights such as being able to vote or run for public office.",
      "Although the pardoning power is considered broad, it is not limitless. For example, a president can only issue pardons for federal (national-level) crimes.",
      "The issue is relevant because there is a question mark over the sentencing of Trump in his hush-money case in New York. He will be unable to pardon himself in that state-level case when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "How many pardons have other presidents issued?",
      "There is a long-standing precedent of US presidents on both sides of the political divide issuing pardons - including to people close to them. This is the 26th pardon issued by Biden, a Democrat.",
      "In 2020, Trump, a Republican, pardoned Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter Ivanka. Kushner was sentenced to two years in prison in 2004 for charges including tax evasion, campaign finance offences and witness tampering.",
      "And in 2001, Bill Clinton, pardoned his younger half-brother, Roger Clinton, for a cocaine-related offence that dated back to 1985.",
      "In both cases, the pardons were given to people who had already served a sentence. President Biden's intervention in his son's case comes before sentencing.",
      "Trump granted 237 acts of clemency during his four years in the White House, according to the Pew Research Center, comprising 143 pardons and 94 commuted sentences. Many were in a flurry before he left office.",
      "That number is significantly fewer than his predecessor Barack Obama, who during his eight-year stint granted 1,927 acts of clemency, according to Pew. These were 1,715 commutations and 212 pardons.",
      "Most of those who received executive clemency under Obama had been convicted of narcotics charges at the height of the so-called US war on drugs.",
      "One of the most controversial presidential pardons was granted by Gerald Ford to his predecessor Richard Nixon in 1974 - covering acts that occurred during the Watergate Scandal. It was described as an effort to heal the nation.",
      "What have Biden and Trump said about pardons?",
      "The day after he took office in 2021, Biden emphasised that he would do things differently to Trump. His press secretary told reporters that the flurry of last-minute pardons issued by Trump was \"not a model... for how President Biden would use his own power. He would use his own power far more judiciously\".",
      "Biden said after his son's conviction that he would not issue a pardon. In the statement announcing his U-turn, he acknowledged that he had pledged to \"not interfere with the justice department\u2019s decision-making\". But, he said, the younger Biden had been \"singled out\" and subjected to a \"miscarriage of justice\".",
      "Trump is among those who have attacked Biden for the move, calling it an \"abuse\".",
      "The incoming president asked whether Biden would also pardon supporters of his who were prosecuted over the US Capitol riot on 6 January 2021.",
      "Trump, who faced a series of legal issues while away from the White House, has repeatedly made the allegation that the US justice system has been weaponised against him and his supporters.",
      "He has promised to issue pardons of his own for those who rioted in Washington. But who exactly will be granted clemency, and whether pardons will extend to those convicted of the most serious and violent offences, is still an open question."

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 21:16:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The country's president has already shown he is prepared to go to brutal lengths to save his regime.",
    "story": [
      "The reignited war in Syria is the latest fallout from the turmoil that has gripped the Middle East since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October last year.",
      "The attacks, and Israel\u2019s response, upended the status quo. Events in Syria in the last few days are more proof that the war gripping the Middle East is escalating, not subsiding.",
      "During a decade of war after 2011, Bashar al-Assad\u2019s rule survived because he was prepared to break Syria to save the regime he had inherited from his father.",
      "To do that he relied on powerful allies, Russia, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. They intervened on his side against rebel groups that ranged from the jihadist extremists of Islamic State to militias supported by the US and the rich Gulf monarchies.",
      "Now Iran is reeling from severe blows inflicted by Israel, with US support, on its security in the Middle East. Its ally Hezbollah, which used to send its best men to fight for the Assad regime in Syria, has been crippled by Israel\u2019s attacks. Russia has launched air strikes in the last few days against the rebel offensive in Syria \u2013 but its military power is almost entirely earmarked to fight the war in Ukraine.",
      "The war in Syria did not end. It dropped out of the place it used to occupy in headline news, partly because of turbulence across the Middle East and beyond, and because it is almost impossible for journalists to get into the country.",
      "In places the war was suspended, or frozen, but Syria is full of unfinished business.",
      "The Assad regime has never regained the power it had used to control Syria before 2011, the year of the Arab uprisings, though it still kept a gulag of Syrian prisoners in its jails.",
      "Even so, until the last few days, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad controlled the major cities, their surrounding countryside and the main highways connecting them.",
      "Now a coalition of rebel groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has broken out of Idlib, the province along the border with Turkey that it controls, and in only a few days since 27 November swept away Syrian troops in a series of \"astonishing\" events, as one senior international diplomat told me.",
      "Two days into the offensive, they were posting photos of fighters who had taken the ancient citadel of Aleppo, which had been an impregnable base for government troops between 2012 and 2015, when the city was divided between rebels and regime forces.",
      "The atmosphere in Aleppo seems calm after the rout of government troops. One photo on social media showed uniformed and armed rebel fighters queuing for fried chicken at a fast-food outlet.",
      "HTS has roots in al-Qaeda, though it broke with the group in 2016 and at times has fought its rump loyalists. But HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the UN Security Council and countries including the US, the European Union, Turkey and the UK.  (The Syrian regime calls all its opponents terrorists.)",
      "The leader of HTS, Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani, has a long history as a jihadist leader in Iraq and Syria. In recent years, though, he has moved away from strict jihadist ideology to try to broaden the appeal of his group.",
      "The rebranding is also being used to attract support for the offensive, which HTS calls Operation Repelling the Aggression. That name, and its official announcements, avoid jihadist language and Islamist references.",
      "Neutral language, according to Mina al-Lami, the jihadist media specialist at BBC Monitoring, is designed to distance what\u2019s happening from the jihadist past of HTS and present the offensive as a joint rebel enterprise against the regime.",
      "Syrians are generally repelled by extreme religious rhetoric. As jihadist groups came to dominate the rebellion after pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed after the first year or so of war after 2011, many Syrians either stayed neutral or sided reluctantly with the regime because they feared the murderous jihadist ideology of Islamic State.",
      "The offensive led by HTS comes out of the splintered political landscape of northern Syria. Much of the north-east is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group led by Kurds and supported by the United States, which stations around 900 troops in the area.",
      "Turkey is a big player, controlling borderlands where it has deployed its own regular troops as well as the militias it sponsors. Sleeper cells drawn from the remnants of Islamic State sometimes mount deadly ambushes on roads through the Syrian desert.",
      "Reports from Syria say that the rebel forces have captured significant supplies of military equipment, including helicopters, and are pressing on towards Hama, the next significant city on the road to Damascus.",
      "Without a doubt the regime and its allies will be working to steady themselves and to hit back, especially with air power. The rebels do not have an air force, though in another sign of the way that unmanned aerial vehicles are revolutionising warfare, there are reports that they used a drone to kill a senior regime intelligence official.",
      "The renewed fighting in Syria is causing international alarm. The UN envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, issued a statement saying that \"the latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international security\u2026 No Syrian party or existing group of actors can resolve the Syrian conflict via military means\".",
      "Pedersen added that there had been \"a collective failure to bring about a genuine political process\" to implement UN Security Council resolution 2254, which was passed in 2015. That laid out a roadmap for peace, with the principle in the text that \u201cthe Syrian people will decide the future of Syria\u201d.",
      "The objective was a future shaped by free elections and a new constitution. But that meant Assad and his family giving up a country that they treated for years as their personal fief. More than half a million dead attest to their determination not to let that happen.",
      "It is too soon to write the Assad regime off. It has a core of genuine support. Some Syrians see it as the least bad option \u2013 better than the jihadists who came to dominate the rebellion. But if other anti-Assad groups \u2013 and there are many \u2013 rise up, his regime will once again be in mortal danger.",

    "title": "She fled Israeli bombing four times. It still found her",
    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 22:01:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Rihab Faour's long journey to safety, from her small village in southern Lebanon, ended in the death of her young family.",
    "story": [
      "Rihab Faour fled her home. Then she fled again. Then a third time. Then a fourth. And by the fourth time, a year after the first, she had been fleeing Israeli bombs for so long that nowhere in Lebanon felt safe.",
      "Her journey had begun in October 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel. That prompted Hezbollah, the Lebanese political and militant group, to fire rockets into Israel and Israel to retaliate by bombing southern Lebanon.",
      "The Israeli bombs fell close enough to Rihab\u2019s village that the 33-year-old and her husband Saeed, an employee of the municipal water company, gathered their daughters Tia, eight, and Naya, six, and fled to Rihab\u2019s parents\u2019 house in Dahieh, a  suburb of the capital Beirut.",
      "In Dahieh, for a while, life went on almost as normal, with the exception that Naya and Tia missed their friends, their own beds, their toys and all clothes they had had to leave behind.",
      "Most of all they missed going to school, which had been replaced by online learning. They were excited when, back in August, Rihab enrolled them in a new school in Beirut and took them to buy brand new school uniforms.",
      "But before their first day could arrive, Israel expanded its bombing of Lebanon to include parts of Beirut, particularly the Dahieh suburb that the family now called home.",
      "Israel was assassinating senior Hezbollah figures in the suburb, but it was using large, bunker-busting bombs, each capable of destroying a residential building. In some strikes, Israel dropped dozens of these bombs in one go and flattened entire city blocks.",
      "So the Faour family packed up and fled again, this time to a rented house in another Beirut neighbourhood, Jnah. After a powerful air strike in Jnah, they moved to Saeed\u2019s parents\u2019 house in the neighbourhood of Barbour. There, they lived with 17 others in a single house - people piled on people.",
      "For Tia and Naya though, now nine and seven, it was a rare joy to be surrounded by their cousins day and night. So much so that even when Rihab\u2019s father, a retired Lebanese army sergeant, found a rental apartment in the Basta neighbourhood just for the four of them, the girls did not want to go.",
      "\u201cNaya begged us to stay there with all the family,\u201d Rihab recalled. \u201cWe told her we  just had to go for one sleep in this new house, then we would come straight back to the family and to all the children.\u201d",
      "And she offered the girls a bargain - come to stay at the new apartment and you can choose your dinner. So on the way home they stopped for rotisserie chicken and other treats from the shop, and at about 7.30pm, with the streets still alive with people, the family pulled up to a rundown building in Basta in central Beirut.",
      "Back in 2006, during the previous war between Israel and Hezbollah, the bombing was confined to certain areas of Lebanon - the south, Dahieh, and some infrastructure targets. This time, as senior members of Hezbollah spread out around the country, Israel bombed them where they went.",
      "This brought bombs to places previously thought safe, including parts of central Beirut.",
      "None of that was weighing on Tia and Naya as the family unloaded their belongings into the new apartment. For now, the girls were more concerned with returning to their cousins at the earliest opportunity.",
      "Unlike Saeed's parents' house, the new Basta apartment had running water and a generator for electricity. The girls were happy when they saw that the family finally had their own space. Rihab and Saeed relaxed a little. Most likely, there would have been an Israeli drone buzzing overhead, but the sound had become so common over Beirut that it was possible to tune it out.",
      "Rihab put the food and treats on the table. \u201cWe sat down to eat and we were talking and laughing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that was it, my last memory of them.\u201d",
      "The bomb was a US-made Jdam. It hit the building on 10 October at about 8pm, half an hour after the family had arrived. It levelled all three storeys and destroyed parts of adjacent buildings and cars, and killed 22 men, women and children, making it the deadliest strike on central Beirut since the beginning of the fighting a year earlier.",
      "The Israeli military issued no warning ahead of the strike, so the building was full of people. Israel was reportedly targeting Wafiq Safa, the head of Hezbollah\u2019s co-ordination and liaison unit, but Safa was never reported to be among the dead. He had either survived, or he wasn't there to begin with. The IDF declined to comment on the strike or the lack of a warning ahead of it.",
      "Rihab woke up in Beirut\u2019s Zahraa Hospital, unable to move. Her back and arm were badly injured and she needed at least two operations. She drifted in and out of consciousness. Everything in her mind between laughing with her daughters at dinner and waking up in the hospital was blank.",
      "While she lay there that night, her family searched Beirut\u2019s hospitals. By midnight, they knew that Saeed and Tia were dead. DNA tests would be required to confirm that Naya had been killed, as well as another girl her age brought to the same hospital, because their injuries prevented straightforward identification.",
      "Rihab\u2019s doctors advised the family not to tell her any of this. They were worried that, still facing significant surgery, the news would be too much for her. So for two weeks, as she underwent and then recovered from her operations, her mother Basima reassured her that Saeed and the girls were being treated in different hospitals.",
      "But Rihab sensed that something was wrong, and she began to insist on seeing pictures and videos of the girls. \u201cShe could feel it in her heart,\u201d Basima said.",
      "Eleven days after the strike, the DNA test confirmed that Tia was dead, and on the 15th day a hospital psychiatrist told Rihab that Saeed and the girls were gone.",
      "Six weeks later, Rihab was sitting in a stiff plastic chair in an apartment in Beirut, her eyes dark and her face drawn. She was still recovering from her surgeries - to install eight screws into her spine and another three into her arm. She had been lying down for a long time, and now she was trying to sit up more and to walk a little, though every movement caused her pain.",
      "Naya\u2019s eighth birthday had been four days earlier. Rihab was passing her time \u201ceither crying or sleeping\u201d, she said. But she wanted to talk about her family.",
      "\u201cNaya was very attached to me, she followed me wherever I went. Tia loved her grandparents and she was happy if I left her with them. Both of the girls loved drawing, they loved playing with toys, they missed going to school. They would play teacher and student together for hours.\u201d",
      "Above all they loved to watch videos together on TikTok. Rihab and Saeed thought they were still too young to post their own videos online, so Rihab would film them dancing and playing and tell the girls she was posting them on the app, which seemed to satisfy them, for now.",
      "Saeed had come into Rihab\u2019s life in 2013. Rihab was raised in Beirut but her family would visit the village of Mays El Jabal in the summer, because the air was cooler there and the village was surrounded by countryside, and that summer she met Saeed through mutual friends.",
      "Rihab completed her undergraduate law degree and began studying for a masters, but the couple became engaged and then married, and soon Tia was born, so Rihab put her budding law career on hold.",
      "Now, in the midst of her loss, she has tentatively begun to think of studying again. \u201cI am going to need something to fill my days,\u201d she said.",
      "Saeed and Tia were buried the day after they died, by Rihab\u2019s father and uncles, in temporary wooden caskets in an unmarked grave in Dahieh. Two weeks later, the men of the family dug again in the same spot and buried Naya. Rihab\u2019s uncle placed two sprigs of artificial cherry blossom atop the grave, for the two girls, and later someone else laid a wreath for a stranger buried beside them.",
      "Then an Israeli air strike hit the building directly adjacent to the cemetery and the resultant blast wave and debris smashed gravestones and churned up the earth around them. About the same time, another Israeli air strike hit the family home in Dahieh, destroying several items Rihab had wanted to keep, including two new, unworn school uniforms.",
      "Not long after that, it was all over. A ceasefire announced last week allowed thousands of displaced people to stream back to their villages in the south of Lebanon. Rihab and Saeed\u2019s village was heavily bombed by the Israelis and their family home there destroyed, her uncle said, but Rihab cannot return home anyway, because she will be in a backbrace for several more months and cannot travel.",
      "As joy spread through Lebanon at the news of the ceasefire, new pictures emerged of Wafiq Safa, the reported target of the bomb that killed Saeed, Tia, Naya and 19 others. Safa had not been seen in public since the strike, but he appeared to be alive and well.",

      "It followed a 12-person jury in Dublin finding McGregor guilty of sexual assault in a civil case brought by Nikita Hand, who accused him of raping her at a Dublin hotel in December 2018. She was awarded nearly \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3208,000) in damages. In a social media post, McGregor said he would appeal the decision.",
      "Ms Hand\u2019s case was one of several legal issues and controversies that McGregor, one of Ireland\u2019s most famous athletes, has faced over the past few years.",
      "In 2018, he was arrested in New York for throwing a metal dolly at the window of a bus which had a group of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) staff and athletes on board. A year later, he was convicted and fined \u20ac1,000 (\u00a3850) for punching a man who rejected his offer of a drink in a Dublin pub.",

      "Petesy Carroll, a mixed martial arts (MMA) journalist, credits McGregor and his team for bringing MMA to Ireland, but says they have \"also destroyed it as a sport here\".",
      "Now, after the civil case, it\u2019s unclear what comes next.",
      "A divisive figure",
      "McGregor\u2019s rise to sporting stardom has often been described as a rags-to-riches tale. As a teenager, living in Lucan, Dublin, he quit his job as an apprentice plumber to pursue a career in a sport that was relatively unknown in Ireland.",
      "\u201cThe Irish mentality is when you\u2019re finished school, if you\u2019re not going to college or anything you need to get a job straight away. There\u2019s no chasing your dreams,\u201d he said in a 2013 interview with RT\u00c9\u2019s Late Late Show, where he was 24 years old and almost unrecognisable.",

      "Carroll, who has been covering McGregor since the beginning of his career, says McGregor burst on to the mainstream at a time when Ireland was grappling with the impact of the 2008 recession.",
      "\u201cThere are no opportunities, everybody\u2019s leaving for Australia or Canada, and here\u2019s this guy saying \u2018No, be proud to be Irish. It\u2019s cool to be Irish,'\u201d Carroll says.",
      "\"I used to think this guy, it\u2019s great, he\u2019s the same age as me, I\u2019m a college graduate, I\u2019ve walked out of college into a country that cannot afford me any opportunity, and here\u2019s this guy blazing a trail.\"",
      "McGregor made his UFC debut in Stockholm in 2013, aged 25, defeating Marcus Brimage and winning a knockout of the night award, which came with a $60,000 bonus. In a press conference after the event, McGregor said it was the best moment of his career yet.",

      "By then, it was clear his fame - and bank account - was reaching new heights.",
      "One of the biggest moments in his career came later that year, when he defeated Jos\u00e9 Aldo to win the featherweight title. His first loss was against Nate Diaz in 2016. A rematch a few months later, which McGregor won, sold a record-breaking 1.6 million pay-per-view buys.",
      "That year, on the US chat show Jimmy Kimmel Live, McGregor was asked at what age he realised he was good at fighting. \u201cI\u2019m Irish, we\u2019re all good at fighting,\u201d he told Kimmel. \u201cWhere I come from, where I grew up, you had to be aware, you had to be able to defend yourself, so that\u2019s how I got into it.\u201d",
      "Back on home soil, McGregor was named Sportsperson of the Year at the RT\u00c9 Sport Awards. Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Carroll, an Irish journalist and editor who covered the recent trial, says this was seen as a \u201cremarkable feat\u201d as it happened in the same year as the Olympics and Ireland\u2019s Euro 2016 victory over Italy.",
      "\u201cIt was divisive though,\" she adds. \u201cSome people thought that he wasn\u2019t so much a sportsperson, that he was more a celebrity and people looked up to him because of his attitude and his fame.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s never been a very clear-cut, popular figure in Ireland, but he would have been part of that establishment, winning that award, being invited onto the Late Late Show and would have been highly regarded for his feats in the cage, if nothing else,\u201d she says.",

He fought Mayweather in August of that year, having faced accusations of racism during the promotional tour, which McGregor rejected. Mayweather stopped him in the 10th round.",
      "Ms O'Carroll says some people did not like the antics in the lead up to the fight or the mixing of genres from MMA to boxing.",
      "\u201cBut he still would have had a huge support base, and I remember that fight. It was in the middle of the night, but huge numbers of people would have gotten up in the morning to watch it and it would have been headline news,\u201d she adds.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 13:27:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Uganda is facing condemnation following the arrest of the veteran politician while in Kenya.",
    "story": [
      "The mysterious detention of Uganda's opposition leader Kizza Besigye while on a visit to Kenya nearly two weeks ago has sparked widespread condemnation and fears of a clandestine exchange of intelligence between the two neighbours.",
      "Besigye's allies and wife have come out to reveal harrowing details of how the opposition chief was apparently lured to meet his abductors, said to have disguised themselves as Kenyan security agents.",
      "Reports say he was spied on from the time he boarded a plane at Entebbe airport in Uganda for Kenya's capital, Nairobi, where he was picked up, before somehow being transferred to a military court back home without any extradition proceedings.",
      "While Kenya insists it played no role and is investigating the incident, Uganda holds that Kenya was fully aware of the plan, citing intelligence correspondence aimed at tracking Besigye down.",
      "As his detention is extended until next week by a military court in Kampala, we piece together what we know so far.",
      "Who is Kizza Besigye?",
      "Besigye has contested and lost four presidential elections against President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986.",
      "He has been less active in politics recently, and did not contest the 2021 election.",
      "But earlier this year, he formed a new party, the People's Front for Freedom (PFF) after breaking away from the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), which he founded two decades ago.",
      "The opposition politician has for years travelled to Kenya and moved freely, sometimes to attend high-profile events - even while he remained Museveni's main challenger and biggest critic.",
      "What led up to Besigye's disappearance?",
      "This time, Besigye travelled to Nairobi to attend the launch of a book by Kenyan opposition politician Martha Karua.",
      "The 68-year-old landed in the city on the morning of 16 November and took a taxi to his hotel in the affluent suburb of Hurlingham. He was accompanied by long-term ally Hajj Obeid Lutale.",
      "A few hours later, he left the hotel, boarded a taxi and headed to Riverside Drive, some 5km (three miles) from his hotel, for a private meeting, according to his political allies.",
      "This was the last time he was seen until he re-emerged in Uganda four days later.",
      "His taxi driver said he waited for the veteran politician for more than 12 hours, before deciding to leave when he was unable to phone him.",
      "Besigye\u2019s team in Uganda started relaying distress calls after their leader's mobile phones went unanswered.",
      "His disappearance hit the headlines and raised eyebrows in the region, with his wife Winnie Byanyima, the head of the UN's organisation to tackle HIV and Aids, taking to social media to report that her husband had been \"kidnapped\" in Nairobi.",
      "The next day, his reserved seat at the book launch, where he was expected to be the guest speaker, remained empty with organisers raising the alarm about his absence.",
      "How was Besigye picked up?",
      "Besigye and his friend Lutale arrived at the apartment along Riverside Drive where he was due to meet an unidentified Ugandan national and another unknown British national, according to Ms Byanyima.",
      "The British national supposedly wanted to introduce Besigye to a group of colleagues and businessmen, who had expressed an interest in financially backing  the PFF, she said.",
      "In the room there was a box of what appeared to be a stash of money. One of the hosts had two guns.",
      "Shortly after a brief introduction, eight men in plain clothes who said they were Kenyan police officers knocked on the door and told Besigye and his associate they were under arrest, Ms Byanyima told Kenya\u2019s Citizen TV.",
      "The opposition chief tried to explain he had nothing to do with the items in the room, but the security agents did not listen.",
      "Four of the men bundled Besigye and Lutale into a car with Kenyan number plates and drove them under the cover of night towards the border with Uganda.",
      "\"It was clearly an operation well planned,\" Ms Byanyima added.",
      "Before crossing over to Uganda, the four men switched from speaking Swahili and started talking in the Ugandan languages, Luganda and Runyankole.",
      "The two captive were ferried to Uganda without their belongings, including their passports, which were later picked up by Besigye's party officials from the Nairobi hotel.",
      "PFF spokesperson Ibrahim Ssemujju Nganda told Uganda's Monitor newspaper that Besigye and his friend went through the Malaba border post without stopping for routine security checks.",
      "\"They only changed vehicles. The four-wheel drive vehicle with the Kenyan number plate was left at the Malaba border post and moved to another vehicle with [a] Ugandan number plate,\" he said.",
      "Why was Besigye picked up in Nairobi and was he set up?",
      "Uganda's Information Minister Chris Baryomunsi said detectives had gathered enough intelligence to arrest Besigye while in Nairobi.",
      "He said the Kenyan authorities had enabled the cross-border operation, even though officials in Nairobi insist they knew nothing about it.",
      "Besigye is now being tried in Kampala and not Nairobi because the crime that was planned was \"against Uganda and not Kenya\", Ugandan army spokesman Brig Gen Felix Kulayigye told the BBC's Africa Daily podcast.",
      "\"We have a legal framework with our counterparts in Kenya to deal with matters that threaten regional security,\" he added.",
      "However, he did not explain why there was no extradition process.",
      "Reports indicate that Besigye's arrest had been planned for months and was executed with the help of some people who were close to him.",
      "Organisers of the meeting are said to be a British national and a senior official of the Ugandan army, both of whom were well known to Besigye, Ugandan media reported.",
      "His wife alleged the British national who was in the meeting was a \"paid operative who tried to plant guns\" on Besigye.",
      "Why is Besigye facing a military court?",
      "Over the decades, hundreds of civilians have been tried in Uganda's military courts, even though the Constitutional Court has ruled against the practice.",
      "Besigye, who is no stranger to appearing in military courts, is back there because he subjected himself to military law, Brig Kulayigye told the BBC.",
      "Last week, he and his co-accused were arraigned at the Makindye military court after being held incommunicado for four days.",
      "They are facing four charges which include being found with two pistols and ammunition, and seeking to buy weapons from foreigners in the Swiss city of Geneva, the Greek capital, Athens, and Nairobi.",
      "The two denied all charges.",
      "Besigye objected to being tried by a court martial, saying that if there were any charges against him, he should be tried in a civilian court.",
      "His lawyers also argued that the alleged offences were committed outside Uganda and therefore they were arraigned in the court martial illegally.",
      "But the court overruled the lawyers and allowed the hearing to continue.",
      "The accused were initially remanded to Luzira maximum prison until 2 December, which has now been extended to 10 December.",
      "The court is then expected to rule on objections raised by the defence team, including whether Uganda has jurisdiction to try Besigye on crimes he allegedly committed on foreign soil.",
      "The adjournment also gives time for Besigye's new lead lawyer, Kenya's Martha Karua, to obtain a temporary practising licence to participate in the trial.",
      "Agather Atuhaire, a Ugandan lawyer and a human rights activist, told the BBC that Kenya should have arrested Besigye and extradited him to Uganda following the laws that govern the process.",
      "Ms Byanyima said she did not expect her husband to get justice.",
      "But Brig Kulayigye said the court martial \"is not a kangaroo court\".",
      "\"Justice will be served.\"",
      "Has the matter affected relations between Kenya and Uganda?",
      "Kenyan authorities have swung between denying any knowledge of the operation and remaining silent, while Ugandan officials say that a lot of intelligence was shared between the two countries.",
      "\"The government of Uganda was in touch with the government of Kenya. Otherwise, how would you arrest somebody in the middle of Nairobi and then bring him back to Uganda, whether through the airport or land, without the full knowledge and support of the state there in Kenya?\" Information Minister Baryomunsi told Uganda\u2019s NBS TV.",
      "Many Kenyans are asking about the nature of security ties between the two countries and if there was a full disclosure that Besigye would be charged in a military court.",
      "Last Tuesday, Kenya's acting Foreign Affairs Minister Musalia Mudavadi refrained from giving clear answers to journalists, pleading that his country should not be judged \"too harshly\".",
      "Mudavadi, who is also the acting interior minister, said Kenya was an open country, which allowed \"a lot of latitude\". But he warned foreigners against causing a rift between Kenya and their home countries.",
      "He said Besigye's matter would be resolved diplomatically, describing Uganda as Kenya's \"strong partner\".",
      "The acknowledgement by Uganda that Kenya was involved in the abduction has left the Kenyan government facing a backlash both in Uganda and back home.",
      "Some Ugandans have held protests outside the Kenyan embassy in Kampala while others have threatened to boycott Kenyan brands.",
      "Besigye\u2019s detention follows a string of high-profile abductions and disappearances in Kenya, including the forced deportation of four Turkish refugees to Ankara, where they faced allegations of conspiring against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:21:26 GMT",
    "summary": "The move makes it easier for future presidents to ignore guardrails and use the pardon power as a political instrument.",
    "story": [
      "Joe Biden had repeatedly denied that he was going to pardon his son Hunter for his gun and tax evasion convictions or commute what was shaping up to be a substantive prison sentence.",
      "On the Sunday evening after Thanksgiving \u2013 at a moment when the American public\u2019s attention was decidedly elsewhere \u2013 he announced he had changed his mind.",
      "\u201cThere has been an effort to break Hunter - who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution,\u201d he wrote in a press statement announcing his decision. \u201cIn trying to break Hunter, they\u2019ve tried to break me - and there\u2019s no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.\u201d",
      "Biden's move has already prompted furious claims of hypocrisy from Republicans \u2013 for breaking his promise and for using his presidential power to protect his son. One Democratic governor, Jared Polis of Colorado, quickly released a statement saying he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and that the move would \u201ctarnish\u201d the outgoing president\u2019s reputation.",
      "Follow live reaction to this storyPresident Biden's statement in fullWhat did Hunter Biden do and what is a presidential pardon?Full story: Biden highlights 'miscarriage of justice'",
      "Follow live reaction to this story",
      "President Biden's statement in full",
      "What did Hunter Biden do and what is a presidential pardon?",
      "Full story: Biden highlights 'miscarriage of justice'",
      "Presidents have pardoned family members in the past. In 2001, Bill Clinton issued clemency for his brother Roger\u2019s 1985 drug conviction. Hunter Biden\u2019s \u201cfull and unconditional\u201d pardon was particularly broad, however. It covers his criminal convictions, as well as any future charges for \u201coffenses against the United States\u201d from the start of 2014 to this Sunday.",
      "That time period includes two years that Hunter Biden served on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma and was involved in other international dealings while his father served as vice-president. Republicans have alleged that Hunter Biden had improperly benefitted from his father\u2019s position of power and that the elder Biden had been connected to his son\u2019s business dealings.",
      "The president\u2019s explanation for the pardon might sound familiar to anyone who has listened to Donald Trump rail against America\u2019s system of justice in recent years.",
      "Trump, as he exited the White House in 2021, issued a series of pardons for his close associates and allies who had been swept up in the multiple criminal investigations that encircled him throughout his presidential term. In doing so, he bypassed established White House procedures for exercising the broad presidential pardon power. And although he was criticised for the action at the time, there were little if any political consequences.",
      "Last week, in fact, Trump announced that he was nominating one of his 2021 pardon recipients - Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2013 to be US ambassador to France. Kushner had been convicted of campaign finance violations, tax evasion and witness tampering in 2005 and served two years in prison.",
      "With Biden\u2019s political career drawing to a close, however, there is little price he could pay for his action. And given that Democrats lost power in both Congress and the White House last month, there are few members of the party in a position of power to face the consequences.",
      "If Vice-President Kamala Harris had won, her presidential transition would have been derailed at least temporarily, as she would have been pressed to condemn Biden\u2019s move. It may have made such a sweeping act by Biden less likely. Instead, the national attention will quickly shift back to the incoming Trump presidency.",
      "The rules governing presidential pardoning \u2013 or at the very least the processes and established guardrails that had guided its use \u2013 appear to have been fundamentally and permanently altered. At this point there may be scarce grounds for anyone to complain, no matter on which side of the political aisle they stand.",
      "\"With this decision, Biden has now made it easier for Trump to abuse the clemency power again,\" Jeffrey Crouch, a legal expert from American University, told CBS, the BBC's US partner. \"If presidents from both political parties feel free to abuse clemency without consequence, the pardon power becomes less a tool of grace and more of a political instrument.\"",
      "The Trump camp was quick to issue a response to the news of the Biden pardon, saying that the president-elect would fix the US justice system and restore due process in his second term.",
      "It\u2019s something to keep in mind when Trump returns to office, as he is expected to again use his pardoning power to aid associates who have been prosecuted during the Biden presidency \u2013 and to free many of his supporters who have been convicted during the 6 January, 2021, riot at the US Capitol.",
      "Trump mentioned the 6 January cases when criticising the Hunter Biden pardon, and he is likely to cite the president\u2019s action when he issues his own round of pardons next year.",
      "Both sides will continue to accuse the other of partisan prosecutions and governing as though they are above the law. An American public that polls suggest already is sceptical of ethics in government may now be even more convinced that both sides share the blame."

      "The leader of the self-styled Islamic State (IS) group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was also involved in its formation.",

      "To achieve victory, President Assad could not depend on the country\u2019s under-equipped and poorly motivated conscript army alone, which soon became dangerously stretched and regularly unable to hold positions against rebel attacks.",

      "These included Hezbollah.",
      "There is little doubt that the setback Hezbollah has suffered recently from Israel\u2019s offensive in Lebanon, as well as Israeli strikes on Iranian military commanders in Syria, has played a significant part in the decision by jihadist and rebel groups in Idlib to make their sudden, unexpected move on Aleppo.",

      "She had a lot of questions and didn\u2019t know where to start. \u201cWe just sat together, watching each other and trying to find something in common,\u201d she says.",
      "As the two of them chatted, they realised they shared a lot of interests - Gurgen had once been a renowned dancer at the State Ballet of Georgia, and was delighted to learn that Tamuna\u2019s daughters - his granddaughters - shared his passion.",
      "\u201cThey both love dancing, and so does my husband,\u201d she says with a smile.",
      "Gurgen invited his entire family to his home to meet Tamuna, introducing her to a large group of new relatives - half siblings, cousins, aunts, and uncles. The family agreed there was a strong resemblance between them. \u201cOut of all his children, I look the most like my father,\u201d she says.",
      "They spent an evening sharing stories, eating traditional Georgian food, and singing while Gurgen played the accordion.",
      "Even though she had now met her father, Tamuna still had a niggling question: had she - like thousands of other Georgians - been stolen from her mother at birth and sold? Her adoptive parents were no longer alive so she couldn\u2019t turn to them for answers.",
      "She finally got a chance to ask her birth mother in October. A Polish TV company was filming a documentary about Tamuna and took her to meet her mother, who agreed to talk to her in private.",
      "Unlike many people Tamuna has helped to reunite, she discovered that she had not been a stolen child herself. Instead, her mother had given her up and kept the secret for 40 years.",
      "Her mother and father were not in a relationship and had only had a brief encounter. Her mother - overwhelmed by shame - chose to hide her pregnancy. In September 1984, she travelled to Tbilisi, telling people she was going for surgery, and instead gave birth to a daughter. She stayed there until arrangements were made for Tamuna\u2019s adoption.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to learn that I spent 10 days alone with her before the adoption. I try not to think about that,\u201d Tamuna reflects.",
      "She says that her mother asked her to lie and tell people she had been stolen. \u201cShe told me that if I would not say that I was stolen, everything would end between us\u2026 and I said that I couldn\u2019t do that.\"",
      "Tamuna feels this would be unfair to all the parents whose babies were stolen. \u201cIf I lie, nobody's going to believe those mothers any more,\u201d she explains.",
      "Her mother then asked her to leave the house and they have not spoken since.",
      "\u201cWould I do it all again?\u201d she reflects. \u201cOf course I would, I found out so much about my new family.\u201d",

    "summary": "Theyyam is an ancient folk ritual combining theatre, mime, and worship, predating Hinduism.",
    "story": [
      "For nearly 300 years, a family\u2019s ancestral house in India's southern state of Kerala has been the stage for theyyam, an ancient folk ritual.",
      "Rooted in ancient tribal traditions, theyyam predates Hinduism while weaving in Hindu mythology. Each performance is both a theatrical spectacle and an act of devotion, transforming the performer into a living incarnation of the divine.",
      "The predominantly male performers in Kerala and parts of neighbouring Karnataka embody deities through elaborate costumes, face paint, and trance-like dances, mime and music.",
      "Each year, nearly a thousand theyyam performances take place in family estates and venues near temples across Kerala, traditionally performed by men from marginalised castes and tribal communities.",
      "It is often called ritual theatre for its electrifying drama, featuring daring acts like fire-walking, diving into burning embers, chanting occult verses, and prophesying.",
      "Historian KK Gopalakrishnan has celebrated his family\u2019s legacy in hosting theyyam and the ritual\u2019s vibrant traditions in a new book, Theyyam: An Insider\u2019s Vision.",
      "The theyyams are performed in the courtyard of Mr Gopalakrishnan's ancient joint family house (above) in Kasaragod district. Hundreds of people gather to witness the performances.",
      "The theyyam season in Kerala typically runs from October to April, aligning with the post-monsoon and winter months. During this time, numerous venues near temples and family estates, especially in northern Kerala districts like Kannur and Kasaragod, host performances.",
      "The themes of performances at Mr Gopalakrishnan's house include honouring a deified ancestor, venerating a warrior-hunter deity, and worshipping tiger spirits symbolising strength and protection.",
      "Before the performance honouring a local goddess, a ritual is conducted in a nearby forest, revered as the deity's earthly home.",
      "Following an elaborate ceremony (above), the \"spirit of the goddess\" is then transported to the house.",
      "Mr Gopalakrishnan is a member of the Nambiar community, a matrilineal branch of the Nair caste, where the senior-most maternal uncle oversees the arrangements. If he is unable to fulfil this role due to age or illness, the next senior male member steps in.",
      "Women in the family, especially the senior-most among them, play a crucial role in the rituals.",
      "They ensure traditions are upheld, prepare for the rituals, and oversee arrangements inside the house.",
      "\"They enjoy high respect and are integral to maintaining the family\u2019s legacy,\" says Mr Gopalakrishnan.",
      "The spectacle is a blend of loud cries, fiery torches, and intense scenes from epics or  dances.",
      "Performers sometimes bear the physical toll of these daring feats, with burn marks or even the loss of a limb.",
      "\"Fire plays a significant role in certain forms of theyyam, symbolising purification, divine energy, and the transformative power of the ritual. In some performances, the theyyam dancer interacts directly with fire, walking through flames or carrying burning torches, signifying the deity\u2019s invincibility and supernatural abilities,\" says Mr Gopalakrishnan.",
      "\"The use of fire adds a dramatic and intense visual element, further heightening the spiritual atmosphere of the performance and illustrating the deity\u2019s power over natural forces.\"",
      "The deities can be manifestations of gods and goddesses, ancestral spirits, animals, or even forces of nature.",
      "Here, the theyyam performer (above) embodies Raktheswari, a fierce manifestation of Kali, the Hindu goddess of destruction.",
      "She is portrayed drenched in blood, a powerful symbol of her raw energy and destructive force.",
      "This intense ritual delves into themes of sorcery, voodoo, and divine wrath.",
      "Through dramatic costume and ritualistic dance, the performance channels Kali\u2019s potent energy, invoking protection, justice, and spiritual cleansing.",
      "During the performance, the artist (or kolam) transforms into these deities, through elaborate costumes and body paint, their striking colours bringing the deities to life.",
      "Here, a performer meticulously adjusts his goddess attire, checking his look in the mirror before stepping into the ritual. The transformation is as much an act of devotion as it is a preparation for the electrifying performance ahead.",
      "Distinct facial markings, intricate designs, and vibrant hues - especially vermillion -define the unique makeup and costumes of theyyam.",
      "Each look is carefully crafted to symbolise the deity being portrayed, showcasing the rich diversity and detail that distinguishes this ritual art. Some theyyams do not require face painting but use only masks.",
      "Theyyam\u2019s animistic roots shine through in its reverence for nature and its creatures.",
      "This crawling crocodile theyyam deity symbolises the power of reptiles and is venerated as a protector against their dangers.",
      "With its detailed costume and lifelike movements, it highlights humanity\u2019s deep-rooted connection to nature.",
      "The deity will bless a large congregation of devotees after a performance.",
      "Here, a female devotee unburdens her troubles before a theyyam deity, seeking solace and divine intervention.",
      "As she offers her prayers, the sacred space becomes a moment of spiritual release, where devotion and vulnerability intertwine."

      "A charred lorry, empty tear gas shells and posters of former Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan - it was all that remained of a massive protest led by Khan\u2019s wife, Bushra Bibi, that had sent the entire capital into lockdown.",
      "Just a day earlier, faith healer Bibi - wrapped in a white shawl, her face covered by a white veil - stood atop a shipping container on the edge of the city as thousands of her husband\u2019s devoted followers waved flags and chanted slogans beneath her.",
      "It was the latest protest to flare since Khan, the 72-year-old cricketing icon-turned-politician, was jailed more than a year ago after falling foul of the country's influential military which helped catapult him to power.",
      "\u201cMy children and my brothers! You have to stand with me,\u201d Bibi cried on Tuesday afternoon, her voice cutting through the deafening roar of the crowd.",
      "\u201cBut even if you don\u2019t,\u201d she continued, \u201cI will still stand firm.",
      "\u201cThis is not just about my husband. It is about this country and its leader.\u201d",
      "It was, noted some watchers of Pakistani politics, her political debut.",
      "But as the sun rose on Wednesday morning, there was no sign of Bibi, nor the thousands of protesters who had marched through the country to the heart of the capital, demanding the release of their jailed leader.",
      "While other PMs have fallen out with Pakistan's military in the past, Khan's refusal to stay quiet behind bars is presenting an extraordinary challenge - escalating the standoff and leaving the country deeply divided.",
      "Exactly what happened to the so-called \u201cfinal march\u201d, and Bibi, when the city went dark is still unclear.",
      "All eyewitnesses like Samia* can say for certain is that the lights went out suddenly, plunging D Chowk, the square where they had gathered, into blackness.",
      "As loud screams and clouds of tear gas blanketed the square, Samia describes holding her husband on the pavement, bloodied from a gun shot to his shoulder.",
      "\"Everyone was running for their lives,\" she later told BBC Urdu from a hospital in Islamabad, adding it was \"like doomsday or a war\".",
      "\"His blood was on my hands and the screams were unending.\u201d",
      "But how did the tide turn so suddenly and decisively?",
      "Just hours earlier, protesters finally reached D Chowk late afternoon on Tuesday. They had overcome days of tear gas shelling and a maze of barricaded roads to get to the city centre.",
      "Many of them were supporters and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), the party led by Khan.",
      "He had called for the march from his jail cell, where he has been for more than a year on charges he says are politically motivated.",
      "Now Bibi - his third wife, a woman who had been largely shrouded in mystery and out of public view since their unexpected wedding in 2018 - was leading the charge.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t go back until we have Khan with us,\u201d she declared as the march reached D Chowk, deep in the heart of Islamabad\u2019s government district.",
      "Insiders say even the choice of destination - a place where her husband had once led a successful sit in - was Bibi\u2019s, made in the face of other party leader\u2019s opposition, and appeals from the government to choose another gathering point.",
      "Her being at the forefront may have come as a surprise. Bibi, only recently released from prison herself, is often described as private and apolitical. Little is known about her early life, apart from the fact she was a spiritual guide long before she met Khan. Her teachings, rooted in Sufi traditions, attracted many followers - including Khan himself.",
      "Was she making her move into politics - or was her sudden appearance in the thick of it a tactical move to keep Imran Khan\u2019s party afloat while he remains behind bars?",
      "For critics, it was a move that clashed with Imran Khan\u2019s oft-stated opposition to dynastic politics.",
      "There wasn\u2019t long to mull the possibilities.",
      "After the lights went out, witnesses say that police started firing fresh rounds of tear gas at around 21:30 local time (16:30 GMT).",
      "The crackdown was in full swing just over an hour later.",
      "At some point, amid the chaos, Bushra Bibi left.",
      "Videos on social media appeared to show her switching cars and leaving the scene. The BBC couldn\u2019t verify the footage.",
      "By the time the dust settled, her container had already been set on fire by unknown individuals.",
      "By 01:00 authorities said all the protesters had fled.",
      "Eyewitnesses have described scenes of chaos, with tear gas fired and police rounding up protesters.",
      "One, Amin Khan, said from behind an oxygen mask that he joined the march knowing that, \"either I will bring back Imran Khan or I will be shot\".",
      "The authorities have have denied firing at the protesters. They also said some of the protesters were carrying firearms.",
      "The BBC has seen hospital records recording patients with gunshot injuries.",
      "However, government spokesperson Attaullah Tarar told the BBC that hospitals had denied receiving or treating gunshot wound victims.",
      "He added that \"all security personnel deployed on the ground have been forbidden\" from having live ammunition during protests.",
      "But one doctor told BBC Urdu that he had never done so many surgeries for gunshot wounds in a single night.",
      "\"Some of the injured came in such critical condition that we had to start surgery right away instead of waiting for anaesthesia,\" he said.",
      "While there has been no official toll released, the BBC has confirmed with local hospitals that at least five people have died.",
      "Police say at least 500 protesters were arrested that night and are being held in police stations. The PTI claims some people are missing.",
      "And one person in particular hasn\u2019t been seen in days: Bushra Bibi.",
      "\u201cShe abandoned us,\u201d said one PTI supporter.",

      "\u201cHer exit damaged her political career before it even started,\u201d said Mehmal Sarfraz, a journalist and analyst.",
      "But was that even what she wanted?",
      "Khan has previously dismissed any thought his wife might have her own political ambitions - \u201cshe only conveys my messages,\u201d he said in a statement attributed to him on his X account.",
      "Speaking to BBC Urdu, analyst Imtiaz Gul calls her participation \u201can extraordinary step in extraordinary circumstances\".",
      "Gul believes Bushra Bibi\u2019s role today is only about \u201ckeeping the party and its workers active during Imran Khan\u2019s absence\u201d.",
      "It is a feeling echoed by some PTI members, who believe she is \u201cstepping in only because Khan trusts her deeply\u201d.",
      "Insiders, though, had often whispered that she was pulling the strings behind the scenes - advising her husband on political appointments and guiding high-stakes decisions during his tenure.",

    "story": [
      "\"It's not just about brewing a good cup of coffee but connecting with customers on a deeper level.\"",
      "It was this one thought that made Harmanpreet Singh leave his family bakery to open a specialty coffee shop in the northern Indian city of Jalandhar.",
      "It was an unexpected decision - coffee has always been popular in southern states, traditionally served strong and frothy in a steel tumbler. But it's still not the first choice of beverage in the vast swathes of north India, where drinking tea is an intrinsic part of the culture.",
      "For Mr Singh, the journey began in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic when he saw a growing demand for specialty coffee, particularly among the city's youth and the overseas residents who returned to the country at that time.",
      "Recognising this shift, he moved to the southern city of Bengaluru to learn brewing techniques. \"I studied everything - from the way coffee is served to the role things like decor, cutlery, music and even packaging played in the overall experience,\" he said.",
      "Three months later, Mr Singh put his learnings to test and opened Buland Caf\u00e9 in Jalandhar.",
      "Today, the cafe has 40 outlets across the city and has become a favourite spot for the city's youth, who come here to relax or work over piping cups of coffee.",
      "The beans, roasted in various blends, are sourced from the famed coffee estates of  Karnataka. Mr Singh says he personally trained his staff on how to brew the perfect cuppa and take care of the coffee machine.",
      "\"It's a thriving scene,\" he says.",
      "Mr Singh is among a crop of young entrepreneurs that are benefitting from a wave of specialty coffee consumption in small north Indian towns and cities.",
      "India has had a vibrant cafe culture for years - but it has been largely restricted to big cities where homegrown specialty and international coffee chains dominate the market.",
      "However, post-Covid, several tier-two cities are also seeing a boom in demand for such spaces as people embrace practices like remote working and look for new places to meet their friends and families.",
      "Cafe owners say more Indians are now willing to pay more for coffee that's roasted in smaller batches and customised as per their preferences.",
      "\"Clients have become more knowledgeable about the roasts and are interested in the origins of their coffee,\" says Bharat Singhal, the founder of Billi Hu roasteries.",
      "In fact, more than 44% of the Indian population now drinks coffee, a 2023 report by CRISIL, a marketing analytical company, shows.",
      "While a lot of it comes from home consumption, the growing demand for specialty coffee in small cities plays a big part, says Bhavi Patel, a coffee consultant and dairy technologist.",
      "Roastery owners say the growth is also evident in numbers. \"Subscription based orders have surged by 50% in one year,\" says Sharang Sharma, the founder of Bloom Coffee Roasters. \"Customers have moved from French presses to pour-over or espresso machines, adopting more sophisticated brewing methods.\"",
      "While India is often associated with tea, it also has a long coffee-drinking history.",
      "The culture took shape in the 1900s when Indian Coffee Houses emerged as a hangout spot for the intellectual and elite class. Housed in colonial-styled buildings, these cafes served English breakfasts with steaming hot coffee and offered a space to discuss politics and mobilise support during pivotal periods in history.",
      "A shift occurred in the 1990s when economic reforms opened India to the world, allowing entrepreneurs to open private coffee shops frequented by young peeople, who saw it as a hip experience.",
      "Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day (CCD), which opened in 1996, quickly became one of India\u2019s most popular and widespread coffee chains. At its peak, CCD boasted over 1,700 outlets, serving as a popular gathering spot for students and young adults. But mounting debt, management issues and the untimely death of its founder led to a closure of most of its outlets across India.",
      "In 2012, the arrival of international giant Starbucks spurred the rise of homegrown specialty coffee brands like Blue Tokai Roasters, Third Wave Coffee and Subko Coffee.",
      "Mr Singhal says that while big cities like Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai, and Bengaluru still dominate the scene, smaller cities are quickly catching up.",
      "However, it's not just changing palettes that's driving consumption. \"Often it's social media,\" Mr Singh says. \"People want good coffee but they also want to be in a space that's trendy and which they can post online.\"",
      "Nishant Sinha from Lucknow city is among those who understood the trend early on.",
      "His Roastery Coffee House offers trendy ambience, free wi-fi and cosy seating options along with an array of coffee roasts. While the beans are sourced from coffee estates in the south, the food is distinctively north Indian.",
      "Others like Jatin Khurana in the northern city of Ludhiana are experimenting with flavours.",
      "At his Urban Buhkkad cafe, Mr Khurana serves the \"Shadi Wali Coffee [the wedding coffee]\" - a wedding favourite in the 1990s, which became famous for its blend of instant coffee, milk, sugar, and a sprinkle of chocolate powder.",
      "But instead of coffee powder, Mr Khurana uses freshly grounded beans, available in different roasts and varieties, to enhance its flavours. \"The idea is to capture the essence of the beverage that many Indians grew up drinking,\" he says.",
      "It's an exciting time to be in the business - but growth comes with its own set of challenges.",
      "\"Demand is growing, but a smaller coffee shop owners tend to cut corners, whether it\u2019s by opting for substandard machines, serving weaker coffee shots, or hiring inexperienced baristas,\" Mr Singhal says.",

      "\"More than 70 million people watched the first one and they performed so well,\" Leigh said.",

      "Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, has long been known as \u201cthe green city in the sun\u201d because of its mix of forest and grasslands among the urban sprawl, but it all depends on where you are viewing it from.",
      "Seen from one of the city\u2019s comfortable apartment blocks or homes, then yes, perhaps \u2013 from one of its densely packed slums, then no.",
      "There, life can be characterised by poverty and ecological disaster, such as flooding and deadly landslides.",
      "But an art collective - Kairos Futura \u2013 has been trying to take what might seem like some of the city\u2019s more dystopian elements and create a vision of a utopia, or at least how that might be achieved.",
      "Their exhibition Hakuna Utopia features the works of seven artists exploring themes of apocalypse and resilience \u2013 some in quite abstract ways - as they respond to the daily challenges endured by Nairobi\u2019s six million residents.",

      "He has overcome great odds to become an artist and wants to use his work to address the way that people in Mathare live \u2013 often lacking jobs, housing and education.",
      "Bombaa says they endure a \u201chand-to-mouth economy\u201d, never sure where their next meal will come from.",
      "\u201cPeople are really angry,\u201d he says, but through art, he feels he can \u201cchannel\u201d his community\u2019s anger into something positive as \u201cart unites\u201d.",
      "Bombaa set out to create from the exhibitions \u201cmicro-utopia\u201d sites dotted around the city.",
      "He called it the \u201cjungle room\u201d and hoped to get people to connect with nature from within Mathare itself, in an attempt to bridge the ecological divide.",
      "Ironically, the building he had identified as a possible site was demolished by the authorities to make way for a road.",
      "Undeterred, he has been taking children from his community, often stuck living in unimaginable urban squalor, to experience Nairobi\u2019s verdant parks and expose them to green spaces.",
      "\u201cThere are no trees or green spaces in Mathare,\u201d Bombaa says.",
      "But by contemplating the idea of utopia, he believes that he can imagine what it would be like if people in his community actually had unrestricted access to the city\u2019s green spaces.",
      "In this way, people in his community can claim a right to access nature that is denied to them simply because they are poor.",
      "Bombaa also complains about how ordinary Nairobians, often scrabbling to make a living, have to pay to enter some of their city\u2019s most beautiful locations such as the arboretum or Karura forest.",
      "The Kairos Futura team are also drawing inspiration from nature to use their imagination in how to address urgent environmental issues.",
      "For example, Coltrane McDowell has applied this to architecture.",
      "In his work Invisible Cities, he was inspired by termite mounds to reimagine what architecture might look like in the future.",
      "Another artist in the show, Abdul Rop, known for his mesmerising woodcut prints and paintings, says that in order to \u201cachieve utopia\u201d, Nairobians need to work together.",
      "\u201cThat's why the young people are agitating right now for change,\u201d he says, suggesting they are frustrated by a corrupt political system that hems in their potential.",
      "Gen Z were at the forefront of protests this year against new tax measures, which saw the government make an embarrassing U-turn.",
      "Rop argues that by thinking about utopia through the lens of art, young people may find creative ways to fight for their future.",
      "Rather than being far-fetched, he thinks that it can help imagine a bolder and more equal future for his city.",

      "On any red carpet, Selena Gomez is the picture of beauty, poise and confidence. But she'll be the first to tell you that things aren't always what they appear. For instance, her latest film: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez.\" Gomez co-stars as the wife of a powerful Mexican drug lord who secretly transitions. The film is a hard-hitting true crime story, a poignant love story, a journey of self-discovery \u2013 and a musical. But somehow it all works.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" click on the video player below:",
      "Gomez said shooting left her \"a little sore\" from all the dance numbers. So, why did she want to do it? \"I found it incredibly compelling,\" she said. \"I've never really seen a movie like this before. I don't think I've ever been this proud of something in the acting field.\"",
      "And that's really saying something; at 32, Gomez has a lot to be proud of: She's an accomplished actor, but she's also a very successful singer-songwriter, and thanks to her wildly popular Rare Beauty line of cosmetics, she's a billionaire, and a very active philanthropist. It's all quite impressive, and even more so when you realize where she started.",
      "Gomez was born in the Texas town of Grand Prairie. Her mom, Mandy Teefy, was only 16 years old. Selena's parents split when she was five. She says the family had a lot of love, and not much else, with tough times when her mother struggled to put food on the table. \"My mom worked multiple jobs,\" she said. \"She also was finishing high school when she was having me. When I'm doing something great today, it just makes me more thankful for the lessons that my mother taught me.\"",
      "Gomez was barely 10 when she landed a part on TV's \"Barney & Friends,\" and a few years later she became a fixture on the Disney Channel, on such shows as \"Wizards of Waverly Place.\"",
      "She branched out into music, and became a pop sensation. And when the pandemic came, she switched gears again, hosting \"Selena + Chef,\" a popular online cooking show shot in the kitchen of her L.A. home. \"We had cameras everywhere, from every aspect of it,\" she said.",
      "And how are her cooking skills now? \"They're not that great, I'm not gonna lie!\" she laughed.",
      "And then, in 2021 she helped cook up one of the biggest hits on TV: \"Only Murders in the Building.\" She praised her co-stars, Steve Martin and Martin Short: \"These men, Steve and Martin, have been working longer than I've been alive, but they are the first ones to be on set. They take time to ask everyone they run into how their day is. And on top of it, they think everything through. They are wonderful people, and they've helped me grow up in a lot of ways. These guys have become my friends and allies and people I can ask advice from. I couldn't be more grateful to work with them.\"",
      "Gomez is the first to admit that she's had a magical life, and that it hasn't always been a bed of roses. She's been open about her health struggles, like having lupus and receiving a kidney transplant.",
      "She also decided to take her struggles with anxiety and depression, and her bipolar diagnosis, public. Her 2022 documentary, \"Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me,\" is an unvarnished look at her life \u2013 the highs and the very deep lows.",
      "She admits she was a little nervous about sharing it with the world but, \"once I released it, it felt like a huge relief, because I am a firm believer that one of the strongest things you can do is be vulnerable. And that doesn't mean you have to pour your heart out to everyone. But I made that choice, because I knew I wasn't the only one that felt that way. And if my world was already out there for everyone to see, I'd like to tell my part of the story. And to add on that, it's a dream what I'm doing.\"",
      "Part of what her dream is was a benefit held last month for her Rare Impact Fund, a charity aimed at helping young people who suffer from the same mental health challenges she's been through. \"This is probably the most important thing to me, besides my family,\" she said. \"This is the cherry on top of everything.\"",
      "Another high point is her relationship with music producer Benny Blanco, whom People Magazine named one of the sexiest men alive. \"Yeah, that's my man!\" Gomez said. \"To know that there is someone in the world that deeply cares about every tiny detail about who I am, I'm really, really lucky.\"",
      "It's clear from \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" that she's an artist who likes to take risks. But Selena Gomez's gutsiest move has been sharing her real self, and that has made all the difference.",
      "I asked, \"The reaction in general has been overwhelmingly positive, hasn't it?\"",
      "\"Sure. Maybe,\" Gomez replied.",
      "Maybe?\u00a0 \"It's not that I really need anyone's approval,\" she added. \"I think I'm just really, I'm okay with where I am and who I am. And I'm glad. I'm glad that I finally got there.\"",

      "And it's Duran's personality that over the years has won him loyal fans, including some of the biggest names in pop music. \"Lady Gaga grew up dreaming of hearing her song on our show,\" he said. \"And when she walked into the room, she was sort of nervous.

      "Duran fell in love with radio as a kid: \"I'd spend the night at my grandmother's house when mom and dad were out late, and I listened to the radio. And I became friends with this voice in the dark.\"",
      "He was just seven and growing up in McKinney, Texas. \"I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. I was a loner. And so, I found friendship through the radio.\"",
      "And so began his quest to become one of those voices. He even built his own transmitter, with a studio located in his bedroom closet. \"My only listener was the lady next door.\"",
      "Duran's first real radio job came at age 14. After dropping out of college, he spent a decade bouncing between markets across the country. \"Back in the old days in radio, you never unpacked, you never took dishes out of boxes, because you were always moving,\" he said. \"But you know what, I've been very lucky. I've been at Z100 since 1989. So, I'm doing okay.\"",
      "While his show is based in the Big Apple, Duran's heart belongs in New Mexico. As a kid, he visited the \"Land of Enchantment\" frequently. He says the quiet of Santa Fe is the polar opposite of New York City. \"Of course, I need that. Santa Fe is a magical place. And I think, in some ways, this city has kind of saved my life a little bit. It's good to be in a situation where you're forced to relax.\"",
      "Duran and his husband, Alex Carr, share a home here, not far from where they were married in 2019. But decades before their first date, they had a chance encounter \u2013 where else? \u2013 on the radio, back in 1998. \"I had him on as a contest winner once,\" Duran said.\u00a0 \"Jingle Ball tickets. How old were you?\"",
      "\"Eighteen,\" said Carr.",
      "\"Ooh, God!\"",
      "Duran often hosts his show from Santa Fe. Thanks to a home studio, his commute is short. \"Every morning at 2:30 a.m. Santa Fe time, I slither up this staircase, and here you go.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is the Elvis in New Mexico a different Elvis than the Elvis in the New York studio?\"",
      "\"Oh, absolutely,\" he replied. \"And everyone back in New York has said to me at one time or another, 'You're so relaxed out there. We really like the New Mexico Elvis.'\"",
      "Duran can't say how long he'll keep broadcasting (\"To be able to do this this long, with this family, it's a miracle, it really is\"), but he isn't ready to mute his microphone just yet. He's still got a lot of friends to keep company.",
      "Asked how much this goes back to the seven-year-old Elvis listening to that voice on the radio, Duran replied, \"All of it. You know, I'm not lonely anymore. I never, ever want to go back to being a lonely person ever again. And I don't want anyone listening to our show to be lonely. That's the legacy we're all trying to leave. I don't want them to remember my name; I just want them to remember how we made them feel every day. That's it.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 09:24:56 -0500",
    "summary": "It was in the chaos of a kitchen where the chef, restaurateur and TV cooking judge (and author of the new cookbook-memoir, \"Why I Cook\") learned how to be himself.",
    "story": [
      "When you find yourself at the farmer's market next to a guy with strong opinions about fennel and scallions, you listen. That's especially true if the guy is Tom Colicchio, who for more than 20 seasons has been a judge on one of America's biggest food shows, \"Top Chef,\" while also working as one of America's most successful restaurateurs.",
      "Many of his celebrated dishes have started at a local greenmarket in New York City's Union Square, but lately the meals he enjoys the most are even more local than these ingredients. \"I cook very simply at home,\" he said. \"It's not the food part of it. I enjoy the half an hour, 45 minutes that we're sitting together as a family.\"",
      "Now 62, married and a father of three, Colicchio is sharing the story of his many lives in the kitchen in a new book, \"Why I Cook\" (Artisan).",
      "So, why does he cook? \"Partly it was something that I found at a very young age that I was good at,\" he said. \"It came very easy.\"",
      "Thomas Patrick Colicchio grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, sharing a bedroom with two brothers, and big boisterous family meals in a working-class Italian neighborhood. While mom ran the family kitchen, it was dad, a gambler-turned-corrections officer, who helped turn Tom into a chef. \"Having ADHD, I struggled with recipes; I'd get frustrated by recipes,\" Colicchio said. \"But I loved cooking. And my dad wasn't the kind of dad who sat down and had these long conversations with you about your future. But he came home with these books \u2013 I had no idea what 'La Technique' was doing in a county jail library, but there it was!\"",
      "Yes, Jacques Pepin's \"La Technique\" is what helped Colicchio understand the fundamentals of cooking. \"Once I understood that, I could look at a recipe and go, 'Oh, they want me to roast something here. I know how to roast something. So, I don't need a recipe anymore,'\" he said. \"Or I can braise something. But now when I braise it, well, I can change the flavor profile by adding different things into that braise.\"",
      "The kitchen, however, was where Colicchio learned how to be himself, a place where in the chaos of orders and ingredients, he found a calling.",
      "His career took off fast, from flipping burgers at a local snack bar, to building whole menus at a North New Jersey hot spot, and ultimately to New York City, where \u2013 not yet 30 \u2013 he earned his first three-star review from The New York Times, at Mondrian.",
      "Colicchio doesn't credit his family for his entrepreneurial spirit: \"I think it came from the fact that I worked in kitchens and worked in restaurants that I didn't like. And I didn't want to have a boss.\"",
      "But even as he soared professionally \u2013 becoming executive chef at New York's celebrated Gramercy Tavern - Colicchio's private life was cruising toward rock-bottom. \"I was doing drugs when I was cooking the whole time,\" he said. \"Had a bad night and ended up in Harlem somewhere, you know, with another cook getting a bunch of drugs and, you know, getting high all night. I woke up in my bed \u2026 my shirt was covered in blood. I don't remember getting home, which kind of scared me, 'cause I was driving a motorcycle. So, somehow I made it home. But that was it. I woke up and said, 'That's it. No more.'\"",
      "He quit the drugs, but his working-class roots still led to some awkward moments in the Frenchified, fancy world of fine dining. \"I knew I could hold my own, but I just still felt like I was a fish out of water here,\" he said. \"Now I'm in New York. You know, you get three stars, now all of a sudden you're getting pulled in a lot of different directions. Was there a certain amount of impostor syndrome? Absolutely.\"",
      "He said he tried saying no to \"Top Chef\" (\"Didn't really love food TV\"), but then he had the experience of attending a food festival: \"Come time to sign books, and I'm sitting next to Bobby Flay, and he's signing 300 and I'm signing 20. I didn't think it was because he had a better book. He was on TV. It was like, 'All right, let me do this TV thing.'\"",
      "Looking back now, in his new book, Colicchio traces the arc of a changing industry, where sexism and even abuse has been replaced by something a little kinder, and a lot more welcoming. \"There's still voices being raised,\" he said. \"It's a little different than it used to be, but there's still, you know, in the middle of service there were times you got to be forceful. But you can be sure it's not personal. What's really missing is a lot of the misogyny that I saw.\"",
      "But for Tom Colicchio, after all these years, the one thing that hasn't changed is the one thing that also keeps him in the kitchen: \"Looking back on it, food has the power to bring people around a table. And to this day, I love doing dinner parties, love having people over. That's another reason why I cook.\"",

The on-duty commander that night guaranteed the child Santa would have a safe journey from the North Pole and a tradition was established. The annual tracking carried over when the precursor agency became NORAD in 1959. Since 1997, the tracker has been available online.",

      "Preparing to follow Santa's journey",

      "The new keepsake, titled \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,\" is available exclusively at Target. It hit the retailer's stores on Friday, while it will become available for sale on Target's website\u00a0on Saturday. Swift self-published the book under Taylor Swift Publications.",

      "The women, all in their early 20s when they were hired, accused the much older Rose of subjecting them to repeated physical and verbal sexual harassment while working, including inquires about their sex lives and boasts about his own. Harris and McNeal alleged that Rose said \"they were hired because he likes 'tall women,' i.e., he was attracted to them,\" and Wei alleged that Rose referred to her \"as China doll.\"\u00a0 The three women also accused CBS of knowingly failing to prevent Rose's harassment.",
      "CBS settled in December 2018 for an undisclosed sum. The network said at the time that the women had requested the terms be kept confidential.",
      "Had the lawsuit gone to trial, Rose's lawyer said in court papers that he would challenge the credibility of Harris, McNeal and Wei's claims with evidence showing they had previously expressed little or no concern about the ex-anchor.",
      "Among the evidence, lawyer Jonathan Bach wrote in a Nov. 13 filing, were documents showing that Wei told a CBS human resources officer that she experienced nothing \"sexually inappropriate\" while working for Rose and that McNeal confided in her therapist at the time that she had no personal experience of sexual harassment by Rose.",
      "Other evidence cited by Bach showed that Harris had told her therapist that any harassment by Rose was \"very subtle\" and that she wrote to Rose two months after working for him that his interactions with her were \"always professional and respectful.\"",

    "summary": "An Illinois mom got stuck with a big bill after taking her 3-year-old to the ER but never seeing a doctor. \"It's mind-blowing,\" she said.",
    "story": [
      "Ryan Wettstein Nauman was inconsolable one evening last December. After being put down for bed, the 3-year-old from Peoria, Illinois, just kept crying and crying and crying, and nothing would calm her down.",
      "Her mother, Maggi Wettstein, remembered fearing it could be a yeast or urinary tract infection, something they had been dealing with during potty training. The urgent care centers around them were closed for the night, so around 10:30 p.m. she decided to take Ryan to the emergency room at Carle Health.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "The ER wasn't very busy when they arrived at 10:48 p.m., Wettstein recalled. Medical records indicate they checked in and she explained Ryan's symptoms, including an intermittent fever. The toddler was triaged and given a nasal swab test to check for Covid-19 and influenza A and B.",
      "Wettstein said they sat down and waited to be called. And they waited.",
      "As Wettstein watched Ryan in the waiting room's play area, she noticed her daughter had stopped crying.",
      "In fact, she seemed fine.",
      "So Wettstein decided to drive them home. Ryan had preschool the next day, and she figured there was no point keeping her awake for who knew how much longer and getting stuck with a big ER bill.",
      "There was no one at the check-in desk to inform that they were leaving, Wettstein said, so they just headed home to go to bed.",
      "Ryan went to her preschool the next day, and Wettstein said they forgot all about the ER trip for eight months.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The final bill",
      "$445 for the combined Covid and flu test \u2014 from an ER visit in which the patient never made it beyond the waiting room.",
      "The billing problem: A healthy hospital markup and standard insurance rules",
      "Even though Ryan and her mother left without seeing a doctor, the family ended up owing $298.15 after an insurance discount.",
      "At first, Wettstein said, she couldn't recall Ryan being tested at all. It wasn't until she received the bill and requested her daughter's medical records that she learned the results. (Ryan tested negative for Covid and both types of flu.)",
      "While Wettstein said the bill isn't going to break the bank, it seemed high to her, considering Walgreens sells an at-home Covid and flu combination test for $30 and can do higher-quality PCR testing for $145.",
      "Under the public health emergency declared in 2020 for the Covid pandemic, insurance companies were required to pay for Covid tests without copayments or cost sharing for patients.",
      "That requirement ended when the emergency declaration expired in May 2023. Now, it is often patients who foot the bill \u2014 and ER bills are notoriously high.",
      "\"That's a pretty healthy markup the hospital is making on it,\" Loren Adler, associate director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy, told KFF Health News when contacted about Ryan's case.",
      "The rates the insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for various procedures are often based on multipliers of what Medicare pays, Adler said.",
      "Lab tests are one of the few areas in which insurance companies can often pay less than Medicare, he said \u2014 the exception being when the test is performed by the hospital laboratory, which is often what happens during ER visits.",
      "Medicare pays $142.63 for the joint test that Ryan received, but the family is on the hook for more than twice that amount, and the initial hospital charge was over three times as much.",
      "The hospital is \"utilizing their market power to make as much money as possible, and the insurance companies are not all that good at pushing back,\" Adler said. A markup of a few hundred dollars is a drop in the bucket for big insurers. But for the patients who get unexpected bills, it can be a big burden.",
      "Brittany Simon, a public relations manager for Carle Health, did not respond to specific questions but said in a statement, \"We follow policies that support the safety and wellbeing of our patients, which includes the initial triage of symptomatic patients to the Emergency Department.\"",
      "While Ryan's family would not have had to pay for a Covid test during the public health emergency, it was the family's insurer, Cigna, that did not have to pay this time, since the family had not yet met a $3,000 yearly deductible.",
      "A Cigna representative did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The resolution",
      "Wettstein said she knew she could just pay the bill and be done with it, \"but the fact that I never saw a provider, and the fact that it was just for a Covid test, is mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "She contacted the hospital's billing department to make sure the bill was correct. She explained what happened and said the hospital representative was also surprised by the size of the bill and sent it up for further review.",
      "\"'Don't pay this until you hear from me,'\" Wettstein remembered being told.",
      "Soon, though, she received a letter from the hospital explaining that the charge was correct and supported by documentation.",
      "Wettstein thought she was avoiding any charges by taking Ryan home without being seen. Instead, she got a bill \"that they have verified that I have to pay.\"",
      "\"Like I said, it's mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "The takeaway",
      "ERs are among the most expensive options for care in the nation's health system, and the meter can start running as soon as you check in \u2014 even if you check out before receiving care.",
      "If your issue isn't life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility, which is often cheaper (and look for posted notices to confirm whether it's actually an urgent care clinic). The urgent care centers near Ryan's home were closed that evening, but some facilities stay open late or around the clock.",
      "In some ways, Wettstein was lucky. KFF Health News' \"Bill of the Month\" has received tips from other patients who left an ER after a long wait without seeing a doctor \u2014 and got slapped with a facility fee of over $1,000.",
      "Making the decision about where to go is tough, especially in a stressful situation \u2014 such as when the patient is too young to communicate what's wrong. Trying to figure out what's going on physically with a 3-year-old can feel impossible.",
      "If you decide to leave an ER without treatment, don't just walk out. Tell the triage nurse you're leaving. You might get lucky and avoid some charges.",
      "Wettstein won't think twice about taking Ryan to the pediatrician or an urgent care center the next time she's ailing. But, Wettstein said, after getting this bill, \"I'm not going to create a habit out of going to the emergency room.\"",
      "Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills. Since 2018, this series has helped many patients and readers get their medical bills reduced, and it has been cited in statehouses, at the U.S. Capitol, and at the White House.

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 05:00:17 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal panel has been meeting for months to draft recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "A monthslong process to decide the federal government's food recommendations for the next five years is now set to stretch well into 2025. That timing means Biden officials will miss their opportunity to lock in new guidelines before the Trump administration takes over.",
      "Switching terms in the middle of an update is unprecedented in recent history, though previous versions have come close: an update in 2005 was finished days before the inauguration and the 2020 revision came a month before Biden took office.",
      "The guidelines are hotly contested in Washington because they influence a broad array of federal programs, ranging from rules on nutrition labels to standards for school lunches. They are traditionally based around a scientific report from outside experts.",
      "That committee has been meeting since last year, wrestling with an array of controversial questions, and is not expected to issue its recommendations until mid-December. It usually takes several months after their report is done for officials to publish their guidelines.",
      "This timeline was decided long before Election Day, one person familiar with the process told CBS News.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS did not comment on the timing of the report, except to confirm that it is expected \"later in the year.\"",
      "\"HHS and USDA continue to demonstrate their commitment to transparency, equity, and scientific integrity throughout the entire process,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "It is virtually impossible for the Biden administration to finish an update before leaving office, former officials said. Too many tasks remain, like vetting the findings and developing and testing updated messaging through tools like MyPlate, which replaced the food pyramid.",
      "\"This is a very heavy lift, given the complexity and given the points of view of the different departments,\" said Dr. Brett Giroir, who served as assistant secretary for health in HHS under the Trump administration's last revision.",
      "Input from the public and agencies also must be worked into the guidelines, before the agriculture and health departments can come to an agreement.",
      "\"My belief is that when Congress tells two agencies to collaborate on something, that is an intended tension, hopefully to move the final product in the right direction. And I think certainly folks would agree that HHS and USDA often come from different constituencies, different perspectives,\" said Brandon Lipps, who was the USDA's deputy under secretary for food, nutrition and consumer services under Trump.",
      "One expected fight will be over proposals floated last month by members of the committee \"to emphasize plant sources\" of protein, as part of a broader recommendation to \"shift\" to more \"nutrient dense, plant-based meals.\"",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump had accused his rival of wanting to \"stop people from eating red meat.\" In a statement last month, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association denounced the recommendations as \"unhinged\" and \"impractical.\"",
      "Under the drafts, beans, peas and lentils could be listed as protein sources too, not just vegetables. Red meat would be moved down the ranking of protein foods, over health concerns like cardiovascular disease.",
      "Red meats often needed to be substituted the most in American diets, analyses by the committee concluded, to cut health risks and still meet nutritional goals.",
      "\"Red meats, whether they were processed or not, were the ones to reduce more than the poultry or the eggs. So I would've put them very last,\" said Christopher Gardner, a member of the committee.",
      "How Trump administration officials could change the guidelines",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made changes to the committee a central part of his \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform.",
      "\"What we need to do is change the panel, so they're making good recommendations and they're telling people don't eat these foods,\" Kennedy said in September.",
      "They could also offer Kennedy a vehicle to accomplish his goals, like curbing ultra-processed foods in school lunches. If confirmed as secretary, Kennedy and his counterpart at USDA would have the ultimate authority over what goes into the guidelines.",
      "\"If Congress wanted a group of scientists to write the dietary guidelines, they would have put that in statute. So the committee makes recommendations, and the secretaries take the input from that report,\" said Lipps.",
      "Completely ignoring the committee's work would be unprecedented, though departments in the past \u2013 often driven by career civil servants \u2013 have sometimes disagreed with some recommendations.",
      "\"The process is not perfect, there's bureaucracy in there. But I do believe having transparent scientific committees that everybody knows where it's coming from is the best way to go,\" said Giroir.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:16:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said . \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 10:10:33 -0500",
    "summary": "A CBS News investigation tracked plastic cups from Starbucks recycling bins to landfills and incinerators across the country.",
    "story": [
      "Many consumers trust that when they toss a plastic cup into a recycling bin at a restaurant or coffee shop, it will be recycled and turned into something new. However, a CBS News investigation uncovered that this isn't always true.",
      "CBS News investigated what happens at one of the largest users of plastic cups that advertises its recycling practices: Starbucks. Reporters placed plastic cold drink cups, embedded with trackers, into 57 labeled recycling bins at Starbucks locations across the country to see where the cups went. Only 36 provided reliable data.",
      "The trackers were superglued between two Starbucks cold drink plastic cups and CBS News monitored each tracker's location multiple times a day until the trackers stopped moving.",
      "Of the 36 cups CBS News dropped, 32 did not go to a recycling facility. Fourteen cups were traced to landfills, five to incinerators, and thirteen to waste transfer stations, where trash is compacted before being sent to landfills or incinerators. Only four cups were traced to Material Recovery Facilities, where recyclables are sorted and prepared for reuse.",
      "While attaching a metal Bluetooth tracker to plastic and placing it in a recycling bin could contaminate the item and prevent it from being recycled, only four of the cups tagged by CBS News went to facilities that sort and remove this type of contamination, whereas the rest were immediately diverted for the landfill or incineration.",
      "Two of the trackers revealed a surprising journey: one dropped at a Starbucks in New Jersey and another in Boston both traveled thousands of miles before ultimately ending up in the same landfill in Alabama.",
      "\"When it comes to recycling, companies across the country and the world are lying about all these single-use plastics, saying they're recyclable,\" said Jan Dell, a former chemical engineer and founder of The Last Beach Cleanup, a nonprofit dedicated to combating plastic pollution. \"They're not telling the truth.\"",
      "The challenge of plastic waste",
      "Americans produce more plastic waste each year than any other country \u2013 almost 500 pounds per person. Most of that plastic ends up as trash, according to a 2022 Greenpeace USA report, which revealed that the U.S. recycling rate for plastics is less than 6%.",
      "Companies such as Starbucks, which sells beverages to more than 6 billion customers a year globally, are a major generator of plastic waste. More than 75% of Starbucks' U.S. beverage sales are cold drinks, often served in plastic cups, but the company aims to reduce its overall waste by 50% by 2030.",
      "\"Our goal for cups is that 100% of our customer-facing cups will be reusable, recyclable or compostable,\" says Amelia Landers, vice president of innovation and solutions at Starbucks. Landers was part of the team that redesigned its cold plastic cups in April to be made with up to 20% less plastic, which she says will help divert more than 13 million pounds of plastic from landfills each year.",
      "\"There's a guilt factor associated with using the single-use plastic, for maybe 20 minutes, and then having it exist in the landfill forever, or get incinerated and cause carbon emissions,\" said Dell, which is one of the reasons she believes Starbucks encourages recycling in-store.",
      "But making sure that Starbucks cup is recycled is harder than you might think. Unlike other recyclable materials such as glass, paper or aluminum, plastics are not uniform. Thousands of different types exist, each with unique characteristics, chemicals and additives, making sorting and recycling nearly impossible. For instance, certain beverage bottles cannot be recycled with food containers because they are made from different types of plastic, are different shapes and may be different colors.",
      "Can Starbucks cups be recycled?",
      "Consumers assume items like Starbucks cups can be recycled because of the arrows on the cup or blue bins in the store, but only 9% of Material Recovery Facilities sort the specific plastic that makes a Starbucks cup to be sold as recycled content and very few places actually buy that plastic to recycle it into new content.",
      "Starbucks cups are made out of polypropylene, or No. 5 plastic, and Landers told CBS News that these cups are designed to be recyclable and there are facilities that do this in the U.S. CBS News asked Starbucks to send a list of companies that recycle No. 5 plastic beverage cups. They sent a list of four facilities: three that collected and sorted No. 5 plastics, but only one company, KW Plastics in Alabama, recycles No. 5 cups into new plastic items.",
      "KW Plastics is one of a handful of facilities in America that recycles No. 5 plastics into new material, but of the 160,000 tons of plastic waste made up of No. 5 cups and plates generated in the U.S. each year, less than 1% is recycled, according to the latest EPA report on plastic recycling.",
      "A reusable solution",
      "Starbucks officials say they can only control what happens inside the company's stores, and work with outside partners to ensure its waste ends up in the right place.",
      "\"We're working to increase the recycle capture of the plastic cups so that the recyclability has higher potential,\" says Landers. Her team is currently testing new cup materials and models to encourage reusable cups both in the store, and for customers to take away.",
      "\"The more we can offer customers to sit and stay, that takes a tremendous amount of single-use cups out of the landfill entirely,\" she says.",
      "Starbucks was the first major retailer to roll out a nationwide program where customers can provide their own cup for mobile and drive-thru orders earlier this year.",
      "\"We have tested over 30 different borrow-a-cup models around the world, and there is a lot to learn and a lot to solve,\" says Landers.",
      "Governments can also provide incentives for businesses to innovate by eliminating unnecessary plastics and encouraging reusable products. \"Regulation is absolutely critical as well as enforcement,\" said Dell, with The Last Beach Cleanup.",
      "Prohibitions on single-use plastics are becoming more common. Last week the Miami-Dade County Commissions approved a resolution to eliminate single-use plastics at municipal buildings, which include the Miami Zoo and the airport.",
      "Dell says customers can be critical in pushing for change. \"They can demand that companies be honest,\" she said. \"Secondly, they can choose with their pocketbooks and bring back in a reusable cup.\"",

    "summary": "As the holiday shopping season kicks off, here are five ways retailers try to get consumers to spend.",
    "story": [
      "As shoppers gear up for Black Friday and the holiday shopping season, it can be easy for people to rack up debt that will weigh them down well into the new year. So it pays for consumers to be aware of some of the tactics retailers employ to get them to spend.",
      "For example, most offers that dangle savings in the form of free shipping or a free gift if you spend over a certain amount don't save you money. The practice, called \"spaving,\" or spending more in order to save, rarely benefits consumers, according to personal finance experts.",
      "\"I understand the appeal of getting to checkout and a notification pops up saying spend $10 more to get some perk,\" LendingTree senior economist Jacob Channel told CBS MoneyWatch. \"But 90% of the time when you break it down, it doesn't make sense. You're not actually saving money if you are spending more of it.\"",
      "Here are five tactics retailers use to get you to spend more, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), a consumer advocacy group.",
      "Creating a false sense of urgency",
      "The fear of missing out on a good deal can nudge consumers into making impulse buys. Although some offers really are only valid for a limited time, U.S. PIRG identified a number of sellers on Etsy, an e-commerce site for independent craftspeople, who used fake countdown clocks for deals that never expire.",
      "Of 20 top-selling products on the site with countdown timers on deals, 80% of them simply reset when their tickers tickers hit \"0,\" according to a PIRG study.",
      "\"The 'limited' time window may not be as limited as it sounds and the deals not as good as they seem,\" U.S. PIRG's R.J. Cross told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Make your list, comparison shop on those items, and don't get distracted by offers you haven't had the time to think through.\"",
      "Implying scarcity",
      "Online retailers may label products as \"selling fast!\" or, as a consumer is considering a purchase, display how many other consumers are browsing the same item.",
      "\"Retailers and advertisers are always trying to get you to buy more than you need and spend more than you want,\" Cross said in a statement.\u00a0\"Once you know what to look for, you end up chuckling when you see these tactics instead of falling for them.\"",
      "Pricing tricks",
      "Ever wonder why a price reads $4.99 and not simply $5? When sellers round an item's price down, it suggests to a shopper that it is cheaper, PIRG notes. Although $4.99 is only a penny less than $5, a shopper is more likely to fixate on the dollar figure \u2014 $4 \u2014 versus the cents.",
      "Even removing a comma from a high sticker price like $1,200 and displaying it as $1200 can entice someone to pull the trigger, according to PIRG. Meanwhile, breaking the cost of an item down into monthly installments can also make the price seem smaller than it really is, the organization noted.",
      "\"You're still going to have to pay the full cost, and sometimes\u00a0even more in late fees, if you're not careful,\" Cross pointed out.",
      "Dubious testimonials",
      "Many retailers feature online testimonials ostensibly from customers raving about a \"life-changing\" vacuum cleaner or pair of sweatpants. Some of these account are from real customers, while other reviews cannot be trusted because they have been generated by a bot or the company itself, PIRG said.",
      "At bottom, it's a form of peer pressure \u2014 shoppers are subtly induced to think that buying the product will make them as happy as the satisfied customers depicted in the testimonial. In reality, many online reviews are fake, especially as AI bots proliferate.",
      "\"When you look at reviews on a product, don't necessarily take the star ratings for granted. Better to look through the comments and find those that seem real \u2014 that either include a picture of the product or that make a point specific to the product instead of a generic note like 'great product!'\" Cross recommends.",
      "Appeals based on fear",
      "Many marketing pitches and ads suggest that your life will somehow be worse if you don't make a purchase, from being at risk of a home invasion to hair loss. With e-commerce, of course, such messages are tailored to your individual interests and tastes given that website cookies track and share your browsing patterns with retailers.",
      "Messages \"about how to fix our perceived flaws only become more capable of finding us at all hours of the day whenever we go online,\" Cross said.",

    "summary": "Some companies are weaving Trump's tariffs into their marketing efforts, telling consumers to buy now in case prices rise.",
    "story": [
      "Some retailers are using President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs to urge consumers to shop now, suggesting if the import duties go into effect next year, a\u00a0range of goods could cost Americans a lot more money.",
      "It's yet another sales tactic some companies are implementing, in addition to the traditional Black Friday discounts, to get consumers to spend as much as possible ahead of the holidays.",
      "On Monday, Trump pledged to add a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. The proposed taxes are in addition to earlier campaign promises to impose a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, once he takes office.",
      "While\u00a0prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise if Trump moves forward with his tariff proposals, some retail experts say that retailers may be seeking to tap into people's universal fear of missing out on a limited-time offer or experience. But the tactic could also rub some shoppers the wrong way, experts caution.",
      "\"It's a double-edged sword. I think it it might get people interested in buying things, but it could also split consumers if they think everyone's going to bring their prices up,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. \"The other problem is it's slightly political as well, so some retailers would want to steer clear of it.\"",
      "While Trump has said he plans to move forward with tariffs, some economists have pointed out that the next administration may simply use the duties as a bargaining chip, which could enable the White House to strike new trade deals, for instance. Even though the tariffs are far from certain, a number of companies have explicitly said the levies floated by Trump would inevitably force them to raise prices for consumers.",
      "\"Lock in our current prices\"",
      "For example, filtered shower head maker Jolie recently said it would have pass along some of the anticipated costs from the tariffs to consumers. In a recent email to customers, the company said that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",
      "Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy CEO Corie Barry similarly said on its latest earnings call that the goods it sells could become more expensive under Trump's proposed tariffs.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors on Nov. 26, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "\"Pre-tariff\" sales",
      "And on Facebook, a Dallas, Texas-based furniture store called Finally Home Furnishings, announced a \"pre-tariff sale\" that runs until January, earlier this month.",
      "\"Get a deal while you still can,\" the retailer said.",
      "Finally Home Furnishings did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment, or indicate how much it expects it may need to hike prices if new tariffs go into effect.",
      "Etsy seller Buzzy Park, who sells handmade bamboo picture frames, also advertised a \"pre-tariff \" sale on his entire inventory, starting this month and lasting until any new tariffs go into effect. \"Hurry and get them at their current prices,\" Park wrote in a social media post.",
      "While prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise, some marketing and retail experts say that even sellers who don't expect to face added costs could be using potential tariffs as an excuse to charge customers more.",
      "\"If consumers panic about things getting more expensive, they are playing right into the hands of companies around the country to use it as an excuse to raise prices, even when it's not necessary,\" said Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group. \"",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 10:28:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Target is the only place you can buy the latest Taylor Swift merch, including a new book, vinyl and CD.",
    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's latest release isn't a new song or album \u2014 it's a book commemorating the pop star's\u00a0record-setting\u00a0\"Eras Tour,\" which hit store shelves on Black Friday.",
      "The collector's item chronicles Swift's wildly successful concert tour, which concludes in December and which last year became the first music tour to gross over $1 billion.",
      "A movie version of the concert she performed on her Eras Tour also shattered box office records. It earned an estimated $96 million domestically over its opening weekend, making it the most successful concert film of all time, according to Comscore.",
      "Where can I buy the book?",
      "The new keepsake, titled \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour Book,\" is available exclusively at Target. It hit the retailer's stores on Friday, while it will become available for sale on Target's website\u00a0on Saturday. Swift self-published the book under Taylor Swift Publications.",
      "Some Target stores opened as early as 6 a.m. in anticipation of Black Friday shopping crowds and Taylor Swift fans.",
      "Target first teased the book launch in an Instagram\u00a0post on Oct. 15. Swift herself also promoted the book in an Instagram\u00a0post that garnered more than 3.6 million likes.",
      "What's in The Eras Tour book?",
      "The 256-page hardcover title, which costs $39.99, includes unreleased photographs of Swift in concert from every period of her career, according to Target.",
      "The book also documents the production of Swift's epic Eras Tour, which kicked off in August 2023, including \"personal reflections\" written by the artist herself.",
      "In tandem with the book release, Target is also exclusively launching \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology\" album as both a vinyl record and CD. The recording feature 35 tracks, including four acoustic versions of the following songs: \"Fortnight,\" \"Down Bad,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him\" and \"Guilty as Sin?\"",
      "Two million copies of the book have been printed, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Assuming the initial print run sells out, it would generate nearly $80 million in sales. Forbes puts Swift's net at worth $1. 6 billion, including $600 million from music royalties and touring, a music catalog valued at an estimated $600 million, and $125 million in real estate.",
      "Swift alone could be a forceful enough economic engine to boost Target. The retailer's latest sales and profit figures fell short of analysts' expectations, while Target lowered its earnings forecast for the current quarter. Analysts say that inflation-weary consumers are after deeper discounts than the retailer can offer, or simply aren't making as many discretionary purchases.",
      "\"Consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched, and they are shopping carefully,\" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a Nov. 20 earnings call.",
      "That restraint seems unlikely to deter the Swifties, the singer's rabid fans, as she prepares to wind up the Eras Tour in Vancouver on Dec. 8.",

    "summary": "Canada's Competition Bureau says that an investigation found the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",
      "Mehta also found that Google in 2021 Google paid about $26 billion to Apple and other partners to ensure its search engine would be the default one on internet browsers.",
      "His ruling stemmed from a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit first filed against Google in October 2020 during the first Trump administration.",
      "Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling, but the tech giant must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so. The appeals process could take as long as five years, predicts George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 19:54:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts warn of fabricated websites posing as retailers to scam shoppers looking for Black Friday deals.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are warning that fraudsters are exploiting Black Friday sales to target U.S. shoppers with fake websites and ads for major brands like IKEA, Wayfair and The North Face, after online scams hit record highs in 2023.",
      "A new report released by threat intelligence company EclecticIQ identified a campaign that operates a sprawling network of fabricated websites using \"Trusted Store\" badges to lure shoppers with fake products.",
      "When consumers attempt to make a purchase, scammers steal their personal and payment information. The consumers are often unaware they were scammed until they fail to receive the product.",
      "Reports of online fraud in 2023 exceeded $12.5 billion in potential losses \u2014   a 22% jump from 2022, according to FBI data. Officials say increasingly sophisticated scams are using tools including AI to power their campaigns.",
      "\"With the way it now seems like everyone is shopping online, reliance on digital platforms has handed these groups a wider attack surface than ever,\" EclecticIQ CEO Cody Barrow told CBS News. \"Unfortunately, it's likely we'll see its impact stretch into next week.\"",
      "The scams",
      "EclecticIQ says it identified at least 8,000 fabricated sites that lure shoppers by offering steep \"deals\" on popular brands. The websites are not affiliated with the brands they appear to represent, but are designed to look like official sites and use URLs that appear authentic.",
      "In one example, a site posing as Wayfair used the URL wayfairtoday.com. Another site used the URL wayfairblackfriday.com. The website was registered in early November and offered fake \"deals\" including an $800 mattress reduced to $39.",
      "CBS News also found an ad appropriating Wayfair's logo that directed users to another counterfeit site posing as the retailer. It was removed from Meta's ad library as of Friday. Wayfair told CBS News that it is actively monitoring scams to ensure customers are protected.",
      "Analysts discovered Mandarin coding and Chinese IP addresses on the sites, indicating that the phishing campaign was operated by a China-based group. IKEA told CBS News it was investigating one of the scam websites using its name that EclecticIQ identified.",
      "Separately, an ad on Facebook and Instagram using The North Face logo routed users to a fabricated site. The ad was removed for policy violations, and The North Face told CBS News it was working with Meta and \"other partners\" to combat scam sites.",
      "\"Scammers use every online platform available to them and constantly evolve their tactics in order to evade enforcement,\" said Meta spokesperson Erin Logan. \"In this instance, our systems proactively detected and removed a number of these ads before they were reported to us.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission released data in February that shows online shopping fraud was the second most common type of fraud reported in 2023.",
      "Experts say fraudulent sites and ads remain a pervasive issue. \"Many of the scam sites are short-lived campaigns, so it's an ongoing effort to identify new sites,\" Ilya Volovik, director of Recorded Future Payment Fraud Intelligence, told CBS News. \"Some of the longer living scam sites change their 'sales' advertisement based on a holiday.\"",
      "Tips to protect yourself",
      "Cliff Steinhauer, director of Information Security and Engagement at the National Cybersecurity Alliance, said consumers should take precautions, stay alert when online shopping and act quickly if they believe they have been scammed.",
      "Secure your accounts. Experts recommend setting up multifactor authentication as well as strong and unique passwords for all accounts, including shopping and bank sites.",
      "Avoid unfamiliar links: Be wary of links from unsolicited emails and text messages. Instead, use a search engine to navigate to the retailer's website.",
      "Look for red flags. Be wary of deals that appear too good to be true, as well as websites that use excessive pop-ups and urgent language. If in doubt, leave the site.",
      "Research the website. Look up reviews from other shoppers who have used the site. Visit the Better Business Bureau's website, which maintains a database with ratings for millions of businesses.",
      "If you think you have been the victim of fraud, immediately notify your bank to reverse the charges. You should also change the passwords to your online accounts. File a police report if you experience harassment or repeated attempts to steal more of your information.",
      "Experts also recommend freezing your credit on the three major credit reporting bureaus if your personal information has been compromised through a data breach. This will ensure your identity can't be stolen in the event that scammers obtain your social security number.",

      "A Canadian government official said Wednesday it is exploring potential retaliatory levies on certain U.S. imports after President-elect Donald Trump on Monday threatened to impose a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico on his first day in office. The official, who stressed no final decision has been taken, spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.",

      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum earlier this week also hinted that the country could retaliate against the U.S. with its own tariffs on American products. Trump said the stepped-up duties are necessary to curb the flow of undocumented immigrants and illicit drugs from Mexico and Canada.",
      "\"Blanket 25% tariffs on Canada threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump earlier this week would push Canada into a recession in 2025, cause a sharp spike in inflation and force the Bank of Canada to hold rates higher next year,\" economist Michael Davenport of Oxford Economics said in a report Thursday.",
      "Inflation in Canada would top 7% by mid-2025, while unemployment would approach 8% by year-end, according to the investment research firm. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would take the biggest hit, he added, noting that the sectors also depend on components from American suppliers.",
      "Canada fired back with duties of its own when Trump slapped tariffs on the country's steel and aluminum exports to the U.S. during his first stint in the White House. Canada targeted U.S. products including whiskey and yogurt, most of which came from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are ready to make new investments in border security and work with the Trump administration to lower the numbers from Canada. The Canadians are also worried about an influx of migrants if Trump follows through with his plan for mass deportations.",
      "U.S. also would feel the pain",
      "Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0have said\u00a0tariffs deployed during his first term advanced U.S. economic aims, including boosting federal revenue, and didn't boost inflation.",
      "But the U.S. likely wouldn't go unscathed in a full-blown trade war with Canada. Across-the-board tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S. and fracture political relations between the allies, according to Oxford.",
      "Although the U.S. is the world's leading oil producer, Canada supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied the tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "With so much on the line, the incoming Trump administration is more likely to impose limited tariffs on Canadian products, such as steel, lumber and farm products like dairy.",
      "\"Despite Trump's latest threat of blanket tariffs, we still think it's unlikely that the Trump administration will put tariffs on Canadian autos and energy exports, which make up about 40% of total Canadian exports to the U.S.,\" Davenport said. \"The North American energy sector and auto supply chains are highly integrated across the U.S.-Canada border and any tariffs on these goods would also have a significant negative effect on the US economy.\"",

      "Americans may be shelling out more for gasoline if the incoming Trump administration follows through on threats to impose tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump this week said he would enact a 25% tariff on all products from both countries, citing concerns about illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. While prices could climb on a variety of goods shipped to the U.S., the potential impact on motorists and on the transportation sector could be particularly acute, analysts say.",
      "\"Canada and Mexico are huge U.S. trading partners, so it's a shot across the bow of longtime U.S. allies,\" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "Although the U.S. is the world's leading oil producer, we still import a lot of crude, with Canada providing roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, within as little as two days after the tariffs take effect, De Haan said.",
      "The national average for a gallon of regular on Wednesday stood at $3.07, down from $3.25 a year ago, according to AAA.",
      "The threatened tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada could also result in a $3,000 increase in the cost of the average car, according to Wolfe Research analysts cited by the Wall Street Journal. Roughly $97 billion in auto parts are imported to the U.S. from the two nations annually, and 4 million vehicles are shipped in \u2014 roughly 3 million from Mexico and 1 million from Canada, the firm estimated.",
      "To be sure, it remains uncertain if Trump will follow through on his trade threats. Some analysts think the president-elect is likely using the specter of tariffs as a way to wring concessions from other countries, noting that his administration will be eager to avoid setting off another round of inflation just as U.S. prices are growing at a normal level.",

    "summary": "Tariffs on U.S. imports would raise prices for consumers on a range of goods, experts say. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Prices could rise\u00a0on a variety of goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas under tariffs that President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose as soon as he takes office next year, according to experts.",
      "Trump on Monday pledged to put a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. The tariffs are not certain to go into effect, and if they are implemented, their impact would depend on how they are structured and if certain categories are exempted.",
      "Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent,\u00a0have argued that his first-term tariffs didn't boost inflation, and that import taxes can provide valuable benefits to American workers and businesses. Among them, Trump has said, are protecting U.S. manufacturing jobs and boosting federal revenue, although tariffs are paid by importers and often passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "For their part, experts and business groups are clear that tariffs would lift prices. A barrage of new duties on foreign imports would likely boost consumer costs on everything from vacuum cleaners to tiki torches, which are largely imported from China and are already subject to tariffs, according to Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group.",
      "\"A lot of vacuum cleaners are made in China, so that's one I could be sort of confident you're going to see some price effects on,\" he said.",
      "Consumer electronics",
      "The tariffs would also reduce American consumers' spending power by $90 billion on products including TVs, headphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, smartphones and other electronics, according to the Consumer Technology Association.",
      "The trade group \u2014 which modeled the impact of a 10% tariff on Chinese imports, coupled with a 60% levy on goods from the country that Trump previously floated \u2014 estimated that laptops and tablets would see the steepest price hikes, with costs surging as much as 45%. Video game consoles and smartphones could also see double-digit gains.",
      "Researchers assumed retailers would pass all added costs related to tariffs along to consumers. In the smartphone category, the average increase in price would be $213 per device, according to CTA.",
      "\"The likelihood of retailers or any importer absorbing the tariff cost is very low, so the pass through to consumers will be quick,\" said Ed Brzytwa, vice president of international trade at CTA. \"On all the products we looked at, there are going to be price increases.\"",
      "Best Buy CEO Cory Barrie on Tuesday also said on the company's earnings call that Trump's proposed tariffs would force the retailer to raise costs on a\u00a0range of consumer electronics, noting that \"there's very little in consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "Footwear",
      "Footwear is another goods category that experts are watching. According to Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America (FDRA), 99% of footwear sold in the U.S. is imported from other countries, with 56% of footwear by volume coming from China.",
      "\"We know that if they apply tariffs on Chines goods and Chinese footwear, it will hit working families the hardest,\" FDRA CEO Matt Priest told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some retailers could also decide to hike prices whether or not they face added costs related to potential tariffs. \"It's a pretty handy excuse when you're in a constant battle with consumers on price,\" Lincicome said.",
      "Home goods",
      "A number of retailers have already suggested that the proposed tariffs could force them to raise prices. In an email to customers, filtered shower head maker Jolie said this week that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",
      "Home furnishings giant Ikea told CNN that Trump's tariffs, if enacted, would make it more difficult for the company to keep its prices low.",
      "\"Tariffs make it more difficult for us to maintain the low prices and be affordable for many people, which in the end is our goal,\" Jesper Brodin, Ingka Group CEO, told CNN. \"But it's beyond our control. We will need to understand and adapt.\"",
      "Gasoline",
      "Adding a 25% tariff to Canadian imports would affect crude oil, which is imported from Western Canada and refined at U.S. facilities, according to Patrick De Haan, an analyst at Gas Buddy.",
      "\"Canada and Mexico are huge U.S. trading partners, so it's a shot across the bow of longtime U.S. allies,\" Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "So should consumers be thinking about buying certain products now ahead of possible tariffs next year? Brzytwa thinks so.",
      "\"People should be thinking about buying now. From all indications we have, the Trump administration wants to move as fast as possible to impose much higher tariffs on imports from China, including products not yet subject to tariffs,\" he said.",

    "title": "How Trump's economic agenda could affect mortgage rates in 2025",
    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 17:51:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what a noted housing expert thinks will happen to mortgage rates next year as Donald Trump outlines his priorities.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has promised to lower prices for Americans, but his economic policies may not help one embattled part of the economy: the housing market.",
      "Mortgage rates continue to hover near a 20-year high, while house hunters face near record high\u00a0home prices. The Federal Reserve's two rate cuts, in September and November, haven't trickled through to mortgages, which instead have climbed during the past month and are again hovering close to 7%.",
      "That's because mortgage rates are based on several factors beyond the Fed's benchmark rate, including the strength of the U.S. economy and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond. The latter surged after Trump's November 5 electoral victory on concerns that his policies, including stiff tariffs on U.S. imports, big tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants could drive up inflation.",
      "A key question for housing",
      "Housing affordability is viewed as a top problem within the U.S. by Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike, according to a May\u00a0poll from the Bipartisan Policy Center. The difficulty of affording a home, as well as the impact of rising rents, are issues that colored how voters viewed the economy leading into the election, with the high cost of living top of mind for many.",
      "\"Going forward, the key question is: Are some of the Trump proposals inflationary or non-inflationary?\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"One alarming part is tariffs \u2014 that means imported products will be more expensive, and it could take time for domestic production to ramp up.\"",
      "Trump on Monday pledged to put a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods. Those costs could boost the U.S. inflation rate by almost 1 percentage point, according to a new Goldman Sachs estimate. Higher inflation in turn could lead the Fed to slow or even pause its rate cuts \u2013 another blow to Americans hoping for lower borrowing costs.",
      "Where will mortgage rates go in 2025?",
      "To be sure, forecasting mortgage rates is difficult, given the number of factors that influence them. Yet based on Trump's stated economic plans, Yun said he thinks the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate will bounce around between 6% and 7% for the next year, and could stick around 6.5% for much of 2025.",
      "But, he added, there's a risk mortgage rates could inch even higher if Trump's policies prove more inflationary than expected. Higher mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars in monthly costs for borrowers.",
      "Another issue is whether Trump's policies could widen the federal deficit, which impacts borrowing as well as the yield on the 10-year Treasury. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget forecasts that Trump's proposals would increase the federal budget deficit by $7.75 trillion over the next decade.",
      "To pay interest on that debt, the government would likely have to issue more bonds, like 10-year Treasurys. That could lead investors to demand higher yields, or the return they receive for investing in the bonds. As those yields rise, that would push mortgage rates higher.",
      "\"In the first Trump presidency, the average mortgage rate was about 4% to 5%,\" Yun said, adding, \"We won't get back to that 4% to 5% of that first Trump presidency.\"",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Most Americans report that housing in their communities has become less affordable during the past year, a trend they don't see improving, the Bipartisan Policy Center found.",
      "The median sale price of U.S. homes has dropped slightly during the past year, dipping to about $420,000 in the third quarter from $435,000 a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But that's also considerably higher than the median sale price of $329,000 at the start of 2020, just prior to the pandemic.",
      "The double whammy of high home costs and mortgage rates is pricing many buyers out of the market. The share of first-time home buyers dropped to 24% in 2024, the lowest since 1981, when the National Association of Realtors started tracking the metric. Prior to 2008, the share of first-time buyers had historically been 40%.",
      "That's a problem for would-be homebuyers \u2014 as well as the nation's overall economic health \u2014 because homeownership is a key to building personal wealth. People who delay buying a home have fewer years to grow their assets, which can in turn crimp their ability to build a nest egg for their later years.",
      "The difference in wealth between homeowners and renters is stark: Homeowners had a median net worth of $396,200 in 2022, compared with $10,400 for renters and other non-homeowners, according to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "While mortgage rates might not see much relief in 2025, home prices are likely to remain stable, Yun predicted.",
      "\"The American way is to buy a home,\" he said. \"Maybe it's a little smaller, or not perfectly ideal, but then trade up to the next home \u2014 in terms of buying rather than delaying, the data shows that homeowners build wealth, while renters are spinning their wheels.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 09:52:13 -0500",
    "summary": "An Illinois mom got stuck with a big bill after taking her 3-year-old to the ER but never seeing a doctor. \"It's mind-blowing,\" she said.",
    "story": [
      "Ryan Wettstein Nauman was inconsolable one evening last December. After being put down for bed, the 3-year-old from Peoria, Illinois, just kept crying and crying and crying, and nothing would calm her down.",
      "Her mother, Maggi Wettstein, remembered fearing it could be a yeast or urinary tract infection, something they had been dealing with during potty training. The urgent care centers around them were closed for the night, so around 10:30 p.m. she decided to take Ryan to the emergency room at Carle Health.",
      "The medical procedure",
      "The ER wasn't very busy when they arrived at 10:48 p.m., Wettstein recalled. Medical records indicate they checked in and she explained Ryan's symptoms, including an intermittent fever. The toddler was triaged and given a nasal swab test to check for Covid-19 and influenza A and B.",
      "Wettstein said they sat down and waited to be called. And they waited.",
      "As Wettstein watched Ryan in the waiting room's play area, she noticed her daughter had stopped crying.",
      "In fact, she seemed fine.",
      "So Wettstein decided to drive them home. Ryan had preschool the next day, and she figured there was no point keeping her awake for who knew how much longer and getting stuck with a big ER bill.",
      "There was no one at the check-in desk to inform that they were leaving, Wettstein said, so they just headed home to go to bed.",
      "Ryan went to her preschool the next day, and Wettstein said they forgot all about the ER trip for eight months.",
      "Then the bill came.",
      "The final bill",
      "$445 for the combined Covid and flu test \u2014 from an ER visit in which the patient never made it beyond the waiting room.",
      "The billing problem: A healthy hospital markup and standard insurance rules",
      "Even though Ryan and her mother left without seeing a doctor, the family ended up owing $298.15 after an insurance discount.",
      "At first, Wettstein said, she couldn't recall Ryan being tested at all. It wasn't until she received the bill and requested her daughter's medical records that she learned the results. (Ryan tested negative for Covid and both types of flu.)",
      "While Wettstein said the bill isn't going to break the bank, it seemed high to her, considering Walgreens sells an at-home Covid and flu combination test for $30 and can do higher-quality PCR testing for $145.",
      "Under the public health emergency declared in 2020 for the Covid pandemic, insurance companies were required to pay for Covid tests without copayments or cost sharing for patients.",
      "That requirement ended when the emergency declaration expired in May 2023. Now, it is often patients who foot the bill \u2014 and ER bills are notoriously high.",
      "\"That's a pretty healthy markup the hospital is making on it,\" Loren Adler, associate director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy, told KFF Health News when contacted about Ryan's case.",
      "The rates the insurance companies negotiate with hospitals for various procedures are often based on multipliers of what Medicare pays, Adler said.",
      "Lab tests are one of the few areas in which insurance companies can often pay less than Medicare, he said \u2014 the exception being when the test is performed by the hospital laboratory, which is often what happens during ER visits.",
      "Medicare pays $142.63 for the joint test that Ryan received, but the family is on the hook for more than twice that amount, and the initial hospital charge was over three times as much.",
      "The hospital is \"utilizing their market power to make as much money as possible, and the insurance companies are not all that good at pushing back,\" Adler said. A markup of a few hundred dollars is a drop in the bucket for big insurers. But for the patients who get unexpected bills, it can be a big burden.",
      "Brittany Simon, a public relations manager for Carle Health, did not respond to specific questions but said in a statement, \"We follow policies that support the safety and wellbeing of our patients, which includes the initial triage of symptomatic patients to the Emergency Department.\"",
      "While Ryan's family would not have had to pay for a Covid test during the public health emergency, it was the family's insurer, Cigna, that did not have to pay this time, since the family had not yet met a $3,000 yearly deductible.",
      "A Cigna representative did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The resolution",
      "Wettstein said she knew she could just pay the bill and be done with it, \"but the fact that I never saw a provider, and the fact that it was just for a Covid test, is mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "She contacted the hospital's billing department to make sure the bill was correct. She explained what happened and said the hospital representative was also surprised by the size of the bill and sent it up for further review.",
      "\"'Don't pay this until you hear from me,'\" Wettstein remembered being told.",
      "Soon, though, she received a letter from the hospital explaining that the charge was correct and supported by documentation.",
      "Wettstein thought she was avoiding any charges by taking Ryan home without being seen. Instead, she got a bill \"that they have verified that I have to pay.\"",
      "\"Like I said, it's mind-blowing to me.\"",
      "The takeaway",
      "ERs are among the most expensive options for care in the nation's health system, and the meter can start running as soon as you check in \u2014 even if you check out before receiving care.",
      "If your issue isn't life-threatening, consider an urgent care facility, which is often cheaper (and look for posted notices to confirm whether it's actually an urgent care clinic). The urgent care centers near Ryan's home were closed that evening, but some facilities stay open late or around the clock.",
      "In some ways, Wettstein was lucky. KFF Health News' \"Bill of the Month\" has received tips from other patients who left an ER after a long wait without seeing a doctor \u2014 and got slapped with a facility fee of over $1,000.",
      "Making the decision about where to go is tough, especially in a stressful situation \u2014 such as when the patient is too young to communicate what's wrong. Trying to figure out what's going on physically with a 3-year-old can feel impossible.",
      "If you decide to leave an ER without treatment, don't just walk out. Tell the triage nurse you're leaving. You might get lucky and avoid some charges.",
      "Wettstein won't think twice about taking Ryan to the pediatrician or an urgent care center the next time she's ailing. But, Wettstein said, after getting this bill, \"I'm not going to create a habit out of going to the emergency room.\"",
      "Bill of the Month is a crowdsourced investigation by KFF Health News and The Washington Post's Well+Being that dissects and explains medical bills. Since 2018, this series has helped many patients and readers get their medical bills reduced, and it has been cited in statehouses, at the U.S. Capitol, and at the White House.

    "summary": "23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki talks to \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King about the company's recent struggles, welcoming employee feedback and her vision for the future of the genetic-testing and ancestry-tracing company.",
    "story": [
      "23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki knows the genetic-testing and ancestry-tracing company has been in \"the eye of the storm\" recently, but she said she's confident that the company is still viable and believes it will be \"growing and thriving\" a year from now.",
      "\"I believe in the company. I believe in the long-term mission. But I believe it's essential for us to restructure,\" Wojcicki told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King in an exclusive interview.",
      "Wojcicki acknowledged recent headlines about the California-based company's struggles, including a data security incident in late 2023, a full board resignation in September, and laying off 40% of the company's workforce in November. In a public letter, the seven board members said it was \"clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward.\"",
      "The announcement came as a surprise to Wojcicki, saying that she doesn't have \"great insights into what the strategic differences were\" and that \"there was not an overt disagreement.\" Wojcicki has recently said she intends to take the company private and isn't open to considering third-party takeover proposals.",
      "\"I will make [mistakes], and I will learn from them\"",
      "Former 23andMe employees were critical of Wojcicki's management style in an October interview with Fortune Magazine \u2013 with one calling her \"outwardly charming, but stubborn and controlling behind the scenes.\"",
      "\"I love getting feedback. Like, one of my favorite things\u2026\" Wojcicki said.",
      "Wojcicki said she encourages everyone to voice their opinions and share suggestions.",
      "\"At the heart of what 23andMe does\u2026we're about consumer empowerment and research. Okay.\u00a0 So help me navigate because this has never been done before. So I love getting feedback for all those reasons because it has never been done before,\" Wojcicki explained. \"We're doing all kinds of things for the first time. So we will make mistakes. 100% admit all of that. But\u2026my commitment to the world has always been I will always learn from my mistakes. I will make them, and I will learn from them, and we will be better going forward.\"",
      "Wojcicki sent \"CBS Mornings\" emails she says the company received in support of 23andMe, including one from 70-year-old Rebecca Jones who thanked the company for helping her learn about her increased risk for Alzheimer's. Wojcicki said stories like these show the company provides real value.",
      "When asked by \"CBS Mornings\" if she was concerned about her data following the 2023 security incident at the company, Jones said, \"I have to have some level of confidence in the integrity of 23andMe, like I trust my physician. I have to trust that they are going to safeguard it. Of course I'm concerned and am watching it and will see if there are any steps I should take. I downloaded my data and all of that.\"",
      "Wojcicki's future plans for 23andMe",
      "23andMe's stock has dropped around 98% since 2021, when it went public. The company, which was once valued at $6 billion, now has a market cap of around $80 million. In its most recent quarter, the company reported a net loss of $59.1 million.",
      "King asked, \"How does a company survive when it's lost 98% of its value though?\"",
      "\"I think market cap and reality of a company are always two different realities,\" Wojcicki said. \"We absolutely are in a situation where we're figuring out cash burn and we're looking at all the ways that we're gonna drive revenue growth.\"",
      "To help boost revenue, Wojcicki said the company is focusing on its subscription service, where members can get more insights into their health. With a premium membership, customers get health and ancestry kits, discover things like their historical matches, receive new research reports on health findings - such as new breast cancer variants - and more.",
      "\"People did 23andMe, and they loved it. And we see over 50% of our customers coming back on a quarterly basis, so they're engaged,\" said Wojcicki, adding that it shows \"they want more.\"",
      "Wojcicki said the recent layoffs, which affected more than 200 employees, were also an attempt to help slash costs.",
      "\"The focus right now is 100% on making 23andMe sustainable. And I will not be taking on research initiatives at our own cost anymore. So we will be focusing on \u2013 you know, the consumer business, the subscription, and research partnerships. And I absolutely think, like, 23andMe will, you know, turn a point at some point of being profitable,\" Wojcicki said.",
      "Wojcicki said she's confident that in 2025, the company will be \"growing and thriving.\" In five years, it \"will transform health care,\" she told King.",

    "story": [
      "For years, U.S. authorities and fishermen have been complaining about illegal fishing for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico, and now it's been revealed who is behind the lucrative trade: a Mexican drug cartel.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions Tuesday against members of the Gulf drug cartel, which operates in the border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros, across from McAllen and Brownsville, Texas.",
      "While commercial fishing and drug cartels may seem like an unlikely combination, it makes perfect sense for a criminal organization.",
      "The department says the cartel uses fishing boats to facilitate drug and migrant smuggling; along the way, the boats catch tons of red snapper, a commercially valuable but vulnerable species. The boats often launch from Playa Bagdad, east of Matamoros, on the Gulf coast.",
      "\"The Gulf Cartel engages in the illicit trade of red snapper and shark species through 'lancha' operations based out of Playa Bagdad,\" the department said. \"Apart from their use for IUU (illegal, unregulated or unreported) fishing in U.S. waters, lanchas are also used to move illicit drugs and migrants into the United States.\"",
      "To add insult to injury, these Mexican boats, often based out of Playa Bagdad, sell their catch in Mexican border cities, where they are sometimes shipped into Texas for resale in the U.S. market.",
      "This occurs while U.S. fishermen had to respect strict seasonal limits or closures designed to protect fish populations.",
      "\"As the fishing of red snapper and shark species is under strict limits in the United States, and therefore those species are more abundant in U.S. waters, Mexican fishermen cross into U.S. waters to fish via these lanchas,\" the department said.",
      "\"They then bring their catch back to lancha camps into Mexico, where the product is ultimately sold and, oftentimes, exported into the United States,\" it continued. \"This activity earns millions a year for lancha camps. In addition, it also leads to the death of other marine species that are inadvertently caught\" on the long lines of baited hooks the boats use.",
      "The Treasury announced Tuesday it was designating five individuals linked to the cartel for illegal fishing -- Ildelfonso Carrillo Sapien (a.k.a. \"El Chivo\"), Raul Decuir Garcia (a.k.a. \"La Burra\"), Ismael Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"El Comandante\"), Omar Guerra Salinas (a.k.a. \"Samorano\"), and Francisco Javier Sierra Angulo (a.k.a. \"El Borrado\").",
      "History of illegal fishing",
      "This isn't the first time cartels have been involved in illegal fishing in Mexico. Experts say other drug cartels are involved in the prohibited gillnet fishing for totoaba in the Gulf of California, also known as the Sea of Cortez, threatening the world's most endangered porpoise, the vaquita marina.",
      "Those designated under Tuesday's sanctions - which block any of their U.S. assets - include Gulf cartel local bosses in Playa Bagdad, as well as two owners of fishing camps there.",
      "The illegal fishing problem became so severe that in 2022, the U.S. government prohibited Mexican fishing vessels from entering U.S. ports on the Gulf of Mexico, arguing the Mexican government had not done enough to prevent its boats from illegally fishing in U.S. waters.",
      "Mexican fishing boats in the Gulf \"are prohibited from entering U.S. ports, will be denied port access and services,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration wrote in a report in 2022. According to a Sept. 10, 2024 NOAA bulletin, those restrictions remain in place.",
      "Small Mexican boats frequently use prohibited long lines or nets to haul in snapper in U.S. waters, which can harm other marine life, such as sharks.",
      "NOAA said in a previous report that the U.S. Coast Guard apprehended dozens of Mexican boats in the Gulf, including repeat offenders who had been interdicted multiple times since 2014.",
      "It noted the United States imported nearly five tons of fresh and frozen snapper from Mexico in 2018, raising concerns that \"these imports may have included fish harvested illegally in U.S. waters.\"",
      "U.S. targeting cartels recently",
      "In recent months, the U.S. Treasury has imposed sanctions on cartels for a variety of reasons -- from drug trafficking to fuel theft to time share scams.",
      "In October, the U.S. sanctioned senior members of the armed wing of a Mexican drug cartel that operates on border territories in and around Chihuahua, Mexico. The cartel has also been linked to the 2019 ambush that\u00a0killed nine Americans\u00a0in Mexico.",
      "In September, the U.S. sanctioned a\u00a0man known as \"The Tank\"\u00a0who allegedly leads the fuel theft arm of Mexico's hyper-violent\u00a0Jalisco New Generation cartel.",

    "title": "Here's why Trump thinks tariffs are good for the U.S.",
    "published": "Tue, 26 Nov 2024 20:23:03 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump is proposing sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China as soon as he takes office. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump, an avowed fan of tariffs, is pledging to enact stiff import duties as soon as he's inaugurated in January. For Trump, these new levies would both supercharge the\u00a0trade policies\u00a0pursued during his first administration and, more broadly, help the U.S. achieve key economic and social goals.",
      "On his Truth Social site Monday evening, Trump unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on January 20, his inauguration day. The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "Trump's penchant for protectionist trade policies is a source of concern for many economists and Wall Street analysts, who worry new tariffs and retaliatory measures by U.S. trade partners could slow economic growth, spur inflation and trigger a trade war.",
      "But Trump and his allies, including his choice for Treasury Secretary,\u00a0Scott Bessent, have argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that the upside could far outweigh any negatives.",
      "\"But tariffs are two things if you look at it,\" Trump said in October in an interview with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait. \"No. 1 is for protection of the companies that we have here, and the new companies that will move in because we're going to have thousands of companies coming into this country.\"",
      "Here are four ways Trump says tariffs will help with the U.S., along with what experts say.",
      "Protect U.S. manufacturing",
      "Trump believes that imposing tariffs on trading partners will help protect U.S. businesses at a time when domestic manufacturing jobs have fallen far from their peak in 1979.",
      "In some instances, the tariffs that Trump imposed in 2018-19 achieved that goal, with the Brookings Institution noting there's some evidence that jobs in specific industries may have received a boost. For instance, tariffs on imported washing machines may have created 1,800 new U.S. jobs at Whirlpool and other manufacturers, according to the centrist think tank.",
      "But that ignores the broader impact of Trump's first-term tariffs on U.S. manufacturing, with the Federal Reserve finding\u00a0that U.S. manufacturers ended up facing higher costs for raw materials they imported, as well as from retaliatory tariffs from other nations. The number of U.S. manufacturing jobs fell slightly during Trump's first term, from about 12.4 million to 12.2 million workers, although a range of factors could account for that decline.",
      "\"[O]ur results suggest that the tariffs have not boosted manufacturing employment or output, even as they increased producer prices,\" the Fed researchers noted.",
      "Bring new companies to the U.S.",
      "Trump also contends that broad-based tariffs will convince some foreign manufacturers to open plants in the U.S. as a way to avoid the import duties.",
      "\"The higher the tariff, the more likely it is that the company will come into the United States and build a factory in the United States, so it doesn't have to pay the tariff,\" Trump told Bloomberg's Micklethwait.",
      "Although such a shift is possible, Micklethwait said such changes would \"take many, many years.\" (Trump disputed that, saying companies would \"come right away.\") Experts note that many factors beyond tariffs affect where companies decide to operate, including supply chains, taxes, shipping costs, and labor and regulatory policies.",
      "Already, some businesses are anticipating the impact of tariffs by shifting their manufacturing locations, but that may not be guaranteed to benefit the U.S. For instance, shoemaker Steve Madden said if Trump places new tariffs on Chinese imports, it will shift manufacturing away from China and toward nations such as Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Deliver billions in new federal revenue",
      "Trump has also touted tariffs as a way to generate new federal revenue that can offset his proposed tax cuts. During his first administration, his tariffs \u2014 more limited than his current proposals \u2014 generated $80 billion in revenue, according to the Tax Foundation.",
      "If Trump institutes a 10% tariff on all imports, as he proposed during his campaign, the federal government would reap $2 trillion from 2025 through 2034,\u00a0estimates\u00a0the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, a think tank focused on tax issues.",
      "According to Goldman Sachs, a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, along with a 10% tax on Chinese imports, would generate just under $300 billion in tariff revenue per year. Overall, 43% of U.S. imports come from Mexico (15.4%), Canada (13.6%),and China (13.9%).",
      "However, that revenue would largely be paid by U.S. consumers and businesses, experts say. That's because tariffs are not paid by the countries that export to the U.S., as Trump maintains, but rather by U.S. importers.",
      "In other words, companies like Walmart would be faced with the decision of whether to swallow the higher costs of imports, or passing those on to consumers, Vicky Redwood, senior economic adviser for Capital Economics, wrote in a research note.",
      "\"If the costs are passed on, then customers face a choice: continue buying the (now more expensive) import or switch to buying a domestic alternative (which will cost more than the import pre-tariff),\" she noted.",
      "Trump's tariffs could cost the typical U.S. family an additional $2,600 a year due to importers and manufacturers passing the cost of tariffs to consumers, according to an August analysis from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan think tank focused on economic issues.",
      "Stem the flow of drugs and illegal immigration",
      "Trump also sees the threat of new tariffs as a way to curb illegal immigration and drug smuggling, citing people \"pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before.\" The tariffs would remain \"until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\" he added.",
      "Much of the fentanyl within the U.S.\u00a0is smuggled from Mexico. During President Biden's term, border seizures of the drug rose sharply, with U.S. officials tallying about 21,900 pounds (12,247 kilograms) of fentanyl seized in the 2024 government budget year, versus 2,545 pounds (1,154 kilograms) in 2019, when Trump was president.",
      "While it's possible that Canada, Mexico and China could increase enforcement against drug smuggling or immigration to avoid Trump's tariffs, it's unclear whether such a threat along would achieve those goals. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday suggested Mexico could retaliate with tariffs of its own and described illegal drugs as a U.S. problem, while indicating a willingness to discuss the issues with Trump.",

      "Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said Tuesday that personal electronics could become more expensive if President-elect Donald Trump carries out his threat to slap new tariffs on foreign goods, as large retailers scramble to assess the potential impact of the proposed levies on their business.",
      "The warning came one day after Trump said he would impose a\u00a0new round of tariffs\u00a0on Mexico, Canada and China on his first day in office. Before the Nov. 5 election, he had proposed a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, arguing the such levies protect domestic manufacturers and encourage American companies to create jobs at home.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors in the company's Nov. 26 earnings call, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "\"These are goods that people need, and higher prices are not helpful,\" she added.",
      "Price hikes are not guaranteed, Barry cautioned, saying that any impact on the retailer's costs and prices are contingent on how any new tariffs might be implemented.",
      "\"I think it's going to be a very fluid situation as we continue to work through it,\" she said, adding that the company will \"make sure we do everything we can to keep prices right for our customers.\"",
      "Best Buy could try to partly offset the impact of new tariffs by importing more goods ahead of levies taking effect in 2025, as well as working with vendors to source products from countries other than China, Barry said during the call. Roughly 60% of the goods Best Buy sells are imported from China.",
      "\"We are already planning for and working with our vendor partners on next steps,\" she said.",

      "That exceeds the U.S. median rent of $15,216 that same year, while some families are spending as much as almost 30% of their annual earnings on child care, the agency noted. Overall, the cost of child care has soared more than 50% over the last decade.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:16:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said . \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0President Biden announced late Sunday that he issued a pardon for his son Hunter Biden, in a major reversal in the final weeks of his presidency.",
      "Mr. Biden repeatedly pledged not to pardon his son, who was\u00a0convicted in June of three separate felony charges\u00a0related to his purchase of a revolver in 2018 when he was battling an addiction to illegal drugs, which he lied about on paperwork to obtain the gun. He also pleaded guilty to nine tax evasion charges in a separate case in September.",
      "\"Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement Sunday night.",
      "The president argued that \"Hunter was treated differently\" than others under similar circumstances, claiming that the charges were brought after \"several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.\"",
      "\"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2014  and that is wrong,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "The \"Full and Unconditional Pardon\" applies to any crimes Hunter Biden may have committed from Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "Mr. Biden did not address the pardon with reporters before boarding Air Force One for his trip to Angola.",
      "Hunter Biden charges and allegations",
      "Hunter Biden was investigated and prosecuted by special counsel David Weiss, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware who was kept on by Mr. Biden's administration in 2021, when other Trump-era prosecutors were asked to resign, in order to continue the probes into Hunter's conduct. Attorney General Merrick Garland later elevated Weiss to special counsel status after whistleblowers and congressional Republicans alleged irregularities in the probe.",
      "Weiss' office declined to comment on the pardon.",
      "Joseph Ziegler and Gary Shapley, two IRS whistleblowers who came forward to raise concerns about what they said were the Justice Department's efforts to shield Hunter Biden, said in a statement that it was \"a sad day for law abiding taxpayers to witness this special privilege for the powerful.\"",
      "Before dropping out of the race for president, Mr. Biden had committed not to pardon his son,\u00a0saying in an interview with ABC News in June that he had ruled it out. After opting to\u00a0leave the race\u00a0the next month, the White House maintained that Mr. Biden had no plans to pardon his son, though the possible political consequences of the decision had decreased. The White House\u00a0said\u00a0as recently as last month that the president still had no plans to issue a pardon.",
      "\"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction \u2014 mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport. Despite all of this, I have maintained my sobriety for more than five years because of my deep faith and the unwavering love and support of my family and friends,\" Hunter Biden said in a statement Sunday night.",
      "\"I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering,\" the president's son said.",
      "Hunter Biden was set to be sentenced for the gun convictions on Dec. 12 and on Dec. 16 for the tax evasion charges.",
      "Following the White House announcement of the pardon, Hunter Biden's legal team informed the federal judges overseeing his cases in Delaware and California about the pardon so the cases can be formally dismissed and the sentencing hearings set for later this month be canceled.",
      "Hunter Biden was\u00a0indicted on three felony gun charges\u00a0in September after a proposed plea deal with federal prosecutors\u00a0fell apart. The deal would have had him plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and enter a diversion program instead of pleading guilty to a felony gun possession count.",
      "During the court hearing in which the plea deal was set to be finalized, the judge overseeing the case raised concerns over the terms while Hunter Biden's legal team pushed back against prosecutors over whether the agreement was to protect the president's son from any future criminal charges.",
      "Hunter Biden was accused of lying on paperwork and illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while he was addicted to crack cocaine. Federal law prohibits users of illegal drugs from owning firearms.",
      "Prosecutors said the president's son lied about his drug use on a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives form when he bought a revolver and several other items from a Wilmington, Delaware, gun store on Oct. 12, 2018.",
      "In the separate case in California, a federal grand jury last December\u00a0charged Hunter Biden\u00a0with three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor offenses. The president's son was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes while living an \"extravagant lifestyle.\"",
      "According to the indictment, Hunter Biden made some $7 million in income from his foreign business dealings from 2016 through 2019. He was accused of spending nearly $5 million during that same time period on \"everything but his taxes,\" including on drugs, escorts, luxury hotels, cars and clothing. Hunter Biden was accused of falsely listing those purchases as business expenses.",
      "After unsuccessfully attempting to enter an \"Alford\" plea, wherein a defendant accepts a guilty verdict while maintaining their innocence, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to the tax evasion charges on Sept. 5.",
      "\"Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form,\" Mr. Biden said Sunday night. \"Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.\"",
      "Special counsel response",
      "Weiss argued in a court filing on Monday that Hunter Biden's cases should not be dismissed, but rather closed by the judge overseeing them. The Justice Department said Monday they have not yet seen the order of clemency signed by Mr. Biden for his son.",
      "Weiss argued the cases against Hunter Biden were not defective and as a result, should not be dismissed. He says the judges should follow precedent form other cases in which defendants received pardons and simply close the case and docket the notice of clemency on the public docket.",
      "\"If media reports are accurate, the Government does not challenge that the defendant has been the recipient of an act of mercy,\" Weiss said in the filing. \"But that does not mean the grand jury's decision to charge him, based on a finding of probable cause, should be wiped away as if it never occurred. It also does not mean that his charges should be wiped away because the defendant falsely claimed that the charges were the result of some improper motive. No court has agreed with the defendant on these baseless claims, and his request to dismiss the indictment finds no support in the law or the practice of this district.\"",
      "Without specifically calling out Mr. Biden by name, Weiss also pushed back on criticism of the probe, writing, \"there was none and never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case.\"",
      "White House response",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dodged questions about the president's reversal on Monday, reiterating portions of the president's statement while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One. She outlined that Mr. Biden made the decision over the weekend, saying that he \"agonized\" over it.",
      "While insisting Mr. Biden believes in the Justice Department, Jean-Pierre said that \"politics infected the process,\" arguing that \"both things could be true.\" She said the president is not seeking the resignation of the attorney general, and said Mr. Biden does not agree with President-elect Donald Trump that the DOJ has been weaponized for political purposes or needs reform.",
      "Jean-Pierre suggested that the decision came in part because the president didn't think his political opponents would let up.",
      "\"One of the reasons the president did the pardon is because it didn't seem like his political opponents would let go of it,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"It didn't seem like they would move on.\"",
      "Biden family reaction",
      "First lady Jill Biden told reporters on Monday \"of course I support the pardon of my son.\"",
      "The first lady and daughter Ashley were often present during Hunter Biden's trial to show their support for him. Hunter Biden, his wife Melissa and son Beau Jr. all spent Thanksgiving weekend on Nantucket with Mr. Biden, Jill Biden and Ashley.",
      "Reaction to the pardon",
      "On social media, Trump called the Biden pardon \"an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\"",
      "Other Republicans on Sunday and Monday decried the pardon. House Speaker Mike Johnson posted X that \"trust in our justice system has been almost irreparably damaged by the Bidens and their use and abuse of it.\"",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley wrote that is he is \"shocked\" about the pardon because Mr. Biden \"said many many times he wouldn't & I believed him[.] Shame on me.\"",
      "Colorado's Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, meanwhile, wrote on Sunday that as a father, he understands Mr. Biden's desire to pardon his son, but said he was \"disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country. This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.\"",
      "But former Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder said on Sunday night \"pardon warranted,\" posting on social media that had Hunter Biden's \"name been Joe Smith the resolution would have been - fundamentally and more fairly - a declination.\"",
      "Holder also mentioned Trump's announcement over the weekend that he wanted Kash Patel to lead the FBI, saying \"ask yourself a vastly more important question. Do you really think Kash Patel is qualified to lead the world's preeminent law enforcement investigative organization? Obvious answer: hell no.\"",
      "Presidential pardons",
      "Hunter Biden is the 26th person to receive a pardon during Mr. Biden's presidency. Most of the others received pardons for drug offenses. Trump granted\u00a029 pardons\u00a0at this point in his first term, but issued a total of 143 pardons by the time he left office in 2020.",
      "This is not the first time a president has pardoned a family member. President Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother, Roger Clinton, before leaving office. Trump pardoned his son-in-law's father, Charles Kushner, during his first term. Trump announced that he intends to\u00a0nominate Kushner\u00a0as U.S. ambassador to France on Saturday.",
      "The two federal cases against Hunter Biden came amid a backdrop of Republican-led congressional inquiries into his business dealings and whether they involved Mr. Biden. The president has maintained he had nothing to do with his son's businesses and the investigative committees produced no evidence showing the president engaged in wrongdoing.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California said there's \"a lot of reason for concern\" for the second Trump administration \"if the first administration is any indicator.\"",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California said on Sunday that President-elect Donald Trump \"has made it no secret that he has it in for California\" as Gov. Gavin Newsom has convened a special legislative session this week to prepare for legal fights in Trump's upcoming term.",
      "Padilla said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that there's \"a lot of reason for concern\" for the second Trump administration \"if the first administration is any indicator.\"",
      "The California Democrat cited reports that Trump initially withheld disaster funds for the state during his first term, saying the president-elect tried to keep federal dollars from California families \"simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election.\" In September, Trump threatened to block federal wildfire aid for California if elected again.",
      "\"We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats,\" Padilla continued.",
      "California Democrats billed the state as the \"resistance\" state during the first Trump administration. And after Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election, Newsom announced that he would convene an emergency session of the California state legislature to \"safeguard California values and fundamental rights in the face of an incoming Trump administration.\" In addition to bolstering legal resources, the governor pointed to protections for civil and reproductive rights, climate action, and immigrant families.",
      "On immigration, Padilla said \"we're hearing a lot of bombast from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history.\" He said while \"nobody disagrees\" with a focus on violent criminals, that's \"very different than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately.\" Padilla said that providing legal support for communities that could be impacted by Trump's plans is \"just the California way.\"",
      "\"We embrace our diversity,\" Padilla said. \"Our diversity is what has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration.\"",
      "Meanwhile, as a \"sanctuary state,\" California state law instructs local law enforcement not to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on deportations, teeing up what could be a clash with the Trump administration. Padilla, citing California's status as the most populous state in the nation with more immigrants than any other state, argued that the issue concerns the ability for people to be able to come forward to report a crime, saying \"the last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes.\"",
      "\"Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials' job,\" Padilla continued. \"There doesn't have to be a conflict unless that's what Trump wants.\"",
      "More broadly, Padilla said \"there's also a lot of good that can be finalized\" before President Biden leaves office, pointing to climate-related work and additional flexibility for public health care programs to target mental health issues. And the California Democrat noted that there's \"a lot of good work to be done\" beyond the current administration if the federal government will continue to support California.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns this week from a Thanksgiving recess with a number of priorities to get through before the end of the year, while a deadline to fund the government looms over lawmakers.",
      "With the new Congress set to be sworn in on Jan. 3, lawmakers are pushing through a list of to-dos in the coming weeks in the lame-duck session, while Republicans gear up for leadership in Washington next year.",
      "But first, Congress must address government funding, since lawmakers only have until Dec. 20 to approve new spending. And although a shutdown remains unlikely, leaders will need to reach an agreement on a short-term funding measure in the weeks ahead.",
      "Funding the government",
      "In September, lawmakers approved a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through Dec. 20, setting a pre-holiday deadline to prevent a shutdown that has become commonplace for Congress. With frustration among some conservatives over the practice, House Speaker Mike Johnson made clear at the time that he opposed an omnibus package to fund the government, suggesting that the House would work to approve the 12 full-year spending bills individually after the election. But the favorable results for Republicans in the 2024 elections appeared to change the calculus.",
      "Republicans appear likely to push to punt the deadline into the early days of President-elect Donald Trump's administration, though the exact timeline for the stopgap measure remains a key question. The deadline will tee up a larger fight over government spending, with Republicans set to control the House, Senate and the White House \u2014 and looking to make significant spending cuts while juggling the extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Lawmakers also have disaster aid to consider after the Biden administration requested $98 billion in aid to address the aftermath of Hurricanes Milton and Helene in the southeast.",
      "The funding fight comes as Johnson is looking to hold onto his gavel in the new year, with a narrow House majority that's proven problematic for Republicans seeking the speakership in recent years. Republicans have already selected Johnson to be their nominee for speaker in January, and the full House will elect a speaker when lawmakers are sworn in next month.",
      "Senate Republicans meet with Trump's administration picks",
      "Senate Republicans are expected to continue meeting with Trump's picks for top posts in his administration this week, looking to secure support in the upper chamber, which has the role of confirming the intended nominees.",
      "Ahead of their recess, Senate Republicans met with Trump picks including Pete Hegseth and former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who then opted to withdraw his name from consideration for Attorney General following intense scrutiny over a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. On Monday, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa is set to meet with former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who Trump tapped for Attorney General after Gaetz withdrew.",
      "Trump has continued to announce his picks for the top posts, including Kash Patel, a 44-year-old who served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term and has a reputation as a controversial figure, for FBI director. The announcement came as Trump-nominated Christopher Wray's term isn't set to expire until 2027.",
      "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump tapped to lead the newly coined Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, will also be on Capitol Hill this week, meeting Thursday with Senate and House Republicans.",
      "House Ethics Committee meets to consider Gaetz report",
      "The House Ethics Committee is set to meet Thursday to further consider whether to release the report about its investigation into Gaetz, after the evenly split bipartisan panel failed to reach an agreement in an hourslong meeting last month.",
      "A day later, Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration, further complicating the ethics committee's decision about whether to release the report. Gaetz' resignation from the House after his selection for attorney general had ended the committee's jurisdiction over him, making the release of the report all the more controversial. The Republican committee chairmen said he voted against the release of the report over the jurisdiction issue.",
      "Still, some view the report's release as essential if Gaetz is eyeing other offices, like another post within Trump's administration or running for Florida governor down the road.",
      "The Ethics Committee's investigation first began in 2021, but was put on pause as the Justice Department conducted a sex trafficking and obstruction probe of Gaetz. Last year, the Ethics Committee resumed its work, after prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz, who has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "Senate Democrats hold leadership elections",
      "Senate Democrats, who will be in the minority in the new Congress, are expected to meet Tuesday to elect their leadership for the next two years, after Republicans flipped the chamber in the 2024 elections.",
      "Though the top posts in Democratic leadership are expected to remain unchanged, with Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and whip Dick Durbin seeking to remain in their roles, the no. 3 post is up for grabs as Sen. Debbie Stabenow set to retire.",
      "Stabenow, who is leaving the Senate after more than two decades, chairs the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. The post has been eyed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.",
      "The leadership races come as Senate Democrats are making a final push on their agenda, with a focus on confirming President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts. Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's 234 judicial confirmations from his first term during the lame-duck session, but have run into resistance from Republicans looking to hold up and drag out the process.",

      "President Biden's full statement",
      "Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.",
      "The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room \u2013 with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter's cases.",
      "No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2013 and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter \u2013 who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they've tried to break me \u2013 and there's no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.",
      "For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They'll be fair-minded. Here's the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice \u2013 and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's announcement\u00a0Saturday that he intends to nominate Kash Patel as FBI director sent shockwaves through Washington over the weekend, prompting outrage from Democrats and even some former Trump officials, while some loyalists insisted they believed Patel would be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Patel, a 44-year-old who served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, is a controversial figure even within Trump's world, and a former U.S. official described him as \"by far the most dangerous pick\" Trump has made.",
      "\"There is no 'there' to him,\" the official told CBS News. \"He'll literally do anything.\"",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term and was Patel's boss, compared the nomination to Joseph Stalin's secret police chief.",
      "\"Fortunately, the FBI is not\" Stalin's secret police, Bolton said. \"The Senate should reject this nomination 100-0.\"",
      "In response to Bolton's comments, Vice President-elect JD Vance posted on social media that \"John Bolton has been wrong about everything so I guess Kash must be pretty awesome.\"",
      "In addition to objections about Patel at the helm of the FBI, current FBI director Christopher Wray's 10-year term is not due to end until 2027. For Patel to become FBI director, Wray would have to resign or be fired by Trump and Patel would need to be confirmed by the Senate. Republicans are set to hold a 53-47 majority come January, giving incoming Majority Leader John Thune only a few votes to lose.",
      "Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People\" in a post on social media Saturday. And some of his supporters echoed the sentiment, like Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, who said Patel is a \"very strong nominee\" whom he thinks will be approved by the Senate.",
      "\"I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI,\" Cruz said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he \"encouraged President Trump to bring Kash Patel to the table,\" saying Patel \"represents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI.\"",
      "Other Republicans, like Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, took a more cautious approach. Rounds expressed support for Wray, who was nominated by Trump in his first term in 2017.",
      "\"I think the president picked a very good man to be the director of the FBI when he did that in his first term,\" Rounds said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I don't have any complaints about the way that he's done his job right now.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats were highly critical of the pick. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on NBC that he will vote no, expressing concern that Patel \"is going to only care about protecting Republicans.\" And Murphy pledged to help his colleagues and the American public \"understand what's happening here.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump told the American public during the campaign that he was going to turn the Department of Justice into a political operation, an arm of the White House, to destroy his political opponents,\" Murphy said. \"Kash Patel's only qualification is because he agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should serve to punish, lock up, and intimidate Donald Trump's political opponents. And so the cost to the American public is pretty simple\"",
      "In recent weeks, Trump's most controversial selections for top posts in his administration have faced intense scrutiny as they prepare for the Senate confirmation process. And one pick, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, already withdrew his name from consideration facing headwinds in the Senate.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the current majority whip in the upper chamber, urged his Senate colleagues in a statement to reject Trump's pick of Patel, noting that \"we already have a FBI director\" and accusing the president-elect of wanting to \"replace his own appointee with an unqualified loyalist.\"",

Boulos will likely play a role in how Trump approaches Israel's ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza, which has triggered conflicts with Lebanon and Iran while threatening to spread more widely throughout the region. The Biden White House announced last week that it had helped broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah in Lebanon, although both Israel and Hezbollah have accused the other of violating the agreement.

      "The FBI says: \"Director Wray's focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with and the people we do the work for.\"",
      "Trump also announced he has selected son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, to serve as the next U.S. ambassador to France. Kushner was pardoned by Trump in 2020 after serving time in prison as part of a two-year sentence on federal criminal charges.",

      "MAJOR GARRETT: Weijia Jiang in Palm Beach, Florida, thank you.",
      "We turn now to Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who joins us this morning from Houston.",
      "Senator, it's good to see you. Good morning to you.",
      "Let's pick up this thread on tariffs. I remember covering your presidential campaign in 2016, and you were a skeptic of tariffs then. I know the politics around tariffs have changed. President-elect Trump has done that. But have the economics changed?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ (R-Texas): Well, I will tell you, what hasn't changed is \u2013 is the importance of leverage.",
      "And I got to say, you look at the threat of tariffs against Mexico and Canada immediately has produced action. We've seen the president of Mexico stand up and promise that she is going to work hand in hand with the president of the United States, President Trump, to secure the border.",
      "I will tell you, representing Texas, we've seen four years of an invasion at our southern border. Let me ask you, Major, why hasn't Joe Biden done this? Why hasn't Joe Biden actually stood up and used leverage to secure the border?",
      "And the reason is, Joe Biden and the Democrats wanted this invasion to happen. And I got to say, this is a promise that I believe President Trump is going to deliver on and deliver quickly. We are going to secure the border. This is about using leverage to get Mexico and Canada to cooperate.",
      "And I will tell you, Major, I think one of the very first bills we're going to take up in the Senate, vote on, and I hope pass, is my legislation the Justice for Jocelyn Act that is a response to the horrific rape and murder of Jocelyn Nungaray, 12-year-old girl in Houston, Texas, killed by violent criminal illegal aliens released by Joe Biden and the Democrats.",
      "This is a promise the president needs to deliver on, and I think he's going to.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So, when you think about tariffs and president-elect Trump, you don't take them seriously as an economic matter; you take them seriously only as a diplomatic lever?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, look, I think the president was explicit with Mexico and Canada. He said he will impose these tariffs unless they secure the border.",
      "It was explicitly leverage. And, by the way, that is the same way that President Trump negotiated the remain-in-Mexico agreement. If you remember, during his first term, President Trump threatened tariffs against Mexico. And AMLO, then the president of Mexico, he was incredibly scared and concerned. He was scared of Trump, and he ended up signing the remain-in- Mexico agreement, which produced the lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years.",
      "It was incredibly successful. What did Joe Biden the Democrats do when they came in? The very first week in office, they ripped up that incredibly successful international agreement. I expect we will once again enter into remain-in-Mexico.",
      "And we are going to see \u2013 I'm going to make a prediction right now. We will see the numbers plummet of illegal immigration coming into this country, not in a year, not in six months, but in January and February, because we will have a president who will vigorously enforce the law.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: On that point. Senator Cruz, you would concede, in the last three or four months, numbers have gone down already, have they not?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: They have ticked down slightly. We have still seen over these four years the highest rate of illegal immigration in our nation's history. Twelve million illegal immigrants have come into this country.",
      "And I got to say, in a state like Texas, you want to see the consequences, this last election was an incredible landslide for President Trump. He won all seven of the swing states. And, in Texas, President Trump won Hispanic voters in Texas. I won Hispanic voters in Texas. I won statewide by a million votes, nine points.",
      "And South Texas, the Rio Grande Valley, has literally spent over 100 years as a bright blue Democrat bastion. This cycle, South Texas flipped Republican. And it is amazing what having 12 million people invade your home can do to change people's voting behavior. I think the president has a mandate to deliver on securing the border, and I look forward to working hand in hand with him to deliver on that promise.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Kash Patel suggested by President Trump as the new leader of the FBI, how enthusiastic are you about that?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Listen, I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee. I think the entire slate of Cabinet nominees President Trump has put forward is very strong.",
      "I believe every one of these Cabinet nominees is going to be confirmed by the Senate. I think Kash Patel is going to be confirmed by the Senate. You look at his background, he has a serious professional background. He was a prosecutor. He was a public defender. He was a senior intelligence staffer on Capitol Hill. He was a senior intelligence staffer in the White House. He was the chief of staff of the Department of Defense.",
      "He was the deputy director of national intelligence. And I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI.",
      "The FBI and the Department of Justice are two institutions incredibly important to the rule of law in the United States. I revere both. And one of the most tragic consequences of four years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is, both the DOJ and the FBI have been politicized and weaponized, and I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption in the FBI.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: As you know, Senator, there isn't a vacancy at the top of the FBI. What should become of Christopher Wray, appointed by President Trump?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, I think he'll make a choice. I think either he will resign or President Trump will fire him. But it's no secret to anybody, including Chris Wray, that he is not going to continue to serve as the head of the FBI under Donald Trump.",
      "Listen, if you look at James Comey and Chris Wray, there has never been a period in our nation's history where the FBI has suffered a greater loss of respect, where more Americans doubt the fundamental integrity of the FBI.",
      "And it's because James Comey and Chris Wray presided over allowing the FBI to become a partisan cudgel to be used to target parents at school board meetings, to be used to target people who chose not to take the COVID vaccine, to be used to target President Trump and to target the political opponents of Joe Biden and the White House.",
      "It is tragic. That is not what the FBI is for. That is not what the DOJ is for. And I got to say, Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, I think, together are a very strong slate of nominees to go and restore integrity to both institutions.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How do you place that up against the prosecutions of Bob Menendez, a congressman, a Democrat from Texas, Hunter Biden? Are those political prosecutions as well or not?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, first of all, let's be clear. Bob Menendez was \u2013 was literally caught with gold bars and a stack of cash with his fingerprints taking bribes, and it's why Bob Menendez is not my colleague anymore. At that point, the evidence was overwhelming.",
      "Look, Major, I wrote an entire book entitled \"Justice Corrupted: How the Left Has Weaponized the Legal System.\" And it broke down \u2013 it started, sadly, under Barack Obama, where he began using the federal government to target his political opponents.",
      "The book details how many of those partisans then burrowed in to senior career positions during the Trump administration. They waged war against President Trump during his first term. And now, under Joe Biden, they have been open and brazen, and I think it has done unbelievable damage to the integrity of the Department of Justice and the FBI.",
      "I think Merrick Garland will go down in history as the most partisan attorney general our nation has ever seen. And I got to say, I hear regularly from \u2013 from prosecutors, from FBI agents who are deeply dismayed about the institution they have devoted a lifetime working for, because, listen, I don't want a Republican Department of Justice.",
      "I don't want a Democrat Department of Justice. I want a Department of Justice and an FBI that enforces the law regardless of party. And, sadly, we haven't seen that these last four years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What can you tell us about the three Americans released by China who are in San Antonio? Have you been in touch with them? And do you have any concerns about the contours of that swap?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Well, at this stage, we don't know all of the details of the contours of the swap, but I will tell you, I am celebrating the return of three Americans, especially Mark Swidan.",
      "Mark Swidan is a Texan from Houston. His mom, Katherine, is from Luling, Texas. I have talked with Katherine many times. I authored and passed a resolution in the Senate that passed unanimously calling for Mark Swidan's return to America. He spent 12 years unjustly imprisoned in communist China.",
      "I will tell you, I have raised it directly with the foreign minister of China. I have raised it with President Biden. I have raised it with Secretary of State Tony Blinken.",
      "And I will give them credit on this. Tony Blinken, just two weeks ago was the most recent time I spoke with him about Mark Swidan, and the administration has pressed the Chinese government. And Mark Swidan is back home with his mother, who has prayed for him, who has loved \u2013 loved him.",
      "I want to say, Mark, welcome home. Katherine, congratulations. I told you this day would come. This is a time where all Texans and all Americans should be celebrating.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, Senator Cruz, because I also know you care about the case of Austin Tice.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: Yes.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you have any sense that the rebel gains in Syria of the recent vintage will have any chance of unlocking Austin Tice's freedom?",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: I don't know. I certainly hope and pray. Austin Tice needs to come home. And I hope and pray.",
      "Listen, there's a combination of two things working. One, as Joe Biden is in the process of transitioning out, any \u2013 any outgoing president is looking to try to get some final wins. I would encourage him and I'm sure he is doing everything he can to bring Austin Tice home, to bring the hostages in Gaza home, both the Israelis and the Americans, bring them home in this window.",
      "I also think President Trump coming into office on January 20, the enemies of America, I think, are afraid of President Trump. That is a moment. I hope we have a moment right now that is very much like the end of the Jimmy Carter administration\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: \u2026 right before Ronald Reagan came in. And we saw, on January 20, our hostages in Iran released, I think in significant part because the ayatollah was afraid of Reagan.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, sir.",
      "SENATOR TED CRUZ: I hope a similar dynamic is playing out. And if we can see more hostages come home, that would be cause for enormous celebration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, thank you. Good morning.",
      "We'll be back with Face the Nation in just one moment. Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "We go now to California Democratic Senator Alex Padilla. He joins us this morning from Porter Ranch, California.",
      "Senator, good to see you.",
      "Let's start with Kash Patel. Your reaction to that nomination or that suggested nomination from president-elect Trump?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA (D-California): Well, good morning. Great to be with you.",
      "And, look, the \u2013 this announcement that Kash Patel is going to be nominated for a high-ranking position at the FBI, very key to the Department of Justice, raises a lot of the same questions that other announcements and other nominations raise.",
      "Are they going to go in there and do the job of \u2013 that the Department of Justice calls for to truly, truly be independent of the president of the United States, or is he going in there to do Trump's bidding? That's the big question here. Is it a genuine, legitimate appointment or a political appointment to politicize the bureau and the Department in Trump's \u2013 in Trump's favor?",
      "That's just the beginning of the questions that we expect to raise in the con \u2013 in the confirmation hearings that will begin in January.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you expect that the current FBI director, who has three years remaining, will just have to resign?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Well, that's going to be a personal decision for Director Wray who, look, the public should remember, was a Trump appointee to begin with.",
      "And so he's got three years left. It's up to him to resign or not. Your prior guest suggested that Trump may very well fire him, which is just par for the course. Anybody who recalls the first Trump administration recalls a whole lot of Cabinet officials being named, being confirmed, and being sold as the greatest thing since sliced bread.",
      "And, as soon as they lose favor with Trump, as soon as they don't do 100 percent of what he's demanding, all of a sudden, you know, they're fired, a lot of times by social media posts. And so who knows what Donald Trump is going to decide to do, whether it's with Director Wray, Kash Patel or any of his other nominees this coming term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: During the first Trump administration, California fashioned itself the resistance state. Some Democrats in the legislature have already begun to describe that as a cliche and say they don't even know what that means anymore.",
      "What does it mean?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Look, I think there's a lot of reason for concern of the second Trump administration, if the first administration is any indicator.",
      "I think, as the governor, as other legislative leaders and even the congressional delegation have said, if \u2013 if, you know, the federal government will continue to support California in its leadership in so many policy areas, there's a lot of good work to be done there.",
      "But Donald Trump has made it no secret that he has it in for California, whether it's the withholding of disaster funds, I mean, a lot of FEMA dollars that Donald Trump tried to keep from, not the state government of California, but from California families, simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election. We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats.",
      "There's also a lot of good that \u2013 that can be finalized before the end of the Biden administration, whether it's Environmental Protection Agency waivers that will allow California to continue to grow our economy while tackling climate change aggressively, waivers at Health and Human Services that would give California a little bit of flexibility with our Medicare dollars to be able to also treat behavioral health issues, mental health issues of Californians, because when \u2013 we know that treating the whole body is good for both physical and mental health.",
      "We're trying to make sure those waivers\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do those \u2013 where \u2013 where\u2026",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 are locked in before the end of the Biden administration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do you stand with the Biden administration on that, Senator? Are they going to be responsive?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: They've been very encouraging that the technical work can and should be done before the end of the term.",
      "But we'll know it when there's signatures on the documents that we need. But, again, these are just examples that we want to lock into place before President Trump comes into office, and then can use it either as a threat, as a punishment, or, as Senator Cruz mentioned in the prior segment, simply leverage to get other things he would want out of California.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You know President elect Trump has promised mass deportations. You also know, in California, there is a state law that tells local law enforcement not to participate and cooperate with ICE agents in deportation or identification processes.",
      "The incoming Trump administration border czar, Tom Homan, has said any law enforcement who don't cooperate will be prosecuted under federal law. How is this going to be resolved?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes. Well, I think there's an important distinction here.",
      "No state government, not Texas, not California, not any state in the nation, has a constitutional authority to impose federal immigration law. That is the responsibility of the federal government. Some states like Texas want to push the envelope and try to find a way to assist, but there's no obligation to do so.",
      "And that's what California leaders and municipal leaders throughout the state are saying. You know, we're not going to utilize state and local resources to do the federal government's job for them, number one. I think there's a long history of this being smart public safety policy as well.",
      "California is the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation. And the last thing you want to do is have immigrants who are victims of crime afraid to come forward to report that crime. The last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes.",
      "That's what we're talking about here. Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials' job. There doesn't have to be a conflict, unless that's what Trump wants.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The governor has called a special session that will convene this week to set aside money to battle the Trump administration.",
      "Will some of that money also be set aside to protect migrants and undocumented immigrants in California as they seek either legal advice or continued legal financial backing to support their efforts to stay within California and the United States?",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Yes, again, if the first Trump administration is any indicator, we know that there will continue to be a lot of fear in communities and communities that deserve to know what their rights are and what their rights are \u2013 are not.",
      "And so, if it's legal assistance, legal advice, legal support, that's just the California way. We embrace our diversity. Our diversity is what has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration.",
      "If we wanted to sort of cut to the chase, you know, we're hearing a lot of bombast from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history, on the one hand, versus a \u2013 maybe a focus on violent criminals on the other.",
      "Nobody \u2013 nobody disagrees with a focus on violent criminals.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: Democrats, Republicans agree. But that's very different\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately, not just tearing families apart, tearing communities apart\u2026",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Yes, Senator.",
      "SENATOR ALEX PADILLA: \u2026 but tremendous damage to our economy that that would create.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat from California, we thank you for your time this morning.",
      "And we'll be back right away with a lot more Face the Nation. I invite you to please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Be sure to tune in to CBS News on January 20 for full coverage of Donald Trump's inauguration here in Washington, D.C. You can watch live on CBS, on Paramount+, or on our CBS News app.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We will be right back with CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, and author H.W. Brands.",
      "Please stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We're joined now by CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger. She's in Southampton, New York, this morning.",
      "Jill, Senator Ted Cruz described tariffs and the threat thereof as leverage. But what I'm curious about economically is, do retailers view it as only leverage, do consumers view it only as leverage, or are they beginning to change their behavior in anticipation?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, let's just talk about whether or not they're going to change their behavior. We know that t here were some retailers who were sort of dangling this out around this holiday weekend, saying, oh, buy now because tariffs could make prices go up. I don't know what the motivation of most people is when they shop, but I'm not sure it's tariffs.",
      "What we do know about tariffs is, remember, this is a fee that is imposed on an imported good. The importing company, the U.S. company that takes that good in has to make a decision in that moment. And that company has to decide, are we going to eat it and maybe make less money this year, or are we going to pass it along to consumers. So, that is why consumers are a little unnerved by this, and businesses are as well, because they're not really sure whether they can pass that along and have consumers pay that additional price.",
      "What we know is, over the long term, in history, tariffs tend to increase the price of certain goods. It's not necessarily across the board. But, you know, it is hard coming off of what we've just come through in the last few years with this inflationary spike to imagine that consumers are just going to take it in stride. It is a real hard thing to imagine that any company or consumer is going to feel like they want to absorb higher prices at this point.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, there was a tariff story in the first Trump administration. Do you foresee a deeper and different tariff story potentially in Trump 2.0?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think there's two parts of that question, which is, we don't know what these tariffs are. And as Senator Cruz said, this is a negotiation. So, we don't know whether we're going to land in that negotiation. But a big difference between where we are today and where we were back in 2017 and 2018 is, during the early Trump administration, what we had was incredibly low inflation. That was after the financial crisis. For all those years, inflation or prices only grew by about less than 2 percent a year.",
      "Now, compare that with where we are now. We had inflation spike at a 40- year high of 9 percent in the summer of 2022. Yes, that inflation rate has come down, but prices are still about 22 percent, 23 percent higher than they were just four or five years ago. So, the big difference between the first Trump administration and the second Trump administration is prices are already high, and there are many Americans who are struggling.",
      "So, I think that that is the real fear among economists that I speak to. They're worried that this is going to cause a real anxiety among consumers, and that consumers might pull back at a time where they - actually, the economy's doing pretty well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Talking about the economy doing well. You crunch a lot of numbers, Jill, and always break them down so easily for our audience. When you look at the data, what's the best news you see and what's the most worrisome sign?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, the best news as - is that the labor market has grown really substantially and has kept up. So, I think that the labor market has been the driver of this economy. And it's been pretty consistent.",
      "The other part of the good news story is that the United States economy, more than any other developed nation, has come out of the Covid era and that post-Covid inflationary spike much stronger in a growth mode. So, we are seeing really good things from the labor market. We're seeing things in the economy. We're seeing that AI and technology is really in a boom period. These are all wonderful things.",
      "So, what's the downside here? I hate to be a kill joy, but why not, I play one on Sunday mornings. And what I can see is that these tariffs could cause a problem for a lot of consumers who are already struggling, and also this idea that we are going to see the extension of the tax cuts from the first Trump administration in the individual tax code. There is a fear among some investors that while we may not have a crisis right now when it comes to the debt and the deficit, that the extension of those tax cuts could start to really unnerve financial markets. Not happened yet, but those are the two worrisome things, the tariffs and the debt and deficit. I think those are the two looming things. And, of course, all the things we can't contemplate right now.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The three stock indexes have gone up pretty regularly since Election Day. Is that a methodical and well thought out reaction to an election or a kind of exuberance that may soon run its course?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Time will tell. I think that the initial investor reaction was a second Trump presidency would mean a drop in the tax rates - or the extension of the tax cuts and those tax rates would basically be in place for another four years. So, we'd have low taxes, which is good for especially the wealthier people out there. They love low taxes. And corporate taxes were already enshrined in the code. OK, so we have taxes staying low. That's a big factor when you come - when it comes to investing.",
      "The second part is the idea that a Trump administration would have a light regulatory touch. So, when you saw that first few trading - those first few trading days after the election, what went up a lot? The most highly regulated industries. So, that could be energy, that could be banking, that could be other areas where you could really need an industrial companies where you need a lot of regulatory prominence in the working of your business. Lighter regulatory touch will mean that those businesses will do well.",
      "OK, so is it exuberance or not? Who knows? I can only tell you that as someone who watches markets all the time, when everybody tells me that the sky is clear and the sun is shining and it's rainbows and unicorns, the only thing I can remember is what my father used to say is, well, no one ever rings a bell at the top or at the bottom. So, if you're an individual investor, don't count on everything being great. There's going to be a market slide. There is going to be a sell-off at some point. Don't count on everything being great all the time. Stick to your game plan and only change that game plan, not when the administration changes, but when your own life changes. That's it.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Breaking it down for us, as always, and beautifully so. Jill Schlesinger, thanks so very much.",
      "And we'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We' are joined now by President Biden's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. He is in New Castle, New Hampshire, this morning.",
      "Jake, good morning. It's good to see you.",
      "The Hamas video release of Edan Alexander, I know the administration regards it as a cruel propagandistic maneuver, but do you detect anything tactical at all in the timing of the release of this video, Jake?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN (President Biden's National Security Adviser): Well, Major, first, thanks for having me.",
      "And as far as this video, it is a cruel reminder of the barbarity and the brutality of Hamas, holding so many innocent people hostage, including Americans, including Edan. We were in touch with Edan's family yesterday. I'll be talking to the families of all of the American hostages, including Edan's family, this week.",
      "And I do think that Hamas is feeling the pressure. They're feeling the pressure because one of their main partners in crime here, Hezbollah, has now cut a ceasefire deal and they thought that Hezbollah would be with them until the end. They're feeling the pressure, of course, because their top leader, Sinwar, has been killed. So, they may be looking anew at the possibility of getting a ceasefire and hostage deal, and we are working actively with all of the key players in the region, including Israel and Turkey and Qatar and Egypt to try to bring that about.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The fate of the hostages, of course, on the administration's mind, on the minds of all Americans and all in the region. But also, Jake, I'm sure you saw over the last couple of days the video from Gaza of Palestinians surging to try to get a loaf of bread, in some cases crushing one another unintentionally. All suggestions are that the humanitarian situation there is - if it already isn't past crisis stage, near famine crisis stage.",
      "How much does that intensify the need to get this thing across, as you just said, the finish line?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: The humanitarian situation in Gaza is a crisis. You have too many people who are suffering from shortages of food, water, medicine, access to sanitation. Innocent people who deserve a measure of peace and deserve access to all of those life-saving supplies in abundance. The United States has been working, week in, week out, month in, month out, to open crossings, to move trucks, to insure that humanitarian aid gets in. And at critical moments, we have been able to intervene in ways that have staved off the worst case scenarios of famine. But it's constantly stocking (ph) Gaza. And so more needs to be done to get aid in.",
      "Now, part of the problem, as we've seen just in the last 24 hours, is not actually moving aid from outside Gaza into Gaza, but moving it around Gaza once it's inside. The U.N., in fact, said it was suspending movement from certain areas of Gaza because of concerns about looting. These are all things that would be helped if there were a ceasefire in place.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, is the probability of a ceasefire enhanced or undercut when someone such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham says, President- elect Trump wants a ceasefire before inauguration deal. Does that help you or hurt you?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I think the key actor right now holding the decision on the ceasefire is Hamas. And the key thing motivating Hamas is not American politics or the American presidential transition, it's their determination about whether or not it makes sense for them at this point, after Hezbollah has abandoned them, after their leader has been killed, after their military formations have been degraded to finally say yes to a ceasefire and hostage deal. That's going to be the telling thing more than anything that's said back here.",
      "But I will say this, there has been very good coordination between our team and the incoming team on all of the aspects of the crisis in the Middle East. We felt it was important that we be in touch with them, to keep them up to speed on what's happening, because this handoff has got to be smooth. And they, in turn, have reciprocated by being open and transparent and working with us. This is how it should be in a transition. This is what we're going to keep driving for, for every day that we have left in office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to have a conversation with you about leverage as regards to the Israeli government. I want to play for you something that Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said on this program a week ago.",
      "Let's listen.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Your response?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: First of all, I respect Senator Van Hollen. He knows these issues as well as any person in Washington, and he is passionate about them.",
      "But, of course, we have a different perspective. We have, at various points over the course of this conflict, made asks of the Israelis consistent with our values and our interests. Have we gotten everything we've asked for? No. Have we seen a change in Israeli behavior with respect to the movement of humanitarian assistance, with respect to how they conducted certain military operations, including in places like Rafah? Yes, we have.",
      "And so, we do believe that we've had a constructive engagement with the Israeli government and also been able to make a difference on the ground with respect to the flow of humanitarian aid.",
      "In addition, we worked closely with the Israeli government to bring about a ceasefire in Lebanon. A ceasefire people said wasn't possible until a new administration took office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to take - turn your attention to Ukraine, where the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared to indicate in a recent interview that he could possibly be open to a peace settlement in which Russia retains the territory it has. Ukraine, meaning Kyiv, keeps all the rest, if that is swiftly brought under the umbrella of NATO. Is that the outline or the contours of something you believe the administration believes could be workable?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Major, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I can't negotiate in public on your program, and I certainly can't negotiate on behalf of President Zelenskyy, who really should speak for himself when it comes to the destiny of his country. The future of Ukraine should be determined at the negotiating table by decisions of the Ukrainians, not imposed from the outside by the United States or anybody else.",
      "I will say, though, that we have been engaging with the Ukrainians over the course of this year on how you marry the support we provided them for use on the battlefield with a diplomatic strategy for the negotiating table.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And some recent decisions in the administration have been criticized by Republicans as setting the situation on fire, meaning ATACMS and anti-personnel mines. Those advocates for Ukraine say those decisions are way too late to change the battle space in any strategically important way. Where do you come down?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Anti-personnel land mines, which are nonpersistent mines that shut off after two weeks so they don't represent a long term threat to civilians, these could be helpful against the particular type of tactics that the Russian infantry is using right now in eastern Ukraine. So, he's sending them.",
      "The ATACMS permission into Russian territory, that was a decision he took after Russia escalated by introducing North Korean troops into this war, a foreign army into this war. So that was a responsible, coordinated step that we took with other allies to respond to that provocation, to that escalation by Russia.",
      "The president has been clear all along, we are going to give Ukraine the tools it needs. We are also going to do what we can to put them in the best possible position on the battlefield so they'll be in the best possible position at the negotiating table, and then this war will ultimately end in diplomacy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, thanks so much for your time.",
      "And we'll be right back with a lot more FACE THE NATION.",
      "Please, stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back.",
      "We turn now to author and historian H.W. Brands. He is the Jack S. Blanton senior chair at the University of Texas in Austin. And his latest book is \"America First: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War.\"",
      "He joins us this morning from Austin, Texas.",
      "H.W., it's great to see you.",
      "First of all, what does this America first clash then tell us if anything about today and references to America first?",
      "H.W. BRANDS (Author, \"America Frist: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War\"): The debate that I describe in the book is whether the United States should enter World War II. Between the time Germany started the war in September of 1939 and the United States entered the war in December of 1941, that was the narrow focus of the debate. The larger question and the one that persists today is, what do Americans think their country's role in the world ought to be? Should the United States, must the United States take a leading role in the world? Should the United States concern itself in conflicts among other nations that perhaps don't directly address American interests? This - this was the question then. It's a question we're dealing with again today.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: If you could, sketch out briefly Charles Lindbergh's stature at the time this debate with Franklin Delano Roosevelt was engaged.",
      "H.W. BRANDS: Lindbergh came to the attention of the American public, indeed to the world public, in 1927 when he flew a solo flight for the first time across the Atlantic Ocean. He became this national hero. He became a world celebrity for accomplishing this great technical feat, but it was also a feat of personal daring.",
      "He was a darling of the United States, a darling in other countries. He was decorated by foreign governments. He became an early celebrity in an age when celebrity was first starting to take form. So, that was his position as of 1927.",
      "His celebrity took a different turn in the early 1930s when his and his wife's infant son was kidnapped and murdered in what then was called the crime of the century, which gave rise to the trial of the century. And so, this golden boy, all of a sudden had a dark shadow cast across his life. And so he was, in some ways, this star-crossed hero at that point.",
      "He continued to be influential in aeronautical engineering circles. He knew a lot about aircraft. But in the American mind he was this - he was this great celebrity. And many people were surprised actually that he did take a leading role in the debate over American policy because he was not a political figure, he eschewed politics.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that debate with Roosevelt, did Roosevelt and his administration regard Charles Lindbergh as a potential political threat? And if so, how did they deal with it?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: It's a little bit hard to say. Franklin Roosevelt at some point decided that he wanted to run for a third term. This broke a long- standing, informal rule of American politics. And he knew that Republicans were constantly going up to Charles Lindbergh and saying, you could be president. You'd be a great candidate.",
      "Lindbergh's father had been a congressman, but Lindbergh took from his father's experience, which turned out badly because of his opposition to American policy during World War I, that he didn't want to have anything to do with politics or politicians. He considered politicians a bunch of liars, people who could not be trusted and he considered politics this low and sort of mean occupation that he wanted to have nothing to do with.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When this debate began in 1931, Lindbergh was in one place. When it ended in 1941, he was in a different place in the public mind. Some accused him of being a Nazi sympathizer. Some editorialist described him as an anti-Semite. Where do you come down?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The one thing I should say is that everybody who calls him an anti-Semite or a Nazi sympathizer, had political reasons for doing so because Lindbergh became the face of opposition to American intervention in the war. And it served his opponents' purposes to paint him in this negative category.",
      "In terms of his Nazi sympathy, he - there were American Nazis. There was an American Nazi party. They were clearly Nazi sympathizers. Lindbergh was not a member of the party. In fact, the America first committee, of which Lindbergh was a part, took pains to keep its distance from those. Lindbergh did not want Germany to win the war. His position was that the United States should not place its frontier of security in the middle of Europe the way Franklin Roosevelt and the interventionists appears to be doing.",
      "But because he took that position - and it was a position the Germans supported. The Germans didn't want the United States to enter the war. There was this objective sense in which one could say that when Lindbergh gave a speech, it served the purposes of the German government.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How about his appraisal of American Jews wanted to push America into the war and then exercising outsized influence culturally in our country?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: So, the charges of anti-Semitism against Lindbergh really are associated with a single speech he gave in the autumn of 1941, in which he identified three groups that in his opinion were most influential in pushing the United States toward war. One was the British government. Britain was already at war, and he explained it was natural that they would try to get the United States involved in the war. The second group he said was American Jews. And he said, it's perfectly understandable that they should want the United States to get into the war given what Hitler and the Nazis have done to their relatives, friends, co-religionists in Europe. And the third group was the Roosevelt administration. He was most critical of the Roosevelt administration because Lindbergh claimed that Roosevelt was using the excuse of the war to further his own political ambitions.",
      "Now, merely for mentioning American Jews in the context of war policy, the sky fell down upon Lindbergh. Everybody who wanted to make sure that they weren't accused of anti-Semitism, everybody who opposed Lindbergh's policy came down and pointed the finger of anti-Semitism at Lindbergh.",
      "To what extent was Lindbergh actually an anti-Semite? Well, I would - I would - I would - I would put him in the category of the sort of not in my country club kind of anti-Semite, which was extremely common in the United States at the time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, H.W., there's a clash over information and disinformation. Both sides warn each other and the American public about that. Unspool that for us, if you could, real quick.",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The British government and the germane government, the two antagonists in the war at that point, were both engaged in propaganda campaigns in the United States. And so, when the British government would plant editorials, features in American newspapers, often unknown to the reading public, then Lindbergh and his side would say, well, look what the British government is doing. When the German government would do something similar, then the Roosevelt administration would say, look at what the German government is doing. So, each side then, the governments of the two sides, they were doing their best to sway American public opinion because they realized that in the end it was American public opinion that had to be persuaded.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: H.W. - foreign interference in American public opinion then and now.",
      "H.W. Brands, it's been a pleasure. Thank you so much.",
      "And we'll be right back.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We turn now to Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, who joins us this morning from Houston. Senator, it's good to see you. Good morning to you. Let's pick up this thread on tariffs. I remember covering your presidential campaign in 2016 and you were a skeptic of tariffs. Then I know the politics around tariffs have changed, President-elect Trump has done that, but have the economics changed?",
      "SEN. TED CRUZ: Well, I'll tell you, what hasn't changed is, is the importance of leverage. And I got to say, you look at the threat of tariffs against Mexico and Canada, immediately has produced action. We've seen the President of Mexico stand up and promise that she is going to work hand in hand with the President of the United States, President Trump, to secure the border. I'll tell you, representing Texas, we've seen four years of an invasion at our southern border. Let me ask you, Major. Why hasn't Joe Biden done this? Why hasn't Joe Biden actually stood up and used leverage to secure the border? And the reason is, Joe Biden and the Democrats wanted this invasion to happen. And I got to say, this is a promise that I believe President Trump is going to deliver on and deliver quickly. We are going to secure the border. This is about using leverage to get Mexico and Canada to cooperate. And I'll tell you Major I think one of the very first bills we're going to take up in the Senate, vote on, and I hope pass, is my legislation, the Justice for Jocelyn Act, that is a response to the horrific rape and murder of Jocelyn Nungaray, 12-year-old girl in Houston, Texas, killed by violent criminal illegal aliens released by Joe Biden and the Democrats. This is a promise the President needs to deliver on and I think he's going to.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: So when you think about tariffs and President-elect Trump, you don't take them seriously as an economic matter. You take them seriously only as a diplomatic lever.",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Well, look, I think the President was explicit with Mexico and Canada. He said he will impose these tariffs unless they secure the border. It was explicitly leveraged. And by the way, that is the same way that President Trump negotiated the Remain in Mexico agreement. If you remember, during his first term, President Trump threatened tariffs against Mexico and AMLO, then the President of Mexico. He was incredibly scared and concerned. He was scared of Trump, and he ended up signing the remain in Mexico agreement, which produced the lowest rate of illegal immigration in 45 years. It was incredibly successful. What did Joe Biden the Democrats do when they came in? The very first week in office, they ripped up that incredibly successful international agreement. I expect we will once again enter into remain in Mexico, and we are going to see, I make a prediction right now, we will see the numbers plummet of illegal immigration coming into this country, not in a year, not in six months, but in January and February, because we will have a president who will vigorously enforce the law.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: On that point. Senator Cruz, you would concede, in the last three or four months, numbers have gone down already, have they not?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: They have ticked down slightly. We have still seen over these four years the highest rate of illegal immigration in our nation's history. 12 million illegal immigrants have come into this country. And I got to say, in a state like Texas, you want to see the consequences. This last election was an incredible landslide for President Trump. He won all seven of the swing states. And in Texas, President Trump won Hispanic voters in Texas, I won Hispanic voters in Texas, I won statewide by a million votes, nine points. And South Texas, the Rio Grande Valley, has literally spent over 100 years as a bright blue Democrat Bastion. This cycle, South Texas flipped Republican. And it is amazing what having 12 million people invade your home can do to change people's voting behavior. I think the President has a mandate to deliver on securing the border, and I look forward to working hand in hand with him to deliver on that promise.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Kash Patel suggested by President Trump as the new leader of the FBI. How enthusiastic are you about that?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Listen, I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee. I think the entire slate of Cabinet nominees President Trump has put forward is very strong. I believe every one of these Cabinet nominees is going to be confirmed by the Senate. I think Kash Patel is going to be confirmed by the Senate. You look at his background, he has a serious professional background. He was a prosecutor, he was a public defender. He was a senior intelligence staffer on Capitol Hill. He was a senior intelligence staffer in the White House. He was the Chief of Staff of the Department of Defense. He was the deputy director of national intelligence. And I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI. The FBI and the Department of Justice are two institutions incredibly important to the rule of law in the United States. I revere both. And one of the most tragic consequences of four years of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is both the DOJ and the FBI have been politicized and weaponized, and I think Kash Patel is a very strong nominee to take on the partisan corruption in the FBI.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: As you know, Senator, there isn't a vacancy at the top of the FBI. What should become of Christopher Wray, appointed by President Trump?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Well, I think he'll make a choice. I think either he will resign or President Trump will fire him. But it's no secret to anybody, including Chris Wray, that he is not going to continue to serve as the head of the FBI under Donald Trump. Listen, if you look at James Comey and Chris Wray, there has never been a period in our nation's history where the FBI has suffered a greater loss of respect, where more Americans doubt the fundamental integrity of the FBI, and it's because James Comey and Chris Wray presided over allowing the FBI to become a partisan cudgel to be used to target parents at school board meetings, to be used to target people who chose not to take the COVID vaccine, to be used to target President Trump and to target the political opponents of Joe Biden the White House. It is tragic. That is not what the FBI is for. That is not what the DOJ is for. And I got to say Pam Bondi and Kash Patel, I think together, are a very strong slate of nominees to go and restore integrity to both institutions.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How do you place that up against the prosecutions of Bob Menendez, a congressman, a Democrat from Texas, Hunter Biden. Are those political prosecutions as well or not?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Well, first of all, let's be clear, Bob Menendez was- was literally caught with gold bars and a stack of cash with his fingerprints taking bribes, and it's why Bob Menendez is not my colleague anymore. At that point, the evidence was overwhelming. Look Major, I wrote an entire book entitled \"Justice Corrupted: How the Left Has Weaponized the Legal System\", and it broke down- it started sadly under Barack Obama, where he began using the federal government to target his political opponents. The book details how many of those partisans then burrowed in to senior career positions during the Trump administration. They waged war against President Trump during his first term, and now under Joe Biden, they have been open and brazen, and I think it has done unbelievable damage to the integrity of the Department of Justice and the FBI. I think Merrick Garland will go down in history as the most partisan Attorney General our nation has ever seen. And I got to say, I hear regularly from- from prosecutors, from FBI agents, who are deeply dismayed about the institution they devoted a lifetime working for because- listen, I don't want a Republican Department of Justice. I don't want a Democrat Department of Justice. I want a Department of Justice and an FBI that enforces the law regardless of party. And sadly, we haven't seen that these last four years.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: What can you tell us about the three Americans released by China who are in San Antonio. Have you been in touch with them? And do you have any concerns about the contours of that swap?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: Well, at this stage, we don't know all of the details of the contours of the swap, but I'll tell you, I am celebrating the return of three Americans, especially Mark Swidan. Mark Swidan is a Texan from Houston. His mom, Katherine, is from Luling, Texas. I've talked with Katherine many times. I authored and passed a resolution in the Senate that passed unanimously calling for Mark Swidan's return to America. He spent 12 years unjustly imprisoned in communist China. I'll tell you, I have raised it directly with the foreign minister of China. I've raised it with President Biden. I've raised it with Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, and I will give them credit on this. Tony Blinken, just two weeks ago was the most recent time I spoke with him about Mark Swidan, and the administration has pressed the Chinese government and Mark Sweden is back home with his mother, who has prayed for him, who has loved- loved him. I want to say, Mark, welcome home. Katherine, congratulations. I told you this day would come. This is a time where all Texans and all Americans should be celebrating.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, Senator Cruz. Because I also know you care about the case of Austin Tice. Do you have any sense that the rebel gains in Syria of the recent vintage will have any chance of unlocking Austin Tice's freedom?",
      "SEN. CRUZ: I don't know. I certainly hope and pray Austin Tice needs to come home, and I hope and pray. Listen, there's a combination of two things working. One, as Joe Biden is in the process of transitioning out any- any outgoing President is looking to try to get some final wins, I would encourage him, and I'm sure he is doing everything he can to bring Austin Tice home, to bring the hostages in Gaza home, both the Israelis and the Americans bring them home in this window. I also think President Trump coming into office on January 20, the enemies of America, I think, are afraid of President Trump. That is a moment- I hope we have a moment right now that is very much like the end of the Jimmy Carter Administration right before Ronald Reagan came in. And we saw on January 20, our hostages in Iran released, I think, in significant part because the Ayatollah was afraid of Reagan. I hope a similar dynamic is playing out, and if we can see more hostages come home, that would be cause for enormous celebration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, thank you. Good morning. We'll be back with Face the Nation in just one moment. Please stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: We are joined now by President Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. He is in Newcastle, New Hampshire this morning. Jake, good morning. It's good to see you. The Hamas video release of Edan Alexander, I know the administration regards it as a cruel propagandistic maneuver, but do you detect anything tactical at all in the timing of the release of this video, Jake?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well Major, first, thanks for having me. And as far as this video, it is a cruel reminder of the barbarity and the brutality of Hamas holding so many innocent people hostage, including Americans, including Edan. We were in touch with Edan's family yesterday. I'll be talking to the families of all of the American hostages, including Edan's family this week. And I do think that Hamas is feeling the pressure. They're feeling the pressure because one of their main partners in crime here, Hezbollah, has now cut a ceasefire deal, and they thought that Hezbollah would be with them till the end. They're feeling the pressure, of course, because their top leader, Sinwar, has been killed. So, they may be looking anew at the possibility of getting a ceasefire and hostage deal. And we are working actively with all of the key players in the region, including Israel and Turkey and Qatar and Egypt, to try to bring that about. In the coming days, conversations will be happening, even this very day, to try to make that happen as soon as possible.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, it has been reported that the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a conversation with Edan's family, said, quote, conditions are ripe, unquote, for a hostage deal. How do you assess that?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, we have been working closely with the Israelis since President Biden went out into the Rose Garden and announced the ceasefire with- across the border between Israel and Lebanon, and what President Biden said was this opens a real opportunity to get that ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. He also spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu that day, and Prime Minister Netanyahu told him he agreed, the time is right. The moment is now. Let's drive to get it done. And now, if the world can come together to increase the pressure on Hamas, we can finally break through, get a deal in place, get a ceasefire, get a surge of humanitarian assistance, and crucially, get those hostages, including those Americans, home safely to their families.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And what have the weekend talks in Egypt told you about the prospects for that?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look you can never really tell about whether you're going to get across the finish line until you do, even if you get down to the 5,4,3,2,1, yard line. Punching it in, getting the deal, finally getting it done, that requires the ultimate breakthrough. So I can't predict whether it's going to happen. What I can say is, there has been progress. There have been steps forward. There is a renewed sense that this is possible, but we've been here before Major where we thought we were close, it didn't pan out. And so I'm not going to get ahead of myself or make any predictions or provide false hope. What I will say is, we're driving at this with everything we've got. We think we have a chance, but we won't rest until we get it done.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The fate of the hostages, of course, on the administration's mind, on the minds of all Americans and all in the region, but also Jake, I'm sure you saw over the last couple of days the video from Gaza of Palestinians surging to try to get a loaf of bread, in some cases, crushing one another unintentionally. All suggestions are that the humanitarian situation there is- \u00a0if it already isn't past crisis stage, near famine crisis stage. How much does that intensify the need to get this thing across, as you just said, the finish line?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: The humanitarian situation in Gaza is a crisis. You have too many people who are suffering from shortages of food, water, medicine, access to sanitation. Innocent people who deserve a measure of peace and deserve access to all of those life saving supplies in abundance. The United States has been working week in, week out, month in, month out, to open crossings, to move trucks, to ensure that humanitarian aid gets in. And at critical moments, we have been able to intervene in ways that have staved off the worst case scenarios of famine. But it's constantly stalking Gaza, and so more needs to be done to get aid in. Now, part of the problem, as we've seen just in the last 24 hours, is not actually moving aid from outside Gaza into Gaza, but moving it around Gaza once it's inside. The UN, in fact, said it was suspending movement from certain areas of Gaza because of concerns about looting. These are all things that would be helped if there were a ceasefire in place. Because with a ceasefire, with calm in Gaza, it becomes that much more straightforward to move the aid around the strip so that it can get to people, including to people who are currently in areas that are experiencing very heavy conflict. So one of the key things that we would like to achieve in this cease fire deal is the surge of humanitarian aid to go along with the release of the hostages.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake is the probability of a ceasefire enhanced or undercut when someone such as South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham says, President elect Trump wants a cease fire before inauguration deal. Does that help you or hurt you?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I think the key actor right now holding the decision on the cease fire is Hamas. And the key thing motivating Hamas is not American politics or the American presidential transition, it's their determination about whether or not it makes sense for them at this point, after Hezbollah has abandoned them, after their leader has been killed, after their military formations have been degraded, to finally say yes to a ceasefire and hostage deal. That's going to be the telling thing, more than anything that's said back here. But I will say this, there has been very good coordination between our team and the incoming team on all of the aspects of the crisis in the Middle East. We felt it was important that we be in touch with them, to keep them up to speed on what's happening, because this handoff has got to be smooth, and they, in turn, have reciprocated by being open and transparent and working with us. This is how it should be in a transition. This is what we're going to keep driving for for every day that we have left in office.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to have a conversation with you about leverage as regards the Israeli government. I want to play for you something that Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen said on this program a week ago. Let's listen.",
      "[SEN. VAN HOLLEN SOT]",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: We've seen this pattern where President Biden makes demands of Prime Minister Netanyahu, only to be ignored or slapped down entirely. And then President Biden sends more bombs and more money. That is not an effective use of leverage.",
      "[END SOT]",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Your response?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: First of all, I respect Senator Van Hollen. He knows these issues as well as any person in Washington, and he is passionate about them. But of course, we have a different perspective. We have, at various points over the course of this conflict, made asks of the Israelis consistent with our values and our interests. Have we gotten everything we asked for? No. Have we seen a change in Israeli behavior, with respect to the movement of humanitarian assistance, with respect to how they conducted certain military operations, including in places like Rafah? Yes, we have. And so we do believe that we've had a constructive engagement with the Israeli government and also been able to make a difference on the ground with respect to the flow of humanitarian aid. In addition, we worked closely with the Israeli government to bring about a ceasefire in Lebanon, a ceasefire people said wasn't possible until a new administration took office. And in fact, the fact that we were able to do that says a lot about our ability to work with the Israeli government to generate an outcome, including one that has many political detractors inside the Israeli system. So we'll keep at it every single day. I respect voices like Senator Van Hollen. I look forward to continuing to work with him. But of course, we see things a different way.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jake, I want to turn your attention to Ukraine, where the Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelenskyy appeared to indicate in a recent interview that he could possibly be open to a peace settlement in which Russia retains the territory it has. Ukraine, meaning Kyiv keeps all the rest, if that is swiftly brought under the umbrella of NATO. Is that the outline or the contours of something you believe- the administration believes could be workable?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Major, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I can't negotiate in public on your program, and I certainly can't negotiate on behalf of President Zelensky, who really should speak for himself when it comes to the destiny of his country. The future of Ukraine should be determined at the negotiating table by decisions of the Ukrainians not imposed from the outside by the United States or anybody else. I will say though, that we have been engaging with Ukrainians over the course of this year on how you marry the support we provided them for use on the battlefield with a diplomatic strategy for the negotiating table. And we've been driving towards that before the election, we continue to drive at it, and ultimately, the new team will have to work with President Zelensky to determine the diplomatic way forward.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And some recent decisions in the administration have been criticized by Republicans as setting the situation on fire, meaning ATACMS and anti-personnel mines. Those advocates for Ukraine say those decisions are way too late to change the battle space in any strategically important way. Where do you come down?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look what President Biden has done at critical moments in the conflict, is try to provide Ukraine with the tools that it needs to succeed. Anti-personnel land mines, which are non persistent mines that shut off after two weeks, so they don't represent a long term threat to civilians. These could be helpful against the particular type of tactics that the Russian infantry is using right now in eastern Ukraine. So he's sending them. The ATACMS permission into Russian territory. That was a decision he took after Russia escalated by introducing North Korean troops into this war, a foreign army into this war. So that was a responsible, coordinated step that we took with other allies to respond to that provocation, to that escalation by Russia. The President has been clear all along. We are going to give Ukraine the tools it needs. We are also going to do what we can to put them in the best possible position on the battlefield, so they'll be in the best possible position at the negotiating table, and then that this war will ultimately end in diplomacy.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan. Thanks so much for your time.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Thank you.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And we'll be right back with a lot more \"Face the Nation.\" Please stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Alex Padilla, Democrat of California, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to California Democratic Senator Alex Padilla. He joins us this morning from Porter Ranch, California. Senator, good to see you. Let's start with Kash Patel. Your reaction to that nomination, or that suggested nomination from President-elect Trump?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Well, good morning. Great to be with you. And look the this announcement that Kash Patel is going to be nominated for a high ranking position at the FBI, very key to the Department of Justice. Raises a lot of the same questions that other announcements and other nominations raise, are they going to go in there and do the job of- that the Department of Justice calls for to truly, truly be independent of the President of the United States? Or is he going either to do Trump's bidding? That's the big question here. Is it a genuine, legitimate appointment? Or a political appointment to politicize the Bureau and the Department in Trump's in- Trump's favor? That's just the beginning of the questions that we expect to raise in the car in the confirmation hearings that will begin in January.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Do you expect that the current FBI director who has three years remaining will just have to resign?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Well that's going to be a personal decision for Director Wray who, like the public should remember, both a Trump appointee to begin with. And so he's got three years left. It's up to him to resign or not. Your prior guest suggested that Trump may very well fire him, which is just par for the course. Anybody who recalls the first Trump administration recalls a whole lot of cabinet officials being named, being confirmed, and being sold as the greatest thing since sliced bread. And as soon as they lose favor with Trump, as soon as they don't do 100% of what he's demanding all of a sudden, you know, they're fired a lot of times by social media posts. And so who knows what Donald Trump is going to decide to do, whether it's with Director Wray, Kash Patel or any of his other nominees this coming term.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: During the first Trump administration, California fashioned itself the resistance state. Some Democrats in the legislature have already begun to describe that as a cliche and say they don't even know what that means anymore. What does it mean?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Look, I think there's a lot of reason for concern of the second Trump administration, if the first administration is any indicator. I think as the governor, as other legislative leaders and even the congressional delegation have said, if- if you know, the federal government will continue to support California in its leadership in so many policy areas, there's a lot of good work to be done there. But Donald Trump has made it no secret that he has it in for California, whether it's the withholding of disaster funds. I mean, a lot of FEMA dollars that Donald Trump tried to keep from not the state government of California, but from California families, simply because it's a state that did not vote for him in the presidential election. We're trying to inoculate ourselves from those types of threats. There's also a lot of good that can be finalized before the end of the Biden administration, whether it's Environmental Protection Agency waivers that will allow California to continue to grow our economy while tackling climate change aggressively. Waivers at Health and Human Services that would give California a little bit of flexibility with our Medicare dollars to be able to also treat behavioral health issues, mental health issues of Californians, because when we know that treating the whole body is good for both physical and mental health. we're trying to make sure those waivers\u2013",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: \u2013Where do those waivers\u2013",
      "SEN. PADILLA: \u2013are locked in before the end of the Biden administration.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Where do you stand with the Biden administration on that, Senator? Are they going to be responsive?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: They've been very encouraging that the technical work can and should be done before the end of the term, but we'll note when there's signatures on the documents that we need. But again, these are just examples we want to lock into place before President Trump comes into office, and then can use it, either as a threat, as a punishment, or, as Senator Cruz mentioned in the prior segment, simply leverage to get other things he would want out of California.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: You know, President elect Trump has promised mass deportations. You also know, in California, there is a state law that tells local law enforcement not to participate and cooperate with ICE agents in deportation or identification processes. The incoming Trump administration border czar, Tom Homan, has said any law enforcement who don't cooperate will be prosecuted under federal law. How is this going to be resolved?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Yeah, well, I think there's an important distinction here. No state government, not Texas, not California, not any state in the nation has a constitutional authority to impose federal immigration law that is the responsibility of the Federal Government. Some states like Texas want to push the envelope and try to find a way to assist, but there's no obligation to do so, and that's what California leaders and municipal leaders throughout the state are saying. You know, we're not going to utilize state and local resources to do the federal government's job for them. Number one, I think there's a long history of this being smart public safety policy as well. California is the most populous state in the nation, the most diverse state in the nation, home to more immigrants than any state in the nation, and the last thing you want to do is have immigrants who are victims of crime afraid to come forward to report that crime. The last thing you want is immigrants who may be witnesses to crime to be afraid to come forward and share any information that they have in the investigation and prosecution of crimes. That's what we're talking about here. Let the federal government do the federal government's job, but have state and local officials do the state and local officials job. There doesn't have to be a conflict unless that's what Trump wants.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The governor has called a special session that will convene this week to set aside money to battle the Trump administration. Will some of that money also be set aside to protect migrants and undocumented immigrants in California as they seek either legal advice or continued legal financial backing to support their efforts to stay within California and the United States?",
      "SEN. PADILLA: Again, if the first Trump administration is any indicator, we know that there will continue to be a lot of fear in communities and communities that deserve to know what their rights are and what their rights are not. And so if it's legal assistance, legal advice, legal support, that's just the California way. We embrace our diversity, our diversity has made our communities thrive and our economy thrive. And so we will assist families against the threats of the Trump administration, if we wanted to sort of cut to the chase. You know, we're hearing a lot of bombas- from Trump and his allies about the biggest deportation operation in our country's history, on the one hand, versus a- maybe a focus on violent criminals on the other. Nobody- nobody disagrees with a focus on violent criminals. Democrats, Republicans agree, but that's very different than millions and millions of people being deported indiscriminately, not just tearing families apart, tearing communities apart, but tremendous damage to our economy that that would create.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Senator Alex Padilla, Democrat from California, we thank you for your time this morning, and we'll be back right away a lot more Face the Nation. I invite you to please stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with H.W. Brands, Jack S. Blanton Sr. Chair in History at the University of Texas at Austin and author of \"America First: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War,\" on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back. We turn now to author and historian H.W. Brands. He is the Jack S. Blanton Sr. Chair at the University of Texas at Austin, and his latest book is \"America First: Roosevelt vs. Lindbergh in the Shadow of War.\" He joins us this morning from Austin, Texas. H.W., it's great to see you. First of all, what does this \"America First\" clash then tell us, if anything, about today and references to \"America first\"?",
      "H.W. BRANDS: The debate that I describe in the book is whether the United States should enter World War II between the time Germany started the war in September of 1939 and the United States entered the war in December of 1941. That was the narrow focus of the debate. The larger question, and the one that persists today, is, what do Americans think their country's role in the world ought to be? Should the United States, must the United States, take a leading role in the world? Should the United States concern itself in conflicts among other nations that perhaps don't directly address American interests? This- this was the question then, it's a question we're dealing with again today.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: If you could, sketch out briefly Charles Lindbergh's stature at the time this debate with Franklin Delano Roosevelt was engaged.",
      "BRANDS: Lindbergh came to the attention of the American public, indeed, to the world public, in 1927 when he flew a solo flight for the first time across the Atlantic Ocean. He became this national hero. He became a world celebrity for accomplishing this great technical feat, but it was also a feat of personal daring. He was a darling of the United States, a darling in other countries. He was decorated by foreign governments. He became an early celebrity in an age when celebrity was first starting to take form. So that was his position as of 1927. His celebrity took a different turn in the early 1930s when his and his wife's infant son was kidnapped and murdered in what then was called the \"crime of the century,\" which gave raise- which gave rise to the \"trial of the century.\" And so this golden boy, all of a sudden, had a dark shadow cast across his life. And so he was, in some ways, this star crossed hero, at that point. He continued to be influential in aeronautical engineering circles. He knew a lot about aircraft, but in the American mind, he was this- he was this great celebrity. And many people were surprised, actually, that he did take a leading role in the debate over American policy, because he was not a political figure. He eschewed politics.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: And in that debate with Roosevelt, did Roosevelt and his administration regard Charles Lindbergh as a potential political threat? And if so, how did they deal with him?",
      "BRANDS: It's a little bit hard to say. Franklin Roosevelt, at some point, decided that he wanted to run for a third term. This broke a long standing informal rule of American politics. And he knew that Republicans were constantly going up to Charles Lindbergh and saying, you could be president, you'd be a great candidate. Lindbergh's father had been a congressman, but Lindbergh took from his father's experience, which- which turned out badly because of his opposition to American policy during World War I, that he didn't want to have anything to do with politics or politicians. He considered politicians a bunch of liars, people who could not be trusted, and he considered politics this low and sort of mean occupation that he wanted to have nothing to do with.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: When this debate began in 1931, Lindbergh was in one place. When it ended in 1941, he was in a different place in the public mind. Some accused him of being a Nazi sympathizer. Some editorialists described him as an antisemite. Where do you come down?",
      "BRANDS: The one thing I should say is that everybody who called him an antisemite or a Nazi sympathizer had political reasons for doing so, because Lindbergh became the face of opposition to American intervention in the war. And it served his opponents' purposes to paint him in this negative category. In terms of his Nazi sympathy, he- there were American Nazis. There was an American Nazi Party. They were clearly Nazi sympathizers. Lindbergh was not a member of the party. In fact, the America First Committee, of which Lindbergh was a part, took pains to keep its distance from those. Lindbergh did not want Germany to win the war. His position was that the United States should not place its frontier of security in the middle of Europe,the way Franklin Roosevelt and the interventions appeared to be doing. But because he took that position, and it was a position that the Germans supported, the Germans didn't want the United States to enter the war. There was this objective sense in which one could say that when Lindbergh gave a speech, it served the purposes of the German government.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: How about his appraisal of American Jews wanting to push America into the war and then exercising outsized influence culturally in our country?",
      "BRANDS: So, the charges of antisemitism against Lindbergh really are associated with a single speech he gave in the autumn of 1941, in which he identified three groups that, in his opinion, were most influential in pushing the United States toward war. One was the British government. Britain was already at war, and he explained it was natural that they would try to get the United States involved in the war. The second group, he said, was American Jews, and he said it's perfectly understandable that they should want the United States to get into the war, given what Hitler and the Nazis have done to their relatives, friends, co-religionists in Europe. And the third group was the Roosevelt administration. He was most critical of the Roosevelt administration because Lindbergh claimed that Roosevelt was using the excuse of the war to further his own political ambitions. Now, merely for mentioning American Jews in the context of war policy, the sky fell down upon Lindbergh. Everybody who wanted to make sure that they weren't accused of antisemitism, everybody who opposed Lindbergh's policy, came down and pointed the finger of antisemitism at Lindbergh. To what extent was Lindbergh actually an antisemite? Well, I would say- I would- I put him in the category of the sort of, not in my country club, kind of antisemite, which was extremely common in the United States at the time.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Very quickly, H.W., there's a clash over information and disinformation, both sides warn each other and the American public about that. Unspool that for us, if you could, real quick.",
      "BRANDS: The British government and the German government, the two antagonists that were at that point, were both engaged in propaganda campaigns in the United States. And so when the British government would plant editorials, features, in American newspapers, often unknown to the reading public, then Lindbergh and his side would say, well, look what the British government is doing. When the German government would do something similar, then the Roosevelt administration would say, look at what the German government is doing. So each side then, the governments of the two sides, they were doing their best to sway American public opinion, because they realized that, in the end, it was American public opinion that had to be persuaded.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Foreign interference in American public opinion, then and now. H.W. Brands, it's been a pleasure. Thank you so much. And we'll be right back"

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We're joined now by CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger. She's in Southampton, New York this morning. Jill, Senator Ted Cruz described tariffs and the threat thereof as leverage, but what I'm curious about economically is do retailers view it as only leverage? Do consumers view it only as leverage? Are they beginning to change their behavior in anticipation?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, let's just talk about whether or not they're going to change their behavior. We know that there were some retailers who were sort of dangling this out around this holiday weekend, saying, Oh, buy now because tariffs could make prices go up. I don't know what the motivation of most people is when they shop, but I'm not sure it's tariffs. What we do know about tariffs is, remember, this is a fee that is imposed on an imported good. The importing company, the U.S. company that takes that good in, has to make a decision in that moment, and that company has to decide, are we going to eat it and maybe make less money this year, or are we going to pass it along to consumers? So that is why consumers are a little unnerved by this and businesses are as well, because they're not really sure whether they can pass that along and have consumers pay that additional price. What we know is over the long term in history, tariffs tend to increase the price of certain goods. It's not necessarily across the board, but, you know, it is hard coming off of what we've just come through in the last few years with this inflationary spike to imagine that consumers are just going to take it in stride. It is a real hard thing to imagine that any company or consumer is going to feel like they want to absorb higher prices at this point.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Jill, there was a tariff story in the first Trump administration. Do you foresee a deeper and different tariff story potentially in Trump 2.0?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, I think there's two parts of that question, which is, we don't know what these tariffs are. And as Senator Cruz said, this is a negotiation, so we don't know where we're going to land in that negotiation. But a big difference between where we are today and where we were back in 2017 and 2018 is during the- the early Trump administration, what we had was incredibly low inflation. That was after the financial crisis. For all those years, inflation or prices, only grew by about less than 2% a year. Now, compare that with where we are now. We had inflation spike at a 40-year-high of 9% in the summer of 2022. Yes, that inflation rate has come down, but prices are still about 22, 23% higher than they were just four or five years ago. So the big difference between the first Trump administration and the second Trump administration is prices are already high and there are many Americans who are struggling. So, I think that that is the real fear among economists that I speak to. They're worried that this is going to cause a real anxiety among consumers, and that consumers might pull back at a time where they- actually, the economy is doing pretty well.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Talking about the economy doing well, you crunch a lot of numbers for us, Jill, and always break them down so easily for our audience, when you look at the data, what's the best news you see and what's the most worrisome sign?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Well, the best news as- is that the labor market has grown really substantially and has kept up. So I think that the labor market has been the driver of this economy, and it's been pretty consistent. The other part of the good news story is that the United States economy, more than any other developed nation, has come out of the COVID era, and that post-COVID inflationary spike much stronger, in a growth mode. So we are seeing really good things from the labor market. We're seeing things in the economy. We're seeing that AI and technology is really in a boom period. These are all wonderful things. So what's the downside here? I hate to be a killjoy, but why not? I play one on Sunday mornings, and what I can see is that these tariffs could cause a problem for a lot of consumers who are already struggling, and also this idea that we are going to see the extension of the tax cuts from the first Trump administration in the individual tax code, there is a fear among some investors that, while we may not have a crisis right now when it comes to the debt and the deficit, that the extension of those tax cuts could start to really unnerve financial markets. Not happened yet, but those are the two worrisome thing:, the tariffs and the debt and the deficit. I think those are the two looming things and of course, all the things we can't contemplate right now.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: The three stock indexes have gone up pretty regularly since Election Day. Is that a methodical and well thought out reaction to an election or a kind of exuberance that may soon run its course?",
      "JILL SCHLESINGER: Time will tell. I think that the initial investor reaction was a second Trump presidency would mean a drop in the tax rates or the extension of the tax cuts, and those tax rates would basically be in- in place for another four years. So we'd have low taxes, which is good for especially the wealthier people out there. They love low taxes, and corporate taxes were already enshrined in the code. Okay, so we have taxes staying low. That's a big factor when you come- when it comes to investing. The second part is the idea that a Trump administration would have a light regulatory touch so when you saw that first few trading- those first few trading days after the election, what went up a lot? The most highly regulated industries. So that could be energy, that could be banking, that could be other areas where you could really need- industrial companies, where you need a lot of regulatory prominence in the working of your business. Lighter regulatory touch will mean that those businesses will do well. Okay, so is it exuberance or not? Who knows? I can only tell you that as someone who watches markets all the time, when everybody tells me that the sky is clear and the sun is shining and it's rainbows and unicorns, the only thing I can remember is what my father used to say is, well, no one ever rings a bell at the top or at the bottom. So if you're an individual investor, don't count on everything being great. There's going to be a market slide. There is going to be a sell-off at some point. Don't count it- on everything being great all the time. Stick to your game plan and only change that game plan, not when the administration changes, but when your own life changes. That's it.",
      "MAJOR GARRETT: Breaking it down for us as always and beautifully so. Jill Schlesinger, thanks so very much. And we'll be right back."

      "President Biden will travel to Angola this week, becoming the first sitting president to do so and following through on a yearslong pledge to visit sub-Saharan Africa while in office, as his presidency nears the end.",
      "Mr. Biden's trip marks the first president to visit the region since 2015, and comes as he has long planned to make the trip to discuss economic partnerships and the vision for Africa's first transcontinental open-access rail network, among other issues.",
      "The president, who departs for the trip on Sunday night, had pledged to visit the African continent in 2023 before earlier this year saying he would visit after he was reelected. But the visit was thrown into question when he dropped out of the presidential race, before a trip in October was announced. Mr. Biden then\u00a0postponed that trip\u00a0to oversee the domestic response to Hurricanes Milton and Helene.",
      "This week, the president is set to meet with Angola President Joao Lourenco and deliver remarks. Mr. Biden is expected to discuss infrastructure and economic opportunities with leaders, while highlighting the investments in Angola and Africa more broadly, according to senior administration officials previewing the trip.",
      "The president is expected to announce among a number of things that the U.S. government will have closed 12 deals in Angola by the time he departs the White House, with a combined value of $6.9 billion. He'll also outline a new global health security partnership aimed at responding to infectious diseases, while touting U.S. investments aimed at increasing food access and storage. And the president is expected to support the nomination of Angola's Kwanza Corridor as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the officials said.",
      "During the three-day visit, the president will also tout an infrastructure and rail project with heavy U.S. investment known as the Lobito Corridor, which aims to increase the speed of transport of critical minerals used for electric vehicles and AI data centers, along with drastically speeding up shipment times for food deliveries and helping to alleviate food insecurity in Africa.",
      "The visit comes as China and Russia have made inroads in the region with infrastructure investments, adding to U.S.' urgency surrounding making investments on the continent.",
      "Mr. Biden's trip also comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, spurring questions about the longevity of Mr. Biden's achievements. But the Biden administration officials noted that U.S.-Africa policy has enjoyed bipartisan support in recent administrations, and said they expect the next administration to continue building on the policy.",
      "The president also pledged when he took office to mend relationships around the world, after Trump's first term.

In 2022, Mr. Biden hosted the Africa Leaders Summit, and since then, the administration officials said more than 20 Cabinet and other senior leaders have also traveled to the continent.",

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:53:47 -0500",
    "summary": "To do so, current FBI Director Chris Wray would have to voluntarily vacate the position or be fired by President-elect Trump.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Saturday that he plans to name Kash Patel as FBI director, who would replace the current FBI chief Chris Wray.",
      "In a post to his Truth Social platform, Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People.\"",
      "For Patel to take the post, Wray would have to voluntarily vacate the position or be fired by Trump if he is to be replaced before his term ends in 2027. One source previously told CBS News the Trump team was aware of the complexities involved in ousting Wray.",
      "Patel will also have to be confirmed by the Senate. In his social media post, Trump did not call on Wray to resign. Trump nominated Wray in 2017 for the 10-year term after firing James Comey.",
      "An FBI spokesperson told CBS News in a statement Saturday evening that, \"Every day, the men and women of the FBI continue to work to protect Americans from a growing array of threats. Director Wray's focus remains on the men and women of the FBI, the people we do the work with, and the people we do the work for.\"",
      "The 44-year-old Patel\u00a0served\u00a0in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, including chief of staff to the secretary of defense. He was also designated by Trump to be a representative to the National Archives and Records Administration and fought a subpoena to testify before a federal grand jury in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case.",
      "He is an attorney and staunch Trump loyalist who rose to prominence as an aide to former Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California, fighting the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.",
      "He served on Trump's National Security Council, then as a senior adviser to acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell, and later as chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller.",
      "Patel published a 2023 book titled \"Government Gangsters,\" which received praise from Trump and in which Patel writes that the \"FBI has become so thoroughly compromised that it will remain a threat to the people unless drastic measures are taken.\"",
      "\"This is the roadmap to end the Deep State's reign,\" Trump said on Truth Social about the book in September 2023.",
      "Patel, who was born in Long Island, New York, did his undergraduate work at Richmond University and earned his law degree from Pace University, as well as a certificate of international law from University of College London. He served as a county and federal public defender in Florida from 2005 to 2013 before joining the Justice Department as a trial attorney.",
      "Speaking on Steve Bannon's podcast in December 2023, Patel said that he and other Trump loyalists \"will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media.\"",
      "\"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\" Patel said to Bannon, the former White House chief strategist in Trump's first term, repeating false claims often stated, without evidence, by many Republican leaders of voter fraud in the 2020 election. \"We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly. We'll figure that out. But yeah, we're putting you all on notice\u2026We're actually going to use the Constitution to prosecute them for crimes they said we have always been guilty of but never have.\"",
      "Wray and the FBI's leadership became targets of Trump's enduring ire in 2022, when FBI agents executed a court-authorized search warrant at Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida. The search exposed what had been an ongoing federal probe into Trump's handling of classified records after he left office.",
      "Special counsel Jack Smith, appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, ultimately charged Trump with dozens of counts, including the illegal retention of national defense information and obstruction, as a result of the investigation. All the charges were dismissed by a federal judge earlier this year. Trump pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.",
      "Earlier this week, a federal appeals court granted Smith's bid to end the case, with Smith citing a longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Patel would be the third FBI director to work under a Trump administration and would take over the nation's chief federal law enforcement apparatus amid years of intense criticism from Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. While Wray's departure from the job was largely expected, Trump's announcement about replacing Wray before his 10-year term was to end is sure to reverberate throughout the bureau's rank-and-file. Presidents, however, have the power to force them out of the role and many previous directors have not served their full terms.",
      "Patel would report directly to the attorney general of the United States \u2014\u00a0 Trump's current pick for the post is former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. The president-elect announced her nomination after former Congressman Matt Gaetz withdrew his nomination because his confirmation prospects looked dim as a bipartisan group of senators raised concerns about his past conduct and a Congressional ethics report. Gaetz \u2014 a staunch critic of the Justice Department and FBI \u2014 has denied wrongdoing.",
      "Trump's pick for Attorney General and FBI Director are likely to be tasked with potential reforms and mass policy overhauls of the agencies that have long been targets of the president-elect.",
      "Wray \u2014 a former federal prosecutor and counterterrorism official \u2014 was nominated by then-President Trump in 2017. President Biden retained him as FBI director throughout his administration.",
      "While deep distrust of the FBI has been the focal point of Trump and his supporters, Wray spent much of his tenure on countering China's espionage campaigns. He sounded the alarm on foreign efforts to target American infrastructure and warned of aggressive posturing by Iran and Russia. The FBI employs about 35,000 people \u2014 including thousands of field agents \u2014 tasked with enforcing federal law and investigating crimes across the country, including terrorism, espionage, and child exploitation.",
      "The last FBI director to serve a full 10-year appointment was Robert Mueller, who was later named special counsel during the first Trump administration to investigate Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election and allegations of collusion with the Trump campaign. Mueller, and by extension the entire Justice Department and FBI, quickly became a target for Trump and Republicans in Congress.",
      "Trump's decision to fire then-FBI Director James Comey in 2017 because of the investigation into the 2016 election contributed to Mueller's appointment as special counsel. Comey, who has since become an outspoken critic of the president-elect, found himself at odds with Democrats and Republicans upon his departure from the FBI's top job. A Justice Department Inspector General Report released in the years after his firing revealed Comey \"violated Department and FBI policies\" when he shared with a friend memos he made about his interactions with Trump.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister\u00a0Justin Trudeau\u00a0flew to Florida to meet with President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate, where they held a \"very productive meeting.\" It came in the wake of Trump's threat to impose tariffs on goods coming from Canada.",
      "Trudeau dined with Trump at Mar-a-largo Friday night, according to senior sources who spoke to CBC News on condition they not be named due to the sensitivity of the trip. The sources said the meeting was pushed for by Canadian officials, the Canadian broadcaster said.",
      "Trudeau's plane landed at Palm Beach International Airport at about 5:30 p.m. local time. A smiling Trudeau declined comment upon returning to his West Palm Beach hotel late Friday from Mar-a-Lago. The Trump transition team did not comment on the meeting when reached by CBS News.",
      "Joining Trump and Trudeau at dinner were Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump's pick to lead the Interior Department, Mike Waltz, Trump's choice to be his national security adviser, and the three men's wives, a person familiar with the dinner plans who was not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity told the Associated Press.",
      "Also attending the dinner, the person told the AP, were Republican Senator-elect David McCormick of Pennsylvania, and his wife Dina Powell, a former deputy national security adviser under Trump, as well as Katie Telford, Trudeau's chief of staff.",
      "On Saturday, while leaving a hotel in West Palm, Trudeau told reporters that \"it was an excellent conversation\" with Trump the night before. He did not elaborate further and would not comment on questions about whether the tariffs were part of the conversation or about his relationship with the president-elect.",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump said he had a \"very productive meeting\" with Trudeau during which they discussed \"many important topics that will require both Countries to work together to address.\" For issues in need of such cooperation, Trump cited fentanyl and the \"Drug Crisis that has decimated so many lives as a result of Illegal Immigration,\" fair trade deals \"that do not jeopardize American Workers\" and the U.S. trade deficit with its ally to the north.",
      "\"I made it very clear that the United States will no longer sit idly by as our Citizens become victims to the scourge of this Drug Epidemic caused mainly by the Drug Cartels, and Fentanyl pouring in from China. Too much death and hardship!\" Trump said. \"Prime Minister Trudeau has made a commitment to work with us to end this terrible devastation of U.S. Families. We also spoke about many other important topics like Energy, Trade, and the Arctic. All are vital issues that I will be addressing on my first days back in Office, and before.\"",
      "The meeting also came after Trudeau earlier Friday cautioned that if Trump follows through on this threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, he would be raising prices for Americans and hurting American businesses.",
      "Trump\u00a0has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if the countries don't stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across southern and northern borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products\u00a0entering the U.S.\u00a0from Canada and\u00a0Mexico\u00a0as one of his first executive orders.",
      "\"It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There's no question about it,\" Trudeau said to reporters in Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada earlier Friday.",
      "\"Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,\" he added.",
      "Trudeau said Trump got elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries, but now he's talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products, including potatoes from Prince Edward Island.",
      "Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump's team negotiated during his first term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully re-negotiate the deal, which he calls a \"win-win\" for both countries.",
      "\"We can work together as we did previously,\" Trudeau said.",
      "Although Trump once called Trudeau \"weak\" and \"dishonest\" during his first term, ties between the two countries have remained among the closest in the world. Trudeau is the first leader from the Group of Seven countries to visit Trump since the Nov. 4 election.",
      "Trump aide Corey Lewandowski, speaking on Fox News Friday night, said that he was \"certain\" that Trudeau \"is going to come down and have a conversation with the president and say, 'Sir, what can we do to keep this border open, what can we do to keep goods flowing? We know we have problems we are here to fix it.'\"",
      "Trump made the tariff threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border.",
      "The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone \u2014 and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024.",
      "Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border are few in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but they are ready to make new investments in border security.",
      "\"We're going to work together to meet some of the concerns,\" Trudeau said. \"But ultimately it is through lots of real constructive conversations with President Trump that I am going to have, that will keep us moving forward on the right track for all Canadians.\"",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Thursday she is confident that\u00a0a tariff war with the United States\u00a0will be averted. Trump posted on social media that he had spoken with her and she had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States.",
      "When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum.",
      "Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border each day.",
      "Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security.",

    "summary": "LGBTQ voters were among the only demographic groups that did not move more toward Trump in the 2024 election.",
    "story": [
      "Lucian Holness woke up to a daunting reality on Nov. 6. Acute stress led the mix of emotions that struck the transgender marketing manager as they learned President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 never a reliable ally to the LGBTQ community and an increasingly hostile figure for transgender Americans \u2014 had won a second term in the White House.",
      "\"I went into this election fully expecting Trump to win,\" said Holness, who lives in New Jersey and began to medically transition during the pandemic, an experience they called \"liberating\" and \"amazing\" after a long time spent \"feeling like something was wrong.\"",
      "Assuming Trump would take the presidency again was a self-preservation tactic, Holness told CBS News, but it did not necessarily soften the blow.",
      "\"Maybe I thought it would be a closer race than it was. And just seeing how many states we were losing, the immense way that we lost \u2026 that really destroyed me,\" Holness said. \"And for several days after I had no hope in humanity.\"",
      "After the election, commentators and analysts suggested Trump's decisive victory against Vice President Kamala Harris was broad evidence of a thirst for economic change across\u00a0the bright red map of the country. To win, he had punctured the Democratic \"blue wall\" and flipped all seven battleground states, with CBS News exit polls\u00a0indicating he had received support from more of the electorate than ever.",
      "LGBTQ voters were among the only demographic groups that did not stray toward Trump when they cast ballots in the presidential contest this year. Black women also overwhelmingly backed Harris at the polls.",
      "\"Black voters and queer voters understood the assignment in this election, and our assignment was to defeat the great threat to our safety and freedom that Trump poses, so that we can fight for what all of us need to be safe and free,\" said Melanie Willingham-Jaggers, the executive director of GLSEN, an LGBTQ advocacy group focused on supporting and educating young people. Willingham-Jaggers identifies as nonbinary and queer.",
      "The LGBTQ community has historically voted Democrat but unlike most other demographic trends this year, LGBTQ support for the party's presidential nominee rose substantially from 2020. CBS News' national exit polls showed 86% of people who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender voted for Harris, while just 13% voted for Trump. Echoing most Harris voters, a majority of LGBTQ\u00a0 people said they feared what could happen during another Trump presidency.",
      "People in the LGBTQ community told CBS News they see the recurrence of Trumpism as a tangible affront to their basic human rights. The implications feel particularly urgent to transgender Americans, whom the president-elect and his affiliates categorically targeted throughout the campaign.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these individuals are sadly misinformed,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump-Vance transition team, in a statement to CBS News. \"President Trump campaigned on being a president for ALL Americans and will unify our country through great success.\"",
      "\"I don't feel welcome here\"",
      "The Trump campaign ran advertisements attacking trans people for months ahead of Election Day, in a move that likely cost at least tens of millions of dollars. Criticized for scapegoating, one TV ad bore a tagline interpreted as an attempt to sow division: \"Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\"",
      "The advocacy organization GLAAD\u00a0counted 225 defined attacks on the LGBTQ community by Trump during his first White House term and latest presidential campaign, in terms of policy decisions and rhetoric, which transgender Americans and others who are LGBTQ told CBS News is damaging on its own. The Trevor Project saw a 700% spike in crisis calls throughout the day after the election, and research from the organization found recent politics negatively impacted the well-being of 90% of LGBTQ young people, while anti-trans state legislation in the last year drove up suicide attempts among transgender and nonbinary youth by as much as 72%.",
      "\"I don't feel welcome here,\" said Holness.",
      "Although New Jersey is a sanctuary state for LGBTQ rights, and Gov. Phil Murphy last year declared it a safe haven for transgender and nonbinary people seeking gender-affirming care, Holness is still concerned about the ways in which a second Trump administration and Republican Congress could potentially work to break down that refuge.",
      "\"What people think being trans is, versus the actual experience of being trans, are so vastly different. And if people would just listen to us, I think they'd be surprised how much we are the same as them,\" Holness told CBS News. \"It took me a while to take Trump seriously, but after seeing the rise in trans hate crimes, and the rise in anti-trans legislation, the bounty out on trans people just for existing, you know, it's become really scary.\"",
      "Trump's anti-LGBTQ and specifically anti-trans positions stretch back to his first term in the White House, when he scrubbed federal agency sites of representation and proceeded to roll back protections for LGBTQ\u00a0 people, among other policy decisions that clamped down on their abilities to live and work freely.",
      "But vitriol toward the community became integral to Trump's politics and his overall public brand during the latest presidential bid.",
      "Health care access under siege",
      "As Trump doubled down on anti-trans rhetoric in his speeches, he backed conservative proposals to restrict access to healthcare for transgender people and punish doctors who give minors gender-affirming care.",
      "\"The number one issue, of the many that the trans people I spoke with are worried about, is access to the health care that we need to live. This is not an abstraction. It is not a culture war. It is not a political football,\" said Gillian Brandstetter, a communications strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"It is very much a problem of material need. Can we access hormone therapy? Can we maintain our relationship with our doctors? Can we maintain our insurance coverage?\"",
      "Trump pushed during his last administration to federally redefine gender along binary lines that would exclude transgender identities, effectively denying trans people legal recognition and upholding an outdated characterization of \"biological sex,\" even though\u00a0the medical field has expanded its view of the spectrum of gender identity. Renewed promises made by the campaign this year are fueling panic that he will attempt to implement it nationally again.",
      "Ryan Lyman, a trans college student in New York City who volunteered for the Harris campaign and said he has \"passing privilege\" after beginning hormone therapy at 17 and undergoing top surgery, told CBS News trans people elsewhere in the country are preparing for the worst case scenario. \"Passing privilege\" in this instance means Lyman may avoid some of the prejudice other transgender people face if he is publicly perceived to be a cisgender man.",
      "\"I've seen a lot of people on the Internet lately who are going back to their assigned gender presentation,\" Lyman said. \"There is a part of the community that lives in the Deep South, in red states, who have to go stealth for their own safety. And I do not judge them at all.\"",
      "A decision that could potentially work to protect certain trans rights before Inauguration Day is the outcome of United States v. Skrmetti, a landmark case set to go before the Supreme Court in December where justices will hear a challenge to Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming health care for transgender people younger than 18. The decision could have wide-ranging impacts at a time where almost half of U.S. states have enacted laws to limit access to various aspects of gender-affirming care, like hormones, puberty-blocking drugs or surgery.",
      "An uncertain future",
      "Many LGBTQ people are anxious about how Trump could alter fundamental parts of their lives, out in the world and at home.",
      "A growing number of transgender social media users have now spent the better part of a month sharing guidance on how to update licenses, passports and other legal documents to reflect their names and pronouns. LGBTQ couples told CBS News they are having conversations about whether they should rush to get married before January's inauguration and what family planning might look like once Trump is sworn in.",
      "Lee Robinson, a comedian moving from Denver to New York City, said they were already considering some of those big questions within days of the election. They had started to discuss their options with their girlfriend, too.",
      "\"It's not just marriage, it's parentage and fertility stuff, and queer adoption,\" said Robinson. \"It just totally throws off our ability to plan for our futures when this kind of thing happens.\"",
      "Everyone who spoke to CBS News for this story shared concerns about losing discrimination protections under a second Trump administration. They also wonder what it would mean if the Supreme Court's 2015 marriage equality ruling came under review and marriage rights, like abortion rights, were returned to the states.",
      "An updated policy rundown on Trump's 2024 campaign website called Agenda 47 offers a blueprint of his \"20 Core Promises To Make America Great Again.\" Among the items on that list, Trump pledges to \"keep men out of women's sports\" and cut federal funding for schools \"pushing critical race theory, radical gender ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\"",
      "These items echo GOP state lawmakers and government leaders who have sought to bar trans youth from athletic teams that align with their gender identities and ban\u00a0LGBTQ and racial identity-focused\u00a0lesson plans and books from school curriculum. The First Amendment's freedom of speech and religion clauses have been used in high-profile court cases to justify anti-LGBTQ discrimination.",
      "They are not just concepts. Anti-LGBTQ doctrines embraced at Republican rallies have in recent years been codified across the country, keeping transgender children off of sports teams and away from bathrooms aligned with their gender identity. In Florida, laws have been passed to take transgender-focused curriculum out of schools; a legal settlement earlier this year clarified that students and teachers would be able to discuss gender identity as long as it's not part of the curriculum.",
      "Capitol Hill is not immune, as Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat set to become the first openly transgender person in Congress, faced a swift Republican-led attempt after her trailblazing win to restrict her restroom use\u00a0in the Capitol Complex.",
      "\"It's dehumanizing people,\" said Sarah Kate Ellis, the president and CEO of the advocacy organization GLAAD. \"They want to treat us as second-class citizens, question our dignity and respect.\"",
      "Ellis said measurable repercussions in the balance, like medical coverage and equality under the law, are joined by intangible consequences that could trickle down generations.",
      "\"I think of my kids, as my wife and I's marriage is under fire, but our neighbors' marriage isn't under fire. It's awful when you think about that,\" she shared. \"So, my kids, in their understanding, see us as less than the family next door because they have two moms versus a mom and a dad, or a single mom. I just think all these are their culture wars, not ours.\"",
      "Project 2025",
      "Experts often attribute the intensification of Trump's anti-LGBTQ platform to his ties with right-wing religious groups like the Heritage Foundation, an organization with a long history of espousing anti-LGBTQ laws that helmed the presidential transition proposal Project 2025.",
      "Project 2025 is a 900-page policy handbook developed by a team linked to more than 100 conservative groups, to which Trump had denied connections, though he is hiring several of its architects to fill key staff positions in the next administration. The book calls for an overhaul of the federal government to \"restore family as the centerpiece of American life.\" Its socio-political vision for how to do that, introduced on the first page of Project 2025, directs government officials to reject transgender people and LGBTQ identities across the board.",
      "\"The next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors. This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (\"SOGI\"), diversity, equity, and inclusion (\"DEI\"), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists,\" the document states, at the outset of its opening chapter.",
      "Although Trump attempted to distance himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, even going so far as to call some of its proposals \"abysmal,\" the blueprint is compatible with the Republican Party agenda. But at the same time, Trump also plans to nominate Scott Bessent to be treasury secretary. He's a billionaire and former George Soros hedge fund manager and if confirmed, he'd be the first openly gay person to serve in this role.",
      "\"We should absolutely take Trump at his word,\" said Willingham-Jaggers, of GLSEN. \"We should take Project 2025 at its word. We should expect a full court press to get everything outlined in Project 2025, created into policy and enacted as the starting point, not the end point, as the starting point. That's part one. That's what I'm concerned about.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 07:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "As Donald Trump's second term approaches, Republicans have cited inflated figures on noncitizens with criminal records.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's appointed \"border czar\" Tom Homan has said that he wants to prioritize deporting noncitizens with criminal histories when Trump's second term starts in January.",
      "This follows recent high-profile criminal cases involving undocumented immigrants, including the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley by a Venezuelan immigrant who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "But in interviews, Homan and other top Republicans have shared contradictory and inflated figures about the overall number of noncitizens who Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials say fall into this category.",
      "In a recent interview with Fox News, Homan said there are \"over 1.5 million convicted criminal aliens in this country with orders for removal who we'll be looking for.\" The Trump transition team has said this number includes some migrants who have crossed into the country illegally, although they are not considered \"convicted criminal aliens.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson has claimed in recent weeks that the number of migrants apprehended for committing violent crimes specifically is \"by some counts, as many as 3 or 4 million people.\"",
      "However, Immigration and Customs Enforcement provided much lower estimates to Congress.",
      "As of July 21, ICE's national docket, which tracks immigrants facing deportation proceedings, listed roughly 660,000 noncitizens with criminal histories, including 436,000 convicted criminals and 227,000 with pending criminal charges.",
      "This includes noncitizens in ICE detention and those not detained by the agency.",
      "There are only estimates of the number of noncitizens currently in the U.S. As of 2022, there were roughly 24.5 million noncitizens \u2014 including at least 11 million unauthorized immigrants and 13.5 million people who are lawful permanent residents or temporary lawful residents, according to estimates by Pew Research Center based on the latest Census data.",
      "By Homan's numbers, around 6% of noncitizens would be convicted criminals. By Johnson's numbers closer to 12% of the noncitizens would be criminals, or as much as 24% of the unauthorized population.",
      "According to ICE's figures closer to 2.6% of the noncitizens in the U.S. have criminal histories.",
      "Response from Trump's transition spokesman",
      "The agency's totals are far below the millions suggested by Homan and Johnson, and ICE's figures remain the most accurate available for tracking noncitizens with criminal histories, according to C. Mario Russell, executive director for the Center for Migration Studies, a think tank that also supports policies that safeguard migrant rights.",
      "Johnson's office did not respond to a request for clarification at time of publication.",
      "Brian Hughes, a Trump-Vance transition spokesman, told CBS News that Homan was considering the number of migrants who have crossed illegally into the U.S. who evaded border patrol, sometimes called \"gotaways\" by immigration and border security officials.",
      "\"Tom Homan is right\u2013nearly 2 million 'gotaways' have evaded border patrol under the Biden-Harris wide-open border, which is more than four times the average under President Trump,\" Hughes said.",
      "Border Patrol estimates that roughly 1.7 million migrants have evaded apprehension since the start of fiscal year 2021. However, there is no official data on the number of so-called \"gotaways\" with criminal records.",
      "There were also \"gotaways\" during the Trump administration but the average number during Trump's first three years in office, before immigration fell during COVID-19, was four times lower than the totals in fiscal year 2022 and 2023, according to testimony by Steven A. Camarota, the director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies.",
      "In some interviews, Homan has also cited lower figures more in line with ICE data. On Nov. 14, for example, Homan told NewsNation, \"authorities have identified more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants with criminal convictions.\"",
      "What ICE's data shows about the number of noncitizens with criminal histories",
      "Noncitizens \u2014 including those with green cards \u2014 can lose their legal right to be in the U.S. after committing a crime. Many of the people ICE tracks remain incarcerated and can be deported only after serving their sentences.",
      "Data suggests many of the 436,000 convicted criminals on this list, including over 13,000 convicted of murder and 62,000 people convicted of assault, have been in the U.S. for years. Non-violent offenders are also on ICE's docket, including more than 125,000 people convicted of or facing traffic offenses.",
      "In 2016, under the Obama administration, there were 368,574 convicted criminals in ICE's non-detained docket, according to data published by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General. In June 2021, a few months into the Biden administration, there were 405,786 convicted criminals on the list.",
      "Some criminal noncitizens remain in the U.S. for years because they come from countries that don't accept or limit U.S. deportations, including Cuba, Venezuela, and China. Others are legally protected from deportation under United Nations convention because they face a credible threat of torture if they return to their home countries.",
      "Government statistics indicate that a relatively small fraction of migrants processed by Border Patrol have criminal records in the U.S. or in other countries that share information with American officials.",
      "Additionally, although the data is not exhaustive, available studies suggest that undocumented migrants are incarcerated less frequently than native-born Americans.",

    "published": "Wed, 27 Nov 2024 11:46:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Scientists now have a clearer picture of Camp Century, an abandoned U.S. military base long hidden under the ice in Greenland, thanks to a NASA research team's good luck.",
    "story": [
      "As NASA scientist Chad Greene flew over northern Greenland with a team of engineers in April, they never expected their radar to find something manmade buried deep within the ice. Greene and his team were flying above the Greenland Ice Sheet on a NASA Gulfstream III plane, scanning the barren expanse of ice that's more than a mile deep in some areas, when their radar instrument picked up something unusual.",
      "\"We didn't know what it was at first,\" Greene said in a statement released by NASA's Earth Observatory this week, along with new images of the discovery. \"We were looking for the bed of the ice and out pops Camp Century.\"",
      "It turns out the team had stumbled upon an abandoned Cold War-era military base built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1959. Nicknamed the \"city under the ice,\" the compound consists of a network of tunnels carved into the ice sheet. It was abandoned in 1967 and, over time, became buried about 100 feet below the surface as snow and ice accumulated.",
      "The base was built as part of Project Iceworm, a then-secret plan to experiment with building a missile launch site under the Greenland Ice Sheet during the Cold War, when tension soared between the U.S. and the then-Soviet Union. Camp Century, a remote, nuclear-powered installation, was built to study the feasibility of such a project, but it was never realized and the base was decommissioned under the assumption it would be buried forever under the ice.",
      "While the \"city under the ice\" had been picked up by previous radar scans, the instruments used on the NASA flight in April provided a more detailed, if unexpected, survey.",
      "\"In the new data, individual structures in the secret city are visible in a way that they've never been seen before,\" said Greene, who works with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.",
      "Past scans had used a type of radar that points straight down at the ground and produces a two-dimensional scan of structures buried beneath the ice. Greene's flight used NASA's Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar, which is able to produce maps with \"more dimensionality,\" according to the agency.",
      "A photo released by NASA on Monday showed the features of the base hidden deep under the ice, appearing as anomalies near the base of the ice sheet.",
      "\"Scientists have used maps acquired with conventional radar to corroborate estimates of Camp Century's depth \u2014 part of an\u00a0effort to estimate\u00a0when melting and thinning of the ice sheet could\u00a0re-expose the camp\u00a0and any remaining biological, chemical, and radioactive waste that was buried along with it,\" NASA's Earth Observatory said in its article this week. \"The scientific utility of the new UAVSAR image of Camp Century remains to be seen; for now, it remains a novel curiosity acquired by chance.\"",
      "A 2016 study of the abandoned base suggested that the facility could no longer be considered \"preserved for eternity,\" due to climate change increasing the rate at which Arctic ice is melting.",
      "CBS News' Walter Cronkite visited Camp Century for a tour of the still-under-construction facility for a program that aired in 1961. The camp's commander, Captain Tom Evans, explained to him that the goals of the program were three-fold: \"The first one is to test out the number of promising new concepts of polar construction. And the second one is to provide a really practical field test of this new nuclear plant. And, finally, we're building Camp Century to provide a good base, here, in the interior of Greenland, where the scientists can carry on their R&D activities.\"",
      "The exact nature of that research and development work wasn't discussed in Cronkite's report for the CBS documentary show \"The Twentieth Century.\" \u00a0(An abridged version of that report can be viewed at the link above.)",
      "Speaking with 60 Minutes in 2016, as that show revisited Cronkite's decades-old trip to Camp Century, producer Daniel Ruetenik said the trip was fascinating, and he marveled at the evolution of human interest in the vast, frozen expanse of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",
      "\"At the time [of Camp Century], the Cold War was considered to be the greatest threat to humanity,\" Ruetenik said. \"And now, the area has become a destination for climate scientists trying to study changes in the environment. So, it has a second purpose now.\"",

    "summary": "Forensic pathologists hope advanced DNA testing technology will enable them to attach names to all the unidentified people at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office.",
    "story": [
      "Some may have been lost hikers, runaway children, or wanderers.",
      "One thing connects the 58 or so remains at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office found with no identification card and no next of kin to claim them: They remain nameless.",
      "Forensic pathologists hope advanced DNA testing technology will enable them to attach names to all of the agency's unidentified people. But for now, five cases - all children and teens - have been sent for additional testing thanks to a $50,000 grant from Texas-based cold case resolution company Othram.",
      "They include the partial skeleton of a teenager found in Keehi Lagoon near the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in 2002; parts of the body of a 7- to 10-year-old boy discovered in Waianae in 2000; six fingers of a girl under the age of 4 who was found in Honolulu in 2012; and the skeletal remains of an adolescent found mixed with animal bones inside of a vase purchased in Honolulu in 2015.",
      "The medical examiner's office wouldn't provide additional details about the cases, but medicolegal investigator Charlotte Carter said each represents a person whose family deserves closure.",
      "The five cases sent to Othram for testing were chosen in part because they are juveniles who DNA experts felt had a good chance of being identified through advanced technology.",
      "One case is connected to a 2014 homicide, so the medical examiners office declined to provide information while the investigation continues.",
      "For the case involving the severed fingers, it's unclear whether they belong to a child who died or only suffered trauma to their hands. The other cases could be missing children, a possibility that can't be ruled out until DNA testing is complete.",
      "Carter said she's committed to resolving the other unidentified cases in Honolulu's morgue, especially if DNA testing becomes more accessible and affordable.",
      "\"Anybody who's unidentified deserves to have a chance at being found and identified,\" she said, \"and given their name back.\"",
      "The Honolulu City Council in June accepted the grant from Houston-based Othram, which performs forensic genetic genealogy testing, which combines DNA analysis with genealogy research.",
      "So far, Carter said, none of the samples have been identified.",
      "Sparse information about each case is available publicly through the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs, an organization funded by the National Institute of Justice, which runs a national database of unidentified, missing and unclaimed persons. Representatives with NamUs didn't respond to interview requests.",
      "For some cases, very little is known.",
      "For the skeletal remains found inside the vase in Honolulu, for example, forensic pathologists could not identify an age range, gender, height, weight or year of death - only that the person was still an adolescent.",
      "Other cases include more clues. The young boy found in Waianae in 2000 was suspected to have died that same year. He was recovered without a torso and was missing one or more of his limbs and one or both of his hands.",
      "A forensic artist reconstructed his face, which is included on his NamUs profile, showing what he may have looked like in life. He's listed in the missing children's database as \"John Waianae Doe 2000.\"",
      "Carter said it can take a year or more for DNA testing results to come back.",
      "Thus far, her agency has worked on one successful identification with Othram.",
      "Skeletal remains unearthed by a construction crew in Manoa in 2010 were tested and later identified as belonging to William Hans Holling Jr., a Washington man last seen by friends and family in January 1985. Othram identified Holling's remains and the Honolulu Police Department confirmed his identity in July. No arrests have been made, and the investigation remains open.",
      "Serial killer-rapist identified with the technology",
      "Forensic genetic genealogy testing enables investigators to search for an unidentified person's relatives as a starting point and, with the help of public records, to build a family tree they hope will get them closer to an identification.",
      "The method became popular in criminal investigations in the 2010s after companies like 23andMe and Ancestry came onto the market. Those companies block law enforcement agencies like the FBI from their databases, but investigators can use others, like GEDMatch, which is public-facing, and FamilyTreeDNA, which allows limited access by law enforcement, according to Stephen Kramer, a former FBI in-house counsel and founder of Indago Solutions, a DNA identification company.",
      "While still working with the FBI in 2018, Kramer helped identify the Golden State Killer using forensic genetic genealogy testing. Joseph James DeAngelo Jr., pleaded guilty to 13 murder and rape charges for crimes committed in the 1970s and '80s and has admitted overall to 161 crimes involving 48 victims, including dozens of rapes.",
      "Kramer's company recently identified Albert Lauro as the murder suspect in the 1991 killing of Dana Ireland on the Big Island.",
      "During a presentation to University of Hawaii law students this month, Kramer said genetic analysis of the DNA found on Ireland's body connected him to ancestry information about the suspect. He discovered the man was 83% Filipino, meaning he had three Filipino grandparents. He was also 5% European and Scandinavian, with the rest a mix of Hawaiian, Maori and South Pacific Islander.",
      "That told Kramer the suspect's fourth grandparent was about 30% European and 25% Pacific Islander, he said. Kramer focused on that grandparent because it's generally easier to find public records for people of European descent.",
      "He used records to identify people with this ancestry who had moved to Hawaii and married into Filipino families, leaving very few potential matches. He traced a family tree with three Filipino grandparents and one grandparent descending from Europeans, Scandinavians and Pacific Islanders.",
      "There, he found his suspect.",
      "Investigators followed Lauro by picking up a fork he discarded, which was tested against a DNA sample from Ireland's body.",
      "Detectives later reconfirmed Lauro's identity with a swab when they brought him in for questioning on July 19. Hawaii County Police Chief Ben Moszkowicz later said police didn't have enough probable cause to arrest Lauro for Ireland's murder, and they let him go.",
      "He killed himself four days later.",
      "Factors hindering use of the technology",
      "Lack of funds is the main obstacle to more intensive screening and forensic genetic genealogy on cold cases, Carter said. Each case costs about $10,000, and NamUs pays for Honolulu to send around five cases per year for testing.",
      "The 58 unidentified cases at the Honolulu Medical Examiner's Office date back to about 1966 and include people found under a variety of circumstances.",
      "Many are skeletal remains uncovered at construction sites, Carter said. Others are remains discovered by hikers that likely belonged to people who were homeless and living in encampments in remote parts of the island.",
      "If remains are found on tribal lands, are more than 50 years old or otherwise suspected to be Native Hawaiian, medical examiners contact the Department of Land and Natural Resources' State Historic Preservation Division for confirmation. If the remains are confirmed to be Native Hawaiian, the agency takes custody of them for repatriation.",
      "But some unidentified cases involve people who died fairly recently and, although they were physically recognizable when they were found, still haven't been claimed by family members or matched through any national database.",
      "Forensic pathologists haven't been able to identify a woman fatally struck by a car while trying to cross a road on May 21, 2016, Carter said. She was between 50 and 75 years old, of Asian or mixed Asian ancestry and appeared to be homeless, according to her NamUs profile. Her DNA was run through the national database and Honolulu police collected her fingerprints and sent them to the FBI but received no matches.",
      "A few people have come forward thinking they knew her, but her identity wasn't able to be confirmed, Carter said.",
      "\"That is a person who was a victim of a crime,\" she said. \"But, unfortunately, we're not able to figure out who she is.\"",
      "The most recent case was discovered on Oct. 9 when military personnel doing a training exercise found two femurs inside a camping tent off a hiking trail in Haleiwa.",
      "Carter said her office doesn't track statistics on identifications but said usually one or two unidentified remains are ID'd each year through DNA testing. If a person is identified but their next of kin can't be found, their case is moved to NamUs's unclaimed persons database.",
      "If family members are found, they are able to collect their relative's remains for burial or cremation, Carter said.",
      "She hopes that as technology improves, testing will become more accessible so every case can be resolved.",
      "\"I just think everybody deserves a name and their family deserves an answer,\" she said. \"We have a lot of families who are out there wondering what happened to somebody they love. And now that there's new technologies, we're maybe going to get a little step closer to having more closure or more processing to that new normal for those families.\"",

      "NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has returned incredible new photos of the Sombrero galaxy, offering a new look at the region.",
      "The Sombrero galaxy, named for its resemblance to the Mexican hat, is about 30 million light-years from Earth, NASA said in a news release. The galaxy is surrounded by multiple rings, where stars are formed. At its center is a supermassive black hole that emits a bright jet of light and consumes material from inside the galaxy. Both the rings and black hole are relatively docile, NASA said, and neither creates much solar activity each year.",
      "What sets the galaxy apart is its 2,000 globular clusters, or collections of hundreds of thousands of old stars held together by gravity, according to NASA. These clusters allow astronomers to study stars, since there are thousands of stars in one area. The stars are roughly the same age, but they vary in many other ways, allowing scientists to compare them.",
      "Photos taken by the Webb telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument, or MIRI, reveals a new texture in the galaxy's outer ring and details the dust along the ring. Such dust is an \"essential building block\" for solar objects, NASA said.",
      "The outer ring had been photographed before, but appeared smooth. The more detailed MIRI images revealed intricate clumps along the rings. The images also show various galaxies in the background, which NASA said can allow astronomers to learn about their properties, including how far away they are from the Sombrero galaxy.",
      "The Webb telescope is set to begin its fourth year of science operations this summer, NASA said. Researchers are able to apply for observation time with the telescope, with a record-breaking 2,377 proposals submitted in October.

      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 08:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Australia's full legislature has now passed a bill that will soon ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's Senate passed legislation Wednesday that, once signed by the country's leader who has strongly endorsed it,\u00a0will ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms. The new law will give Australia the tightest restrictions of any democracy in the world on children's use of hugely popular social media apps.",
      "The Senate passed the bill by 34 votes to 19 on Thursday, a day after Australia's House of Representatives\u00a0passed the same bill by a sweeping margin of 102 votes to 13.",
      "Australia's major parties in the House all supported the bill, which will see social media companies such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Tech giant Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has called for the bill to be delayed. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted online Tuesday, Meta said it was \"concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation.\"",
      "\"The Government's approach will likely require each app provider to collect personal identification or biometric data from all Australians in order to prevent under 16s from accessing their services, an inefficient and burdensome process for everyone,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "Meta also pointed to a policy it introduced earlier this year on its Instagram platform, Instagram teen accounts, which limits who can contact teenagers via their accounts and attempts to moderate the content that young users see.",
      "In a post shared last week on the X platform that he owns, tech billionaire Elon Musk also condemned the Australian bill and said it seemed to him \"like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\"",
      "Other independent bodies and non-profit organizations have also taken aim at the bill, voicing concern that young people's human rights could be restricted by it.",
      "The CEO of the Save the Children charity Mat Tinkler said in a statement\u00a0earlier this month that while he welcomes government efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than introducing a blanket ban.",
      "\"We are asking the government to reconsider this legislative approach and instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits,\" Tinkler said.",
      "The Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, expressed its own \"serious reservations\" over the proposed law in an analysis published last week.",
      "\"There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies,\" the analysis said. \"We also need to help children and young people to better navigate online spaces by ensuring the national curriculum includes a specific focus on teaching digital literacy and online safety.\"",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese rejected criticism of the proposed law as he\u00a0addressed the parliament\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"There are common sense exemptions. We want to make sure that young people can continue to access health and education related services \u2014 Headspace, YouTube, Google Classroom \u2014 as well as messaging services and online games,\" he said.",
      "The Australian leader added that there would be \"very strong and strict privacy requirements to protect people's personal information, including an obligation to destroy information provided once age has been verified.\"",
      "Despite the criticism, the legislation remains popular among Australians, according to recent polling data.",
      "A YouGov survey released Tuesday showed 77% of Australians back the ban on under-16s, and 87% of said they supported the introduction of stronger penalties for social media companies that fail to comply with regulations.",

    "story": [
      "Meet Daisy \u2013 an AI-generated grandma created by British phone company Virgin Media O2 as the ultimate scam buster. Daisy's sole purpose is to talk to scammers all day so real people don't have to.",
      "Daisy made her debut on Nov. 14 and has already had more than 1,000 conversations with scammers so far, the longest lasting around 40 minutes, frustrating them with her tech-illiteracy and wasting their time by telling irrelevant stories about her grandchildren.",
      "\"The newest member of our fraud-prevention team, Daisy, is turning the tables on scammers \u2013 outsmarting and outmaneuvering them at their own cruel game simply by keeping them on the line,\" Murray Mackenzie, director of fraud at Virgin Media O2, said in a statement.",
      "While Daisy may sound like a human, she is essentially an AI large language model with the character application of a grandma. She functions by listening to the scammers and translating their voice to text. The AI then searches its large database to find an appropriate response, based on the specific scam training it's received, and translates that text response to speech for Daisy to reply. All this happens in seconds with no additional input needed.",
      "The company told CBS they worked with known scam artists to train Daisy and used a tactic called number seeding to get Daisy's phone number added to a list of online \"mugs lists\" \u2014 lists used by scammers targeting U.K. consumers. When they call, Daisy \"has all the time in the world\" to keep the scammers occupied.",
      "In addition to wasting scammers' time, Virgin Media O2 hopes to draw attention to fraud by warning consumers to be vigilant about who they may be speaking to.",
      "\"Daisy is also a reminder that no matter how persuasive someone on the other end of the phone may be, they aren't always who you think they are,\" Mackenzie said.",
      "According to the company's research, 69% of the British public has reported being the target of a scam and the company says it intercepted and blocked over \u00a3250 million ($260 million) in suspected fraudulent transactions last year.",
      "\"Fraud is at epidemic levels, with organized gangs of fraudsters operating professional call centers which relentlessly target Brits every second of every day,\" said Virgin Media O2 COO Rob Orr.",
      "\"We're constantly building our defenses higher and sharing compelling evidence of what these gangs are up to but with no real deterrent in place, these criminals can repeatedly steal free from the threat of prosecution.\"",
      "Fraud is a big problem in the U.S. too. According to TrueCaller, a caller ID and phone blocking app, Americans receive an average of 2.9 billion unwanted or spam calls a month. That's about eight spam calls per user, per month.",
      "Although there is no American version of Daisy, many U.S. phone companies have call screening software that can identify a likely scam or robocall.",
      "On Nov. 13, Google announced a new A.I. feature for its Pixel phone that will go one step further and listen in to calls you make. Google AI will sound an alarm or vibrate if it detects conversation patterns commonly associated with scams, like a caller urgently requesting money transfers or asking for account login information or your bank details.",
      "As phone companies and scammers continue to innovate with AI for their own purposes, the best thing consumers can do is stay vigilant.",
      "\"In terms of tips and tricks, whether you're shopping online, reviewing your emails, or receiving an out-of-the-blue phone call, it's important to always remain vigilant,\" a spokesperson for O2 told CBS. \"We never call customers and ask for their full passwords, one-time passcodes or bank details over the phone, so any call like this is guaranteed to be fraud. Always check links you receive and if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:16:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said . \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",

      "\"Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement Sunday night.",
      "The president argued that \"Hunter was treated differently\" than others under similar circumstances, claiming that the charges were brought after \"several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.\"",
      "\"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2014  and that is wrong,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "The \"Full and Unconditional Pardon\" applies to any crimes Hunter Biden may have committed from Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "Mr. Biden did not address the pardon with reporters before boarding Air Force One for his trip to Angola.",
      "Hunter Biden charges and allegations",
      "Hunter Biden was investigated and prosecuted by special counsel David Weiss, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware who was kept on by Mr. Biden's administration in 2021, when other Trump-era prosecutors were asked to resign, in order to continue the probes into Hunter's conduct. Attorney General Merrick Garland later elevated Weiss to special counsel status after whistleblowers and congressional Republicans alleged irregularities in the probe.",
      "Weiss' office declined to comment on the pardon.",
      "Joseph Ziegler and Gary Shapley, two IRS whistleblowers who came forward to raise concerns about what they said were the Justice Department's efforts to shield Hunter Biden, said in a statement that it was \"a sad day for law abiding taxpayers to witness this special privilege for the powerful.\"",
      "Before dropping out of the race for president, Mr. Biden had committed not to pardon his son,\u00a0saying in an interview with ABC News in June that he had ruled it out. After opting to\u00a0leave the race\u00a0the next month, the White House maintained that Mr. Biden had no plans to pardon his son, though the possible political consequences of the decision had decreased. The White House\u00a0said\u00a0as recently as last month that the president still had no plans to issue a pardon.",
      "\"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction \u2014 mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport. Despite all of this, I have maintained my sobriety for more than five years because of my deep faith and the unwavering love and support of my family and friends,\" Hunter Biden said in a statement Sunday night.",
      "\"I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering,\" the president's son said.",
      "Hunter Biden was set to be sentenced for the gun convictions on Dec. 12 and on Dec. 16 for the tax evasion charges.",
      "Following the White House announcement of the pardon, Hunter Biden's legal team informed the federal judges overseeing his cases in Delaware and California about the pardon so the cases can be formally dismissed and the sentencing hearings set for later this month be canceled.",
      "Hunter Biden was\u00a0indicted on three felony gun charges\u00a0in September after a proposed plea deal with federal prosecutors\u00a0fell apart. The deal would have had him plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and enter a diversion program instead of pleading guilty to a felony gun possession count.",
      "During the court hearing in which the plea deal was set to be finalized, the judge overseeing the case raised concerns over the terms while Hunter Biden's legal team pushed back against prosecutors over whether the agreement was to protect the president's son from any future criminal charges.",
      "Hunter Biden was accused of lying on paperwork and illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while he was addicted to crack cocaine. Federal law prohibits users of illegal drugs from owning firearms.",
      "Prosecutors said the president's son lied about his drug use on a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives form when he bought a revolver and several other items from a Wilmington, Delaware, gun store on Oct. 12, 2018.",
      "In the separate case in California, a federal grand jury last December\u00a0charged Hunter Biden\u00a0with three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor offenses. The president's son was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes while living an \"extravagant lifestyle.\"",
      "According to the indictment, Hunter Biden made some $7 million in income from his foreign business dealings from 2016 through 2019. He was accused of spending nearly $5 million during that same time period on \"everything but his taxes,\" including on drugs, escorts, luxury hotels, cars and clothing. Hunter Biden was accused of falsely listing those purchases as business expenses.",
      "After unsuccessfully attempting to enter an \"Alford\" plea, wherein a defendant accepts a guilty verdict while maintaining their innocence, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to the tax evasion charges on Sept. 5.",
      "\"Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form,\" Mr. Biden said Sunday night. \"Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.\"",
      "Special counsel response",
      "Weiss argued in a court filing on Monday that Hunter Biden's cases should not be dismissed, but rather closed by the judge overseeing them. The Justice Department said Monday they have not yet seen the order of clemency signed by Mr. Biden for his son.",
      "Weiss argued the cases against Hunter Biden were not defective and as a result, should not be dismissed. He says the judges should follow precedent form other cases in which defendants received pardons and simply close the case and docket the notice of clemency on the public docket.",
      "\"If media reports are accurate, the Government does not challenge that the defendant has been the recipient of an act of mercy,\" Weiss said in the filing. \"But that does not mean the grand jury's decision to charge him, based on a finding of probable cause, should be wiped away as if it never occurred. It also does not mean that his charges should be wiped away because the defendant falsely claimed that the charges were the result of some improper motive. No court has agreed with the defendant on these baseless claims, and his request to dismiss the indictment finds no support in the law or the practice of this district.\"",
      "Without specifically calling out Mr. Biden by name, Weiss also pushed back on criticism of the probe, writing, \"there was none and never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case.\"",
      "White House response",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dodged questions about the president's reversal on Monday, reiterating portions of the president's statement while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One. She outlined that Mr. Biden made the decision over the weekend, saying that he \"agonized\" over it.",
      "While insisting Mr. Biden believes in the Justice Department, Jean-Pierre said that \"politics infected the process,\" arguing that \"both things could be true.\" She said the president is not seeking the resignation of the attorney general, and said Mr. Biden does not agree with President-elect Donald Trump that the DOJ has been weaponized for political purposes or needs reform.",
      "Jean-Pierre suggested that the decision came in part because the president didn't think his political opponents would let up.",
      "\"One of the reasons the president did the pardon is because it didn't seem like his political opponents would let go of it,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"It didn't seem like they would move on.\"",
      "Biden family reaction",
      "First lady Jill Biden told reporters on Monday \"of course I support the pardon of my son.\"",
      "The first lady and daughter Ashley were often present during Hunter Biden's trial to show their support for him. Hunter Biden, his wife Melissa and son Beau Jr. all spent Thanksgiving weekend on Nantucket with Mr. Biden, Jill Biden and Ashley.",
      "Reaction to the pardon",
      "On social media, Trump called the Biden pardon \"an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\"",
      "Other Republicans on Sunday and Monday decried the pardon. House Speaker Mike Johnson posted X that \"trust in our justice system has been almost irreparably damaged by the Bidens and their use and abuse of it.\"",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley wrote that is he is \"shocked\" about the pardon because Mr. Biden \"said many many times he wouldn't & I believed him[.] Shame on me.\"",
      "Colorado's Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, meanwhile, wrote on Sunday that as a father, he understands Mr. Biden's desire to pardon his son, but said he was \"disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country. This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.\"",
      "But former Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder said on Sunday night \"pardon warranted,\" posting on social media that had Hunter Biden's \"name been Joe Smith the resolution would have been - fundamentally and more fairly - a declination.\"",
      "Holder also mentioned Trump's announcement over the weekend that he wanted Kash Patel to lead the FBI, saying \"ask yourself a vastly more important question. Do you really think Kash Patel is qualified to lead the world's preeminent law enforcement investigative organization? Obvious answer: hell no.\"",
      "Presidential pardons",
      "Hunter Biden is the 26th person to receive a pardon during Mr. Biden's presidency. Most of the others received pardons for drug offenses. Trump granted\u00a029 pardons\u00a0at this point in his first term, but issued a total of 143 pardons by the time he left office in 2020.",
      "This is not the first time a president has pardoned a family member. President Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother, Roger Clinton, before leaving office. Trump pardoned his son-in-law's father, Charles Kushner, during his first term. Trump announced that he intends to\u00a0nominate Kushner\u00a0as U.S. ambassador to France on Saturday.",
      "The two federal cases against Hunter Biden came amid a backdrop of Republican-led congressional inquiries into his business dealings and whether they involved Mr. Biden. The president has maintained he had nothing to do with his son's businesses and the investigative committees produced no evidence showing the president engaged in wrongdoing.",
      "Robert Legare and \n                                                  \n                                  Arden Farhi\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "A White former police detective accused of sexually assaulting Black women and girls in Kansas \u2014 and terrorizing those who tried to fight back \u2014 is dead, prosecutors said as his trial was set to begin Monday.",
      "Prosecutors say female residents of poor neighborhoods in Kansas City, Kansas, feared that if they crossed paths with Roger Golubski, he'd demand sexual favors and threaten to harm or jail their relatives.",
      "Golubski, 71, was facing six felony counts of violating women's civil rights. But he did not appear in court Monday morning for the start of jury selection. Prosecutors later confirmed in court that Golubski had died. They did not say how or when he died. Law enforcement set up a crime scene outside Golubski's home on Monday morning, CBS affiliate KCTV reported.",
      "His attorney, Christopher Joseph, said his client \"was despondent about the media coverage.\" He did not elaborate.",
      "U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse dismissed the case against Golubski at prosecutors' request. Joseph called the death \"truly unexpected.\"",
      "\"I don't know the details,\" he told reporters as he walked away from the courtroom where jury selection had been set to begin.",
      "The case has outraged the community and deepened the historical distrust of law enforcement.",
      "The prosecution follows earlier reports of similar abuse allegations across the country where hundreds of officers have lost their badges after allegations of sexual assaults.",
      "Golubski was accused of sexually assaulting one woman starting when she was barely a teenager and another after her sons were arrested.",
      "About 50 people rallied outside the federal courthouse Monday morning in freezing temperatures to show their support for women who've said they were victimized by Golubski. They held signs that said, \"Justice now!\"",
      "The trial is the latest in a string of lawsuits and criminal allegations that has led the county prosecutor's office to begin a $1.7 million effort to reexamine cases Golubski worked on during his 35 years on the force. One double murder case Golubski investigated already has resulted in an exoneration, and an organization run by rapper Jay-Z is suing to obtain police records.",
      "Golubski had pleaded not guilty, and his attorney said that lawsuits over the allegations were an \"inspiration for fabrication\" by his accusers. But prosecutors said that, along with the two women whose accounts are the heart of the criminal case, seven others were going to testify that Golubski abused or harassed them.",
      "\"Every time I turn around, I'm looking,\" said Jermeka Hobbs, who has filed a separate lawsuit against Golubski and was not going to be a witness in the trial. Her lawsuit says she was groomed to be one of \"Golubski's girls\" and submitted to sexual advances fearing that he would bust her for drugs. \"I'm thinking somebody is after me. I have no peace at all.\"",
      "Veteran detective patrolling poor neighborhoods",
      "Fellow officers once revered Golubski for his ability to clear cases, and he rose to the rank of captain in Kansas City before retiring there in 2010 and then working on a suburban police force for six more years. His former partner served a stint as police chief.",
      "Prior to his death, Golubski had been under house arrest and undergoing kidney dialysis treatments three times a week.",
      "Joseph said in a statement that some of the allegations against Golubski are 20 to 30 years old, adding, \"In public filings, the prosecution has acknowledged that the verdict will turn entirely on the accusers' credibility.\"",
      "But Jim McCloskey, founder of Centurion, a New Jersey nonprofit working to free innocent people, described Golubski in a court hearing as the \"dirtiest cop I've ever encountered.\"",
      "Stories about Golubski remained just whispers in the neighborhoods near Kansas City's former cattle stockyards partly because of the extreme poverty of a place where some homes are boarded up. One neighborhood where Golubski worked is part of Kansas' second-poorest zip code.",
      "Crime was abundant there, as were drug dealers and prostitutes, said Max Seifert, a former Kansas City police officer who graduated from the police academy with Golubski in 1975.",
      "Fellow officer: \"A boys will be boys type of thing\"",
      "Seifert said police misconduct was tolerated in the department. He described how informants and Golubski's ex-wife complained that Golubski was soliciting prostitutes. Golubski also was caught having sex with a woman in his office, he said.",
      "\"It's kind of like a boys will be boys type thing,\" said Seifert, who was forced into early retirement for refusing to conceal a motorist's beating by a federal agent in 2003.",
      "McCloskey said in an interview that Golubski had women \"at his mercy.\"",
      "The inquiry into Golubski stems from the case of Lamonte McIntyre, who started writing to McCloskey's nonprofit nearly two decades ago.",
      "McIntyre was just 17 in 1994 when he was arrested and charged in connection with a double homicide, within hours of the crimes. He had an alibi; no physical evidence linked him to the killings; and an eyewitness believed the killer was an underling of a local drug dealer. Golubski and the dealer have since been charged in a separate federal case of running a violent sex trafficking operation.",
      "The eyewitness only testified that McIntyre was the killer after Golubski and a now disbarred attorney threatened to take her children away, she alleged in a lawsuit.",
      "\"I want to spend the rest of my life being happy,\" McIntyre told CBS News in 2018 after being released from prison. \"I don't want to be bitter. That's taking away from me. I don't have any more time to give.\"",
      "McIntyre's mother said in a 2014 affidavit that she wonders whether her refusal to grant regular sexual favors to Golubski prompted him to retaliate against her son.",
      "\"She, like many people in the community, just viewed the police as all-powerful,\" said Cheryl Pilate, an attorney who helped free McIntyre in 2017.",
      "In 2022, the local government agreed to pay $12.5 million to McIntyre and his mother to settle a lawsuit after a deposition in which Golubski invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent 555 times. The state also paid McIntyre $1.5 million.",
      "\"That was the thread that gave people some courage,\" said Lindsay Runnels, who serves on the board of the Midwest Innocence Project.",
      "Women say they were threatened and mocked",
      "Prosecutors say Golubski drove one of the women at the center of their criminal case to a cemetery and told her to find a spot to dig her own grave. He sexually assaulted her repeatedly, starting when she was just in middle school, leading her to suffer a miscarriage, court filings say.",
      "Once, prosecutors say, he forced her to crawl on the ground with a dog leash around her neck in a remote spot near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers. With no one around, he is accused of chanting, \"Down by the river, said a hank a pank; Where they won't find her until she stank.\"",
      "Golubski introduced himself to Ophelia Williams, the other woman at the center of the case, by complimenting her legs and nightgown as police searched her home, prosecutors said.",
      "Williams was terrified at the time because her 14-year-old twins had just been arrested in a double homicide. They ultimately admitted to the crime so police would free their 13-year-old brother, Williams said in a separate lawsuit.",
      "Golubski began sexually assaulting her, alternating between threatening her and claiming he could help her sons, according to court records in the criminal case. The twins are now 40 and remain behind bars. The lawsuit she is part of questions their confessions.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name alleged victims of sexual assault, but Williams has told her story publicly.",
      "Williams said in her lawsuit that she once mentioned making a complaint. She claims Golubski told her: \"Report me to who, the police? I am the police.\"",

She was nude, and the subsequent autopsy that confirmed Whitney's name also determined her cause of death to be asphyxia from strangulation and probable smothering. She was believed to have been sexually assaulted, which additional autopsy findings supported, according to the Pierce County Sheriff's Department, which operates in the area around Tacoma and investigated Whitney's case.",
      "Whitney was 18 when she died. At the time, Pierce County detectives tried to develop leads as they searched for whomever was responsible in her murder. They interviewed people who knew Whitney, and people who had dated her, as the probe got underway. But despite collecting DNA samples from the body that presumably belonged to the killer, investigators were unable to pinpoint a suspect.",
      "The case remained unsolved for years. In 2005, another effort to find the suspect by running those DNA samples through CODIS \u2014 a national database that law enforcement can use to link forensic profiles to crimes and suspects called the Combined DNA Index System \u2014 ultimately proved unsuccessful as no matches were found, according to the Pierce County sheriff.",
      "Tracy Whitney Cold Case Solved\n\nOn August 28th 1988, Pierce County Deputies responded to a call of a body found in the Puyallup River near Sumner. Some fisherman had located the body of a woman who was nude right where the Puyallup and White Rivers meet. \n\nDetectives were called out to the scene and an autopsy was performed. The autopsy revealed the woman's cause of death was asphyxia caused by strangulation and probable smothering. She had several blunt force injuries and was believed to have been sexually assaulted. Her death was ruled a homicide and DNA swabs taken from the body.\n\nDetectives interviewed everyone who knew or had dated Tracy to try and find the killer. Unfortunately the case went cold for years. \n\nIn 2005 the suspect DNA was sent in to CODIS, however no matches could be found.

Detectives matched the suspect DNA to  Guillot's biological son to confirm Guillot Jr. was the suspect. \n\nThere were no connections between Tracy and Guillot Jr and detectives believe this was a stranger abduction, rape and murder.\n\nOur Cold Case Unit is always looking into the past trying to find answers for families just like Tracy's. We are glad they can finally have an answer and some closure with the solving of this case.",
      "It wasn't until 2022, owing to a grant from the Washington State Attorney General's Office, that a Pierce County sheriff's cold case detective submitted the DNA to a genetic genealogy laboratory for repeat testing. Genetic Genealogy is a process where forensic analysts build a family tree from a DNA profile, which in this case allowed law enforcement to identify Whitney's killer by way of a family member.",
      "Findings from the genealogy lab led detectives to the biological son of their suspect in Whitney's death, John Guillot, Jr., and confirmed that the elder Guillot was in fact a match for the DNA, according to the Pierce County sheriff. Guillot, the suspect, died from cancer in January 2022, just eight months before the lab returned the DNA match that implicated him in the murder.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns this week from a Thanksgiving recess with a number of priorities to get through before the end of the year, while a deadline to fund the government looms over lawmakers.",
      "With the new Congress set to be sworn in on Jan. 3, lawmakers are pushing through a list of to-dos in the coming weeks in the lame-duck session, while Republicans gear up for leadership in Washington next year.",
      "But first, Congress must address government funding, since lawmakers only have until Dec. 20 to approve new spending. And although a shutdown remains unlikely, leaders will need to reach an agreement on a short-term funding measure in the weeks ahead.",
      "Funding the government",
      "In September, lawmakers approved a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through Dec. 20, setting a pre-holiday deadline to prevent a shutdown that has become commonplace for Congress. With frustration among some conservatives over the practice, House Speaker Mike Johnson made clear at the time that he opposed an omnibus package to fund the government, suggesting that the House would work to approve the 12 full-year spending bills individually after the election. But the favorable results for Republicans in the 2024 elections appeared to change the calculus.",
      "Republicans appear likely to push to punt the deadline into the early days of President-elect Donald Trump's administration, though the exact timeline for the stopgap measure remains a key question. The deadline will tee up a larger fight over government spending, with Republicans set to control the House, Senate and the White House \u2014 and looking to make significant spending cuts while juggling the extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Lawmakers also have disaster aid to consider after the Biden administration requested $98 billion in aid to address the aftermath of Hurricanes Milton and Helene in the southeast.",
      "The funding fight comes as Johnson is looking to hold onto his gavel in the new year, with a narrow House majority that's proven problematic for Republicans seeking the speakership in recent years. Republicans have already selected Johnson to be their nominee for speaker in January, and the full House will elect a speaker when lawmakers are sworn in next month.",
      "Senate Republicans meet with Trump's administration picks",
      "Senate Republicans are expected to continue meeting with Trump's picks for top posts in his administration this week, looking to secure support in the upper chamber, which has the role of confirming the intended nominees.",
      "Ahead of their recess, Senate Republicans met with Trump picks including Pete Hegseth and former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who then opted to withdraw his name from consideration for Attorney General following intense scrutiny over a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. On Monday, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa is set to meet with former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who Trump tapped for Attorney General after Gaetz withdrew.",
      "Trump has continued to announce his picks for the top posts, including Kash Patel, a 44-year-old who served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term and has a reputation as a controversial figure, for FBI director. The announcement came as Trump-nominated Christopher Wray's term isn't set to expire until 2027.",
      "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump tapped to lead the newly coined Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, will also be on Capitol Hill this week, meeting Thursday with Senate and House Republicans.",
      "House Ethics Committee meets to consider Gaetz report",
      "The House Ethics Committee is set to meet Thursday to further consider whether to release the report about its investigation into Gaetz, after the evenly split bipartisan panel failed to reach an agreement in an hourslong meeting last month.",
      "A day later, Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration, further complicating the ethics committee's decision about whether to release the report. Gaetz' resignation from the House after his selection for attorney general had ended the committee's jurisdiction over him, making the release of the report all the more controversial. The Republican committee chairmen said he voted against the release of the report over the jurisdiction issue.",
      "Still, some view the report's release as essential if Gaetz is eyeing other offices, like another post within Trump's administration or running for Florida governor down the road.",
      "The Ethics Committee's investigation first began in 2021, but was put on pause as the Justice Department conducted a sex trafficking and obstruction probe of Gaetz. Last year, the Ethics Committee resumed its work, after prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz, who has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "Senate Democrats hold leadership elections",
      "Senate Democrats, who will be in the minority in the new Congress, are expected to meet Tuesday to elect their leadership for the next two years, after Republicans flipped the chamber in the 2024 elections.",
      "Though the top posts in Democratic leadership are expected to remain unchanged, with Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and whip Dick Durbin seeking to remain in their roles, the no. 3 post is up for grabs as Sen. Debbie Stabenow set to retire.",
      "Stabenow, who is leaving the Senate after more than two decades, chairs the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. The post has been eyed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.",
      "The leadership races come as Senate Democrats are making a final push on their agenda, with a focus on confirming President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts. Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's 234 judicial confirmations from his first term during the lame-duck session, but have run into resistance from Republicans looking to hold up and drag out the process.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said . \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "The Syrian military and its ally Russia conducted deadly joint air raids Monday on areas that Islamist-led rebels seized control of over the weekend. The strikes were a response to a lightning offensive by the rebels that saw them wrest control of swathes of northwest Syria from government forces.",

On Saturday, rebels, including many with the U.S.-designated Islamic terrorist group Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS), took control of the major city of Aleppo in northern Syria.",

The ensuing war is thought to have killed around 500,000 people but, for the last several years, it had simmered as a stalemate. Government forces have controlled the west and south of the country, American-backed rebels have dominated the northeast, and Islamist rebel factions \u2014 including the ones now in control of Aleppo \u2014 have held most of the northwest.",
      "\"We are coming Damascus,\" the rebels chanted Sunday, threatening to push on next toward Syria's national capital and the Assad government's stronghold.",
      "The balance in the stalemate started changing last week, when the Islamist-led rebel alliance in the northwest launched its offensive. Over the weekend, HTS and allied factions took control of Aleppo city for the first time since the civil war started more than a decade ago, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitoring group's director Rami Abdel Rahman.",
      "Aleppo, an ancient city dominated by its landmark citadel, is home to two million people. It was the scene of fierce battles earlier in the conflict but, until Sunday, the rebels had never managed to totally seize it. Video showed rebels in military fatigues patrolling the streets of Aleppo, with some setting fire to a Syrian flag and others holding up the green, red, black and white flag of the revolution.",

      "He insisted it wasn't true that Georgia's European integration had been halted. \"The only thing we have rejected is the shameful and offensive blackmail, which was, in fact, a significant obstacle to our country's European integration.\" The government's announcement came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing last month's general election in Georgia as neither free nor fair.",
      "Kobakhidze also dismissed the U.S. State Department's statement Saturday that it was suspending its strategic partnership with Georgia. The statement condemned Georgia's decision to halt its efforts toward EU accession.",
      "\"You can see that the outgoing administration is trying to leave the new administration with as difficult a legacy as possible. They are doing this regarding Ukraine, and now also concerning Georgia,\" Kobakhidze said. \"This will not have any fundamental significance.

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:44:15 -0500",
    "summary": "After a childhood behind the Iron Curtain, Angela Merkel served as Chancellor of a united Germany for 16 years, becoming the most powerful woman in the world while dealing with its most powerful men. She talks about her new book, \"Freedom: Memoirs 1954-2021.\"",
    "story": [
      "We met former German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a fitting place for her: the museum in Berlin dedicated to the Wall, that great symbol of the Cold War division between East and West. Parts of the wall have been preserved as a reminder of those hard times, especially for someone who lived through them.",
      "She said images of the wall still conjure up highly emotional memories for her.",
      "I asked, \"When you look at the wall, what comes to mind to you immediately?\"",
      "\"Between the ages of seven and 35, I had to live with this wall,\" she replied. \"I was, so to speak, behind the wall, and couldn't come to this side. And of course, that's still very moving.\"",
      "Merkel's new book, \"Freedom: Memoirs 1954-2021\" (published by St. Martin's Press), is filled with moving memories of what it was like growing up in the Communist-controlled police state that was East Germany. Her family had moved there when she was an infant because her father, a Protestant pastor, was assigned to a church there. But it was the fall of the wall that spurred her political awakening, and jump-started a career nobody would have bet on: A woman, from the East, who would not only become Chancellor of Germany, but who would hold the job for 16 years; who would be called the most powerful woman in the world, and who would deal with its most powerful men.",
      "It turns out, life in the East actually had given her one advantage for dealing with all those men in dark suits: Those bright pant suits of hers weren't an accident. \"In my book I write that maybe my love for colorful clothes is due to the fact that in the East, everything was very gray,\" she said.",
      "Merkel's uniform became part of her identity, and helped her break through the American pop-cultural barrier, on \"Saturday Night Live,\" the way few European leaders could.",
      "Merkel left power three years ago this week, and has gone into a kind of self-imposed political radio silence since then, keeping her recollections and opinions to herself.",
      "Not anymore.",
      "Among the more awkward memories: that first shocking, even embarrassing, meeting with President Donald Trump in 2017.",
      "I said, \"I think it's fair to say your most difficult relationship with an American president was with President Trump in his first term. You talk about your first encounter in the Oval Office where he refused to shake your hand, and you say that it occurred to you that he was fascinated with Putin and with politicians with authoritarian and dictatorial traits. Why did you say that?\"",
      "\"Why he didn't want to shake my hand, that, you'd have to ask him,\" Merkel replied. \"I think he often conveyed a message with a handshake. With some men he shook hands for a long time.\"",
      "\"What were you thinking? Should I reach over? Will we shake hands? Won't we shake hands? What's he trying to do?\"",
      "\"I describe it in my book because it was so interesting. I whispered to him, 'I think they want us to shake hands.' And at that moment when I said it, I noticed that he wanted to convey a message. And I was quite na\u00efve, telling him that they want us to shake hands.\"",
      "\"But did you get what he was trying to do?\" I asked. \"Did you think, Oh, he's going to play it that way, that's how we're going to do it?\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's the way it was. I left being convinced that multilateral cooperation would be difficult with Donald Trump,\" Merkel replied. \"You can make deals with Donald Trump because he always thinks in terms of advantage and disadvantage. But in my experience, win-win situations are not only good for one side, but for both sides. That's not really his way of thinking.\"",
      "Merkel's book, which is being released around the world, went to press before last month's election. In it, she wrote that she wishes \"with all my heart that Kamala Harris defeats her competitor and becomes president.\"",
      "Of the election results, she said, \"I was sad. First of all, I wanted a woman to win. I was also in favor of Hillary Clinton. And secondly, I'm closer to Kamala Harris' political conviction. But the American voters have decided, and it was a democratic election.\"",
      "Merkel has come in for her own share of criticism since she left office. Her decision to allow more than a million refugees and migrants fleeing Syria into Germany is now often cited as a reason for the rise of anti-immigrant, right-wing political parties in Europe. She says those forces were on the rise anyway.",
      "Her decision to allow the German economy to become too dependent on Russian natural gas is seen as another reason for Germany's economic decline since the flow was stopped.",
      "She says staying engaged with Vladimir Putin seemed like the right idea at the time, difficult though it was. And it didn't stop him from invading Ukraine.",
      "I asked, \"You dealt a lot with Vladimir Putin. I take it, reading between the lines of your book, that you found him a very difficult and manipulative character as well, even an intimidating character at times. Famously, you don't like dogs; he'd bring his dog to the meeting. Do you think he did that in an intimidating kind of way? And how would you suggest people deal with him, especially as things are heating up again?\"",
      "\"Without fear,\" she replied. \"Of course, there are attempts to see how people react under a certain amount of pressure. And Putin can do that, too. And with the dog he expressed exactly that. But it all depends on how I manage the situation. I'm used to political pressure since childhood, so that did not shock me.\"",
      "Despite all her experience, Merkel says she now refrains from giving advice. But she does give hints. She says that, in general, she is worried about developments in the world: \"I've always said that fear is not a good advisor. Times have become rougher. We are now sitting in a place where the world was divided in the Cold War, and then there was 1990. We had great hopes that things would become easier after the end of the Cold War. Things have not become easier.\"",

They faced little to no resistance from government troops, according to fighters and activists.",
      "A war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the insurgents led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham seized control of Aleppo International airport, the first international airport to be controlled by insurgents. The fighters claimed they seized the airport and posted pictures from there.",
      "Thousands of fighters also moved on, facing almost no opposition from government forces, to seize towns and villages in northern Hama, a province where they had a presence before being expelled by government troops in 2016. They claimed Saturday evening to have entered the city of Hama.",
      "Assad's forces caught by surprise",
      "The swift and surprise offensive is a huge embarrassment for Syria's President Bashar Assad and raises questions about his armed forces' preparedness. The insurgent offensive launched from their stronghold in the country's northwest appeared to have been planned for years. It also comes at a time when Assad's allies were preoccupied with their own conflicts.",
      "In his first public comments since the start of the offensive, released by the state news agency Saturday evening, Assad said Syria will continue to \"defend its stability and territorial integrity against terrorists and their supporters.\" He added that Syria is able to defeat them no matter how much their attacks intensify.",
      "Turkey, a main backer of Syrian opposition groups, said its diplomatic efforts had failed to stop government attacks on opposition-held areas in recent weeks, which were in violation of a de-escalation agreement sponsored by Russia, Iran and Ankara. Turkish security officials said a limited offensive by the rebels was planned to stop government attacks and allow civilians to return, but the offensive expanded as Syrian government forces began to retreat from their positions.",
      "The insurgents, led by the Salafi jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and including Turkey-backed fighters, launched their shock offensive on Wednesday.

      "French authorities had escorted her to the plane but were not traveling with her. She became disruptive while on board and police were called to remove her.",

      "The woman has a driver's license showing she is a Philadelphia resident. She is in the U.S. on a green card, according to a person familiar who did not immediately know what her native country was. The French Ministry of the Interior identified her as a Russian national.",
      "The situation initially unfolded Tuesday, when the woman boarded Delta Flight No. 265 from JFK Airport to Paris without a boarding pass. The flight was not sold out, and she was discovered when a flight attendant became concerned that the woman was making frequent and lengthy visits to various lavatories aboard the Boeing 767-400ER, according to a source familiar with the incident.",

      "\"I heard them saying, like, we have a passenger who we think was hiding in the lavatory during takeoff,\" Jackson said. \"She does not have a seat. She did not have a boarding pass. And basically, she's a stowaway.\"",
      "A Transportation Security Administration source told CBS News that the woman went through an advanced imaging technology body scanner at a checkpoint in JFK Airport after somehow appearing to evade the document and ID check portion of the TSA process. Her bags were also scanned for prohibited items before she went to the gate and snuck onto the flight, the source said.",
      "A TSA spokesperson confirmed in a statement that the woman \"without a boarding pass was physically screened without any prohibited items\" and then \"bypassed two identity verification and boarding status stations and boarded the aircraft.\"",
      "After getting through TSA security, it's unclear how exactly the woman boarded the plane without showing a boarding pass or passport to Delta staff.",

      "\"Add these things on a daily basis, and I promise this will help you gently get the bad stuff out and move you into a much healthier, stronger gut state,\" he said.",
      "1. Increase fiber intake",
      "Fiber is critical to digestive health, according to Gioffre.",
      "\"When we have more fiber-rich foods, it's like brushing the inner walls of our intestines \u2014 and that's going to help us remove the constipation and get to where we want to go,\" the doctor said.",
      "Constipation affects 42 million Americans each day.",
      "Some of his suggested fiber-rich foods are quinoa, wild rice, sweet potatoes, root vegetables, and squashes like winter squash and spaghetti squash.",

      "\"When you drink this on an empty stomach, it's going to go into all the little nooks and crannies of your gut \u2026 and it's going to help you start to detoxify and gently give you that \u2018internal shower\u2019 effect.\"",
      "2. Reduce inflammation",
      "\"At the end of the day, we don't die of old age \u2014 we die of inflammation,\" Gioffre cautioned.",

      "Suggestions for fiber-rich foods include quinoa, wild rice, sweet potatoes, root vegetables, and squashes like winter squash and spaghetti squash. (iStock)",
      "Some plant-based foods that lower inflammation include chia seeds, flax seeds, hemp seeds, avocado and coconut oil.",

      "\"Magnesium-rich powerhouses relax your intestinal muscles, soften stools and keep things moving, all while feeding your healthy gut bacteria.\" (iStock)",

      "A high-quality magnesium supplement can also combat this deficiency and give the body the support it needs, he added.",
      "\"You can also do an Epsom salts bath, which is magnesium sulfate,\" he added, or apply magnesium lotion to the skin.",

      "\"Combining proper hydration with regular movement creates a powerful, drug-free strategy to support digestive health and prevent constipation.\"",

      "\"It can also increase your happiness, improve your relationships and give you a boost in mental strength that you'll likely need during the day.\"",
      "2. Don\u2019t skip breakfast",
      "It might seem wise to forgo the meal leading up to Thanksgiving, with the idea of \"making room\" for the main food event, but experts say that\u2019s not a good idea.",
      "\"When you skip breakfast or lunch, you tend to be ravenous by the time you do eat, and that sets you up for overeating as you overindulge,\" Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Consumer Health Digest based in Wyoming, told Fox News Digital.",

      "3. Choose foods wisely",
      "Among the many options on the Thanksgiving table, some choices are better than others.",

      "\"A slower pace of eating will help improve digestion and help you recognize comfortable fullness.\"",
      "Another reason to slow down is that the faster you eat (and the less you chew), the more stomach acids have to work to break down foods, which leads to gas, bloating and reflux, Schopis added.",
      "5. Drink water with dinner",
      "This tip comes from Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and the owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition in Raleigh, North Carolina.",
      "GIVING THANKS CAN MAKE YOU HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"Keeping alcohol to a minimum will help you feel much better while you eat and afterward,\" she told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"Choose to speak about things you have in common and reminisce over good memories,\" Amodio recommended.",
      "Some other ideas include bringing old photo albums, playing board games and taking breaks throughout the day by stepping into another room as needed.",
      "7. Take guilt off the menu",
      "\"Remember that Thanksgiving is just one day and guilt is not a food group,\" said Elizabeth Harris, a registered dietitian in Maryland.",
      "\"Consider how you want to feel after your holiday meal and do your best to walk your choices backwards from there.\"",

      "Look for smart swaps",

      "\"For example, choose roasted vegetables instead of buttery casseroles or opt for turkey breast without gravy to reduce unnecessary fat,\" he suggested.",

      "\"Remember, fat slows gastric emptying \u2013 it\u2019s why you feel full when you eat a fatty meal.\"",
      "When taking GLP-1 medications, gastric emptying is already slowed, Osborn noted, which means too much fat ingested in one sitting will cause nausea and potential vomiting.",
      "Opt for smaller portions",
      "The experts recommended doling out smaller portions of favorite dishes.",
      "\"You can enjoy traditional Thanksgiving dishes, but in much smaller quantities,\" Osborn said. \"Focus on a few bites of high-calorie dishes rather than full servings.\"",
      "Reierson agreed, adding, \"You can still enjoy all the variety and bounty of the meal without overeating.\"",
      "\"Listen to your body, and don\u2019t feel pressured to eat a whole plate if you\u2019re not hungry.\"",
      "Eat mindfully",
      "Overindulging while on GLP-1 medications can lead to nausea or discomfort, Osborn warned.",
      "\"Listen to your body, and don\u2019t feel pressured to eat a whole plate if you\u2019re not hungry,\" he said. \"It\u2019s OK to take small bites, chew slowly and savor the flavors.\"",
      "\"You can still enjoy all the variety and bounty of the meal without overeating,\" an expert said. (iStock)",
      "As these medications will help you feel full sooner, it\u2019s important to pay close attention to your body\u2019s signals, he noted.",
      "\"Remember, there is a delay between eating and one\u2019s perception of satiety,\" Osborn said. \"And this can hit you like a tidal wave if you\u2019re not careful.\"",
      "He added, \"Stop eating as soon as you feel satisfied, not stuffed.\"",
      "Plan for leftovers",
      "If you can\u2019t clear your plate in one sitting, simply pack it up and take it home.",
      "\"You can enjoy your favorite holiday dishes over several days, so there is no need to overeat during the meal,\" Reierson noted.",
      "Stay hydrated",
      "Hydration is important for everyone, but particularly those on GLP-1 medications.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "Since \"GLP-1 medications can slow gastric emptying, dehydration can worsen side effects. Drink water throughout the day and shortly after your meals.\"",

      "\"Avoid the temptation to skip meals earlier in the day to \u2018save up\u2019 for the big meal,\" Reierson advised.",
      "\"This will often backfire and can lead to overeating and discomfort.\"",
      "Keep it simple and polite",
      "If someone comments on your small portion size, Osborn recommended keeping it \"simple and polite.\"",

      "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to discuss what Americans should be concerned about with the data breach; he also talks about Apple's bold new move toward AI.",
      "There are companies whose entire business model is built around collecting personal data, including criminal records, employment details, addresses and more. They use this data to offer background check services to other businesses and individuals. However, while they profit from this information, they often fail to adequately protect it. Earlier this year, the National Public Data made headlines for\u00a0failing to secure 2.7 billion records of people whose data it collected. Now, on a smaller scale, another data aggregator has exposed the personal information of 600,000 Americans.",

      "Illustration of a hacker (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What information leaked?",
      "As reported by\u00a0Website Planet, the exposed database contained 644,869 PDF files, totaling 713.1 GB of sensitive data. These documents mainly consisted of background checks but also included court records, vehicle ownership details such as license plates and VINs, and property ownership reports. The background checks alone revealed highly sensitive personal data, including full names, home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, employment details, information about family members, social media accounts and criminal histories.",
      "The worst part is that the database was left publicly accessible without password protection or encryption, allowing anyone to grab it. Anyone with the link could view and download the files. Plus, the files were named in a way that exposed personal details, using formats like \"First_Middle_Last_State.PDF.\" This made sensitive information visible even without opening the files.",

      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",

      "The database that exposed over 600,000 records belongs to SL Data Services LLC, an information research provider that appears to prioritize convenience over basic data security. The company operates a sprawling network of around 16 websites, including Propertyrec, which advertises real estate ownership data and property records. However, SL Data Services\u2019 business goes far beyond property records, offering services like criminal background checks, DMV records and even birth and death records.",
      "While Propertyrec promotes its affordability, claiming users can search for documents for as little as $1, customer reviews paint a different picture. Many users report being unknowingly enrolled in subscription services, resulting in recurring charges instead of the promised one-time fees. This predatory business practice raises further questions about the company\u2019s ethics and transparency.",

      "How could the leak affect people?",
      "The exposure of sensitive personal info in this breach is a big deal for the people involved. The database has detailed data about them, and that\u2019s basically a jackpot for cybercriminals. This kind of leak can lead to various dangerous outcomes.",
      "For one, attackers could use this info to run phishing scams or social engineering tricks. If they know details like your job, family or even criminal history, they can send super convincing messages to trick you into sharing even more sensitive details, like your financial info. That\u2019s not all. Criminals could also use this leaked data to impersonate someone and apply for loans, credit cards or other services in their name.",
      "What really gets me, though, is that most people whose info got leaked probably won\u2019t even find out about it unless they\u2019re using a service to remove their data. A lot of them might not have even known they were being background-checked in the first place. For those with criminal records, this kind of leak could cause major reputational damage or lead to discrimination, even if the info is outdated or flat-out wrong.",

      "7 ways to protect yourself from data leaks",
      "1) Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can promise to completely erase your data from the internet, using a data removal service is one of the best steps you can take. They do the heavy lifting by actively scanning and removing your personal information from hundreds of websites. This helps protect you from scammers who may cross-reference data from breaches with other information they find on the dark web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With your address exposed, bad actors could try to scam you through physical mail. They may impersonate companies or people you trust and send fake urgent letters about things like missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Be skeptical of unexpected communications and verify any claims before taking action.",
      "3) Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: The leaked data could lead to phishing attacks via email, phone calls or messages from unknown sources. Be on high alert for any requests for personal information, especially if they seem urgent or ask you to click on suspicious links. Always verify the legitimacy of any request before responding.",
      "To protect your devices from malicious links, make sure you have strong antivirus protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, it\u2019s crucial to start regularly reviewing your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts. Keep an eye out for any unauthorized transactions and report them immediately to your bank or credit card company to prevent further damage.",
      "5) Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex passwords for each of your online accounts and consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them securely.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement this extra layer of security on all accounts that offer it to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "7) Regularly update your software: Keep your operating system, apps and security tools\u00a0up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s alarming how many companies profit from collecting personal data, yet fail to protect it adequately. Recent breaches, including one exposing the sensitive information of 600,000 Americans, highlight this negligence. With unprotected databases containing everything from criminal records to addresses, cybercriminals have a treasure trove of information to exploit. This situation underscores the urgent need for you to take proactive steps to safeguard your privacy and demand better security practices from these data aggregators.",

It can be a gateway for scammers to access your personal information and wreak havoc on your life. From\u00a0phishing attempts to extortion, the risks are numerous and varied. Here are nine ways scammers can exploit your phone number if it falls into the wrong hands:",
      "Scammers can also use your phone number to launch rather easy\u00a0phishing attacks. They might send text messages or make calls posing as your bank or a popular online service that you subscribe to. The goal is to call you and trick you into providing login credentials, credit card details or other personal information, which they can then use for fraudulent activities. And once they have all your other information, they can do a lot more damage just by having your phone number as that initial segue.",
      "In some cases, scammers use your phone number for extortion or blackmail. They may claim to have compromising information about you and demand payment to keep it private. By contacting you directly, they can apply continuous pressure, making their threats seem more real and immediate.",
      "One unique way they do this to target elderly people is by pretending to be your grandchild or another relative in distress. The scammer often claims that your grandchild is in an emergency situation \u2014 such as needing bail money or medical assistance \u2014 and urgently requests financial help. With AI voice cloning technology, they may even be able to use your grandchild's voice. This emotional manipulation usually gets the victim to pay up.",
      "This one may not be as dramatic, but your phone number can be sold to\u00a0robocall and spam message services. These automated systems bombard you with unwanted calls and texts, often promoting scams or fraudulent products.

      "Illustration of a scammer with cash in his hand\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone number spoofing is a common tactic where scammers disguise their caller ID to appear as a trusted contact by calling from what appears to be a familiar number as it may have the same area code where you live, an area code where your friends or family live or even the actual phone number of someone close which you can recognize.",
      "This makes it more likely that you'll answer the call, giving them the opportunity to deceive you into revealing personal information or transferring money. This is, of course, the case when phone spoofing is used against you. But in situations where they use YOUR phone number, they can be scamming those close to you without you even knowing!",
      "With these phone spoofing tactics, scammers can use your phone number to\u00a0impersonate government officials, such as IRS agents or Social Security administrators. They may call you claiming there\u2019s an urgent issue, like unpaid taxes or suspicious activity involving your Social Security number. This ploy often involves threats of legal action or arrest to pressure you into providing sensitive information or making immediate payments.",
      "Instead of pretending to be from a government agency, another trick is for scammers to try their luck by posing as a representative from a utility company, like an electric or water company. Scammers will claim that you have an overdue invoice and threaten to cut off your service unless you pay immediately. Using your phone number, they can contact you repeatedly, making the scam seem more legitimate (and pressing).",
      "SIM swapping or a\u00a0port-out scam is when scammers transfer your phone number to a new SIM card in their possession. By convincing your mobile carrier to reroute your number, they can receive all your calls and messages, including those containing two-factor authentication codes. This allows them to bypass security measures and take over your online accounts.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "With SIM swapping techniques/port-out, scammers can also use your phone number as a key to access sensitive data stored in your online accounts. By initiating password resets and intercepting verification codes sent via SMS, they can gain unauthorized access to your email, social media and banking accounts, leading to significant personal and financial damage.",
      "Finally, scammers can use all the tactics above to not only access the accounts you already have but also create fake online accounts in your name. These accounts can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as spreading malware, launching further scams or conducting identity theft.

      "Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier has the latest on regulatory uncertainty amid AI development on 'Special Report.'",
      "An increasing number of companies are using artificial intelligence (AI) for everyday tasks.\u00a0Much of the technology is helping with productivity and keeping the public safer. However, some industries are pushing back against certain aspects of AI. And some industry leaders are working to balance the good and the bad.",
      "\"We are looking at critical infrastructure owners and operators, businesses from water and health care and transportation and communication, some of which are starting to integrate some of these AI capabilities,\" said U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly. \"We want to make sure that they're integrating them in a way where they are not introducing a lot of new risk.\"",
      "US AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY TESTS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: 'A LOT OF POTENTIAL'",
      "Consulting firm Deloitte recently surveyed leaders of business organizations from around the world. The findings showed uncertainty over government regulations was a bigger issue than actually implementing AI technology. When asked about the top barrier to deploying AI tools, 36% ranked regulatory compliance first, 30% said difficulty managing risks, and 29% said lack of a governance model.",
      "Easterly says despite some of the risks AI can pose, she said she is not surprised that the government has not taken more steps to regulate the technology.",
      "\"These are going to be the most powerful technologies of our century, probably more,\" Easterly said. \"Most of these technologies are being built by private companies that are incentivized to provide returns for their shareholders. So we do need to ensure that government has a role in establishing safeguards to ensure that these technologies are being built in a way that prioritizes security. And that's where I think that Congress can have a role in ensuring that these technologies are as safe and secure to be used and implemented by the American people.\"",
      "An increasing number of companies are using AI for everyday tasks. (iStock)",
      "Congress has considered overarching protections for AI, but it has mostly been state governments enacting the rules.",
      "\"There are certainly many things that are positive about what AI does. It also, when fallen into the hands of bad actors, it can destroy [the music] industry,\" said Gov. Bill Lee, R-Tenn., while signing state legislation in March to protect musicians from AI.",
      "The Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security Act, or ELVIS Act, classifies vocal likeness as a property right. Lee signed the legislation this year, making Tennessee the first state to enact protections for singers. Illinois and California have since passed similar laws. Other states, including Tennessee, have laws that determine names, photographs and likenesses are also considered a property right.",
      "\"Our voices and likenesses are indelible parts of us that have enabled us to showcase our talents and grow our audiences, not mere digital kibble for a machine to duplicate without consent,\" country recording artist Lainey Wilson said during a congressional hearing on AI and intellectual property.",

      "Wilson argued her image and likeness were used through AI to sell products that she had not previously endorsed.",
      "\"For decades, we have taken advantage of technology that, frankly, was not created to be secure. It was created for speed to market or cool features. And frankly, that's why we have cybersecurity,\" Easterly said.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has cracked down on some deceptive AI marketing techniques. It launched \"Operation AI Comply\" in September, which tackles unfair and deceptive business practices using AI, such as fake reviews written by chatbots.",
      "\"I am a technologist at heart, and I am an optimist at heart. And so I am incredibly excited about some of these capabilities. And I am not concerned about some of the Skynet things. I do want to make sure that this technology is designed and developed and tested and delivered in a way to ensure that security is prioritized,\" Easterly said.",
      "A close-up of the icon of the ChatGPT artificial intelligence chatbot app logo on a cellphone screen.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Chatbots have had some good reviews. Hawaii approved a law this year to invest more in research utilizing AI tools in the health care field. It comes as one study finds, OpenAI\u2019s chatbot outperformed doctors in diagnosing medical conditions. The experiment compared doctors using ChatGPT with those using conventional resources. Both groups scored around 75% accuracy, while the chatbot alone scored above 90%.",
      "AI isn\u2019t just being used for disease detection, it\u2019s also helping emergency crews detect catastrophic events. After deadly wildfires devastated Maui, Hawaii state lawmakers also allocated funds to the University of Hawaii to map statewide wildfire risks and improve forecasting technologies. It also includes $1 million for an AI-driven platform. Hawaiian Electric is also deploying high-resolution cameras across the state.",

      "California and Colorado have similar technology. Within minutes, the AI can detect when a fire begins and where it may spread.",
      "AI is also being used to keep students safe. Several school districts around the country now have firearm detection systems. One in Utah notifies officials within seconds of when a gun might be on campus.",

      "Maryland and Massachusetts are also considering state funds to implement similar technology. Both states voted to establish commissions to study emerging firearm technologies. Maryland\u2019s commission will determine whether to use school construction funding to build the systems. Massachusetts members will look at risks associated with the new technology.",
      "\"We want to use these capabilities to ensure that we can better defend the critical infrastructure that Americans rely on every hour of every day,\" Easterly said.",
      "The European Union passed regulations for AI this year. It ranks risks from minimal, which have no regulations, to unacceptable, which are banned. Chatbots are classified as specific transparency and are required to inform users they are interacting with a machine. Software for critical infrastructure is considered high risk and must comply with strict requirements. Most technology that profiles individuals or uses public images to build-up databases is considered unacceptable.",

      "\"We need to stay ahead in America to ensure that we win this race for artificial intelligence. And so it takes the investment, it takes the innovation,\" Easterly said. \"We have to be an engine of innovation that makes America the greatest economy on the face of the earth.\"",

      "In the remote reaches of Siberia, a colossal scar on the Earth's surface is expanding at a breathtaking pace, swallowing up the frozen landscape and potentially unleashing ancient threats. The Batagaika crater, aptly nicknamed the \"Gateway to Hell,\" is not just a geological curiosity, it's a stark reminder of the rapid changes our planet is undergoing.",

This massive thermokarst depression \u2013 a fancy term for a giant permafrost-thaw sinkhole \u2013 is growing at an astonishing rate of 35 million cubic feet each year. To put that into perspective, it's like carving out a small town's worth of earth annually. Currently stretching about 0.6 miles long and 0.5 miles wide at its widest point, this behemoth shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, it's speeding up, driven by a vicious cycle of warming temperatures and melting ice. This study was published in the\u00a0journal Geomorphology.",

      "Despite its name, permafrost isn't actually permanent. It's ground that's remained at or below freezing for at least two years. When this frozen soil thaws, it can't support the weight above it, leading to collapse and the formation of these massive \"slumps.\" The Batagaika crater is a prime example of this process in overdrive. As the permafrost melts, it exposes more soil to sunlight, which then melts more permafrost. It's a feedback loop that's difficult to break, especially in our warming world.",

The steep walls of this mega-slump reveal permafrost layers estimated to be 650,000 years old. That's older than our species. But with ancient ice comes ancient dangers. Scientists have already revived a 48,500-year-old \"zombie virus\" from Arctic permafrost, and there's concern about what other long-dormant pathogens might be awakening.

      "The Batagaika crater isn't just releasing potential pathogens. It's also unleashing a significant amount of carbon into the atmosphere. According to recent studies, this single mega-slump is responsible for releasing 4,000 to 5,000 tons of organic carbon every year. That's equivalent to the annual emissions of about 1,000 cars. This release of carbon, previously locked away in the frozen ground, further contributes to global warming, potentially accelerating the very process that created the crater in the first place.",

      "The Batagaika crater, while extreme, is not unique. It represents a process happening across the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. As our planet continues to warm, more of these massive permafrost thaw features are likely to appear. While some might see the crater as a tourist attraction \u2013 and indeed it has become one \u2013 it's crucial to recognize it as a warning sign. The \"Gateway to Hell\" is more than just a catchy nickname; it's a portal into a possible future where rapid environmental changes reshape our world in ways we're only beginning to understand. The question remains: Will we heed the warning signs and take action, or will we continue to watch as more gateways open across our warming world?",

      "In the 1930s, there were around 6.8 million farms in the United States. The size averaged at around 155 acres. Over the next several decades, the number of farms rapidly declined to around 1.9 million in 2023. Those farms grew larger, averaging around 464 acres.",

      "The most recent data shows 41% of farmers reported labor shortages in 2018. That\u2019s a 27% increase from those reporting shortages in 2014. The trend is expected to continue. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 2% decline in workers through 2033 despite the number of job openings remaining the same.",
      "\"We do more with less. It's not that it has no set way and has totally changed the traditional work, it is empowering, and it is increasing the productivity of existing workers,\" said Ilias Tagkopoulos, a computer science professor at UC Davis and the director of AIFS.",

Whether that has to do with production of different types of vegetables, fruits, nuts, other types of meats or other types of foods,\" Earles said. \"There\u2019s a lot of potential, we think, all the way from going from the research and lab side through startups, through corporate innovation. And we're here to kind of find a way to facilitate and integrate that along the way.\"",

      "How the Spotify scam works",
      "As reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer, this scam works by misusing Spotify\u2019s popularity and trustworthiness. Scammers exploit Spotify playlists by injecting targeted keywords, such as \"free download,\" \"crack\" or \"warez,\" into titles and descriptions.",
      "These keywords are designed to align with popular search terms. Since Spotify\u2019s web player pages are indexed by search engines like Google, these spammy results appear in user searches, driving traffic to their links. For example, a Spotify playlist titled \"Sony Vegas Pro 13 Crack\u2026\" was found promoting \"free\" software sites in its title and description, directing users to questionable external links.",
      "The scam isn\u2019t limited to playlists. It extends to podcasts as well. Scammers create podcasts with multiple short episodes, typically under 20 seconds, using synthesized speech to direct listeners to click links in the description for free content. These podcasts often target users searching for pirated ebooks, audiobooks or game cheats. While the content may appear legitimate at first glance, clicking on the links often results in being redirected to unsafe pages that further exploit users.",

      "7 ways to stay safe from Spotify scams",
      "1. Avoid clicking on suspicious links: Be cautious when you come across playlists or podcasts with titles like \"Sony Vegas Pro 13 Crack\" or other promises of free software, audiobooks or game cheats. These often include links in the description that redirect to unsafe sites hosting malware, adware or phishing pages.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Stick to official sources: Always download software, eBooks or other digital content from trusted official websites or reputable platforms. If you see a Spotify playlist or podcast offering \"free\" versions of paid content, it\u2019s likely a scam. Cross-check the legitimacy of the content through known channels instead of relying on unverified links.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex and unique passwords for your Spotify account and avoid using personal information like birthdays or pet names. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Be skeptical of synthesized speech and short episodes: Many scam podcasts feature short episodes (10-20 seconds) with synthesized speech directing you to click on a link in the description. These are a common tactic used to trick users into visiting unsafe pages. If the content feels automated, vague or overly promotional, it\u2019s best to avoid it.",
      "5. Verify curator credentials: Check the credentials of playlist curators. Legitimate curators usually have a verifiable online presence. If you can't find any information about them, it's best to avoid engaging with them.",
      "6. Recognize phishing attempts: Be cautious of emails claiming to be from Spotify that ask you to confirm account details or click on suspicious links. These are often phishing attempts designed to steal your credentials.",
      "7. Report and block suspicious content: If you come across playlists or podcasts that seem fraudulent or inappropriate,\u00a0report them directly to Spotify. Use Spotify\u2019s reporting tools to flag content that violates its platform rules. Blocking suspicious accounts or playlists also ensures you won\u2019t accidentally interact with them in the future, and reporting helps Spotify improve its filtering and moderation systems.",

      "Scammers will use any means possible to trick you. In the past, we\u2019ve seen bad actors weaponize\u00a0Google search results with malicious websites that install malware when links are clicked on. There have also been plenty of\u00a0SEO scams targeting users. Companies like Spotify need to implement measures to prevent their platforms from being misused by scammers. Google also has a responsibility to ensure the quality of its search results. Just because a webpage comes from a well-known organization doesn\u2019t mean it deserves to rank highly on the search results pages.",

      "1. Display rack gift card trick",
      "One of the latest gift card tricks involves tampering with the gift cards on the display racks at retail stores. Scammers will record the activation code on the card or place a custom barcode sticker over the real barcode, which allows them to secretly load the cash onto their own card immediately after you purchase the gift card. This means that when you or your recipient try to use the gift card, it will be empty or invalid.",
      "Check the packaging of the gift card before buying it. Look for signs of tampering, such as the wrapping being torn or resealed or stickers placed over the barcode or card number. Also, choose a card from the back of the rack, as scammers often place their fraudulent cards at the front of the display.",

      "2. Impersonation gift card trick",
      "Another common gift card trick scammers use involves impersonating someone you know or trust, such as a family member, a romantic interest, a company or the government. Scammers will contact you by phone, text, email or social media and create a fake story or emergency that requires you to send them money urgently.",
      "They will ask you to buy a gift card or multiple gift cards and then send them a photo of the card or the numbers on the back of the card. Once they have the gift card information, they will disappear with your money and cut off contact.",
      "Never send money or gift cards to anyone you don\u2019t know personally or haven\u2019t met in person. If someone claims to be someone you know or trust, verify their identity by contacting them directly through a different channel.",
      "Don\u2019t trust caller ID, as scammers can spoof phone numbers. Don\u2019t be pressured by threats or promises, as scammers use emotional manipulation to get you to act quickly and without thinking. And remember, no legitimate company or government agency will ever ask you to pay them with a gift card.",

      "3. Resale gift card trick",
      "Another gift card trick involves buying or selling gift cards on online platforms, such as websites, apps or social media groups. Scammers will offer to sell you gift cards at a discounted price or buy your unwanted gift cards for cash.",
      "However, they will either send you a fake or empty gift card or take your gift card information and money without sending you anything in return. They may also use stolen credit cards or hacked accounts to buy or sell gift cards, which can put you at risk of fraud or identity theft.",
      "Only buy or sell gift cards from reputable sources, such as official retailers, authorized resellers or trusted friends and family. Avoid buying or selling gift cards from strangers online, especially if they offer a deal that sounds too good to be true.",
      "Don\u2019t share your gift card information or personal details with anyone you don\u2019t know or trust. And use a secure payment method that offers protection, such as a credit card or PayPal, instead of a gift card, wire transfer or cash.",

      "4. Phishing gift card trick",
      "A very popular gift card trick this holiday season\u00a0involves phishing, which is a type of online fraud that tries to trick you into revealing your personal or financial information. Scammers will send you an email, text or pop-up message that looks like it comes from a legitimate company, such as a retailer, bank or\u00a0tech support service.",
      "They will claim that there is a problem with your account, your order, your device or your security and that you need to verify your identity, update your information or fix an issue. They will then ask you to click on a link, open an attachment or call a number and then request that you pay them with a gift card or provide them with your gift card information.",
      "Never click on links, open attachments or call numbers from unsolicited messages, as they may lead to fake or malicious websites or software. Don\u2019t provide any personal or financial information, such as your passwords, PINs, account numbers or gift card numbers, to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.",
      "Don\u2019t trust messages that create a sense of urgency, pressure or fear, as they are designed to make you act without thinking. If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a message, contact the company directly using a verified website, phone number or email address.",
      "Using antivirus protection will help to protect you against scammers and hackers who try to steal your money and personal information using gift card tricks, especially\u00a0through phishing. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on any malicious links, fake websites, phishing emails and text messages is to have strong\u00a0antivirus protection installed and actively running on all your devices. It\u2019s the best to help stop and alert you of any malware in your system and ultimately protect you from being hacked.",

      "A person purchasing a gift card online (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5. Loyalty program gift card trick",
      "This gift card trick involves loyalty programs, which are rewards programs that offer you points, discounts or freebies for being a loyal customer. Scammers will pretend to be representatives of a loyalty program that you are a member of or that you are eligible to join.",
      "They will tell you that you have won a prize, sweepstakes or a promotion and that you need to pay a fee, a tax or a shipping cost to claim it. They will then ask you to pay them with a gift card or provide them with your gift card information.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Be wary of any unsolicited offers or notifications that claim that you have won something, especially if you don\u2019t remember entering or signing up for anything. Don\u2019t pay any money or fees to receive a prize, as legitimate loyalty programs will never ask you to do that. Don\u2019t provide any personal or financial information, such as your passwords, account numbers or gift card numbers, to anyone who contacts you unexpectedly.",
      "Don\u2019t trust messages that create a sense of excitement, curiosity or greed, as they are designed to make you act impulsively. If you have any doubts about the legitimacy of a message, contact the loyalty program directly using a verified website, phone number or email address.",
      "A person purchasing a gift card online (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6. Fake balance checker scam",
      "In this scam, fraudsters set up fake websites or phone services that claim to check the balance of your gift cards. Victims are lured into providing their gift card numbers and PINs under the guise of verifying their balance. Once the information is entered, scammers can drain the funds from the card almost immediately.",
      "To avoid this scam, always use official websites or apps from reputable retailers to check your gift card balance. Be wary of unsolicited calls or messages asking for your gift card information, especially if they claim to be from a legitimate company. It is important never to enter your gift card details on unfamiliar websites.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt Knutsson explains how to safeguard retirement accounts from cyber threats with a VPN: encryption, anonymity, secure access.",
      "Protecting your financial future goes beyond smart investing and saving. It's crucial to safeguard your retirement accounts from cyber threats. While many believe that using\u00a0public Wi-Fi to check their 401(k) or IRA is harmless, the reality is that without proper protection, you could be putting your hard-earned savings at risk. Let's explore why using a VPN (virtual private network) is essential for securing your retirement accounts and how you can implement this extra layer of security.",
      "1 WEEK LEFT!\u00a0I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYSEnter by\u00a0signing up for my free newsletter.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her tablet (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms: IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from their server network, effectively preventing websites and cyber criminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Understanding the risks",
      "When you access your retirement accounts online, especially through public Wi-Fi networks, you're potentially exposing sensitive financial information to cybercriminals. These hackers can intercept your data, steal your login credentials and potentially drain your accounts. What's more concerning is that retirement accounts are often less frequently monitored than regular bank accounts, making them an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cellphone and a laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR PCS, MACS, IPHONES AND ANDROIDS \u2013 CYBERGUY PICKS",
      "Why a VPN is crucial for protecting your retirement accounts",
      "By creating an encrypted tunnel for your internet traffic, a VPN makes it extremely difficult for hackers to intercept your sensitive data. Here's a deeper look at why VPNs are indispensable for safeguarding your retirement accounts:",
      "VPNs employ military-grade encryption protocols, such as AES-256, to scramble your data. This means that even if a cybercriminal manages to intercept your information, it would appear as an indecipherable jumble of characters. For your retirement accounts, this translates to an extra layer of security for your login credentials, account numbers and financial transactions.",
      "By masking your IP address and replacing it with one from their servers, VPNs make it significantly harder for malicious actors to track your online activities. This anonymity is crucial when accessing financial accounts, as it prevents cybercriminals from identifying you as a high-value target based on your browsing habits or the financial institutions you visit online.",
      "The ability to check your accounts while traveling or using\u00a0public Wi-Fi is convenient but risky. A VPN provides a secure connection, essentially creating a protected tunnel between your device and the financial institution's servers. This is particularly important for retirement accounts, which may not have the same level of fraud protection as checking or savings accounts.\u00a0However, check if your retirement fund platform permits VPN usage, as some might flag it as unusual activity.",
      "VPNs are excellent safeguards against man-in-the-middle attacks, where hackers position themselves between you and the website you're trying to access. By encrypting your data from end to end, VPNs make it nearly impossible for attackers to insert themselves into your connection and steal your information.",
      "If you're traveling abroad and need to access your U.S.-based retirement accounts, some financial institutions may block access from foreign IP addresses. A VPN allows you to connect through a U.S.-based server, ensuring you can manage your accounts securely from anywhere in the world.",

      "2) Always use VPN on public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Never access financial accounts on public networks without activating your VPN first.",
      "3) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by\u00a0enabling 2FA.",
      "4) Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create complex passwords for each of your accounts and consider using a password manager. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "5) Regularly monitor your accounts: Check your retirement accounts frequently for any suspicious activity.",
      "6) Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and apps are always\u00a0up to date with the latest security patches.",
      "7) Be wary of phishing attempts: Don't click on suspicious links or provide personal information in response to unsolicited emails. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Fox News' CB Cotton reports the latest on Daniel Penny's manslaughter trial in New York City. Fox News contributor Paul Mauro and former NYPD lieutenant Darrin Porcher also weigh in on the case during 'America's Newsroom.'",
      "Daniel Penny's subway chokehold trial resumes Monday, with attorneys expected to begin their closing arguments after a break for Thanksgiving.",
      "The 26-year-old architecture student and Marine Corps veteran faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of manslaughter for the death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old mentally ill homeless man who was high on synthetic marijuana when he barged onto a subway car and started screaming threats at the passengers.",
      "Neely had a warrant out for his arrest at the time, the case's final witness revealed before the defense rested its case \u2013 as well as a lengthy criminal history and schizophrenia.",
      "DANIEL PENNY DEFENSE RESTS AS FINAL WITNESS REVEALS JORDAN NEELY HAD OPEN WARRANT, DEFENDANT DOESN'T TESTIFY",
      "Daniel Penny arrives to Manhattan Supreme Court in New York, NY on Monday, December 2, 2024. Closing arguments are expected to begin \u00a0second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide trial for in the 2023 death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway train. (Julia Bonavita/Fox News Digital)",
      "Responding officers questioned Penny \u2013 without telling him Neely had died \u2013 and then let him go. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office secured an indictment nearly two weeks later and Penny turned himself in.",
      "A diverse cast of witnesses for the prosecution testified that Neely was scaring them with death threats in a subway outburst that went above and beyond the typical subway outbursts many members of the jury had witnessed before on the city's troubled public transit system.",
      "Defense attorney Steven Raiser went first, speaking for about two hours and arguing that Penny's use of force was justified, legal and not the single cause of Neely's death.",

      "\"All of those riders and more, Daniel Penny was the one who moved to protect them. Why? Because he had something the others didn't, something unique to him. His training,\" Raiser said. \"Danny acted to save those people, and there\u2019s no dispute that when Danny acted, he didn't know whether Jordan Neely was armed.\"",
      "Bragg, who was not present during the beggining of Raiser's summation, arrived in person after the lunch break and sat in the second row. Raiser resumed his remarks.",
      "\"The government wasn't there. The police weren't there. Danny was,\" Raiser told the jury. \"And when he needed help no one was there. The government has the nerve to blame Danny because police weren't there? Blame Danny for holding on when police weren't there?\"",
      "It took seven minutes for police to respond to the 911 cll and 20 minutes before medics arrived, he said. Neely was \"on a collision course with himself,\" and a \"broken system\" led up to his death, the lawyer said.",
      "WATCH: Ex-NYPD Lt. says Daniel Penny trial sets a 'bad precedent' for police officers",
      "When Raiser finished, Assistant Manhattan District Attorney Dafna Yoran gave a closing on behalf of the prosecution.",
      "\"No one had to die on May 1, 2023,\" she said. \"Jordan Neely did enter the subway car in an extremely threatening manner\u2026 so much less physical force would have done the job\u2026 Daniel Penny easily could have restrained Neely without choking him to death. We are here today because the defendant used way too much force for way too long in way too reckless of a manner.\"",

      "Prosecutors argue that Penny went too far when he put a belligerent, shouting Neely in a chokehold on a Manhattan subway car after he started screaming death threats.",
      "Neely was Black and Penny is White, and prosecutors appeared to highlight the case's racial undertones in court, even though Penny is not accused of a hate crime. They allowed one witness to repeatedly describe Penny as \"the White man\" and another to call him a \"murderer\" despite there being no murder charges filed in connection with the case.",
      "Assistant District Attorney Dafna Yoran also brought up the term \"homicide,\" prompting Wiley to ask the jury to disregard the term, explaining that \"homicide\" means something different to a medical examiner than it does to a lawyer or a juror.",
      "Witness Lauri Sitro testified that in 30 years of subway riding, she's seen a lot of unstable people, but this \"felt different.\"",

      "\"I was scared for my son,\" she testified under cross-examination. \"It's not like you can take a 5-year-old and run to the next train. I felt very relieved when Daniel Penny had stopped him from moving around sporadically.\"",
      "Sitro was not the only woman who told the court that Neely scared them when he barged onto the train, shouting threats and violently throwing his jacket.

      "Gittings testified that it did not look like Neely was going to give up as Penny and the other men held him down, that she was especially terrified by the encounter after enduring prior attacks on other subway cars and that it didn't look like Penny was applying pressure to Neely's neck but rather trying to hold him still as officers were on the way.",

She was scheduled to take a connecting flight to New York, with a 42-minute layover at 11 a.m., but she never got on that flight. Her family is unsure why.",

      "A former defense attorney for Ted Bundy has described a \"fascinating\" parallel between the infamous serial killer's last act and the charges against University of Idaho student murders suspect Bryan Kohberger \u2013 while also revealing he was consulted on the latter but chose not to get involved.",
      "Bundy escaped prison in Colorado \u2013 where the death penalty would soon be found unconstitutional \u2013 only to head to Florida, commit more murders and wind up on death row.",
      "Bundy then torpedoed his own plea deal, which would have spared him from execution, his former attorney John Henry Browne said. But he found it eerily similar to the charges against Kohberger, a Washington State University Ph.D. student who is accused of driving across state lines into Idaho to commit a quadruple murder.",
      "\"Here's some guy who drives 10 miles from a state where there's no death penalty, [from] a state where there's an active mental health defense, to a state where there is no mental health defense, and the death penalty is very active,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I think it's just fascinating to me. I don't know what to imply from it, but I know the facts are the facts.\"",

      "Bundy snuck into the Chi Omega house around 3 a.m. on Jan. 15, 1978, entering through the back door. Inside, he bludgeoned the sleeping Margaret Elizabeth Bowman with a club, then strangled her. In the next room, he beat, sexually assaulted and killed Lisa Janet Levy. Before fleeing the scene, he attacked two other young women, Karen Chandler and Kathy Kleiner (now Kathy Kleiner Rubin), who survived.",
      "\"He was a coward,\" Kleiner Rubin later told Fox News Digital. Bundy had broken her jaw with the club when a late-returning sorority sister's headlights shone through the window. He fled. She survived.",

      "The best defense? Playing offense",
      "\"If I were his lawyers, I would start playing offense \u2013 a lot,\" Browne told Fox News Digital. \"Because you're not going to get anywhere in a case like this playing nice.\"",
      "Kohberger, who had a master's degree in criminal justice from DeSales University and was trying to get a Ph.D. in criminology at Washington State University, studied under Katherine Ramsland, a leading expert on serial killers who has written articles and books on many of them \u2013 including Bundy.",
      "Browne attempted to negotiate a plea deal for Bundy that would have spared him execution \u2013 but the serial killer sabotaged it himself and wound up on the electric chair.",

      "Browne said the defense should continue to aggressively seek to make life for the prosecution as difficult as possible, in order to aggressively attack the case \u2013 something Kohberger's defense team of Anne Taylor, Jay Logsdon and Elisa Massoth has been working on for over a year.",
      "But the defense's attack plan may have turned off the judge, too. Kohberger's team turned to a motion for a Franks hearing, which is an attempt to throw out some of the search warrants in the case. However, Hippler told them to re-file it with proper citations after reminding Logsdon it's not his job to look through the 2,000 pages of attached exhibits to figure out what they're talking about.",
      "Ted Bundy watches intently during jury selection at his trial in Orlando for the murder of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach. (Bettmann)",
      "\"By way of example, Defendant cites generally to Exhibit D9 for the proposition that law enforcement's vehicle expert felt more comfortable setting the date range of 2011-2013 for the Elantra,\" Hippler wrote. \"That exhibit is over one hundred pages of duplicative emails. Defendant does not identify which email supports his proposition. The Court will not do counsel's job and scour the exhibit to decide what portions defendant must be suggesting supports his assertion.\"",
      "Browne said such motions are rarely successful \u2013 he's tried hundreds of cases and only had three work out \u2013 but it can cripple the state's case if it works.",
      "Another item the defense may want to consider is whether to waive Kohberger's right to be tried before a jury and leave his fate in the hands of the judge.",

      "Even after securing the change in venue from Latah County to Boise, the case is so high-profile that large swaths of potential jurors could have already made up their minds.",
      "\"[There] is always a possibility, but not a very good one, and that is that you could waive the jury, and try the case to the judge,\" Browne said.",
      "Bundy, represented by a different lawyer at the time, did that in Utah and got a lenient sentence. It didn't work out for Jose Ibarra, Laken Riley's killer, who was convicted last week and sentenced to life in prison without parole, the stiffest punishment available because the prosecutor on that case did not seek the death penalty.",

      "Brown claimed last week that \"billions of dollars have been mobilized\" in the Lobito Rail Corridor, a planned 800-mile railway that is central to Biden\u2019s Angola visit \u2013 and his legacy. Brown claimed it is one of his \u2018signature initiatives\u2019.",
      "The rail system will stretch from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and a point close to Zambia, to the port of Lobito, on Angola\u2019s Atlantic seaboard. Washington is hoping that it can be used to transport critical raw materials (CRMs), such as cobalt and lithium, needed for the likes of electric vehicles, EV, batteries, and cut down transit time from the current 45 days to under a week.",
      "\"The International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that between 2020 and 2040, demand for nickel and cobalt will increase by 20 times, for graphite 25 times, and for lithium more than 40 times,\" Dr. E.D. Wala Chabala wrote in a recent paper for the Africa Policy Research Institute.",

      "Chabala, a former chairman of Zambia Railways and an economic policy consultant, added, \"This projected surge in demand for CRMs has fueled great interest in the Lobito Corridor, and with it an inevitable scramble for access. The DRC, as the world\u2019s largest producer of cobalt (estimates are consistently around 70% of global production), has found itself at the epicenter of this scramble, as has, by association, Zambia.\"",
      "But there\u2019s a large panda in the room: China. Chabala pointed out\u00a0\"the targeted materials (CRMs) are mostly already locked in by China, and\u00a0the Asians are leaders in EV technology.\"",
      "Chabala added, \"Not only are the Chinese ubiquitously present on the African continent, but China is already far ahead in building supply chains for cobalt, lithium, and several other essential metals and minerals. And what is more, China is moving to take over the running of the TAZARA railway line, which runs from central Zambia to the port of Dar es Salaam on the Indian Ocean.\"",

      "\"The reality of the Lobito Corridor development is that it may be coming too late in the day. What is more, there is a proposed route, shorter by some 500 km, to the east between Lubumbashi and Dar es Salaam.\"",
      "\"The European Union (EU) and the U.S. are not currently leaders in EV technology. It is reported that almost 90% of cell component manufacturing, the most significant step in the battery value chain, is undertaken in Asia,\" Chabala said.",
      "Van Staden told Fox News Digital, \"The viability of the rail corridor partially depends on external factors. It will compete with the TAZARA rail line between Zambia and Tanzania, which will be upgraded by Chinese companies over the next few years. There will likely be pressure from the African side to connect the two lines, because that would realize a long-held goal to connect the Atlantic and Indian Ocean coasts.\"",
      "\"The U.S. has no choice but to seek access to critical minerals in Africa, as many of these are crucial components to the kind of high-tech manufacturing that the U.S. is trying to remain competitive in,\" Hudson told Fox News Digital, adding, \"We simply cannot afford to cede that territory to China, nor is it too late to try to claw back our influence in this sector.\"",
      "Nigeriens protest against the U.S. military presence, in Niamey, Niger April 13, 2024. (Reuters/Mahamadou Hamidou/File Photo)",
      "\"More importantly, there is an opening to do so because Africans want diversity in their economic partnerships. Just as we are wary of China cornering the market on critical minerals in certain countries, so too are those countries worried about being so beholden to Chinese interests.\"",
      "Hudson continued, \"The Lobito project is really a proof of concept that the U.S. can and should be undertaking the kind of large-scale commercial infrastructure projects similar to what China has been doing on the continent for decades. \u00a0Importantly, it is a recognition that we have heard the calls from African leaders that they want a relationship that is based on \u2019trade not aid.\u2019\"",

      "Chabala told Fox News Digital this week that another factor working against U.S. interests is that the Chinese are involved in ownership of the mines producing CRMs in the DRC. \"They own 80% of the largest cobalt producer in Congo, they are heavily involved in the EV battery value chain, with the bulk of the value chain activities being undertaken in Asia, and they are currently the number one global producer of EVs (the Chinese auto manufacturer BYD),\" he said.",
      "He added, \"The long-term strategy of the EU and U.S. ought to be to invest and establish strong counterweight economies, so much so that the impact and consequences of the Chinese economic dynamics are counterbalanced. The African continent has 1.4 billion people, 60% below the age of 24, with a landmass of more than 30 million square kilometers (over 11 million square miles).\"",
      "Congolese flags fly alongside Chinese flags at the Palais des Congres in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, March 29, 2013. (Junior D. Kannah/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"This is double the population of the EU and U.S., and almost double their landmasses. The quantities of materials on the African continent and the potential they represent for the global economy are astounding. This represents [an] unfathomable potential for establishing industries on the continent, not only to counterweight the Chinese economy, but to lock in a future market for all the top brands of EU and U.S. businesses. The mind boggles that the EU and U.S. have not embarked on pursuing this strategy, decades ago.\"",
      "Van Staden noted, \"Chinese actors make up less than 10% of all the mining done on the continent and there is space for more engagement from many stakeholders, as long as that happens on African terms.\"",

      "The navy\u2019s commander was ready to comply with the decree, but army and air force leaders objected to any plan that would prevent Lula's inauguration, the report said. Those refusals are why the plan did not go ahead, according to witnesses who spoke to investigators.",
      "Many legal experts including say evidence that former president presented the draft to military leaders and supported for different versions of the document are very damaging.",
      "\"(The goal) was to unduly intervene in elections,\" said Luiz Henrique Machado, a law professor at the IDP university in the capital Brasilia. \"In Brazil, it is the electoral prosecutors' office and the top electoral court that have the final word about electoral legislation.\"",
      "In an interview with website UOL published Thursday, Bolsonaro said he discussed with military leaders moves including decreeing a state of emergency and other exceptional measures that would have suspended the rule of law for the public good. He said such measures are provided for by the constitution, so there is nothing unseemly about evaluating those options.",
      "\"What is being said is absurd. For my part, there has never been any discussion of a coup,\" Bolsonaro told journalists in Brasilia on Monday.",
      "Plan to assassinate the president-elect",
      "On Nov. 19, Brazil's Federal Police arrested four army special operations officers and a federal police officer accused of plotting in 2022 to assassinate Lula, vice-president-elect Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The arrested men were all mentioned in a police report that was unsealed later.",
      "The assassination plan sought to leave Bolsonaro's ticket as the only remaining valid one in the 2022 runoff, police say. As for de Moraes, he led a five-year probe into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led some far-right allies and supporters being barred from social media and even imprisoned. In early 2023, he presided over the nation\u2019s top electoral court when it declared Bolsonaro ineligible for office until 2030 over abuse of power related to a meeting he convened with foreign ambassadors to spread lies about the voting system.",
      "Gen. Walter Braga Netto, Bolsonaro\u2019s 2022 running mate and former defense minister, greenlit the assassination plan at a meeting with the plotters inside his home, investigators added. Federal Police portray the retired general as one of the plot's leaders, also involved in pressuring military leaders to sign onto the coup.",
      "Braga Netto said in a statement on Tuesday that he never plotted a coup. He added that several of the documents seized from one of his aides, including \"writings, drafts and media reports\" were \"preparatory material to answer media requests and to prepare for testimony in congressional hearings.\"",
      "The police report contains no indication that any attempt to assassinate Lula or Alckmin was put into motion. However, investigators found messages and documents indicating that the plotters were monitoring and following de Moraes at the time.",
      "Police said they found evidence that retired Brig. Gen. M\u00e1rio Fernandes, one of the officers arrested who had been serving as interim general secretary of the presidency, also visited the protest camps outside military installations, including at the army headquarters in Brasilia. Investigators said they have evidence that he gave instructions and financial support to the protesters.",
      "Jan. 8 uprising",
      "Federal Police linked Bolsonaro and some of his top ministers to the Jan. 8, 2023 riot in which supporters of the former president, many of whom had been camped outside army headquarters for months, ransacked the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace in Brasilia.",
      "The protesters had pleaded for the armed forces to keep the leftist leader out of office and their uprising \u2014 which came after Lula was sworn in \u2014 was an attempt to force military intervention and oust the new president, police say.",
      "The riot appears in the report as one of several \"other actions to pressure the army commander to join the coup d\u2019etat.\" Police also say that Brig. Gen. Fernandes sent a message in November 2022 to Gen. Marco Ant\u00f4nio Freire Gomes, then the Army's commander, discussing the need for a \"triggering event\" for a coup.",
      "Defendants, including Bolsonaro, have argued that the riot was an isolated event, and many legal experts have noted that the report's evidence of a connection between it and a broader plot is tenuous.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"It is clear that the alleged coup plotters had contacts with people camped outside military barracks, people who were there on Jan. 8. But how much of that contact was transformed into planning, coordination, stimulus for those people to take public buildings that day? That is to be debated, it is going to be discussed in the process and the collection of more evidence,\" said Jo\u00e3o Pedro P\u00e1dua, a professor of criminal law proceedings at the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Bolsonaro left for the United States days before Lula\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2023 and stayed there three months, keeping a low profile. The police report alleges he was avoiding possible imprisonment related to the coup plot and awaiting the fallout from the uprising."

      "Who\u2019s running?",
      "The outgoing government was led by the two parties who have dominated Irish politics for the past century: Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. They have similar center-right policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland\u2019s 1920s civil war.",
      "After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat they formed a coalition, agreeing to share Cabinet posts and take turns as taoiseach, or prime minister.

      "This election includes a large crop of independent candidates, ranging from local campaigners to far-right activists and reputed crime boss Gerry \"the Monk\" Hutch.",
      "What are the main issues?",
      "As in many other countries, the cost of living \u2014 especially housing \u2014 has dominated the campaign. Ireland has an acute housing shortage, the legacy of failing to build enough new homes during the country\u2019s \"Celtic Tiger\" boom years and the economic slump that followed the 2008 global financial crisis.",

      "Tangled up with the housing issue is immigration, a fairly recent challenge to a country long defined by emigration. Recent arrivals include more than 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by war and thousands of people fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East and Africa.",
      "This country of 5.4 million has struggled to house all the asylum-seekers, leading to tent camps and makeshift accommodation centers that have attracted tension and protests. A stabbing attack on children outside a Dublin school a year ago, in which an Algerian man has been charged, sparked the worst rioting Ireland had seen in decades.",
      "Unlike many European countries, Ireland does not have a significant far-right party, but far-right voices on social media seek to drum up hostility to migrants, and anti-immigrant independent candidates are hoping for election in several districts. The issue appears to be hitting support for Sinn Fein, as working-class supporters bristled at its pro-immigration policies.",
      "What\u2019s the likely outcome?",
      "Opinion polls suggest voters\u2019 support is split into five roughly even chunks \u2014 for Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Sinn Fein, several smaller parties and an assortment of independents.",
      "Fine Gael has run a gaffe-prone campaign, Fianna Fail has remained steady in the polls and Sinn Fein says it has momentum, but is unlikely to win power unless the other parties drop their opposition to working with it.",
      "Analysts say the most likely outcome is another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition, possibly with a smaller party or a clutch of independents as kingmakers.",
      "\"It\u2019s just a question of which minor group is going to be the group that supports the government this time,\" said Eoin O\u2019Malley, a political scientist at Dublin City University. \"Coalition-forming is about putting a hue on what is essentially the same middle-of-the-road government every time.\"",

      "Dabbas spoke with Fox News Digital from northwest Syria by phone in an interview translated by the Syrian Emergency Task Force (SETF), a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit and advocacy group, where he described his family\u2019s five-day journey from Lebanon to an area liberated from Assad regime control and the challenges they\u2019ve faced as displaced people.",
      "\"We had gone to Lebanon to escape bombardment and war followed us,\" he said. \"For the same reasons, we had to leave everything in search of safety. And, so, we had to run away from Lebanon back to Syria.\"",

Dabbas said many of the people running the checkpoints demanded money for them to pass through, and they ultimately ended up paying bribes to keep moving.",

They eventually made it to the rebel side of the border and spent one day at a Free Syrian Army checkpoint before finally registering with authorities in opposition areas and settling in the northern countryside of Idlib Oct. 4.",

      "Amos Hochstein, special presidential coordinator for Global Infrastructure and Energy Security, says the Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire agreement is comprehensive on 'Your World.'",
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 Amid the start of a cease-fire on Wednesday between Israel and the Iranian regime-backed Hezbollah terrorist movement in Lebanon, some leading Republican lawmakers accused President Biden of browbeating Israel into a temporary suspension of the war as the Jewish state staged a near-takedown of the terror group's leadership and military structure.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reached the Litani River in Lebanon on Tuesday. A key war goal for the IDF is to push Hezbollah forces north of the Litani River. Under the\u00a0cease-fire deal, Hezbollah is required to move its forces north of the Litani, which in some places is about 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border.",
      "Yet, the reported threat of Biden imposing a weapons embargo on Israel pulled the plug on Israel\u2019s penetration of Hezbollah-controlled territory in southern Lebanon, according to regional experts and several lawmakers.",

      "\"The cease-fire agreement does not diminish what Israel managed to achieve in short order against Hezbollah. Within two months, it dismantled its infrastructure along the border, decapitated its entire senior command structure, destroyed a large percentage of its arsenal, and killed and injured thousands of its fighters,\" Tony Badran Levant, analyst and news editor at Tablet Magazine, told Fox News Digital.",
      "Describing the move by former officials from the Obama administration who now work in the Biden administration, he said, \"What the Obama-Biden team did on their way out was to coerce the Israelis, reportedly with the threat of an arms embargo at the Security Council, into signing onto Obama\u2019s vision for the U.S. role in Lebanon, which is part of his broader pro-Iran realignment. This is the downside of the agreement: it consolidates this Obama framework that should have been dismantled \u2014 and that\u2019s separate from the tactical and strategic gains that Israel achieved on the battlefield. Rather, this pertains to U.S. policy and how the Obama-Biden team used Israel to lock in their regional preferences.\"",
      "He continued, \"The deal puts the incoming Trump administration and the Israelis in a weird situation, not just because it saddles the new administration with Obama\u2019s preferences in Lebanon \u2014 including hundreds of millions in additional aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces \u2014 but also it makes the U.S. an arbiter for Israeli action against Hezbollah moving forward and the possibility for friction that may create between the Trump administration and Israel.",
      "U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein speaks during a press conference after meeting with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri in Beirut on March 4. (Reuters/Mohamed Azakir/File Photo)",
      "\"Meanwhile, the Obama-Biden team have set their structure in place. If the incoming administration keeps it, that would be great for the Democrats, who will pick it up on the other end and expand on it. In any case, they have a document \u2014 a bilateral side agreement \u2014 that will be there for a future Democratic administration,\" he warned.",
      "Amos Hochstein, the presidential envoy who brokered the deal, told Israel's Channel 12 evening news anchor Yonit Levi that he had informed President-elect Trump's team about the tenets of the deal \"because it's very important for them to understand and support it, because they are going to have to carry it forward and implement as they took office in just a few weeks.\"",
      "Echoing Badran's warning, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas., noted in a statement that \"I am deeply disturbed both by reports that Obama-Biden officials exerted enormous pressure on our Israeli allies to accept this cease-fire and by how those officials are characterizing Israel's obligations. This pressure and these statements are further efforts to undermine Israel and constrain the incoming Trump administration. Obama-Biden officials pressured our Israeli allies into accepting the cease-fire by withholding weapons they needed to defend themselves and counter Hezbollah, and by threatening to facilitate a further, broader, binding international arms embargo through the United Nations.\"",

It's only that we didn't threaten it\u2026 literally the topic never came up, so, I don't even know how to answer the question any other way. It is completely new to me. And none of us has heard of this before.\"",
      "Backing this up in his interview with Israel's Ch. 12, Hochstein also denied the Biden administration threatened Israel over use of its U.N. Security Council veto if it did not sign the deal, saying, \"There was no such discussion at any point,\" adding that \"it never came up.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 17:00:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Syria's civil war has exploded back into life after Islamist rebels launched a lightning offensive on the northern city of Aleppo.",
    "story": [
      "In the messy patchwork of conflicts raging across the Middle East, one country has been absent from the spotlight: Syria.",
      "A civil war that dominated international headlines for more than a decade has now been reignited after a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a lightning offensive last week, seizing Aleppo, the country\u2019s second-largest city, from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime.",
      "The rebels took only hours to recapture territory that Assad\u2019s forces had spent years reclaiming. Fighter jets from Syria and its ally Russia soon began bombing the area \u2014 killing hundreds of the rebels but civilians, too, according to a leading monitoring group.",
      "\u201cThis is a very unstable situation with a huge amount of flux,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "Some anti-Assad activists hope it could herald the crumbling of a depleted regime; others fear the brutality of the Russia-Syrian response \u2014 as well as the hard-line ideology of the Islamist rebels themselves.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear how this may affect the 900 or so American troops still in the region, or the remnants of the Islamic State terror group that they are there to fight and that the Pentagon has warned may be regrouping.",
      "Here\u2019s what we do know:",
      "What happened?",
      "With little warning last Wednesday, a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a rapid assault that soon seized Aleppo as well as towns in the nearby Idlib and Hama provinces, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group.",
      "The rebels are being led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which grew out of a former al Qaeda affiliate called Jabhat al-Nusra and is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the United Nations and others.\u00a0The State Department has a $10 million bounty for information about its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "However, some analysts say the group has \u201cgreatly moderated\u201d its positions, as Robin Yassin-Kassab, author of \u201cBurning Country: Syrians in Revolution and War,\u201d wrote this week. \u201cIt\u2019s still an authoritarian Islamist militia\u201d but \u201chas a much more positive policy towards sectarian and ethnic minorities than ISIS,\u201d he said.",
      "For these anti-Assad observers, the group presents an opportunity to topple the brutality of his regime and its Russian and Iranian benefactors.",
      "But after the rebels\u2019 offensive, Syrian and Russian fighter jets responded by launching airstrikes on the rebel-held areas, with Assad\u2019s government claiming to have killed more than 400 of the \u201cterrorists.\u201d",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the number of rebels killed in five days of fighting at 244, with 61 civilians killed alongside 141 government troops.",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered his full support to Assad and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would do likewise. And on Monday, Iran-backed militias based in Iraq crossed the border into Syria to support the government there, according to the Observatory.",
      "Why is this happening now?",
      "Syria\u2019s time on the back burner of international attention is also one  reason it has roared back into prominence, some experts say.",
      "Assad once looked like he might be toppled by the diverse group of rebels that rose up against him after the Arab Spring of 2011. That he has survived was largely because of the intervention of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Lebanon-based proxy.",
      "Russia\u2019s indiscriminate bombing, in particular, turned the tide against the rebels. It also transformed then rebel-held cities such as Aleppo and Homs into moonscapes of rubble and rebar. In all, the U.N. has documented more than 350,000 deaths but says this is \u201ccertainly an undercount.\u201d",
      "Today, however, Russia, Iran and Lebanon are distracted and depleted.",
      "Russia\u2019s primary focus is on the war in Ukraine, where it is locked in an attritional battle of trenches, tanks and mud with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Washington-backed government in Kyiv. In recent years Moscow has withdrawn assets from Syria, potentially weakening Assad\u2019s grip on power, experts say.",
      "Likewise, Iran has taken a hit at the hands of Israel, which has gutted Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and targeted its missile arsenal, while also fighting Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIranians have also shown that their forces are stretched and perhaps not as powerful as people get them credit for,\u201d said Hellyer, the Russia analyst who was speaking from Cairo. All of this \u201cputs Assad in a much weaker position.\u201d",
      "But \u201cthe Syrian regime, in coordination with the Russians and less so the Iranians, will hit them with everything they\u2019ve got,\u201d he added.",
      "Washington and ISIS",
      "Less clear is what role, if any, the U.S. may play.",
      "As well as the American troops based in Syria, there are another 2,500 in neighboring Iraq that are part of a residual 80-country coalition to prevent ISIS from regrouping.",
      "However, it\u2019s far from certain these forces will remain there after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. He twice threatened to withdraw these troops during his first term.",
      "But the ISIS threat has not gone away, despite the group being purged in 2017 from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq over which it had governed.",
      "In July, the Pentagon warned ISIS attacks were on track to double year-on-year.",
      "If HTS were to seize the city of Deir el-Zour \u2014 a former ISIS stronghold \u2014 then ISIS could be freer to expand its influence across the east of the country, some analysts believe.",
      "\u201cAs Assad\u2019s regime moves resources to the northwest\u201d to try to fight off the rebels, \u201cISIS will reap the rewards, filling vacuums\u201d elsewhere,  Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said in a post on X.",
      "If Assad were to fall altogether, Iran may no longer be able to use Syria as a pipeline of weapons and other supplies to Hezbollah, the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington-based think tank, said in a briefing.",
      "However, any hopes for Assad's ouster should be tempered by who or what might replace him.",
      "\u201cMuch as I oppose the Assad regime, its atrocities and abuses, what is happening in Aleppo right now is terrifying. Many will die,\u201d Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, posted on X. \u201cIf there was a chance of a lovely peaceful outcome to the benefit of Syrians, I will be thrilled. This is unlikely.\u201d"

    "summary": "Rep. Jamie Raskin, who served as the lead Democratic prosecutor in Donald Trump's second impeachment trial, will challenge Rep. Jerry Nadler for House Judiciary chairman.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a former constitutional law professor who served as Democrats\u2019 lead prosecutor in the Trump impeachment trial after the Jan. 6 attack, told colleagues Monday he will challenge Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., for the top Democratic spot on the powerful Judiciary Committee.",
      "Nadler, 77, has held the top job on the Judiciary panel since 2019, served in Congress since 1992 and has suffered some health scares in recent years. While Raskin is 61 years old, his bold challenge to Nadler is another example of a new generation of Democratic stars taking on the old guard \u2014 and the party's seniority system \u2014 and follows disappointing losses for the party in the 2024 elections.",
      "\u201cIn the 119th Congress, the Judiciary Committee will be the headquarters of Congressional opposition to authoritarianism and MAGA\u2019s campaign to dismantle our Constitutional system and the rule of law as we know it,\u201d Raskin, a cancer survivor who also served on the special House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack, wrote in a letter to colleagues Monday.",
      "\u201cI hope to be at the center of this fight and \u2014 as someone who has battled cancer and chemotherapy \u2014 I can tell you that I will never, never surrender,\" he continued.",
      "In his three-page letter, Raskin, the current ranking member of the Oversight Committee, also offered praise for Nadler, who is running for his fourth term leading Democrats on the Judiciary panel.",
      "\u201cI should say, finally, that I take this step with respect and boundless admiration for my friend Jerry Nadler and his remarkable half-century of service in public office in New York and Congress. ...\u00a0 If I\u2019m lucky enough to be chosen for this responsibility in the 119th Congress,\" Raskin wrote, \"I will turn to Jerry first and throughout for his always wise counsel and political judgment.\u201d",
      "Raskin, who was first elected to the House in 2016, is not the only Democrat to announce a challenge to a longtime committee leader this year. Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., told colleagues in his own letter Monday that it was time for him to \u201cpass the torch\u201d as the leading Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee after Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., announced he would challenge the 76-year-old for the job.",
      "Grijalva, who has served in Congress since 2003, had missed votes for several months after he announced a cancer diagnosis in April. Huffman, 60, was first elected to Congress in 2012.",
      "A race for the top position on the Agriculture Committee is also shaping up, with Reps. Jim Costa, D-Calif., and Angie Craig, D-Minn., vying to unseat longtime Rep. David Scott, D-Ga., who is 79 years old and has battled health issues for years.",
      "The Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, which is closely aligned with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is expected to make recommendations to the full Democratic Caucus next week about which members should serve as the top Democrats on each committee in the next Congress. The caucus would then take a final vote."

      "Two Democratic senators are urging the Biden administration to issue a policy directive that could temporarily limit President-elect Donald Trump's ability to deploy U.S. military troops domestically after he takes office.",
      "Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., both members of the Armed Services Committee, sent a letter dated Nov. 26 to President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that urged them to issue a policy directive that would ensure that U.S. troops can be used only when local or\u00a0state\u00a0authorities ask for federal help or are unable or unwilling to protect the public.",
      "\u201cWe write to urge you to issue a policy directive that prohibits the mobilization of active duty military or federalizing National Guard personnel to be deployed against their fellow Americans unless specifically authorized,\u201d they wrote.",
      "After he takes office on Jan. 20, Trump could issue his own policy directive that would reverse the directive issued by Biden. Warren and Blumenthal, whose offices said the letter speaks for itself, apparently hope that publicly highlighting the issue might deter Trump.",
      "During his first term, Trump considered using the Insurrection Act in response to the Black Lives Matter protests. And some of his allies urged him to consider invoking martial law after he was defeated in the 2020 election.",
      "More recently, Trump has suggested he would use the U.S. military to help deport immigrants who do not have permanent legal status. He has also said he would move U.S. troops from overseas and station them on the southern border. And Trump has repeatedly talked about using troops to go after \u201cthe enemy from within.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Fox News before the election, he said: \u201cI think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they\u2019re the \u2014 and it should be very easily handled by \u2014 if necessary, by National Guard or, if really necessary, by the military, because they can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d",
      "Federal troops\u00a0are\u00a0prohibited from engaging\u00a0in domestic law enforcement\u00a0by\u00a0the Posse Comitatus Act,\u00a0an 1878 law that bars the president from using the military for such a purpose unless it is expressly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress.",
      "A separate law,\u00a0the Insurrection Act,\u00a0an amalgamation of various statutes Congress passed from 1792 to 1871, creates an exception. It allows the president to deploy military troops in cases of insurrection, rebellion or extreme civil unrest.",
      "In their letter, Warren and Blumenthal asked the Biden administration to issue a policy directive before Biden leaves office that would require state or local officials to request assistance before federal military forces are deployed.",
      "\u201cWe urge you to issue a policy directive that makes clear that the narrow application of the Insurrection Act should be limited to instances when State or local authorities are so overwhelmed and that the chief executive of the State requests assistance,\u201d\u00a0they wrote,\u00a0\u201cor attacks against the U.S. government overwhelm State or local authorities.\u201d",
      "Civil liberties groups have warned that Trump could misuse the military in a second term.\u00a0Joseph Nunn, a counsel at the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law, warned\u00a0that the Insurrection Act gives the president virtually unlimited discretion and power to use the military as a police force and that it essentially\u00a0creates\u00a0a loophole in the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "\u201cUnless Congress acts now to reform this dangerous and antiquated law, there\u2019s little anyone could do to stop him,\u201d Nunn wrote\u00a0last year,\u00a0citing fears that Trump would abuse his powers if he were re-elected.",
      "Warren and Blumenthal also asked the White House to ensure that future administrations would go to Congress before they turned to the military for domestic law enforcement.",
      "\u201cFinally, we urge you to clarify that the President must consult with Congress to the maximum extent practicable before exercising this authority, as well as transmit to the Federal Register the legal authorities,\u201d they wrote.",
      "They warned that the recent Supreme Court decision that expanded presidential immunity for official acts\u00a0made\u00a0the need for clear policy more urgent.",
      "\u201cGiven the disagreement amongst scholars on the serious implications of the recent Supreme Court decision, it is reasonable to assume that service members, other DoD personnel, and the broader military community may not be aware of or fully understand their rights and responsibilities,\u201d\u00a0Warren and Blumenthal wrote.",
      "\u201cIf unaddressed,\" they added, \"any ambiguity on the lawful use of military force, coupled with President-elect Trump\u2019s demonstrated intent to utilize the military in such dangerous and unprecedented ways, may prove to be devastating.\u201d"

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear a dispute over the Food and Drug Administration's refusal to approve flavored e-cigarettes over public health concerns.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday probed whether  the Food and Drug Administration unlawfully refused to approve flavored e-cigarettes over public health concerns.",
      "During the oral argument, a majority of the nine justices appeared unconvinced that the agency had changed its standard for evaluating whether to approval products in the middle of the proceeding, as two companies argue.",
      "But it is still possible the court could find fault in the agency's approach.",
      "The court has a 6-3 conservative majority that is often skeptical of federal agency decision-making.",
      "But in a positive sign for the FDA, a key member of the conservative wing, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, seemed sympathetic to the agency's position.",
      "Other conservatives seemed more skeptical, wondering if the FDA had failed to give companies fair notice of what kind of evidence it required to approve flavored vapes.",
      "The case puts the FDA's role in approving new tobacco products under the microscope at a time when e-cigarettes, or vapes, have flooded the market.",
      "Makers of flavored vapes have brought various cases around the country challenging FDA decisions.",
      "Although the FDA won most of those cases, it appealed to the Supreme Court after it lost one of them in the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "The legal issue before the justices is whether the FDA failed to correctly consider the companies\u2019 requests, in violation of a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act.",
      "The case focuses on challenges brought by Triton Distribution, which makes e-liquids for vape pens with colorfully named flavors, including Signature Series Mom\u2019s Pistachio and Suicide Bunny Mother\u2019s Milk and Cookies, and Vapestasia, which has sought approval for Iced Pineapple Express, Killer Kustard Blueberry and other flavors.",
      "The FDA has repeatedly declined to approve flavored vapes, saying they might pose a health risk because they could encourage young people to use tobacco. The products nevertheless remain widely available.",
      "The companies, which face potential civil and criminal penalties for marketing products without approval, say the FDA got it wrong, arguing that flavored vapes can be used to help people stop smoking.",
      "Their lawyers argue that the FDA changed its standard for considering flavored vapes in the middle of the process without giving applicants adequate warning.",
      "Kavanaugh pushed back, saying it was clear from the outset what the FDA's position on the issue was, with a focus on the harm to young people of flavored vape products.",
      "He noted that under the Tobacco Control Act, the FDA has the power to regulate tobacco products, with a special focus on young people.",
      "If, after weighing the evidence, the FDA rejects an application, \"It's kind of the end of it, isn't it?\" Kavanaugh said.",
      "Both Kavanaugh and another conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett, did not seem to think the FDA had meaningfully changed its position during the process.",
      "It was a view shared by the court's three liberal justices.",
      "\"I guess I'm not really seeing what the surprise is here, or what the change is here,\" said Justice Elena Kagan.",
      "She added that applicants know very well that the FDA believes that flavored vapes are especially appealing to children and that they would need to overcome that presumption in their submissions.",
      "\"I\u00a0mean, there's just not a lot of mystery here about what FDA was doing. You might disagree with that, because you think that, in fact, the world of 40-year-olds really wants to do blueberry vaping, but you can't say that FDA hasn't told you all about what it's thinking in this respect,\" Kagan told the companies' lawyer, Eric Heyer.",
      "Likewise, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she was \"baffled\" by the company's argument that they did not have fair notice of the agency's position.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor seemed to share that view, saying she was \"so totally confused\" by the arguments made by Heyer.",
      "Conservative Justice Clarence Thomas was among those who expressed concern about the FDA's actions, characterizing the standard for approval as a \"moving target.\"",
      "Others, including Justice Neil Gorsuch, wondered if the agency  had failed to give applicants fair notice that the rules had changed.",
      "The agency says it evaluates each application on its merits. The two companies' applications were rejected because \"they failed to support their claims with sufficient evidence in any form,\" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in court papers.",
      "The FDA began regulating vape products only in 2016, after they were already on the market. The FDA said at the time that it would not take enforcement actions while companies sought approval.",
      "It subsequently concluded that the potential benefits of helping adult smokers quit do not outweigh the potential health risks to young people, who are most attracted to non-tobacco flavored vapes.",
      "The FDA has\u00a0approved menthol-flavored e-cigarettes,\u00a0as well as some that are tobacco-flavored.",
      "The agency will have a high profile when President-elect Donald Trump takes office for his second term. Trump has pledged to shake up the health care system, pledging to nominate vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to run the Department of Health and Human Services, of which the FDA is part.",
      "Heyer told the justices that if his clients win the case, there could be a change in the FDA's approach, citing comments Trump has made that he would \"save vaping.\""

      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2014\u00a0The former Illinois sheriff\u2019s deputy charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Sonya Massey could soon be set free, following an appellate court ruling that cleared the way for his pre-trial release.",
      "At a hearing Monday, a circuit court judge said he will on Friday determine the restrictions for Sean Grayson\u2019s release. The judge, Ryan Cadagin, had previously denied Grayson\u2019s pre-trial release. But an appellate court overturned that ruling in a unanimous decision Wednesday. Sangamon County State\u2019s Attorney John Milhiser said his office plans to appeal that ruling.",
      "Cadagin said he would comply with the court order and determine \u201cthe least restrictive conditions\u201d for Grayson\u2019s release.",
      "Grayson, appeared via video conference from jail with one of his attorneys by his side. He spoke only to say \u201cYes, your honor\u201d when asked whether he had waived his right to appear in person at Friday\u2019s hearing.",
      "Grayson shot and killed Massey in her home in Springfield on July 6. Massey, who had dealt with mental health issues, had called 911 to report a potential prowler. Body camera video shows that as Grayson spoke to her in her living room, he noticed a pot of hot water on her stove. Massey got up to remove it and, as she was handling the pot, several feet away from Grayson and his partner, she twice said, \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\u201d Grayson told her that she \u201cbetter [expletive] not\u201d and yelled at her to drop the pot. As she ducked, the video shows, he fired three shots, one of which struck Massey beneath her left eye.",
      "The video also showed that Grayson had told his partner not to render aid to Massey because, he said, she had sustained a shot to the head.",
      "Cadagin had initially denied Grayson\u2019s release because he said his actions were \u201ca departure from the basic expectations of civil society.\u201d At a hearing in August, Cadagin rejected Grayson\u2019s request to be released to accommodate his medical needs, which include treatment for colon cancer, saying that electronic monitoring would not sufficiently protect the community from Grayson. One of Grayson\u2019s attorneys, Mark Wykoff, had argued that the threat had been mitigated because Grayson was no longer working in his official capacity since he had been fired from the Sangamon County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "In its unanimous decision issued Wednesday, the 4th District Appellate Court ruled Cadagin\u2019s having denied Grayson pre-trial release was improper.",
      "\u201cThe trial court\u2019s focus on defendant\u2019s failings as a law enforcement officer, while understandable, distracted from the central question of how to address any risk he posed after being stripped of his office,\u201d the appellate court\u2019s ruling states.",
      "Massey\u2019s killing drew national attention as another example of police fatally shooting a Black person in their home. Grayson is white.",
      "Sheriff Jack Campbell\u00a0resigned in August amid public outcry and after Gov. JB Pritzker said he had failed at his job and should step down. Campbell was aware Grayson had pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol on two occasions, one of which led to his premature discharge from the Army in February 2016, according to various personnel records. Those records obtained by NBC News indicate Grayson had moved among six law enforcement agencies in central Illinois in four years and that he had drawn concerns over his aggression and integrity issues at some of them.",
      "The Justice Department recently notified officials in Sangamon County that it had opened an investigation into Massey\u2019s killing.",
      "More than a dozen protesters gathered outside of the courthouse Monday, chanting \u201cSonya\u2019s life matters!\u201d Some carried cardboard signs that read: \u201cJustice for Sonya.\u201d",

      "The body of Lane-Fournier \u2014 who went by the name \"Phoenix\" \u2014 was found in remote wilderness of Welches, an unincorporated community at the foot of Mount Hood, east of Portland. An autopsy conducted Saturday concluded the cause of death was homicide.",
      "The discovery was made after more than 800 search hours involving dozens of officers, K9s and volunteers scouring more than 100 miles of trail. Her two Malinois-mix dogs have also separately been found dead, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Lane-Fournier was first reported missing when she failed to show up for work in a local shop on Nov. 22. The next day, a member of the public spotted her white 1992 Ford F-250 parked near East Salmon River Road.",
      "\"Investigators are looking to speak with anyone who may have seen Michel Fournier in the days before her disappearance or who has information about his activity and whereabouts since then,\" the sheriff's office said.",
      "A month before her disappearance, Fournier-Lane had filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. In court documents seen by NBC affiliate KGW8 of Portland, she gave her name as Susan Lane.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:37:34 GMT",
    "summary": "One of two remaining co-defendants in Georgia's longest-running criminal trial was stabbed in jail, his lawyer said Monday morning, as jurors resumed deliberations in the sprawling racketeering case that had included rap superstar Young Thug.",
    "story": [
      "One of two remaining co-defendants in Georgia's longest-running criminal trial was stabbed in jail, his lawyer said Monday morning, as jurors resumed deliberations in the sprawling racketeering case that had included rap superstar Young Thug.",
      "Douglas Weinstein, a lawyer for Deamonte Kendrick, a rapper known as Yak Gotti, said in a TikTok post that he was stabbed in the Fulton County Jail's south annex and spoke with him Sunday night as he was awaiting to be transported to a hospital for stitches.",
      "\"While he sounded tired, I expect him to make a full recovery,\" Weinstein posted on X. \"I expect to be able to see him in court today and will know more then.\"",
      "Weinstein could not immediately say the circumstances surrounding the incident or the extent of Kendrick's injuries.",
      "The Fulton County Sheriff's Office confirmed in a statement that Kendrick was involved in a physical altercation with another inmate and required \"treatment for minor injuries from a sharp object at the Fulton County Jail.\"",
      "\"This is an active investigation to determine the aggressor in this incident and if charges will be pending,\" sheriff's office spokeswoman Natalie Ammons said.",
      "The Fulton County Jail, including its south annex and two other locations, are part of a federal investigation announced by the Justice Department last month that alleges inmates' civil rights are being violated and officials have allowed for poor living conditions and rampant violence. Last year, according to the report, there were more than 300 stabbings involving contraband and makeshift weapons. The review was opened after an inmate was found dead in a bed bug-infested cell in 2022; Fulton County officials have said they are working to address the issues raised.",
      "Meanwhile, jurors in the case against Kendrick and co-defendant Shannon Stillwell returned to court Monday morning to decide the men's fate in connection to multiple charges linked to the state's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, statute. The deliberations began last Tuesday afternoon.",
      "The case initially featured 28 co-defendants, including Young Thug, whom Fulton County prosecutors accused in a 2022 indictment of leading an Atlanta street gang, Young Slime Life, or YSL. (Young Thug founded his own label, YSL Records, in 2016.)",
      "The trial against the co-defendants started in January 2023 but dragged on through multiple delays and unexpected turns after several defendants took plea deals while others chose to be tried separately from Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Lamar Williams.",
      "Opening statements began in November 2023 with six co-defendants. The proceedings, which have been livestreamed, have riveted social media users, with prosecutors using the Grammy-winning rapper's song lyrics to claim violence and illegal acts and bizarre moments involving alleged drug exchanges, uncooperative star witnesses and combative incidents involving the previous judge.",
      "In December 2023, Stillwell was stabbed during a fight in jail, further delaying the trial.",
      "The trial was halted again in July, when the original trial judge was removed after holding a private meeting with prosecutors and a star witness that failed to include members of the defense. Then, in October, the trial began to unravel following a prosecutorial misstep during a witness' testimony, leading to a possible mistrial.",
      "Four of the six co-defendants entered into plea agreements, including Young Thug. In taking a deal, the rapper was released from jail with his 40-year sentence commuted to time served and 15 years of probation.",
      "Georgia's previous longest criminal trial lasted about eight months and involved Atlanta public school educators accused of racketeering in a cheating scandal."

      "Cyber Monday takes place every year on the Monday after Thanksgiving. It's historically the biggest and most profitable day for online shopping of the year.",
      "Cyber Monday 2024 is on Monday, Dec. 2. But Black Friday and Cyber Monday are no longer just 24-hour events \u2014 brands have morphed their holiday sales into weeks of doorbuster deals.",
      "Prices for already on-sale products likely won\u2019t drop any lower on Cyber Monday. Retailers might add new deals to their offerings, but the selection is largely a repeat of Black Friday. Because of this, I wouldn\u2019t recommend waiting to shop. If the current deal price fits within your budget, it\u2019s best to purchase it as soon as you find it \u2014 waiting could mean it sells out.",
      "Most Cyber Monday sales end at 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 2, but you may see some run through the end of this week. That said, the strongest deals usually end once Cyber Monday is over.",
      "How I found the best Cyber Monday deals",
      "All of my recommendations above are based on NBC Select\u2019s previous coverage and reporting. I also included products the NBC Select staff tested, including Wellness Award, Travel Award, Pet Award, Bed & Bath Award and Giftable Tech Award winners. All the deals I recommend are at least 20% off and highly rated with at least a 4.0-star average rating from hundreds of reviews. When possible, I ran deals through price trackers like CamelCamelCamel to ensure products are at their lowest price in at least three months.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 19:55:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Rep. Jamie Raskin, who served as the lead Democratic prosecutor in Donald Trump's second impeachment trial, will challenge Rep. Jerry Nadler for House Judiciary chairman.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., a former constitutional law professor who served as Democrats\u2019 lead prosecutor in the Trump impeachment trial after the Jan. 6 attack, told colleagues Monday he will challenge Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., for the top Democratic spot on the powerful Judiciary Committee.",
      "Nadler, 77, has held the top job on the Judiciary panel since 2019, served in Congress since 1992 and has suffered some health scares in recent years. While Raskin is 61 years old, his bold challenge to Nadler is another example of a new generation of Democratic stars taking on the old guard \u2014 and the party's seniority system \u2014 and follows disappointing losses for the party in the 2024 elections.",
      "\u201cIn the 119th Congress, the Judiciary Committee will be the headquarters of Congressional opposition to authoritarianism and MAGA\u2019s campaign to dismantle our Constitutional system and the rule of law as we know it,\u201d Raskin, a cancer survivor who also served on the special House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack, wrote in a letter to colleagues Monday.",
      "\u201cI hope to be at the center of this fight and \u2014 as someone who has battled cancer and chemotherapy \u2014 I can tell you that I will never, never surrender,\" he continued.",
      "In his three-page letter, Raskin, the current ranking member of the Oversight Committee, also offered praise for Nadler, who is running for his fourth term leading Democrats on the Judiciary panel.",
      "\u201cI should say, finally, that I take this step with respect and boundless admiration for my friend Jerry Nadler and his remarkable half-century of service in public office in New York and Congress. ...\u00a0 If I\u2019m lucky enough to be chosen for this responsibility in the 119th Congress,\" Raskin wrote, \"I will turn to Jerry first and throughout for his always wise counsel and political judgment.\u201d",
      "Raskin, who was first elected to the House in 2016, is not the only Democrat to announce a challenge to a longtime committee leader this year. Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., told colleagues in his own letter Monday that it was time for him to \u201cpass the torch\u201d as the leading Democrat on the Natural Resources Committee after Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., announced he would challenge the 76-year-old for the job.",
      "Grijalva, who has served in Congress since 2003, had missed votes for several months after he announced a cancer diagnosis in April. Huffman, 60, was first elected to Congress in 2012.",
      "A race for the top position on the Agriculture Committee is also shaping up, with Reps. Jim Costa, D-Calif., and Angie Craig, D-Minn., vying to unseat longtime Rep. David Scott, D-Ga., who is 79 years old and has battled health issues for years.",
      "The Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, which is closely aligned with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., is expected to make recommendations to the full Democratic Caucus next week about which members should serve as the top Democrats on each committee in the next Congress. The caucus would then take a final vote."

      "Gen Alpha\u2019s hyper-online manner of speaking has officially entered the zeitgeist.",
      "Oxford University Press announced Monday that \u201cbrain rot\u201d \u2014 the catch-all term for bizarre and semi-unintelligible extremely online language \u2014 is its 2024 word of the year.",
      "The academic publishing house defined brain rot as \u201cthe supposed deterioration of a person\u2019s mental or intellectual state, especially viewed as the result of overconsumption of material (now particularly online content) considered to be trivial or unchallenging. Also: something characterized as likely to lead to such deterioration.\u201d",
      "The first use of \"brain rot\" preceded the internet: It was in Henry David Thoreau\u2019s 1854 book \"Walden.\" But \"the term has taken on new significance in the digital age,\" Oxford University Press wrote, thanks in large part to Gen Z and Gen Alpha communities online.",
      "Gen Alpha are defined as children born after 2010. Their separation from Gen Z is a matter of being born in 2010 versus 2009.",
      "\"These communities have amplified the expression through social media channels, the very place said to cause 'brain rot,'\" Oxford Languages President Casper Grathwohl said in a statement. \"It demonstrates a somewhat cheeky self-awareness in the younger generations about the harmful impact of social media that they\u2019ve inherited.\"",
      "Between 2023 and 2024, the term \u201cbrain rot\u201d increased in usage frequency by 230%, according to Oxford University Press.",
      "The term is often used in \"a humorous or self-deprecating manner by online communities,\" Oxford University Press said. The lingo is often associated with words like: \u201csigma,\u201d someone who is cool or a leader; \u201cgyatt,\u201d which is an exclamation for a curvaceous woman; and \u201cSkibidi,\u201d as in \u201cSkibidi Toilet,\u201d a term derived from a YouTube series that is now used to mean basically anything.",
      "Just as it has in years past, Oxford University Press said it again enlisted the public\u2019s help in choosing its word. More than 37,000 people voted this year. The term \u201cbrain rot\u201d was selected from a short list of six words. The other words on the list were \u201cdemure,\u201d \u201cdynamic pricing,\u201d \u201clore,\u201d \u201cromantasy\u201d and \u201cslop.\u201d",
      "\u201c\u2018Brain rot\u2019 speaks to one of the perceived dangers of virtual life, and how we are using our free time,\u201d Grathwohl said. \u201cIt feels like a rightful next chapter in the cultural conversation about humanity and technology.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 18:53:54 GMT",
    "summary": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2014 The former Illinois sheriff\u2019s deputy charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Sonya Massey could soon be set free, following an appellate court ruling that cleared the way for his pre-trial release.",
    "story": [
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. \u2014\u00a0The former Illinois sheriff\u2019s deputy charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Sonya Massey could soon be set free, following an appellate court ruling that cleared the way for his pre-trial release.",
      "At a hearing Monday, a circuit court judge said he will on Friday determine the restrictions for Sean Grayson\u2019s release. The judge, Ryan Cadagin, had previously denied Grayson\u2019s pre-trial release. But an appellate court overturned that ruling in a unanimous decision Wednesday. Sangamon County State\u2019s Attorney John Milhiser said his office plans to appeal that ruling.",
      "Cadagin said he would comply with the court order and determine \u201cthe least restrictive conditions\u201d for Grayson\u2019s release.",
      "Grayson, appeared via video conference from jail with one of his attorneys by his side. He spoke only to say \u201cYes, your honor\u201d when asked whether he had waived his right to appear in person at Friday\u2019s hearing.",
      "Grayson shot and killed Massey in her home in Springfield on July 6. Massey, who had dealt with mental health issues, had called 911 to report a potential prowler. Body camera video shows that as Grayson spoke to her in her living room, he noticed a pot of hot water on her stove. Massey got up to remove it and, as she was handling the pot, several feet away from Grayson and his partner, she twice said, \u201cI rebuke you in the name of Jesus.\u201d Grayson told her that she \u201cbetter [expletive] not\u201d and yelled at her to drop the pot. As she ducked, the video shows, he fired three shots, one of which struck Massey beneath her left eye.",
      "The video also showed that Grayson had told his partner not to render aid to Massey because, he said, she had sustained a shot to the head.",
      "Cadagin had initially denied Grayson\u2019s release because he said his actions were \u201ca departure from the basic expectations of civil society.\u201d At a hearing in August, Cadagin rejected Grayson\u2019s request to be released to accommodate his medical needs, which include treatment for colon cancer, saying that electronic monitoring would not sufficiently protect the community from Grayson. One of Grayson\u2019s attorneys, Mark Wykoff, had argued that the threat had been mitigated because Grayson was no longer working in his official capacity since he had been fired from the Sangamon County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "In its unanimous decision issued Wednesday, the 4th District Appellate Court ruled Cadagin\u2019s having denied Grayson pre-trial release was improper.",
      "\u201cThe trial court\u2019s focus on defendant\u2019s failings as a law enforcement officer, while understandable, distracted from the central question of how to address any risk he posed after being stripped of his office,\u201d the appellate court\u2019s ruling states.",
      "Massey\u2019s killing drew national attention as another example of police fatally shooting a Black person in their home. Grayson is white.",
      "Sheriff Jack Campbell\u00a0resigned in August amid public outcry and after Gov. JB Pritzker said he had failed at his job and should step down. Campbell was aware Grayson had pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol on two occasions, one of which led to his premature discharge from the Army in February 2016, according to various personnel records. Those records obtained by NBC News indicate Grayson had moved among six law enforcement agencies in central Illinois in four years and that he had drawn concerns over his aggression and integrity issues at some of them.",
      "The Justice Department recently notified officials in Sangamon County that it had opened an investigation into Massey\u2019s killing.",
      "More than a dozen protesters gathered outside of the courthouse Monday, chanting \u201cSonya\u2019s life matters!\u201d Some carried cardboard signs that read: \u201cJustice for Sonya.\u201d",
      "James Wilburn, Massey\u2019s father, attended Monday\u2019s hearing and slammed the appellate court\u2019s ruling afterward.",
      "\u201cThis appellate court ruling was a serious miscarriage of justice, as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to get justice for my daughter, whatever it takes. Whatever it takes.\u201d",
      "He took exception to the judge considering Grayson receive \u201cthe least restrictive conditions\u201d upon release.",
      "\u201cWhen my daughter can get up and walk out of that cemetery, then he can get out of jail,\u201d Wilburn said.",
      "Maggie Vespa reported from Springfield, Ill. Janelle Griffith reported from New Jersey."

      "A white former Kansas City, Kansas,\u00a0police detective was found dead Monday on the day his federal civil rights trial was set to begin for allegedly sexually abusing Black women over decades, authorities said.",
      "An arrest warrant had been issued when Roger\u00a0Golubski, 71, failed to appear at a federal courthouse in Topeka on the first day of jury selection. Department of Justice officials confirmed his death.",
      "\"This matter involved extremely serious charges, and it\u00a0is always difficult when a case is unable to be fully and fairly heard in a public trial and weighed and determined by a jury,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke and U.S. Attorney Kate Brubacher for the District of Kansas said in a statement. \"The proceedings in this case may be over, but its lasting impact on all the individuals and families involved remains. We wish them peace and the opportunity for healing as they come to terms with this development and ask that they all be treated with respect and their privacy respected.\"",
      "Authorities did not immediately disclose the manner of Golubski's death. His attorney and local law enforcement did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Golubski was charged in 2022 with federal civil rights crimes after he was accused of exploiting Black women for sex and framing people for crimes they say they did not commit.",
      "Golubski, who\u00a0retired in 2010 after 35 years with the Kansas City Police Department, pleaded not guilty to six counts of\u00a0deprivation of civil rights. Federal investigators said the case was related to the rape of a woman from 1998 to 2001 and another woman from 1999 to 2002 while he was employed by the department. He was also charged with three others in a separate case for allegedly running a sex trafficking ring from 1996 to 1998 that held women captive.",
      "Golubski had been on house arrest as he was receiving regular dialysis treatments and faced up to life in prison if he were convicted.",
      "Christopher Joseph, Golubski's lawyer, told a judge when his client failed to show up in court that he had been \"despondent\" over the media attention on his case. Joseph did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Kansas City Police Department has come under scrutiny over allegations of corruption and civil rights violations in recent years. Activists have\u00a0called for a broader federal investigation, particularly in light of the alleged abuses\u00a0for decades under Golubski.",
      "Jay Z's\u00a0Team Roc, the social justice arm\u00a0of his Roc Nation entertainment company, filed a lawsuit last month accusing Kansas City of violating public records laws by failing to produce law enforcement records related to claims of police abuse and misconduct.",
      "Team ROC managing director Dania Diaz said the trial would have been meaningful accountability, and Golubski's accusers and the community must continue to be heard.",
      "\"The truth was always going to be revealed in court, but today's development is certainly a tragic ending to a devastating story for a local community that still deserves answers and healing,\" Diaz said."

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 17:54:25 GMT",
    "summary": "As June\u2019s Pride Month festivities were nearing a conclusion, Tractor Supply released a statement that put LGBTQ+ rights proponents on alert.",
    "story": [
      "As June\u2019s Pride Month festivities were nearing a conclusion,\u00a0Tractor Supply\u00a0released a statement that put LGBTQ+ rights proponents on alert.",
      "The farm-focused retailer\u00a0said\u00a0it would stop sponsoring events such as pride celebrations and eliminate roles tied to diversity initiatives. Also on its list of actions: Tractor Supply would no longer submit data to the LGBTQ+ group Human Rights Campaign for its annual Corporate Equality Index.",
      "With that move, Tractor Supply became the first domino to fall as companies began pulling out of the Corporate Equality Index. In the following months, businesses ranging from\u00a0Ford\u00a0to\u00a0Lowe\u2019s\u00a0also announced they would stop submitting data for the index, a two-decade-old benchmark widely considered a gold standard for evaluating companies\u2019 policies and benefits for LGBTQ+ employees.",
      "The latest came on Nov. 25, when\u00a0Walmart\u00a0\u2014 the largest retailer and private employer in the U.S. \u2014 said it would\u00a0stop\u00a0sharing data with the HRC. Walmart said it had conversations with Robby Starbuck, the director-turned-conservative activist, ahead of its announcement.",
      "Starbuck has been a public advocate for this shift, launching campaigns centered on companies he believes have run afoul with corporate diversity work. He told CNBC in an interview that he is ramping up these actions and would be homing in on retailers for the holiday season.",
      "While Starbuck has targeted DEI initiatives more broadly, not just LGBTQ+ policies, the Human Rights Campaign has found its index at the center of a politically charged battle. The shift also pushed some allied groups and LGBTQ+-identifying consumers to speak out.",
      "For Tractor Supply and some others, it marked a staunch turn in policy. Just two years ago, the retailer had\u00a0boasted publicly\u00a0that it earned a top rating from the HRC. On that same day in 2022,\u00a0Molson Coors\u00a0published a\u00a0press release\u00a0stating it had received a perfect score for the 19th straight year.",
      "CNBC reached out to every company mentioned in this article; each company either did not provide further comment beyond public statements or did not respond to requests for details on what drove the changes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very proud and honored to be recognized by the HRC with a 100 percent ranking for our LGBTQ workplace equality practices and policies,\u201d Dave Osswald, chief people and diversity officer for Molson subsidiary MillerCoors, said in the 2022 release. \u201cNo matter the recognition though, we know we can never stop working to ensure a welcoming and inclusive environment.\u201d",
      "In the past two years, experts say, the rising concern around how the federal judiciary could rule on cases tied to diversity work has pushed companies to rethink related internal policies. Continued pressure from right-wing activists to do away with initiatives such as supplier quotas and carbon goals has turned up the heat, they said.",
      "The tide change among some of America\u2019s most well-known brands on this index is the latest instance of white-collar diversity efforts becoming a political flashpoint. Multiple business professors told CNBC that it adds to a broader picture of corporate America backtracking on this work less than half a decade after the numerous promises made in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder.",
      "\u201cThese companies that are making these really public statements, like Lowe\u2019s or Ford Motor companies of the world, are really making an unforced error,\u201d said New York University Law professor Kenji Yoshino.",
      "Companies change course",
      "For several companies, withdrawal from participation in the index comes after years of involvement and previous promotion of their scores.",
      "Take Jack Daniel\u2019s parent\u00a0Brown-Forman, which said in August that it would no longer submit data for the index \u2014 four months after being named in Forbes\u2019 \u201c2024 America\u2019s Best Employers for Diversity\u201d\u00a0list.",
      "The company mentioned that it earned a 100% score for 12 straight years in its 2023\u00a0annual report. Brown-Forman also created in 2022 an initiative aimed at increasing the number of salaried employees in the U.S. who identify as LGBTQ+.",
      "Ford, meanwhile, said in a leaked internal memo to employees in August that it would stop participating in the index and other best workplace rankings. Ford published a\u00a0press release\u00a0in 2017 centered on its perfect rating, and touted it was the first automaker to receive a 100% score \u2014 an achievement the Detroit-based company maintained every year since 2004.",
      "\u201cFord remains committed to supporting diversity and inclusion because we believe it makes our company stronger,\u201d Meeta Huggins, Ford\u2019s then-chief diversity officer, said in the 2017 statement.",
      "Lowe\u2019s, too, said in August that it would\u00a0end participation\u00a0in the index\u2019s survey, along with sponsorships for community events such as parades and fairs. Three years ago, the home improvement retailer posted on its\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0page that it earned a 100% score for the second straight year.",
      "\u201cLowe\u2019s dedication to diversity and inclusion grows from the steadfast values of our associates and extends to every corner of our company,\u201d the company said in the post.",
      "Walmart leadership also once applauded its place atop the HRC\u2019s ranking. Human resources chief Donna Morris posted on X in 2022 that she was\u00a0\u201cproud\u201d\u00a0of the Arkansas-based company for its recognition as a top workplace for the sixth straight year.",
      "Harley-Davidson and\u00a0Toyota\u00a0are also on the growing list of companies declining to provide data for the ranking system going forward.",
      "'Like a rubber band'",
      "The HRC\u2019s index, which launched in 2002, rates companies on factors such as the equitability of their benefits and their corporate social responsibility efforts. In addition to a survey sent to companies, the HRC also reviews tax filings, legal cases and news reports when evaluating firms.",
      "Business and law experts don\u2019t point to one silver bullet that catalyzed this change in sentiment. Instead, they see both rising political pressure and legal concerns at play.",
      "First, right-wing pressure online has become increasingly hard to ignore, said Stephanie Creary, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. Public shaming of companies for their diversity practices was happening long before Starbuck began pressing the issue, Creary said.",
      "\u201cThis has become politicized,\u201d Creary said. \u201cIt was not a tool, either way, that was leveraged by people running for office in quite the way that it is now.\u201d",
      "Creary said the internet gives people who don\u2019t support LGBTQ+ rights easy access through the index to businesses that they may want to protest against. This backlash has turned what was once seen as a \u201creputation enhancer\u201d into something that a handful of companies no longer view as worth touching, she said.",
      "NYU\u2019s Yoshino said recent legal rulings and\u00a0cases\u00a0have already put companies, universities and other organizations on edge.",
      "Yoshino pointed specifically to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on affirmative action in June 2023, which ruled that policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina that gave weight to a would-be student\u2019s race are unconstitutional. The court\u2019s majority opinion said the schools\u2019 affirmative action programs \u201cunavoidably employ race in a negative manner, involve racial stereotyping, and lack meaningful end points.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Supreme Court gave us such a clear window into how it was thinking about race and discrimination in that case,\u201d Yoshino said. \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time before that way of thinking will trickle over into statutes that do affect the private sector.\u201d",
      "However, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no universe in which giving your data with regard to the number of LGBT people within your ranks, or your support for LGBT rights, or your inclusion of LGBT individuals is going to run afoul of the law.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, this plays into a bigger trend of companies backtracking on diversity promises made after Floyd\u2019s murder by a police officer\u00a0galvanized racial equity efforts\u00a0in 2020, said Adina Sterling, an associate professor at Columbia Business School.",
      "When companies pull out of the index or\u00a0walk back other diversity efforts, it suggests that they were never genuinely interested in the work to begin with, Sterling said. Rather, many corporations were only trying to win goodwill in a moment when diversity was considered a favorable topic in corporate America, she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a rubber band: Organizations frequently will snap back into the state that they were in previously,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cI wish it weren\u2019t that way, and I don\u2019t think it has to be that way.\u201d",
      "'Far off course'",
      "While some companies have tried to frame their statements as unrelated to Starbuck\u2019s activism, he told CNBC there are typically conversations between him and executives after he begins researching their businesses.",
      "Companies have responded to Starbuck\u2019s campaigns and general pressure around corporate diversity programs in different ways. Some, including\u00a0Tractor Supply\u00a0and\u00a0Harley-Davidson, released public statements. Ford, on the other hand, sent an internal memo to employees that was obtained and\u00a0shared online\u00a0by Starbuck. Several companies have pointed out that they were already in the process of rejiggering their diversity efforts before Starbuck began applying public pressure.",
      "Starbuck started with an emphasis on companies, such as Tractor Supply, that have mainly conservative-leaning customers, but he is broadening his focus. He also hopes to hire more researchers to investigate employee claims. Starbuck said his team initially \u201cstopped counting\u201d after receiving 5,000 complaints from whistleblowers within companies who believe their employers have gone too far on diversity efforts.",
      "Starbuck said he felt inclined to do this work because he believes certain corporate diversity policies have become \u201cblatantly illegal and violates our existing civil rights laws.\u201d Starbuck said he doesn\u2019t argue against the validity of laws ensuring equal protection of employees from marginalized backgrounds, but he said some companies\u2019 current initiatives have created instances of what he sees as discrimination against white people.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a public company and you\u2019re expected to serve everybody, you\u2019ve got to fundamentally operate differently,\u201d Starbuck said in an interview. \u201cI think we\u2019ve just veered far off course.\u201d",
      "Starbuck said he sees the incoming Trump administration doing \u201ca lot of good\u201d on this front.",
      "Advocates push back",
      "The HRC and other groups are fighting back against what they see as a public disregard for LGBTQ+ issues. The group has pointed repeatedly to data showing consumers were more likely to support businesses that affirmed this community. Four out of five LGBTQ+ consumers, the group said, are opting to boycott companies that are rolling back initiatives. More than half will urge others to do so also.",
      "It\u2019s a group that makes a sizable contribution to the American economy. Data from LGBT Capital clocked purchasing power from the community in the U.S. at\u00a0$1.4 trillion\u00a0annually. That\u2019s roughly equivalent to the entire gross domestic products of Mexico and Spain, according to\u00a0Worldometer.",
      "\u201cConsumers are two times more likely to want to buy from brands that support the community,\u201d HRC President Kelley Robinson told CNBC in an on-air interview. \u201cThis is, bottom line, the best thing to do for businesses, and that\u2019s why I think that we\u2019re seeing so much energy from employees, from consumers and from shareholders starting to push back on these decisions.\u201d",
      "Robinson told CNBC that companies withdrawing their participation would have their scores slashed as a result. Prior to Walmart\u2019s announcement, each company saw a 25-point deduction on their scores, out of 100. The HRC confirmed to CNBC that Walmart\u2019s score is currently under review.",
      "She also emphasized that corporations can be rated regardless of whether they submit data. Additionally, the HRC has been quick to point out that overall participation in the index is rising. The HRC was joined by several other civil rights groups on a\u00a0co-written letter\u00a0to Fortune 1,000 companies calling on them to recommit to diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, efforts.",
      "\u201cThese capitulations weaken businesses and the American economy more broadly,\u201d said the letter from HRC and more than a dozen organizations, including the NAACP and UnidosUS. \u201cThese shortsighted decisions make our workplaces less safe and less inclusive for hard-working Americans.\u201d",
      "Several dozen Democrats in Congress also wrote a\u00a0letter\u00a0to Fortune 1,000 businesses asking them to embrace DEI. This letter did not explicitly name the HRC index, but an\u00a0accompanying press release\u00a0clarified that it was written in response to companies \u201csuccumbing to a conservative media campaign.\u201d",
      "Starbuck, on the other hand, said his work has made \u201ccompanies acutely aware that the HRC is not the powerful influencer that they believed they were.\u201d He said in a\u00a0post on X\u00a0that the changes at Walmart specifically were his \u201cbiggest win yet\u201d and should send \u201cshockwaves throughout corporate America.\u201d Starbuck also recently shared a\u00a0meme of a grim reaper\u00a0walking up to doors with the names of companies deemed \u201cwoke\u201d on them.",
      "Still, some smaller organizations and individuals have thrown their support to the HRC. After Tractor Supply\u2019s June announcement, the Tennessee Pride Chamber\u00a0removed\u00a0the company as a member. Tractor Supply was nominated for the organization\u2019s corporate partner of the year award in 2024 and had been slated to sponsor a networking event for the group the following month.",
      "\u201cThese are not partisan issues, but a matter of human rights and sustainable business practice,\u201d the Tennessee Pride Chamber said in a press release.",
      "Tennessee Pride had just a few hours\u2019 notice from a contact within Tractor Supply that the company\u2019s statement was coming, according to executive director Stephanie Mahnke. She said she had previously been made aware by Tractor Supply representatives that there were some safety concerns tied to the event they were hosting, so they were preparing to enhance security.",
      "\u201cWe were completely caught off guard,\u201d Mahnke said.",
      "After, Mahnke said other companies quickly stepped up to fill the void left by Tractor Supply in running the July event. In conversations, Tennessee Pride members still appear committed to the organization and its values \u2014 with the caveat they are being quieter around DEI issues, given the environment, she said.",
      "For former Tractor Supply customer Ashe Taylor-Austin, the retailer\u2019s announcement pushed them to look elsewhere when purchasing supplies for their horse. Taylor-Austin said they were grateful to have alternatives, knowing LGBTQ+ shoppers in more rural areas likely wouldn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cWhen we got the news about Tractor Supply, I immediately started shopping around,\u201d said Taylor-Austin, who switched to buying from a small business. \u201cOnce you do that and you show, I guess, who you are, then I believe it.\u201d",

      "\"He said he came to this decision this weekend, and\u00a0he said he wrestled with this and, because he believes in the justice system, but he also believes that the raw politics infected the process and led to a miscarriage of justice,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Angola.",
      "She added: \"Hunter was singled out, and because his last name was Biden, because he was the president\u2019s son. That\u2019s what we saw. And so the president believed enough is enough, and the president took action, and he also believes that they tried to break his son in order to break him.\"",
      "Hunter Biden, the president's only surviving son, was found guilty in June on federal gun charges and pleaded guilty in a separate tax evasion case in September.",
      "Jean-Pierre was asked by reporters in September if the guilty plea changed Biden\u2019s mind to not pardon his son.",

      "\"We\u2019ve been asked that question multiple times.\u00a0Our answer stands, which is no,\" she said.",
      "Questions about whether Biden would pardon his son have swirled since last year. Before the jury reached its verdict in June, Biden said that he would accept its decision and not use his presidential pardon power if Hunter were to be convicted. A few days later, the president also told the press that he wouldn't commute his son's sentence in the gun case either.",
      "Those assertions from Biden came before he exited the 2024 presidential race.",
      "The president on Sunday issued a \u201cfull and unconditional pardon\u201d\u00a0for any offenses Hunter Biden has \u201ccommitted or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024,\u201d according to the White House statement.",
      "In a statement explaining his decision, Biden said, \"I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice \u2014 and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I\u00a0hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.\"",

      "After 14 seasons, the CBS drama will air its final episode Dec. 13, but fans of the show can still see several props and costumes at Wahlberg's fast-food restaurant chain, Wahlburgers.",
      "\u201cI took my two Danny Reagan costumes \u2014 my blue suit and my dress blues,\u201d he told People. \u201cI put them on mannequins and put them in a Wahlburgers.\u201d",

And I looked across, and he had tears in his eyes,\" he said. \"That memory for me still brings up a lot for me just, you know, because it kind of made me reflect on not just the 14 years of the show, but my whole life's journey.",
      "Wahlberg went on to explain that he was a fan of Selleck before he worked with him.",
      "\"To watch this man on TV as a little kid in a family where we didn't know if the lights were going to get turned off tonight, and if I'd ever be able to watch TV again, to suddenly now I'm working with this man, and he's there to support me on my last day of work.

      "The singer-actor-model has had a baby, released her second album, opened for Taylor Swift in London and performed at Coachella \u2014 all just in 2024.",
      "After announcing the birth of her child with her partner Robert Pattinson on Instagram in April, Waterhouse headed to the desert to play her Coachella set later that same month.",
      "And just a few months later, she opened for Taylor Swift at Wembley Stadium in London on Aug. 17, all before releasing her second record, \"Memoir of a Sparklemuffin,\" on Sept. 13.",
      "Since then, the 32-year-old has embarked on the \"Sparklemuffin Tour\" across the U.S. and Canada, which is set to wrap on Dec. 21 in Atlanta.",
      "In the midst of it all, Waterhouse stopped by TODAY the day before her album was released. She opened up about what the past few busy months in her life have been like \u2014 especially while raising her daughter.",
      "\"It is a lot,\" she said with a grin. \"It's just that love \u2014 just completely and utterly besotted. I didn't know that it would be this good.\"",
      "After her TODAY segment, the \"Daisy Jones & The Six\" actor ran up the stairs of Studio 1A to answer eight questions before 8 a.m. as part of our \"8 Before 8\" video series. Watch the video above \u2014 or keep reading for Waterhouse's answers on everything from parenting to making music to if she prefers \"Harry Potter\" or \"Twilight.\"",
      "A sparklemuffin is a rare Australian spider that I discovered on a late night Google scroll, and I decided that I wanted to make that the name of my album, \"Memoir of a Sparklemuffin.\"",
      "He's ridiculously wildly colored. He does this very like, razzle dazzle dance, and he's kind of self destructive, and he also might get eaten by his partner if he doesn't dance appropriately.",
      "So yeah, I'm a big David Attenborough fan, and I wanted to have this very cute, unknown spider be part of my album metamorphose, and each song kind of connects. Each group of song connects to the metamorphose of the sparklemuffin, and in tandem, me.",
      "This sounds insane. My album title is a little bit insane, but we love the sparklemuffin.",
      "I feel like I probably relate to \"Big Love\" right now the most. It's this big, kind of explosive song about, a search for love, or feeling this like huge, sort of like, biblical love.",
      "I think, you know, just being with my daughter in the last six months, I really feel kind of like, heart explosion. So I would say \"Big Love.\"",
      "I think it would just make it more fun, actually. There's so many hours before you get on stage of walking around, being in a different city \u2014 doing that with her will be amazing.",
      "And I've just been given these little headphones too by you guys, so now she's gonna have her ears protected as well.",
      "Favorite moments of parenting... ah, I think just like getting the baby. We have like, a routine of putting her in the swimming pool and jumping in and out of the pool.",
      "That\u2019s just always the most fun, like, end of the day, 5 p.m., we all get in the pool and be silly. It\u2019s amazing.",
      "The moment I found out, I got a phone call suddenly, and I just kind of couldn't believe it. I think I'd just done Coachella and I'd only just had the baby, like two months before.",
      "I think it was just this whirlwind and going, \"Oh my goodness.\" In a couple of months, I'm going to be in London doing the biggest thing that I've ever done, and I've just had a baby, which has made me feel so full of love.",
      "So I just felt like I was in this unbelievable time where all these magical dreams that I've always had were coming true.",
      "My favorite thing from that night was just seeing all my school friends, all my family, all gathered in one place. And, you know, just being part of this history-making tour.",
      "I think the memory I have the most is those sliding doors just opening and someone saying, \"Just go,\" and coming up and seeing like, a stadium that can take 92,000 people \u2014 that was something that I've never seen before.",
      "I think playing Karen in \"Daisy Jones & The Six\" had such an impact on me. I was playing a character that was so confident, that was part of a band, part of a unit.",
      "I knew I was going to be hanging out at Sound City Studios all the time. So I think acting in that, and putting myself in her shoes, and she's so brave and strong, you take on the character sometimes. I think it helped me get over a lot of my own insecurities, and made me kind of feel like I could go and make my record.",
      "That song was really just about kind of poking at myself. Those labels that you get boxed in when you're younger and how you have to, like, earn your stripes in doing new things.",
      "I think I've been someone that's done a couple of different things, and it was like a great chance to just kind of like, make fun of myself, and take labels and empower myself through them, and be able to giggle about them.",
      "I feel like Sabrina (Carpenter) is a bit of a sparklemuffin.",
      "Chappell (Roan), she's like warrior sparklemuffin.",
      "Who else am I loving right now? I love the Charli XCX record. That's kind of been on my rotation -- the \"Brat,\" the \"Short n' Sweet,\" and the \"(Rise and Fall of a) Midwest Princess.\"",
      "I would say \"Harry Potter\" because, I used to have a song that I would do with my friend about reading \"Harry Potter\" -- I absolutely love \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "Oooh, that's impossible. I've got to say the TV show, because that's like \u2014 those are my people. I loved doing that. But we couldn't have had the show without Taylor Jenkins Reid's book.",
      "I would say singing, but please don't  ruin my chance at getting an acting job.",
      "Oh, that's another really hard one. I mean, London's like my hometown. London's my heart, so I'd say London.",
      "Sneakers, that's not even hard. I can barely walk in heels at all. I'm constantly uncomfortable, so I can't wait to get back into sneakers immediately."

      "Despite enjoying seeing the outpouring of the love for the movie, Bode said there were reactions that made her feel \u201ca bit uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "In the video, Bode, who uses a wheelchair in real life and on screen, acknowledged that she is biased when it comes to her feelings about her own character. She said it was \"totally fine\" to make jokes about Nessarose\u2019s actions or personality because she is a fictional character.",
      "But, Bode explained, she was not okay with \u201caggressive comments and jokes about Nessa\u2019s disability,\u201d calling the messages \u201cdeeply uncomfortable because disability is not fictional.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, me, Marissa, is the person that is still disabled and in a wheelchair,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so it is simply a low hanging fruit that too many of you are comfortable taking.\u201d",
      "She continued, noting that in addition to her character, she's heard ableist jokes about herself. \u201cBefore even being cast in \u2018Wicked,\u2019 I had received comments just as me, Marissa,\u00a0not Nessa, around the words of \u2018Stand up for yourself,\u2019 \u2018I guess you can\u2019t stand him,\u2019 etc.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen these jokes are being made by non-disabled strangers with a punchline of not being able to walk, it very much feels like laughing at, rather than laughing with,\u201d she added.",
      "Bode said the most frustrating part about acknowledging such comments was how scared she was to voice her opinion.",
      "\u201cThese comments do not exist in a vacuum,\u201d she said. \u201cAggressive comments of wanting to cause harm and push Nessa out of her wheelchair, or that she deserves her disability are two very gross and harmful comments that real disabled people, including myself, have heard before.\u201d",
      "The actor noted that she has seen the repercussions that her peers have experienced when they have called out ableism.",
      "\u201cThese disabled creators\u2019 comments are flooded with ableist comments,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen speaking on ableism, they\u2019re told to just take a joke and that they\u2019re asking for too much, and to stop complaining, to the point where some of my disabled peers have needed to take a break online for their own mental well being.\u201d",

      "\u201cThankfully, I\u2019m at a place in my life today where I can recognize these jokes about disability are made out of ignorance,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say the same about Marissa 10 years ago, and it would have affected younger me a lot more, and I\u2019m worried that a younger version of myself is somewhere on the internet and is harmed by these comments.\u201d",

      "Bode made her feature film debut in the John M. Chu directed movie. The actor, who hails from Wisconsin, performed in plays in middle school and high school before she attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles in order to study acting.",

I know that I can act. I know other disabled talent that can act and can model,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cBut how much of the industry is willing to go for that and is willing to seek out disabled people and willing to listen? That was the one thing that I definitely bumped into.\u201d",
      "Bode is the first-ever physically disabled actor to take on the role of Nessarose, sharing that she was \u201cover the moon\u201d about the casting decision.",

    "story": [
      "While the rest of the world was waiting to see if Taylor Swift would make it to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas from her \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Tokyo to watch Travis Kelce, two women were invested in this year\u2019s game for a different reason.",
      "On Super Bowl Sunday, Samantha DiPippo,\u00a0Hallmark\u2019s senior vice president for programming, was at a watch party texting friends and fellow Hallmark executives.",
      "Their eyes were on the Kansas City Chiefs, a centerpiece of the NFL season if not for a star player\u2019s new courtship with the world\u2019s biggest pop performer, then for entering their fourth Super Bowl in five seasons. Those folks at Hallmark, a mainstay for romance lovers, had some ideas. Could another Lombardi Trophy for the Chiefs help bring those ideas to fruition?",
      "They were about to see \u2014 and the game was a nail-biter. The San Francisco 49ers held on to an early lead, 10-3, going into halftime. After Kansas City pulled ahead in the third quarter, the score was tied 19-19 by the fourth, sending the championship game into overtime.",
      "DiPippo\u2019s phone was blowing up with messages from her team. Then, thanks to the \u201cpower of the Chiefs,\u201d and, she says, \u201ca little bit of magic,\u201d Kansas City won 25-22 after a touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Mecole Hardman.",
      "\u201cCandice (DiLavore, senior manager at Hallmark) and I are just texting back and forth thinking, \u2018I hope this happens. I hope this happens,\u2019\u201d DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cAs it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "The answer to that question became a resounding yes. That movie is Hallmark\u2019s \u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,\u201d premiering Saturday, Nov. 30. The movie airs at 8 p.m. ET on Hallmark Channel.",
      "The film was shot over a period of about 15 days on location in Kansas City, including three days at Arrowhead Stadium.",
      "As it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hallmark executive Samantha DiPippo",
      "TODAY visited the set of the film in July to meet the stars and see Jenna Bush Hager make her film debut with a cameo. This was all while witnessing firsthand the hundreds of extras, dozens of Christmas trees and four football fields worth of lights to make, in the words of DiPippo, \u201cthe largest movie that Hallmark Channel\u2019s ever done.\u201d",
      "A match made in Hallmark heaven",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was announced in June as part of Hallmark\u2019s 2024 \u201cCountdown to Christmas\u201d lineup, which included a new partnership between the Chiefs and Hallmark.",
      "You\u2019re forgiven if you thought this movie would follow the true-to-life plot laid out by Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s romance, though.",
      "For the uninitiated, the Swift-Kelce timeline looks like this: In September 2023, Swift attended a Chiefs home game after rumors that Swift and tight end Travis Kelce were an item. Kelce notably had attended her \u201cEras Tour\u201d show in Kansas City just months before, and after the concert, used his podcast to tell the world that he tried (and failed) to give Swift his number.",
      "The rest, as many know, is history.",
      "Though Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s story produced an audience with an appetite for more football romance, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d isn\u2019t about a player and a pop star (Lifetime has that movie, and it's full of references to Swift); this follows a Chiefs employee and an NFL super fan.",
      "The screenwriter of \u201cHoliday Touchdown,\u201d Julie Sherman Wolfe, who\u2019s written more than 20 films for Hallmark, says she\u2019s always wanted to write \u201ca big football movie.\u201d The offer for this project came just a week after the Super Bowl, when her team, the 49ers, experienced that crushing defeat.",
      "When tackling the script, Wolfe says she leaned into her own family\u2019s unique superstitions and traditions.",
      "\u201cIt really was coming from a place in my heart about what we love the most about the game. I guess I would love people to know that you don\u2019t have to be a Chiefs fan to enjoy this movie,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThe Chiefs are in the movie, and it is about them, but it\u2019s about more than that. It\u2019s about things that are bigger than a team. It\u2019s about your team.\u201d",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d first introduces Alana (Hunter King) and her family of Chiefs super fans who run a merch store. In comes Derrick (Tyler Hynes), who\u2019s in charge of fan engagement for the Chiefs and oversees the annual fan of the year contest (which is real, by the way). Alana\u2019s family is, of course, in the running.",
      "Though Wolfe says one doesn\u2019t have to love the Chiefs to appreciate the movie, its cameos will elate those who do: NFL mom Donna Kelce, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis all appear.",
      "The film even took inspiration from a real job in the Chiefs org. Jayne Martin has been the vice president of fan experience for 23 seasons. She says she is \u201cbridging the gap between the team and our fans.\u201d",
      "In March, Wolfe spoke with Martin to go over the premise of the storyline. They touched on Martin\u2019s job responsibilities and walked through potential scenarios that the film\u2019s leading man might encounter.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for (Wolfe) to ensure that the narrative was realistic,\u201d Martin says.",
      "Wolfe also brought aspects of her own football fandom to the plot. Alana\u2019s last name, Higman, came from her friend\u2019s maiden name, in honor of her family of Chiefs fans. Derrick\u2019s last name meanwhile is Young \u2014 a nod to the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl competitors.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s for Steve Young from the 49ers,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cI had to put something in there.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s the Higmans\u2019 lucky Chiefs hat, which drives a subplot. Alana\u2019s family has a superstition: The Chiefs only go to the Super Bowl when that old beanie is worn by a family member on Christmas. Derrick doesn\u2019t believe it though \u2014 so when the hat goes missing, things go awry.",
      "Originally, Wolfe\u2019s draft referenced a vintage Chiefs baseball hat. After they sent a couple pages of the script to the Chiefs, DiPippo recalls one of the team\u2019s executives saying, \u201cI\u2019m reading this, and I\u2019m just thinking of my grandpa. My grandfather had a vintage Chiefs winter hat, and he would wear it all the time while he was shoveling snow, and that\u2019s my memory of him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading it, I\u2019m in my kitchen crying, and I text one of our other execs, and I said, \u2018It\u2019s a winter hat now, it\u2019s a winter hat now!\u2019\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "The Taylor Swift of it all",
      "It\u2019s undeniable that NFL experienced in 2023 season what has been dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift effect,\u201d or the increase in exposure and female audience that follows the famous singer.",
      "\u201cThe magic, the romance of the Taylor Swift and Kelce union really got people in that romance mood \u2014 and romance plus football, right?\u201d Wolfe says.",
      "Exactly. For Hallmark, project ideas really started flowing in December 2023, after a pair of commercials leaned into just that.",
      "The first was a Hallmark ad, which aired Christmas Day on ESPN and stars Wolfe herself. In it, she sits at her computer as if typing a screenplay and lists the many ways the 2023 NFL season played out like a Hallmark movie, from \u201cincredible stories\u201d to \u201cunexpected romance.\u201d",
      "Then in January, the Chiefs released a postseason commercial titled \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which is framed as a spoof trailer for a Hallmark-esque film about a diehard NFL fan who works at a Chiefs gift shop. (Sound familiar?) Hynes plays that fan, and Donna Kelce notably makes a cameo.",
      "DiPippo says the ESPN ad was a \u201cgreat catalyst\u201d to \u201cHoliday Touchdown.\u201d Then \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which she calls a \u201clittle bit of a love letter to Hallmark,\u201d helped inspire the premise of the movie.",
      "Hynes says that when the Chiefs approached him for the \u201cFalling for Football\u201d commercial, it felt a little more \u201ctongue in cheek.\u201d But starring in \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d required him to treat the type of film spoofed in the commercial with integrity.",
      "\u201cThis is a legitimate Hallmark movie that is filled with all the heart, sincerity, warmth and joy that these movies always have,\u201d says Hynes, who has been in more than 15 Hallmark films, including six in the 2024 season.",
      "Martin says Chiefs fan demographics have changed since Swift first appeared at Arrowhead Stadium and is now about 57% female. \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d is an example of an attempt to reach and engage that new audience with the Chiefs and the NFL as a whole, Martin says.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened.\u201d",
      "Screenwriter Julie Sherman Wolfe",
      "Though DiPippo believes Hallmark\u2019s partnership with the Chiefs could have happened without Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s 100% a pure Hallmark movie at heart,\u201d she says \u2014 Wolfe believes\u00a0a little of fate was still at play.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened. It was meant to be,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThey got the right people and the right time and Travis and Taylor, and everything happened the way it was meant to happen for this movie.\u201d",
      "While appearing on TODAY Nov. 27, Hynes said it's \"impossible\" for the Swift-Kelce inspiration \"to not find its way into the movie.\"",
      "\"We're telling a multigenerational family story,\" he said. \"It feels like something quintessentially Hallmark while still servicing the people who want to see a big football movie.\"",
      "Christmas in July",
      "While \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d strays from Kelce and Swift's relationship, being part of the film is surreal for star Hunter King, who identifies as a Swiftie and has her own \u201cinvisible string\u201d connection to it all.",
      "Kelce and Swift\u2019s storybook romance notably started after he attended an \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Kansas City. On July 7, King attended a Kansas City show with her sister, actor Joey King, who appeared in Swift\u2019s \u201cMean\u201d music video in 2011, then in \u201cI Can See You\u201d almost 13 years later. At that July 7 concert, Joey King joined Swift onstage.",
      "\u201cThe day that we started filming I think was almost exactly a year later,\u201d Hunter King says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Wait a second. It really is a full circle moment for me.\u2019\u201d",
      "The production kicked off shrouded in secrecy. Casting was \u201cincredibly difficult,\u201d DiPippo says, because they couldn\u2019t share many details about the project, and \u201ceverything had NDAs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the most secretive we\u2019ve ever had to be on any project,\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "So when production started up around Kansas City in July, it drew a crowd. In addition to Arrowhead Stadium, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was filmed in the suburb of Independence, Missouri. The local pizzeria Square Pizza was transformed into a fictional barbecue restaurant called Norma & Nic\u2019s, managed by Donna Kelce\u2019s character. Inside, garlands with red ornaments bordered the ordering counter. Chiefs memorabilia hung on the walls, and wreaths decorated every door.",
      "The entire production involved about two dozen Christmas trees used in rotation \u2014 including 18 used in one day \u2014 as well as more than 400 yards of lights of \u201cevery color ornament bulb you can imagine,\u201d according to Daniel King, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u2019s\u201d production designer.",
      "Most behind the scenes were met with challenges, like set decorator Christi Whiteley, who was in charge of decorating and re-decorating up to 20 trees over the course of a few days, and property master Hunter Nelson, who made sure edible props like holiday meals and gingerbread houses were preserved at certain temperatures.",
      "And speaking of temperatures \u2014 the July heat was a hurdle for everyone.",
      "At Arrowhead, about 1,000 extras filmed inside the stadium, wearing parkas, scarves and other winter gear as the temperature reached 99 degrees, though felt more like 102, according to the Weather app.",
      "Hunter King filmed the Arrowhead Stadium scenes with an ice pack in her pants, a neck fan and an undershirt fan. On a discomfort scale of 1 to 10, Hunter King says filming in the sun felt like a 9.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mostly the sweaters and then the coat over it, and in this heat and in the humidity, that\u2019s what really, really cranks it up a notch,\u201d she says.",
      "The heat didn\u2019t deter fans, though. At one point, while filming in Independence, there were about 70 people watching and standing in the sun, DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cThey were coming in Chiefs gear. There were kids, there were grandparents. It was just so cute to see how excited they were just because we\u2019re filming in their town,\u201d she says.",
      "TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager, who makes a cameo as a sports journalist, wore a heavy wool coat paired with a sweater-like tank top and white trousers. While rehearsing her scene on the field of Arrowhead, crew members held up umbrellas for the actors. One of the director\u2019s last calls before \u201caction\u201d was the cue to put on jackets. The first thing each actor did after hearing \u201ccut\u201d was rip those coats off.",
      "Chiefs players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis appear in the film during a game scene, so they got to dress in their Chiefs uniforms.",
      "And luckily for Andy Reid, the head coach\u2019s cameo only took about 15 minutes to film.",
      "Before he left Arrowhead after delivering his lines, Reid told Jenna that he never would have imagined his stadium as the setting for not one, but now two love stories.",
      "He adds, \u201cWhere we\u2019re at in today\u2019s world, this is a healthy thing.\u201d"

      "Lifetime's \"Christmas in the Spotlight,\" which premiered on the network Nov. 23, is seemingly inspired by the popular couple.",
      "The film focuses on mega pop-star Bowyn Sykes (Jessica Lord), who has blond hair, bright red lips and often sports a cat-eye. Bowyn is at the height of her career, focused on making music her fans love, baking for fun and not looking for a new boyfriend after being tired of only dating \u201cserious actors and indie rockers.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Drew \"Gonzo\" Gonville (Laith Wallschleger) is one of the best wide receivers in the league who, from the outside, seems like a playboy, but he really loves hanging out with his family and niece.",

      "The movie's writer Eirene Tran Donohue told USA Today that after seeing Swift cheering on Kelce during a football game, she thought, \"This could be a rom-com.\"",
      "\"I was like, \u2018Christmas and Taylor Swift?' These are the two great loves of my life,\" she said.",

      "In \"Christmas in the Spotlight,\" Bowyn and Drew meet backstage at one of her concerts. Drew then attempts to get Bowyn\u2019s attention after their brief meet up backstage by inviting her to a game over social media.",

      "On their first date, which just so happens to be in Bowyn's private jet, the two have a myriad of song lyric interactions relating to Swift's \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\" Bowyn says, \"I'm a tough kid.\" Then, Drew notes, \"You look like you\u2019re having the time of your life.\"",
      "Newscasters in the film are also given seemingly Swift inspired names: Chad Marcus (\"Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus\") and Aimee Hannah (\"Thank You Aimee\").",

      "The couple breaks up, but the world is still unaware they were ever together. While Bowyn privately mourns the relationship, the media begins speculating when she will release her next \"catchy break up\" song.",
      "Angry at the media and missing Drew, Bowyn decides to show up at his game and surprise him, sitting in his family box. (Swift and Kelce famously went public after she attended the Chiefs-Bears matchup at Arrowhead Stadium Sept. 24, 2023. She's since become a fixture in the box at Chiefs home games.)",
      "In the film, Drew, who initially wasn't having a great game, immediately turns it around after seeing Bowyn. After he scores a touchdown, Drew strikes Kelce's signature archer pose, which Swift has also made on stage during her aptly-titled song, \"The Archer.\"",

      "While initially heartbroken, Drew finally believes Bowyn after his brother (also a football player) and sister-in-law show him the full video, proving she tried to defend him.",
      "This moment could be a reference to the phone call audio Kim Kardashian leaked in 2016 between Swift and Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, over the rapper using her name in his song \"Famous.\" The footage caused the internet to turn on Swift, beginning the #TaylorSwiftIsOverParty trending hashtag. In 2020, the full, unedited clip was released online.",
      "After the truth is revealed, Drew resigns himself to thinking Bowyn is out of his league.",
      "Before Drew's football game and a Christmas gala he was supposed to host (notably featuring Bowyn as a guest performer), his niece gives him a friendship bracelet for good luck, spelling out an indecipherable mix of letters.",

      "(While Swift never confirms the inspiration for her songs, fans speculate that her songs \"The Alchemy\" and \"So High School\" are about Kelce.)",

      "Nevertheless, she gives a speech declaring her love in the hopes he is watching a livestream of her performance. (During each \"Eras Tour\" show, fans can often find a livestream on social media of the show filmed by a concert attendee.)",

      "\"I will always be your biggest cheerleader,\" he says, tying back to Swift's \"You Belong With Me\" once more, before asking her, \"Are we doing this?\"",

      "Nalo returns in the mid-credits scene. Previously seen only as a thunderous cloud, this time he's in human form with purple eyes and a lightening aura. He sits in his throne room, frustrated over Moana and Maui breaking his curse. He summons his servant Matangi (Awhimai Fraser), then confronts her about not stopping Moana. Unbeknownst to Nalo, Matangi had helped Moana find Motufetu.",

    "summary": "Syria's civil war has exploded back into life after Islamist rebels launched a lightning offensive on the northern city of Aleppo.",
    "story": [
      "In the messy patchwork of conflicts raging across the Middle East, one country has been absent from the spotlight: Syria.",
      "A civil war that dominated international headlines for more than a decade has now been reignited after a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a lightning offensive last week, seizing Aleppo, the country\u2019s second-largest city, from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime.",
      "The rebels took only hours to recapture territory that Assad\u2019s forces had spent years reclaiming. Fighter jets from Syria and its ally Russia soon began bombing the area \u2014 killing hundreds of the rebels but civilians, too, according to a leading monitoring group.",
      "\u201cThis is a very unstable situation with a huge amount of flux,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "Some anti-Assad activists hope it could herald the crumbling of a depleted regime; others fear the brutality of the Russia-Syrian response \u2014 as well as the hard-line ideology of the Islamist rebels themselves.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear how this may affect the 900 or so American troops still in the region, or the remnants of the Islamic State terror group that they are there to fight and that the Pentagon has warned may be regrouping.",
      "Here\u2019s what we do know:",
      "What happened?",
      "With little warning last Wednesday, a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a rapid assault that soon seized Aleppo as well as towns in the nearby Idlib and Hama provinces, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group.",
      "The rebels are being led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which grew out of a former al Qaeda affiliate called Jabhat al-Nusra and is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the United Nations and others.\u00a0The State Department has a $10 million bounty for information about its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "However, some analysts say the group has \u201cgreatly moderated\u201d its positions, as Robin Yassin-Kassab, author of \u201cBurning Country: Syrians in Revolution and War,\u201d wrote this week. \u201cIt\u2019s still an authoritarian Islamist militia\u201d but \u201chas a much more positive policy towards sectarian and ethnic minorities than ISIS,\u201d he said.",
      "For these anti-Assad observers, the group presents an opportunity to topple the brutality of his regime and its Russian and Iranian benefactors.",
      "But after the rebels\u2019 offensive, Syrian and Russian fighter jets responded by launching airstrikes on the rebel-held areas, with Assad\u2019s government claiming to have killed more than 400 of the \u201cterrorists.\u201d",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the number of rebels killed in five days of fighting at 244, with 61 civilians killed alongside 141 government troops.",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered his full support to Assad and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would do likewise. And on Monday, Iran-backed militias based in Iraq crossed the border into Syria to support the government there, according to the Observatory.",
      "Why is this happening now?",
      "Syria\u2019s time on the back burner of international attention is also one  reason it has roared back into prominence, some experts say.",
      "Assad once looked like he might be toppled by the diverse group of rebels that rose up against him after the Arab Spring of 2011. That he has survived was largely because of the intervention of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Lebanon-based proxy.",
      "Russia\u2019s indiscriminate bombing, in particular, turned the tide against the rebels. It also transformed then rebel-held cities such as Aleppo and Homs into moonscapes of rubble and rebar. In all, the U.N. has documented more than 350,000 deaths but says this is \u201ccertainly an undercount.\u201d",
      "Today, however, Russia, Iran and Lebanon are distracted and depleted.",
      "Russia\u2019s primary focus is on the war in Ukraine, where it is locked in an attritional battle of trenches, tanks and mud with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Washington-backed government in Kyiv. In recent years Moscow has withdrawn assets from Syria, potentially weakening Assad\u2019s grip on power, experts say.",
      "Likewise, Iran has taken a hit at the hands of Israel, which has gutted Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and targeted its missile arsenal, while also fighting Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIranians have also shown that their forces are stretched and perhaps not as powerful as people get them credit for,\u201d said Hellyer, the Russia analyst who was speaking from Cairo. All of this \u201cputs Assad in a much weaker position.\u201d",
      "But \u201cthe Syrian regime, in coordination with the Russians and less so the Iranians, will hit them with everything they\u2019ve got,\u201d he added.",
      "Washington and ISIS",
      "Less clear is what role, if any, the U.S. may play.",
      "As well as the American troops based in Syria, there are another 2,500 in neighboring Iraq that are part of a residual 80-country coalition to prevent ISIS from regrouping.",
      "However, it\u2019s far from certain these forces will remain there after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. He twice threatened to withdraw these troops during his first term.",
      "But the ISIS threat has not gone away, despite the group being purged in 2017 from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq over which it had governed.",
      "In July, the Pentagon warned ISIS attacks were on track to double year-on-year.",
      "If HTS were to seize the city of Deir el-Zour \u2014 a former ISIS stronghold \u2014 then ISIS could be freer to expand its influence across the east of the country, some analysts believe.",
      "\u201cAs Assad\u2019s regime moves resources to the northwest\u201d to try to fight off the rebels, \u201cISIS will reap the rewards, filling vacuums\u201d elsewhere,  Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said in a post on X.",
      "If Assad were to fall altogether, Iran may no longer be able to use Syria as a pipeline of weapons and other supplies to Hezbollah, the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington-based think tank, said in a briefing.",
      "However, any hopes for Assad's ouster should be tempered by who or what might replace him.",
      "\u201cMuch as I oppose the Assad regime, its atrocities and abuses, what is happening in Aleppo right now is terrifying. Many will die,\u201d Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, posted on X. \u201cIf there was a chance of a lovely peaceful outcome to the benefit of Syrians, I will be thrilled. This is unlikely.\u201d"

      "Yaalon was the IDF\u2019s chief of staff during the second intifada, or \u201cuprising\u201d by Palestinians against Israeli occupation, which ended in 2005. He also served as defense minister from 2013 to 2016, including during a 2014 war in Gaza that lasted more than six weeks and had been the longest conflict between Israel and Hamas until the current one.",
      "He quit in 2016, saying he no longer had faith in Netanyahu, and has been a fierce critic of the prime minister ever since.",

      "During Israel\u2019s war against Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, \u201cthe IDF acted in accordance with the highest standards that can be applied in the complex and difficult war that was forced upon us. The instructions and orders were always given in accordance with the law,\u201d Gallant said in a post on X.",

About 1,200 people were killed in that attack, while about 100 people who were taken hostage are still being held captive in Gaza more than a year later, according to Israeli tallies. Around a third of them are thought to be dead.",
      "The fighting has also displaced almost all of Gaza\u2019s population of 2 million.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Office has condemned the high number of civilian deaths in Gaza, saying in a report last month that almost 70% of the victims it verified in the six months to April 30 of this year were women and children.",

      "BEIRUT \u2014 Iran has thrown its support behind Syria's government after thousands of insurgents took control of the country's second-largest city of Aleppo and seized nearby towns and villages in a swift and surprise offensive.",
      "\u201cWe firmly support the Syrian army and government,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency, before he set off for Syria\u2019s capital Damascus on Sunday. \u201cThe Syrian army will once again be victorious over these terrorist groups as in the past,\u201d he added.",
      "His comments came after the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based war monitor, reported that insurgents led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham had seized control of Aleppo International Airport.",
      "The Observatory said that fighters from the group posted pictures from the airport that would mean it\u2019s the first international airport to be controlled by insurgents. The rebels now control \u201cthe majority of\u201d Aleppo after forcing the governor, police and security branches to retreat from the city center, it added.",
      "Russian and Syrian jets responded by striking the rebel-held city of Idlib on Sunday, according to the Observatory and the Syrian state-run news network Al-Ikhbariyah, in a second day of intensive bombing aimed at pushing back the insurgents.",
      "At least 347 fatalities, including 40 civilians, have been reported during the clashes, according to the war monitoring group, which relies on a network of on-the-ground information sources. Five children and three women were among the civilians killed by bombardment and airstrikes, it added.",
      "National security adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the U.S. has designated Hayat Tahrir al-Sham a \u201cterrorist enemy, so we have concerns, obviously, about that group.\u201d He also called for \u201cthe full implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that can bring a measure of peace and stability to Syria.\u201d",
      "The fighting further exacerbates Syria\u2019s humanitarian crisis, already one of the world\u2019s worst after 13 years of civil war, which began in 2011 as a protest movement against Assad\u2019s authoritarian rule but has since killed an estimated half-million people.",
      "The offensive raises questions about the preparedness of Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s armed forces. In his first public comments released by the state news agency Saturday evening, Assad said Syria will continue to \u201cdefend its stability and territorial integrity against terrorists and their supporters.\u201d Syria is able to defeat them no matter how much their attacks intensify, he added.",
      "The Observatory reported Sunday that his forces were sending \u201clarge reinforcements and drawing a defensive line around several cities and villages\u201d in the Hama Governorate, which sits to the south of Aleppo.",
      "Iran\u2019s renewed commitment to Assad underscores the geopolitical stakes in the conflict and exposes a complex web of rivalries, factions and foreign interventions that ensure Syria\u2019s turmoil persists.",
      "While Assad controls roughly 70% of Syrian territory, the remaining areas are held by a mix of opposition groups, Kurdish forces and countries like the U.S. and Turkey.",
      "Tehran sees Syria as a critical part of its regional strategy, providing a land corridor to Hezbollah in Lebanon and a front against Israeli influence.",
      "Iran\u2019s support for Assad mirrors that of Russia, which helped to turn the tide of the war during 2016\u2019s battle for Aleppo between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters. The victory helped Assad to secure his hold on strategic areas of Syria, with opposition factions and their foreign backers controlling areas on the periphery.",
      "Moscow\u2019s intervention also secured its military presence in Syria, including the naval base at Tartus, while bolstering Assad\u2019s grip on power.",
      "A main backer of Syrian opposition groups, Turkey said in recent weeks its diplomatic efforts had failed to stop government attacks on opposition-held areas. These were in violation of a de-escalation agreement it sponsored along with Russia and Iran.",
      "However, its primary focus is undermining Kurdish-backed rebel groups near its borders. Ankara has said Syrian Kurdish fighters are an extension of the separatist Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since the 1980s \u2014 a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people.",
      "The U.S., for its part, opposes Assad, opposes Russia and opposes Iran, but has allied itself with Syrian Kurdish forces despite their fight against the United States\u2019 NATO ally Turkey.",
      "Sullivan said it was \u201cno surprise\u201d that rebels have tried to take advantage of the main players backing the Syrian government, because Iran, Russian and Hezbollah have been distracted by other conflicts.",
      "Inside Aleppo, schools and government offices were closed Saturday as most people stayed indoors, according to Sham FM radio, a pro-government station, although bakeries were open.",
      "The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Friday that Aleppo\u2019s two key public hospitals were reportedly full of patients, while many private facilities were closed.",

      "\u201cI am happy, scared, in complete shock at the same time. People are in complete shock. Looking at the destruction is devastating,\u201d said Komayha, 58, adding that he had been to the funerals of a mother, her daughter and her son-in-law shortly after he returned.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do many tasks at the same time, cleaning the house, receiving neighbors, getting news from people who did not show up, asking about the casualties,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s hope this will be our last displacement. It feels great to get back home,\u201d he added.",
      "Others like Elham Ezzeldine were less fortunate. After she returned from her brother\u2019s house in Lebanon\u2019s capital Beirut to her home in the southern city of Tyre, she estimated it would cost her at least $30,000 to repair it.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t describe to you the amount of damage,\u201d the 51-year-old housewife said. \u201cThere are some areas and streets in Tyre that are on the ground. I don\u2019t know how long it will take us to go back to our normal life and city. My husband is not working. He used to have a clothing store in Tyre, which was completely demolished.\u201d",

      "While he counts the personal cost of the conflict, the cost of physical damage and economic losses for Lebanon will be around $8.5 billion, according to an estimate from the World Bank \u2014 a huge price for a country still suffering the effects of a financial collapse five years ago.",
      "And while the truce was the first major sign of progress in the region since war began more than a year ago, it did not address the war in Gaza, where United Nations and aid officials say hunger and desperation are growing among the population, almost all of which relies on humanitarian aid to survive.",

    "story": [
      "Australian lawmakers on Thursday approved a landmark ban on social media for children under 16 in some of the world\u2019s toughest such controls.",
      "The ban, which aims to address the impact of excessive social media use on children\u2019s physical and mental health, affects social media platforms including X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat and Reddit, but not YouTube.",
      "The platforms, which bear sole responsibility for enforcement, have one year to figure out how to implement the age limit, which is the highest set by any country. If there are systemic failures to keep children from having accounts, the platforms are liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million).",
      "Senators debated the legislation late into the night on the last day of their parliamentary session, which Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s center-left Labor government had targeted as the deadline for it to pass. The bill, which is also largely supported by the opposition Liberal Party, passed the House of Representatives on Wednesday by a vote of 102 to 13.",
      "Supporters of the ban have cited the effect of harmful depictions of body image on girls and the effect of misogynistic content on boys. Its passage comes after a series of Australian teenagers died by suicide over what their families said was online bullying.",
      "\u201cThe basis for this is that there is a feeling amongst the majority of Australians that social media does more harm than good,\u201d said Rob Nicholls, a senior research associate in media and communication at the University of Sydney.",
      "A YouGov poll released Tuesday found that 77% of Australians support the ban, up from 61% in August.",
      "Other countries have tried to impose limits on social media for children, including the U.S., which requires technology companies to obtain parental consent to collect data from children under 13.\u00a0But the Australian proposal goes further, with no exemptions for parental consent or pre-existing accounts.",
      "Opponents have criticized the Australian ban as too blunt an instrument and said its passage was too rushed.",
      "The bill, which was introduced in Parliament last week, allowed for only one day to submit opinions on it. Sen. Matt Canavan, who opposed the bill, said there had been 15,000 submissions about it during that day and that lawmakers had been able to review only a fraction of them.",
      "\u201cThis is a highly emotional issue and there is an understandable demand for politicians to be seen to be \u2018doing something\u2019 about it,\u201d he said Tuesday in a dissent that was published as part of a Senate committee report. \u201cYet it is also a highly complex area that should be examined carefully not in the hasty fashion that has beset this process.\u201d",
      "Google and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, had urged Australia to delay the legislation\u2019s passage Tuesday, saying more time was needed to assess the potential impact of the ban. ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, also said more consultation was needed.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X, blasted the ban last week as \u201ca backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all\u00a0Australians.\u201d",
      "Officials plan to enforce the age cut-off by trialing an age-verification system that could include biometrics or government identification, which no other country has tried, raising privacy concerns.",
      "A Senate committee signed off on the legislation late Tuesday but said social media platforms should find \u201calternative methods for assuring age\u201d rather than forcing users to submit personal information, such as their passports or other digital identification.",
      "Nicholls said the social media platforms would also be fined for failing to destroy personal information as soon as possible after they verifying users\u2019 ages.",
      "Outside the legislature, the ban has come under heavy scrutiny from parents and scholars who say social media can be a crucial source of support for young people, especially those who feel marginalized.",
      "\u201cSocial media provides vital connections for many young Australians, allowing them to access mental health resources, peer support networks, and a sense of community,\u201d Christopher Stone, executive director of Suicide Prevention Australia, said in a statement Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cCutting off this access risks exacerbating feelings of loneliness and isolation.\u201d",
      "The government has said it will ensure that young people have continued access to messaging apps such as WhatsApp, online gaming platforms such as Roblox and essential services related to health and education.",
      "\u201cYoung people, and in particular diverse cohorts, must be at the center of the conversation as an age restriction is implemented to ensure there are constructive pathways for connection,\u201d Sen. Karen Grogan, chair of the Senate committee on environment and communications legislation, said in its report.",
      "So far the government has not done enough to consult with young people, for whom social media is part of daily life, said Leo Puglisi, 17.",
      "\u201cThis is a government that is obviously not made up of teenagers, but it\u2019s making law about social media when they didn\u2019t grow up in the social media age,\u201d said Puglisi, the founder and chief anchor of 6 News Australia, a streaming news channel based in Melbourne that is majority-run by high schoolers.",
      "He said that while he is beyond the age cut-off, the ban would affect his audience, as well as the ability of some of the journalists on his team to do their work.",
      "In addition, he said, \u201cthere is certainly a possibility that every single Australian would need to use some form of ID to have social media. So in reality it would affect me, it would affect absolutely everyone.\u201d",
      "Daniel Angus, a professor of digital communication at Queensland University of Technology, said that the bill was \u201cillogical and uninformed\u201d and that it lacked critical details about how it will be implemented.",
      "The potential harms of social media the government cited are not sufficiently supported by high-quality research, Angus said in an email, noting that children who are disadvantaged, live in rural areas or are from minority groups rely on social media for community, education and advocacy.",
      "\u201cBy imposing a blanket ban, the government overlooks these essential and diverse experiences, thereby exacerbating existing inequalities,\u201d he said.",
      "He also said the exclusion from the ban of anonymous or web-based platforms such as 4chan \u201cparadoxically leaves young people vulnerable to some of the most harmful digital environments.\u201d",
      "The Heads Up Alliance, a grassroots collective of Australian parents seeking more restrictions on children\u2019s use of social media, said the bill was \u201cdeficient,\u201d giving it a grade of D+.",
      "The group said the ban would do nothing to address bullying on messaging apps, which also have \u201chighly addictive\u201d features.",

      "Exposure to sexual predators \u201cwill also remain a real risk\u201d on online gaming platforms and messaging apps, where many children banned from other social media are likely to migrate, the group said, adding: \u201cOur children will be jumping from the frypan into the fire.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "It is the\u00a0world\u2019s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how extraordinary it is,\u201d said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. \u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Van Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature -- which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July \u2014 is the first ever to take place.",
      "None has ever been seen alive at sea.",
      "The list of what scientists don\u2019t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don\u2019t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they\u2019ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don\u2019t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don\u2019t know how this one died.",
      "Over the next week, researchers studying the 5-meter (16-foot) -long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin hope to find out.",
      "\u201cThere may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,\u201d said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. \u201cWho knows what we\u2019ll discover?\u201d",
      "Only six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification.",
      "New Zealand is a\u00a0whale-stranding hotspot, with\u00a0more than 5,000 episodes recorded\u00a0since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.",
      "DNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species \u2014 and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn\u2019t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before.",
      "On Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks \u2014 normal, they said, and not the cause.",
      "The dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with M\u0101ori, New Zealand\u2019s Indigenous people. To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.",
      "Members of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -\u2013 a prayer -\u2013 over the creature before the study begins.",
      "\u201cAccording to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,\u201d said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.\u201d",
      "The iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale\u2019s head this week.",
      "\u201cIt all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "It\u2019s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean\u2019s deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery.",
      "The assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery.",
      "\u201cWhat we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,\u201d said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \u201cIn discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.\u201d"

      "Lawmakers in both houses of the Russian parliament, the State Duma and Federation Council, had already approved the plans in the past 10 days.",
      "Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine since February 2022 is Europe\u2019s biggest conflict since World War II and has drained the resources of both sides. Kyiv has been getting billions of dollars in help from its Western allies, but Russia\u2019s forces are bigger and better equipped, and in recent months the Russian army has gradually been pushing Ukrainian troops backward in eastern areas.",
      "New European Council President Antonio Costa and EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas arrived in Kyiv on Sunday, marking their first day in office with a strong message of support for Ukraine. Their visit comes as doubts are deepening over what Kyiv can expect from a new U.S. administration led by Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cFrom day one of the war, the E.U. has stood by the side of Ukraine,\u201d Costa posted on X, together with a photo of himself, Kallas and EU enlargement chief Marta Kos. \u201cFrom day one of our mandate, we are reaffirming our unwavering support to the Ukrainian people.\u201d",

      "In Russia, a child was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack in the Bryansk region bordering Ukraine, according to regional Gov. Alexander Bogomaz.",

      "Former \u201cHarry Potter\u201d film actor Rupert Grint faces a $2.3 million bill after he lost a legal battle with the tax authorities.",
      "Grint, who played Ron Weasley in the magical film franchise, was ordered to pay the money in 2019 after H.M. Revenue and Customs, the U.K. tax agency, investigated his tax return from seven years earlier.",
      "The agency said Grint had wrongly classed $5.7 million in residuals from the movies \u2014 money from DVD sales, TV syndication, streaming rights and other sources \u2014 as a capital asset rather than income, which is subject to a much higher tax rate.",
      "Lawyers for Grint appealed, but after years of wrangling a tribunal judge ruled against the actor this week. Judge Harriet Morgan said the money \u201cderived substantially the whole of its value from the activities of Mr. Grint\u201d and \u201cis taxable as income.\u201d",
      "Grint, 36, starred in all eight Harry Potter films between 2001 and 2011 as the boy wizard\u2019s best friend, and is calculated to have earned around $30 million from the role.",
      "He previously lost a separate court battle over a $1.2 million tax refund in 2019."
