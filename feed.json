      "Authorities have released body camera footage from outside the home of Gene Hackman, where the actor and his wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead in late February",
      "ALBUQUERQE, N.M. -- Authorities have released body camera footage from outside the home of Gene Hackman, where the actor and wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead in late February.",
      "The redacted footage shows deputies talking with the two workers who called authorities to report seeing someone lying on the floor inside the home. With no signs of forced entry or other evidence of suspicious circumstances, the deputies asked about the possibility of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning, and the workers said they didn\u2019t see how that could have been the case.",
      "\u201cSomething\u2019s not right,\u201d one of the workers said.",
      "Authorities soon determined there were no leaks that could have been fatal, further fueling a mystery that captured the public\u2019s attention.",
      "It was solved about a week later when medical investigators confirmed that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer\u2019s about a week after hantavirus pulmonary syndrome \u2014 a rare, rodent-borne disease \u2014 took the life of his wife.",
      "The Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office released only some of the footage from the investigation.",
      "A New Mexico court last week granted a temporary restraining order against the release of any photographs and video showing Hackman and his wife the inside of their home. Hackman\u2019s estate had filed the petition to withhold images, citing the need to protect the family\u2019s constitutional right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment.",
      "Workers who had maintained the property talked to investigators about respecting Hackman and Arawaka\u2019s privacy. One worker described Arawaka as a private person.",
      "The body camera footage also shows brief sightings of one of the couple\u2019s dogs running in the wooded hills on their property on the edge of Santa Fe. A man who identified himself to officers as a dog trainer who cared for the couple\u2019s pet dogs said the couple were \u201cnuts\u201d about their dogs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s toys everywhere around the property,\u201d he said.",
      "In a separate video, Arakawa\u2019s hairdresser told investigators that his client took the dogs with her everywhere and that the smallest one would often hang out inside the salon with them during her visits.",
      "That dog was found inside a crate, not far from Arakawa\u2019s body. A report obtained by The Associated Press from the state Department of Agriculture\u2019s veterinary lab states the dog likely died from dehydration and starvation.",
      "The actor\u2019s daughter, Elizabeth Hackman, told authorities she wanted the dog that died to be cremated. Authorities put her in touch with the local animal shelter to talk about the options.",

    "story": [
      "With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, G\u00e9rard Depardieu reigned over cinema for half a century",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 G\u00e9rard Depardieu once seemed larger than France itself. With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, he reigned over cinema for half a century \u2014 a national icon as familiar as the baguette.",
      "But this week, the actor who starred in more than 230 films \u2014 and who inspired writer John Updike to lament, \u201cI think that I shall never view a French film without Depardieu\u201d \u2014 sat slumped on a special orthopedic stool in a Paris courtroom.",
      "He faces two counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000).",
      "But more than Depardieu is on trial.",
      "For many in France, this case marks the country\u2019s ultimate litmus test \u2014 a question not just of guilt or innocence, but of readiness. Can a nation famed for its culture of seduction \u2014 and long criticized for shielding its male artists \u2014 finally hold one of them accountable?",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping two women \u2014 a set dresser and an assistant \u2014 during the 2021 filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\"The Green Shutters\"). According to complaints and witness statements, he trapped one woman with his legs, grabbed her breasts and waist, and shouted: \u201cI can\u2019t even get it up because of this heat!\u201d before crudely inviting her to touch his \u201cbig parasol.\u201d",
      "He denies all allegations. \u201cNever, but never, have I abused a woman,\u201d he wrote in Le Figaro. \u201cI have only ever been guilty of being too loving, too generous, or having a temperament that is too strong.\u201d",
      "But this is the first time one of the more than 20 accusations against him has reached court.",
      "Once a symbol of France\u2019s creative power, Depardieu\u2019s career now shadows the nation\u2019s delayed reckoning with #MeToo. The courtroom has become the stage for something deeper: a country finally confronting the myths it has long told itself about art, power, and male genius.",
      "Born in 1948 to a working-class family in Ch\u00e2teauroux, Depardieu\u2019s rise was the stuff of legend. A stuttering teen with no formal education, he drifted into acting and exploded onto the French stage with \u201cLes Valseuses\u201d (\"Going Places\"), a 1974 film so provocative it remains banned in some countries.",
      "From there came a blur of hits: \u201cJean de Florette,\u201d \u201cCyrano de Bergerac,\u201d \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Last Metro,\u201d and \u201cDanton.\u201d He won a Golden Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the adoration of millions. He played Columbus, Jean Valjean, and even Ob\u00e9lix in the \u201cAsterix\u201d films. He was prolific, omnipresent \u2014 messy, magnetic, and untouchable.",
      "But the excess was real off-screen too. He crashed his motorcycle while drunk, accepted a Russian passport from Vladimir Putin during a tax dispute, and once urinated in a plane aisle. He boasted of his appetites. France seemed to cheer them on.",
      "That myth \u2014 of the lovable brute \u2014 is now unraveling.",
      "In Hollywood, #MeToo toppled titans. In France, the movement was met with a wary eye. When #BalanceTonPorc (\u201cExpose Your Pig\u201d) emerged in 2017, it rattled the country\u2019s self-image \u2014 particularly in the arts, where seduction and transgression had long been celebrated.",
      "Some warned that #MeToo was killing romance. In 2018, screen legend Catherine Deneuve and 99 other prominent French women published an open letter in Le Monde, scolding the movement for going, in their words, \u201ctoo far.\u201d They championed la libert\u00e9 d\u2019importuner \u2014 \u201cthe freedom to bother\u201d \u2014 as a pillar of French life, defending the right of men to pursue women without fear of consequence. To many, it sounded less like a defense of flirtation than a permission slip for harassment, cloaked in perfume and nostalgia.",
      "Even President Emmanuel Macron echoed the sentiment. In Dec. 2023 \u2014 shortly after a documentary aired footage of Depardieu making sexually suggestive comments about a young girl in North Korea \u2014 Macron defended the actor on national television, condemning the backlash as a \u201cmanhunt.\u201d \u201cG\u00e9rard Depardieu makes France proud,\u201d he said.",
      "The remark sparked national outrage \u2014 not just for its timing, but for what it revealed: the instinct to protect cultural giants, no matter the cost.",
      "France\u2019s reluctance to confront sexual misconduct among its stars has long set it apart.",
      "Roman Polanski, convicted of statutory rape in the U.S. and accused by several other women, continues to work and live freely in France. In 2020, his C\u00e9sar Award win prompted walkouts \u2014 but also a standing ovation. There was little institutional pushback.",
      "In 2022, Johnny Depp was dropped from Disney's \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d franchise after domestic abuse allegations by ex-wife Amber Heard ( he was largely vindicated ).",
      "Yet, in France, he was embraced.",
      "In 2023, he played Louis XV in \u201cJeanne du Barry\u201d, the opening film at the French Cannes Film Festival. French fashion house Dior not only kept him on as the face of its Sauvage fragrance \u2014 it reportedly signed him to a multiyear, seven-figure deal in 2022.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s trial isn\u2019t the only case shaking French cinema. In recent months, a string of high-profile convictions have suggested that the shield of fame may finally be cracking.",
      "In February, director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually abusing actress Adele Haenel when she was a child.",
      "Actor-director Nicolas Bedos was sentenced in 2024 for sexual assault.",
      "The same year, actor-director Judith Godr\u00e8che testified before a parliamentary commission, accusing two renowned directors of exploiting her as a teenager. \u201cThis is not about desire,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s about power. About silence. About a system that protects itself.\u201d",
      "That same commission has since summoned major actors \u2014 including Jean Dujardin of \u201cThe Artist\u201d fame. Some reportedly asked to testify behind closed doors.",
      "Anouk Grinberg, who appeared in \u201cLes Volets Verts,\u201d has publicly supported the two women accusing Depardieu. \u201cWhat I saw on set was not seduction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was shameful.\u201d",
      "The case has become a national mirror \u2014 reflecting everything France has tolerated, denied, and excused.",
      "On the Parisian sidewalks, opinions still diverge. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our culture of flirtation,\u201d said Alain Morel, 62, sipping an espresso at a caf\u00e9 near the Arc de Triomphe. \u201cFlirting isn\u2019t a crime \u2014 it\u2019s part of who we are.\u201d",
      "But across the street, 28-year-old student Yasmine Bensalem shook her head. \u201cWe called it charm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was always about power.\u201d",
      "The trial continues. Depardieu, who has diabetes and heart disease, attends with medical accommodations. His lawyer claims the case is a political vendetta \u2014 a plot to \u201cmake Depardieu fall.\u201d",
      "But whether he is convicted or not, the deeper judgment is already underway.",
      "For decades, France\u2019s artists were seen as untouchable \u2014 their genius a shield. That shield is cracking. The myth is dying. And in its place, a question rises:",
      "Can France finally hold its most powerful men to account?",
      "This is not just the trial of Depardieu. This is the trial of a country \u2014 and whether its unfinished revolution will finish at last.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- June Carter, Kenny Chesney and Tony Brown have been invited to join the Country Music Hall of Fame.",
      "The Country Music Association announced the new 2025 inductees on Tuesday in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Carter, the Grammy-winning member of one of country music\u2019s pioneering families and the wife of country giant Johnny Cash, joins as this year's veteran era artist. Chesney, who has won the CMA Awards entertainer of the year four times, joins as the modern era artist. And Brown, a Nashville producer who has supervised a wide array of best-selling hits by Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, George Strait and many others, will join the non-performer category.",
      "The three will be formally inducted during a ceremony in the fall.",
      "Tuesday's celebratory ceremony focused on their contributions to country music over the decades, highlighting their influence, even when they were overlooked at times.",
      "\u201cJohnny once said that his wife was one of the most neglected artists in country music,\u201d said country singer Vince Gill, who introduced the inductees. He said Cash worried that his wife's contributions would \u201cunder-recognized simply because she's my wife.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat changes as she takes her rightful place among family, friends and legends in the Country Music Hall of Fame,\u201d Gill said.",
      "Some of Carter's accomplishments include writing more than 100 songs, including co-writing \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a top hit for Cash. The two married in 1968 and recorded several Grammy-award winning hits like \u201cJackson\u201d and \u201cIf I Were a Carpenter.\u201d",
      "But Carter had been singing since she was 10, long before marrying Cash. Her mother, Maybelle Carter, was in the Carter Family music act with her cousin Sara Carter and Sara\u2019s husband, A.P. Carter. The family act broke up, but mother and daughters June, Helen and Anita continued on as Mother Maybelle & the Carter Sisters, with little June playing autoharp.",
      "The Carters went on to become staples of the Grand Ole Opry country music show in Nashville.",
      "Carlene Carter described her mother as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who was \u201canchored in love.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnything that\u2019s good about me is because of that mom,\u201d said Carlene Carter, who continued in the family business as a country singer and songwriter.",
      "Chesney, who grew up in eastern Tennessee, told the crowd on Tuesday that if someone had said he would one day be inducted into the same Hall of Fame class as June Carter Cash, he would have called it \u201cunbelievable.\u201d",
      "Chesney's career includes 16 platinum albums and more than 50 Top Ten country hits. After receiving a standing ovation, he said he was just hoping to spread love and positivity through his music.",
      "\u201dI had a really big dream and I\u2019m still pushing that dream as far as I can,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cI just wanted to record and write songs that reflected the lives of a lot of people that came to our shows.\"",
      "For Brown, getting the call about his induction into the Hall of Fame almost knocked him over. He called it one of the biggest accomplishments of his career.",
      "Every year, the Country Music Hall of Fame chooses just three inductees, one of which rotates between songwriters, recording/touring musicians and non-performers.",
      "Brown backed Elvis Presley until his death in 1977, then played with Emmylou Harris & The Hot Band, as well as Rodney Crowell & The Cherry Bombs. But he's being honored more for his production work, as president of MCA Nashville, with RCA Records and eventually as co-founder of Universal South Records.",
      "\u201cYou make records and you make some money, but this is better than money,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis is about making an impact.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "With a budget above $250 million, \u201cSnow White\u201d had set out with higher ambitions, particularly since it returns Disney to its very origins. The 1937 original \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was the company\u2019s first animated feature, and paid for its Burbank studio lot.",
      "But this \u201cSnow White\u201d struggled to find anything like a fairy tale ending. The runup to release was plagued by controversies over the film\u2019s handling of the dwarfs, who are rendered in CGI, and backlashes over comments by its star, Rachel Zegler. The PR headaches prompted Disney to pull back on its premiere.",
      "Also working against the film, directed by Marc Webb: poor reviews. Critics were largely not impressed with Disney\u2019s latest live-action remake, with reviews coming in just 43% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "There\u2019s been a wide variance between the box-office performance of other \u201clive-action\u201d Disney remakes, but \u201cSnow White\u201d might mark a new nadir. Jon Favreau\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d (2019) didn\u2019t have great reviews, either, but grossed more than $1.6 billion worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d opened worse than \u201cDumbo\u201d (a $46 million opening in 2019) and well shy of \u201cCinderella\u201d territory ($67.9 million in 2015).",
      "Overseas, \u201cSnow White\u201d added $44.3 million for a global launch of $87.3 million. But going into the weekend, \u201cSnow White\u201d had been eyeing a worldwide total closer to $100 million \u2013 and a few weeks back, expectations were significantly higher.",
      "The result will surely add to questions over Disney\u2019s long-term strategy of mining its vault for live-action remakes. In the pipeline are upcoming new versions of \u201cMoana\" and \u201cTangled.\" A live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d launches in May.",
      "Efforts to modernize \u201cSnow White,\" though, quickly ran afoul. In 2022, actor Peter Dinklage criticized the remake plans as \u201cbackward.\u201d Disney ultimately opted to drop \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d from the original's title, and animate the dwarfs. Some right-wing commentators targeted \u201cSnow White\u201d and Zegler's casting as an overly \u201cwoke\u201d production. Delays and reshoots also ran up costs.",
      "Disney, though, has recently steered a handful of films from modest starts to enviable final hauls. The Barry Jenkins-directed \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d opened with $35.4 million domestically, but ultimately surpassed $717 million worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d will face little direct competition in the coming weeks. Audiences gave it a \u201cB+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cAlto Knights,\u201d a period gangster film starring Robert De Niro in both lead roles, was a total misfire. The Barry Levinson-directed film, which cost about $45 million to make, opened with just $3.2 million from 2,651 theaters. The flop of \u201cAlto Knights\u201d followed another misfire for Warner Bros. with Bong Joon Ho\u2019s big-budget sci-fi \u201cMickey 17.\u201d In three weeks, it\u2019s tallied $40.2 million domestically against a $118 million budget.",

Majors avoided jail time but was given a year of probation.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles County district attorney said Friday that his office will not file sexual assault charges against movie producer David Guillod, more than four years after his arrest.",
      "District Attorney Nathan Hochman said in a statement that there was insufficient evidence to prove a case against Guillod beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "The announcement came nearly three years after a judge rejected similar charges against Guillod in Santa Barbara County.",
      "An email seeking comment from an attorney who has represented Guillod was not immediately answered. Guillod has denied all of the allegations.",
      "Guillod, a talent manager and producer whose credits include 2017's \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d and 2020's \u201cExtraction,\u201d was originally arrested in 2020 and charged with rape and sexual assault involving six women between 2014 and 2020 in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties. Authorities chose to try the cases jointly in Santa Barbara County, where a judge at a 2022 preliminary hearing found that there was insufficient evidence for Guillod to go to trial on charges involving four of the women.",
      "The judge found there was enough evidence to go forward with charges that he had assaulted an actor in 2012 and a waitress in 2018, but because those were both in LA County, Santa Barbara prosecutors no longer had jurisdiction and sent the cases to the Los Angeles District Attorney.",
      "\u201cThe allegations involve deeply troubling and concerning behavior, and we empathize with the pain and trauma the accusers have experienced throughout this long investigative process,\u201d Hochman's statement said.",
      "Hochman's office also recently declined to file charges against Marilyn Manson after another yearslong investigation.",
      "Guillod had been among the people investigated by a task force formed by former District Attorney Jackie Lacey in 2017 to investigate sexual misconduct in Hollywood when the #MeToo movement gained national attention. The vast majority of cases they considered did not lead to charges.",
      "An exception was movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who was convicted of rape and sexual assault in Los Angeles in 2022. He is appealing the convictions.",

      "On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O\u2019Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note",
      "WASHINGTON -- On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O\u2019Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O\u2019Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January, about three weeks before President Donald Trump upended the Kennedy Center by ousting longtime president Deborah Rutter and board chairman David Rubenstein. Trump dismissed the board of trustees and replaced them with loyalists, who then elected him as chairman.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 and also Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \u201cworried about what the future might bring.\u201d",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\u201cTwain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cTwain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\u201d",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin in the Free World.\u201d",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cI think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\u201d comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\u201d",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \u201cthe Roy Cohn Pavilion\u201d after one of Trump\u2019s mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted on social media that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\u201d",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has never been particularly political. The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times. In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O\u2019Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O\u2019Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O\u2019Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows. He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Must Go,\u201d drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \u201cHamilton\u201d and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Leftist comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \u201cAll You Fascists Bound to Lose.\u201d",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",
      "The ceremony will be streamed on Netflix on May 4.",

      "NEW YORK -- The new Paramount+ series \u201cHappy Face\u201d has all the elements of a gripping true-crime yarn: A serial killer, his estranged daughter, a race to get an innocent man off death row. But perhaps the most intriguing part? How it examines the warping nature of true crime itself.",
      "\u201cI was less interested in the specific psychology of a serial killer or glorifying the murders or seeing violence against women on screen,\" says Jennifer Cacicio, executive producer and showrunner. \"I just feel like we\u2019ve seen that. I was very interested in making a true-crime show told through a different lens.\u201d",
      "\u201cHappy Face,\u201d which begins airing Thursday, is inspired by the true story of Melissa Moore, whose father was a prolific serial killer infamous for drawing smiley faces on letters to the media and prosecutors. She was just 15 when he was captured.",
      "Decades later, as an adult with her own children, she finds herself drawn back into his orbit as she sets out to save an innocent man for a crime her father committed. She also has to tell her daughter the truth about her grandfather.",
      "Starring Annaleigh Ashford and Dennis Quaid, \u201cHappy Face\u201d is told from a female point of view and looks at how a shameful secret can echo through generations. It's also about the push and pull of infamy, with horrendous crimes somehow remaining an alluring draw.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of crime dramas out there that I think are very male-centric. It\u2019s either about the cops are the cool guys or the criminals are the cool guys, and it\u2019s all about kicking in doors. I\u2019ve written on those shows and they\u2019re fun and they serve a purpose. And I think that I really wanted to try something different,\u201d Cacicio says.",
      "\u201cWhat is it like for the rest of the family when there\u2019s this shameful secret and this series of crimes and these acts of violence and what are the ripple effects on everybody involved?\u201d",
      "Ashford, who earned a Tony Award nomination playing a serial killer on Broadway in \u201cSweeney Todd,\u201d plays Moore with tenderness and anger, saying she was interested in exploring generational trauma.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst nightmares,\u201d she says. \u201cThe worst nightmare of all is having a family member be a victim. And then the second worst nightmare is having a family member be the perpetrator. So what would you do if you\u2019re a parent or your sibling or your spouse or your child committed an atrocity?\u201d",
      "Moore previously shared her story in the bestselling memoir, \u201cShattered Silence\u201d and the 2018 \"Happy Face\" podcast, reaching out to her father's victims and advocating for other family members of killers. Cacicio was one of a number of writers interested in telling her story for TV.",
      "Cacicio approached Moore with this pitch: \u201cIf you want someone who\u2019s a straight-up journalist, who\u2019s just going to tell exactly the story of the podcast, you should let someone else do it,\u201d she told her. \u201cThere\u2019s also an opportunity for it to be a bigger story that\u2019s asking some questions about true crime.\u201d",
      "Cacicio and Moore, it turned out had plenty in common. They were the same age, and both the oldest of three kids. Both had close relationships with their fathers, who hid other lives \u2014 Moore's was a killer and Cacicio served time in prison for drug dealing.",
      "\u201cObviously, the crimes are different, the circumstances are different. But I think, in my family, it was something we didn\u2019t talk about and it was something I didn\u2019t want my friends to know,\u201d says Cacicio.",
      "\u201cA lot of it was really personal to me. And I think that\u2019s what made her trust me \u2014 that I really understood the feelings, even if I didn\u2019t necessarily understand the specific circumstances.\u201d",
      "Quaid plays Moore's father, but unlike other roles he's taken that involve a living person, he had no intention of meeting the prisoner. He didn't want to glorify the killer but also \u201cHappy Face\u201d isn't that kind of show.",
      "\u201cThis is told from Melissa\u2019s point of view, and I think it\u2019s actually truer than his point of view, because I think she knows him much better than he knows himself,\u201d he says. \u201cI think he shows emotions like a little boy who\u2019s trying to talk himself out of a whipping.\u201d",
      "Cacicio says it's time we took a look at the explosion in popularity of true crime, in which women are often the victims but women are also the chief consumers.",
      "\u201cAre we obsessed with these stories because we\u2019re trying to protect ourselves in case the worst happens?\u201d she asks. \u201cI read somewhere that it\u2019s an act of normalizing your own experiences, because usually it\u2019s whatever you\u2019re watching is worse than what\u2019s happened to you. So it kind of like makes you feel better about your own traumas.\u201d",

      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \u201cdisappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \u201c'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\u201d",
      "They said there was an \u201coverwhelming likelihood\u201d Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs, and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \u201cmade no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\u201d",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row \u2014 measuring the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",

      "\u201cSomehow, here we are,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends throughout the years. Our kids have all grown up together and our kids have kind of kept us in contact even at times when we might have dropped off the radar for each other.\u201d",

Good intentions, like swirling bluebirds, flutter through this \u201cSnow White\u201d: to give its singing protagonist ( Rachel Zegler ) more agency; to expand that notion of \u201cfair\u201d beyond skin tone; to reframe that problematic prince. But all that updating adds up to a mishmash of a fable, caught in between now and once upon a time.",
      "It wouldn\u2019t be an earthshattering observation to note that a 1930s cartoon, let alone a 19th century German folk tale, might not be entirely in line with contemporary culture. Most of these Disney live-action remakes have carried with them more than a few notes of correction and atonement for the past \u2014 a laudable goal that means a generation of kids might not need a brief history lesson to go along with an old classic.",
      "But it\u2019s a tricky thing reworking a fable that\u2019s been around two centuries, and that\u2019s doubly true when leaping from the two-dimensional fantasy realm of animation to the more complicated land of flesh and bone. Webb\u2019s \u201cSnow White\u201d has been a veritable case study for the headaches that can arise when a window into the real world is cracked open. Everything from Israel's war in Gaza (Zegler and her co-star Gal Gadot, who plays the wicked stepmother, have differing opinions), the humanity of little people (there\u2019s a reason \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d has been stripped from the title) and the alleged \u201cwoke\u201d-ness of the production have been fuel for what we can gently refer to as online debate.",
      "Despite some gloriously lush production design, \u201cSnow White\u201d \u2014 innocent of most of those backlashes though not all \u2014 can\u2019t quite thread the needle. Even the new songs (by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul) that are good (\"Waiting on a Wish\") struggle to fit in alongside old standbys. Zegler does a spirited job remaking a classic Disney princess into a more modern woman; when she sings, the movie gets a lift. The last thing that's wrong with this \u201cSnow White\u201d is Zegler's casting.",
      "But like scaffolding that's been left up too long, the strain of renovation shows in Webb\u2019s film, particularly in its awkward handling of Dopey, Sneezy and company. The seven dwarfs, like the fawns and squirrels, are rendered in CGI. You could argue that this acknowledges the artificiality of a dated and offensive trope. But it also gives \u201cSnow White\u201d an uncanny quality, with all human characters but the dwarfs being played by real people. As if to Band-Aid over this, one of the woodsmen is played by an actor of short stature (George Appleby) whose presence seems like yet another atonement, only one for this \u201cSnow White,\u201d not 1937\u2019s.",
      "You might be thinking: But what about the movie? The problem with \u201cSnow White\u201d is that you never stop thinking about these much-strategized and sometimes superficial efforts to recontextualize the original movie. Erin Cressida Wilson's screenplay remakes Snow White's story as less a princess awaiting her Prince Charming (the song \u201cSomeday My Prince Will Come\" has been jettisoned) than an heir to a throne who loses her gumption. Though taught as a child to be \u201cfair\u201d as a leader by her father king (Hadley Fraser), Snow White has lost any ambition by the time Gadot's Evil Queen takes over the kingdom.",
      "Gadot sinks her teeth into the Evil Queen, a spikey, slinky villain who moves with a metallic rustle (the costumes are by Sandy Powell). But she feels cut off from the movie, without the lines that would elevate her flamboyant performance into something memorable. The prince has been altogether scrubbed; instead Andrew Burnap plays the blandly cocksure bandit Jonathan who encourages Snow White not to wait for her father's rescue.",
      "Presumably one of the reasons to bring actors into remakes of animated classics would be to add a warm-blooded pulse to these characters. Zegler manages that, but everyone else in \u201cSnow White\u201d \u2014 mortal or CGI \u2014 is as stiff as could be. You're left glumly scorekeeping the updates \u2014 one win here, a loss there \u2014 while pondering why, regardless of the final tally, recapturing the magic of long ago is so elusive.",
      "\u201cSnow White,\u201d a Walt Disney Co. release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for violence, some peril, thematic elements and brief rude humor. Running time: 109 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "\u201cA Thelma & Louise for our times,\u201d is how bestselling thriller writer Paula Hawkins describes the debut novel, \u201cKiller Potential,\u201d from Hannah Deitch",
      "When bestselling psychological thriller writer Paula Hawkins (\u201cThe Girl on the Train,\u201d 2015) stamps the cover of your debut novel with \u201cA Thelma & Louise for our times,\u201d your career is off to a fast start.",
      "The same goes for the plot pace of Hannah Deitch\u2019s book, \u201cKiller Potential,\u201d which opens at a breakneck clip and doesn\u2019t really slow down for about 200 pages. Evie Gordon is our narrator. She went to \u201ca liberal arts school, stupidly expensive,\u201d and is now working as an SAT tutor in pricey California zip codes. Her first sentence is a gem: \u201cI was once a famous murderess.\u201d The rest of the book reveals how she earned that appellation and the adverb \u201conce.\u201d",
      "The opening scene is at \u201cThe Victor House,\u201d which Evie describes in great detail \u2014 its \u201clive-edge table cut from Portuguese wood,\u201d the \u201cDe Gournay hand-painted silk wallpaper,\u201d and the \u201caquamarine Moroccan tile in the bathroom.\u201d It\u2019s where Evie discovers the dead bodies of Dinah and Peter Victor, the mother with her face bashed in and the father floating in a koi pond. As Evie flees, she hears a voice crying out for help and rescues a woman trapped behind a door under a staircase, before coming face-to-face with her tutoring student, Serena. Thinking Evie and her accomplice are killers fleeing the scene of their crime, Serena attacks with a lamp and the scene ends with Evie smashing a vase against Serena\u2019s head before escaping with the mystery woman in Evie\u2019s car.",
      "Cue the Hans Zimmer soundtrack for the next 100+ pages as Evie gets to know her partner in crime, who doesn\u2019t speak at first, traumatized by whatever happened to her in the house. Eventually we learn her name, Jae, and together they pull off a series of crimes, some petty (shoplifting, carjacking), some not (assaulting and shooting at a few men and boys who recognize them from TV). Throughout it all, Evie\u2019s inner monologue keeps readers engaged as she ponders things like how the language of courtship (Chase. Pursue. Stalk.) mirrors the language of hunting. It\u2019s clear after a while that Evie and Jae lust for one another and when that dam finally breaks, the novel takes on a torrid tone that feels authentic for two people on the run for weeks relying on only each other and their animal instincts to survive.",
      "Of course, Paula Hawkins doesn\u2019t blurb your book unless there\u2019s a well-earned twist, and \u201cKiller Potential\u201d delivers on that front. The final third or so of the novel is a real joy to read as Deitch fills in all the blanks using different narrative techniques. Saying anything more would spoil the fun, but \u201cKiller Potential\u201d earns Deitch a spot on the \u201cnew novelists to watch\u201d list.",

    "story": [
      "Jonathan Majors plays an amateur bodybuilder in the dark drama \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s rage simmering inside Killian Maddox, the amateur bodybuilder portrayed by Jonathan Majors at the heart of the dark and stylized film \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a kind of \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d for the incel age, a harrowing portrait of untreated mental illness, violence, false idols, steroids and male loneliness. There was, from the beginning, lots to discuss and debate in the fabric of \u201cMagazine Dreams.\u201d But in the two years since it debuted at the Sundance Film Festival, it was also eclipsed by the very real-life travails of its star, who was convicted of assaulting his former girlfriend.",
      "In January 2023, \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d had an exciting future with Oscar hopes for Majors. Searchlight Pictures won the distribution rights, reportedly over the likes of Neon and Sony Pictures Classics. And Majors was skyrocketing to the top, with big roles in \u201cCreed III\u201d and as Marvel\u2019s new main villain, Kang. But two months later, he was arrested. By that December, Majors was found guilty of one misdemeanor assault charge and one harassment violation and fired by Marvel. A month later, \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d was without distribution. Majors has, throughout it all, maintained his innocence.",
      "The film was eventually picked up by Briarcliff Entertainment, the same distributor who jumped in to release the young Donald Trump movie \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d after the rest of the entertainment business shied away from it. \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d went on to get Oscar nominations for its two stars.",
      "But there\u2019s a different kind of stigma around \u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d which is why this review has also been a bit eclipsed by what's happened in Majors' life. It\u2019s a film about a man teetering on the edge of violence, about the relentless pursuit of greatness \u2014 and it is deeply uncomfortable watching his descent.",
      "His simplistic devotion to one wild goal may be his undoing in a world that just doesn\u2019t care about him. This is not the movie that any public relations professional would choose as a \u201ccomeback role.\u201d Yet it\u2019s impossible to deny the monumental ferocity of Majors\u2019 performance, from his full transformation to his unsettling ability to show the pain behind (most of) the psychotic actions.",
      "Killian\u2019s life is nothing glamorous: He works in a grocery store and at home cares for his aging grandfather. But he has an intense, maniacal need to be seen and to be remembered. And the only way he\u2019s figured out how to achieve that is through physical perfection \u2014 or at least his very narrow idea. Success is a magazine cover, which he naively conflates with immortality.",
      "When co-worker Jessie (Haley Bennett, who does a lot with a small, somewhat thankless role) agrees to go out on a date with him, he is genuinely shocked that she isn\u2019t familiar with his bodybuilding idol, saying something to the effect of \u201cyou need to get out more.\u201d",
      "Writer-director Elijah Bynum effectively imbues his film with stylized intensity. You feel uneasy and captivated from the start, though you try to give Killian the benefit of the doubt \u2014 to look for his goodness, to root for his success, if only for the hope that it might keep him docile for a little longer. Though we\u2019re told early that he\u2019s had violent episodes, through his court-ordered therapist, the glass isn\u2019t fully shattered until Jessie starts to process that Killian is someone she needs to get away from, fast. This is notably after he orders perhaps $500 worth of protein on the date, just for himself. Sadly, we don\u2019t get to see the bill.",
      "While \u201cMagazine Dreams\u201d is an interesting character study, one many actors would love to play for all its dramatic opportunities, it also seems crafted entirely to provoke and shock \u2014 especially in the almost unbearably bleak final hour. After two viewings, one of which I had to take a break from during one of his violent outbursts, I\u2019m not actually sure what it\u2019s trying to say about men, about trauma, about 'roid rage. Killian seems less like an authentic person and more a simplistic stand-in for the forgotten person, the quiet weirdo who ends up a mass killer.",
      "And yet as movies are being accused of being too straightforward, too moralistic, too simple, perhaps some ambiguity, some discomfort, some unresolved unpleasantness is overdue. Majors is a force, and Bynum is certainly a director to watch. The question with \u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d which was the same in January 2023 as it is in March 2025 is: Will anyone?",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d a Briarcliff Entertainment release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cviolent content, drug use, sexual material, nudity and language.\u201d Running time: 104 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "As CBS' parent company considers settlement of President Donald Trump's lawsuit against \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America\u2019s storied newsmagazine is pulling no punches in its coverage of the new administration",
      "NEW YORK -- As CBS corporate leaders ponder settling President Donald Trump's $20 billion lawsuit against the network's \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d America's storied newsmagazine has produced some fast and hard-hitting stories critical of the new administration in every episode since Trump was inaugurated.",
      "The latest was Sunday, when CBS News helped pay for a performance featuring non-white middle and high school musicians who had won a contest and with it, the right to play with the U.S. Marine Corps Band. The original concert, however, was canceled because of Trump's executive order ending diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "Correspondent Scott Pelley narrated six of the show's seven stories since Trump's inauguration, including Sunday's. He examined the administration\u2019s policies toward Ukraine and tariffs, looked at changes in the Justice Department and reported on firings of government watchdogs. Shortly after his piece on the dismantling of USAID, Elon Musk suggested \u201clong prison sentences\u201d for those working on the show.",
      "All came at a time when television's most popular and influential news broadcast was being watched to see how it would respond to a unique pressure.",
      "\u201cThis may be a lawsuit that is designed to intimidate, but they are clearly making a statement that they will not be intimidated,\u201d said Tom Bettag, a longtime television news producer who worked under Mike Wallace and Morley Safer at the CBS show.",
      "Pelley, meanwhile, has quickly become a polarizing figure.",
      "\u201cAnother week, another \u201860 Minutes\u2019 story trying to discredit Trump policies,\u201d Brent Baker, editor of the conservative media watchdog NewsBusters, wrote on X on Sunday night.",
      "Trump's lawsuit, coupled with a parallel Federal Communications Commission investigation, accuses \u201c60 Minutes\u201d of election interference for the way it edited Bill Whitaker's interview last fall with Trump's 2024 opponent, Kamala Harris.",
      "Two sound bites, broadcast on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and CBS' \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d depicted Harris giving different responses to Whitaker in a discussion about Israel. CBS said Harris made both comments in her answer to Whitaker and that the two shows ended up using different parts of a long sound bite. CBS argued the apparent discrepancy was typical of editing and not, as Trump has suggested, that different remarks by Harris were used to make her look better.",
      "CBS parent Paramount Global filed new motions in the past two weeks to get both the lawsuit and the FCC probe dismissed. Still, Shari Redstone, head of Paramount, is reportedly anxious for a settlement, much like Disney agreed to pay $16 million in December to end Trump's lawsuit against ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. Complicating matters is Paramount's proposed merger with Skydance Media, which needs approval from the Trump administration.",
      "Many at CBS News resist a settlement, insisting \u201c60 Minutes\u201d did nothing wrong. The show's executive producer, Bill Owens, told his staff last month that he would not apologize as part of any prospective settlement.",
      "\u201cMy precious \u201860 Minutes\u2019 is fighting, quite frankly, for our life,\u201d correspondent Lesley Stahl said earlier this month in accepting a First Amendment award from the Radio Television Digital News Association. \u201cI am so proud of \u201860 Minutes\u2019 that we are standing up and fighting for what is right.\u201d",
      "Neither Owens nor Pelley would comment on whether the show is trying to deliver any sort of message about the lawsuit through its work. Bettag said he believed \u201c60 Minutes\u201d is motivated by the importance of the stories.",
      "What the show has done during the past two months is striking, said Bettag, now a journalism professor at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cThe \u201860 Minutes\u2019 people are such committed journalists that they\u2019d consider it foolish to be doing these stories because of what is a frivolous lawsuit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lawsuit pales in comparison with the monumental changes Trump is trying to implement. Those correspondents and producers know that this is a moment that requires their very best work.\"",
      "Some of the segments were unusually urgent for the newsmagazine, which tends to do longer-range stories that could take months to produce. Pelley's March 2 report about Ukraine came only days after the White House confrontation between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Musk's angry comment on his X social media platform came after Pelley's Feb. 16 story about the billionaire's role in the quick shutdown of the USAID office. \u201cThe world's richest man had cut off assistance to the world's poorest families,\u201d Pelley said, noting that Musk collects \u201cbillions of taxpayer dollars\u201d for his SpaceX company.",
      "Hours later, Musk wrote on X: \u201c60 Minutes are the biggest liars in the world! They engaged in deliberate deception to interfere with the last election. They deserve a long prison sentence.\u201d",
      "Other news organizations have done admirable work under difficult circumstances, said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor. Besides Pelley, he cited the news staff of the Washington Post at a time the newspaper\u2019s owner, Jeff Bezos, has shown more friendliness to Trump.",
      "Sunday\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d story involved some elite high school students \u2014 each of them either of either Black, Hispanic, Indian or Asian descent \u2014 who had earned the right to play with the Marine band before the show was called off.",
      "CBS worked with Equity Arc, an organization devoted to increasing the number of minority students playing classical music, to organize a show for family and friends of the students outside Washington, D.C.. Retired members of military bands were brought in to work with the students. CBS News, which wanted to interview the students, paid for the travel and lodging of 22 of them.",

      "\u201cThe original Marine Band concert would have been seen by hundreds,\u201d he said. \u201cHere tonight, these musicians are being heard by millions.\u201d",
      "Pelley's March 9 report, \u201cFiring the Watchdogs,\u201d was about Trump's efforts to fire inspector generals and thwart others who protect whistleblowers in government agencies. He quoted Trump as saying the firings were standard for a new administration taking office. \u201cHe's wrong,\u201d Pelley said.",
      "His story about the U.S. Justice Department examined the resistance among some prosecutors to drop corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.",
      "\u201cAs he continues to step up his attacks on President Donald Trump and the new administration, Pelley is elbowing aside all others to emerge as Trump's loudest TV critic,\u201d wrote Paul Bedard of the Washington Examiner.",
      "In his stories, Pelley's deadpan voice and methodical style could not hide the sharpness of some observations. While narrating the story about USAID, Pelley noted that \u201cIt's too soon to tell how serious President Trump is in defiance of the Constitution.\"",

      "HOUSTON -- Dallas rapper Yella Beezy has been arrested and charged with capital murder in the shooting death of fellow rapper Mo3 on a busy interstate in 2020, according to court records.",
      "Yella Beezy, 33, whose real name is Markies Conway, was indicted by a Dallas County grand jury on Tuesday on a charge of capital murder while remuneration. The indictment accuses Conway of hiring a man named Kewon White to murder Mo3, whose real name was Melvin Noble.",
      "The indictment did not provide information on why authorities believe Conway hired White to shoot Noble, who also lived in Dallas.",
      "Court records did not list an attorney who could speak on behalf of Conway. Calls and emails to representatives for Conway were not immediately returned.",
      "In a Facebook post after Conway's arrest, Noble's mother, Nichole Williams Noble wrote, \u201cJustice for my baby!!!!\u201d",
      "The 28-year-old Noble was driving on Interstate 35 in south Dallas on Nov. 11, 2020, when authorities allege White drove up next to him and got out of his vehicle with a gun in his hand. Noble got out of his vehicle and began running south on the freeway as White shot at him, authorities said. Noble and a bystander who was inside a car were shot by White, police said. The bystander survived but Noble died at a hospital.",
      "White and another man, Devin Brown, 32, were later indicted in Noble\u2019s death. Their cases related to Noble\u2019s death remain pending. White, 26, was sentenced in 2022 in a separate case to nearly nine years in federal prison after pleading guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.",

      "\u201cListening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution\u201d will be released Sept. 9, according to Sentinel Books, a conservative imprint of Penguin Random House.",

The third justice appointed by President Donald Trump, Barrett solidified a conservative majority that has overturned abortion rights, broadened religious rights and ended affirmative action in college admissions. Barrett has also tried to promote a spirit of civil debate: She and Sotomayor, one of the court's liberals, made a handful of joint public appearances i n 2024.",

    "story": [
      "Robert De Niro's doing double duty in \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d literally",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re the actor!\u201d shouts Anna Genovese at her estranged spouse, gangster Vito Genovese, in a courtroom where he\u2019s implausibly claiming he lacks funds to support her. \u201cThe best actor in the world! Better than Clark Gable!\u201d",
      "And we all chuckle. They probably all chuckled on set, too. Because the man playing Vito in \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d is none other than Robert De Niro, indeed one of the best actors in the world, revered in our time as Gable was in his.",
      "It\u2019s a cute moment and an apt one, too, because Barry Levinson\u2019s film, which aims but fails to channel the magic of decades-old mob movies like \u201cGoodfellas\u201d \u2014 though penned by the same writer, Nicholas Pileggi \u2014 is all about De Niro. Actually, it\u2019s all about De Niro AND De Niro. The man plays both lead roles, feuding mobsters Genovese and Frank Costello, in a story based on real events.",
      "Is it a gimmick? Surely. Does it work? Well, there\u2019s the entertainment value \u2014 this is De Niro, after all \u2014 and if you feel that more De Niro minutes are always better, then it follows that two roles are better than one. Others may feel it has a mob-themed \u201cParent Trap\u201d vibe, less weighty than it should be given the obviously violent subject matter.",
      "Also, \u201cGoodfellas\u201d fans may wonder if the Vito role was once intended for Joe Pesci (the movie\u2019s been in development forever), so similar is the character to that actor\u2019s impulsive, manically suspicious persona. On the other hand, in two brief scenes where the De Niros appear together for momentous meetings, one might be forgiven for wondering if Al Pacino was in line at some point, for a \u201cHeat\u201d-like moment.",
      "Happily, De Niro relies here on makeup, and not de-aging as in \u201cThe Irishman,\u201d though it must be said that, at times, his two characters just don\u2019t look different enough. More importantly, \u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d despite its pedigree, doesn't rise anywhere near the heights of its glorious predecessors. It is, rather, an enjoyable if choppily paced look at a relationship between two men, where unfortunately we\u2019re arriving pretty late in the game.",
      "There are, though, a few crackling surprises: that domestic courtroom scene; a tense, televised Senate committee grilling; and finally a climactic gathering of mob bosses in the countryside, with fabulous period vehicles parked on the lawn and sausages on the grill, that's disrupted in comically sudden fashion.",
      "We begin in 1957 in Manhattan. Costello, after a night partying respectably with high society, stops at his swank apartment building. \u201cThis one\u2019s for you,\u201d declares the nervous man who shoots him in the head in his lobby.",
      "The shooter (Cosmo Jarvis), sent by Genovese, makes a bad mistake, as his boss will remind him later: \u201cYou gotta go SEE if they\u2019re dead!\u201d Amazingly, Costello survives. \u201cI shoulda been paying more attention,\u201d says the genteel mobster who favors diplomacy over bloodletting, narrating from the future.",
      "We then go back in time to figure out how things got this bad.",
      "With the help of vintage photos and footage artfully edited to include actors playing the younger Frank and Vito, we learn the two were good friends as young Italian immigrants on the streets. But when Vito got mixed up in a murder case, he had to flee to Italy \u2014 leaving cooler-headed Frank in charge of the business.",
      "Years later, Vito returns, and wants his role at the top of the mob family. And so things go south, quickly.",
      "The women in their lives mirror the differences between the two men. Costello\u2019s wife of more than 50 years, Bobbie (Debra Messing, making a nice foray into drama), is a loyal partner who urges her husband to retire and leave New York \u2014 along with their adorable dogs (De Niro\u2019s own pooches, dressed in mink coats and hats \u2014 a costume design Oscar for this canine fashion, please!). Genovese\u2019s wife Anna (Kathrine Narducci, excellent) is a businesswoman \u2014 she owns a gay bar \u2014 whose fiery union with Vito turns disastrous.",
      "A mere glance at Wikipedia will tell you that both Genovese and Costello ultimately died in nonviolent ways. There\u2019s plenty in \u201cThe Alto Knights\u201d that you won\u2019t see there \u2014 for example, the movie's version of just who engineered that farmland mob summit, and why.",
      "But watching dozens of mobsters run like heck when police happen upon their gathering is a hoot, and it\u2019s hard to beat the moment when two of them insist to suspicious cops: \u201cWe\u2019re hunters!\u201d",
      "If only such witty moments were more frequent in a two-hour movie that somehow, alas, feels much longer.",
      "\u201cThe Alto Knights,\u201d a Warner Bros. Pictures release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor violence and pervasive language.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "With massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight northern locations",
      "WASHINGTON -- With massive job cuts, the National Weather Service is eliminating or reducing vital weather balloon launches in eight northern locations, which meteorologists and former agency leaders said will degrade the accuracy of forecasts just as severe weather season kicks in.",
      "The normally twice-daily launches of weather balloons in about 100 locations provide information that forecasters and computer models use to figure out what the weather will be and how dangerous it can get, so cutting back is a mistake, said eight different scientists, meteorologists and former top officials at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \u2014 the weather service's parent agency.",
      "The balloons soar 100,000 feet in the air with sensors called radiosondes hanging about 20 feet below them that measure temperature, dew point, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction.",
      "\u201cThe thing about weather balloons is that they give you information you can't get any other way,\u201d said D. James Baker, a former NOAA chief during the Clinton administration. He had to cut spending in the agency during his tenure but he said he refused to cut observations such as weather balloons. \u201cIt's an absolutely essential piece of the forecasting system.\u201d",
      "University of Oklahoma environment professor Renee McPherson said, \u201cThis frankly is just dangerous.\u201d",
      "\u201cBad,\u201d Ryan Maue, who was NOAA's chief scientist at the end of President Donald Trump's first term, wrote in an email. \u201cWe should not degrade our weather system by skipping balloon launches. Not only is this embarrassing for NOAA, the cessation of weather balloon launches will worsen America's weather forecasts.\u201d",
      "Launches will be eliminated in Omaha, Nebraska, and Rapid City, South Dakota, \u201cdue to a lack of Weather Forecast Office (WFO) staffing,\u201d the weather service said in a notice issued late Thursday. It also is cutting from twice daily to once daily launches i n Aberdeen, South Dakota; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green Bay, Wisconsin; Gaylord, Michigan; North Platte, Nebraska and Riverton, Wyoming.",
      "The Trump administration and its Department of Government Efficiency fired hundreds, likely more than 1,000, NOAA workers earlier this year. The government then sent out letters telling probationary employees let go that they will get paid, but should not report to work.",
      "Earlier this month, the agency had announced weather balloon cuts in Albany, New York and Gray, Maine, and in late February, it ended launches in Kotzebue, Alaska. That makes 11 announced sites with reduced or eliminated balloon observations, or about one out of nine launch locations which include part of the Pacific and Caribbean.",
      "Among regularly reporting weather stations, NOAA had averaged about only one outage of balloon launches a day from 2021 to 2024, according to an Associated Press analysis of launch data.",
      "Meteorologists Jeff Masters and Tomer Burg calculate that 14 of 83 U.S. balloon sites, or 17%, are doing partial or no launches. That includes two stations that aren't launching because of a helium shortage and a third that is hindered because of coastal erosion.",
      "\u201cThe more data we can feed into our weather models, the more accurate our forecasts, but I can\u2019t speculate on the extent of future impacts,\u201d weather service spokesperson Susan Buchanan said in an email.",
      "University at Albany meteorology professor Kristen Corbosiero looked at the map of launches Friday and said \u201cwow, that is an empty area ... That's not great.\u201d",
      "Corbosiero works in the building where the Albany weather service used to go to the roof to launch twice-daily weather balloons. It's now down to one at night, which she said it is worrisome heading into severe weather season.",
      "\u201cFor those of us east of the Rocky Mountains, this is probably the worst time of year,\u201d said Oklahoma's McPherson. \u201cIt's the time of year that we have some of our largest tornado outbreaks, especially as we move into April and May.\u201d",
      "Former National Weather Service Director Elbert \u201cJoe\u201d Friday said the weather balloons get \u201cthe detailed lower atmospheric level of temperature and humidity that can determine whether the atmosphere is going to be hot enough to set off severe storms and how intense they might be.\u201d",
      "Satellites do a good job getting a big picture and ground measurements and radar show what's happening on the ground, but the weather balloons provide the key middle part of the forecasting puzzle \u2014 the atmosphere \u2014 where so much weather brews, several meteorologists said.",
      "All of the 10 announced reductions are in the northern part of the United States. That's about where the jet stream \u2014 which is a river of air that moves weather systems across the globe \u2014 is this time of year, so not having as many observations is especially problematic, McPherson and Corbosiero said.",
      "Weather balloons are also vital for helping forecast when and where it will rain, said Baker and another former NOAA chief, Rick Spinrad.",
      "The weather agency has been launching balloons regularly since the 1930s. During World War II, weather balloon launches in the Arctic helped America win the air battle over Europe with better forecasts for planes, former weather chief Friday said.",
      "It takes 90 minutes to an hour to fill a weather balloon with helium or hydrogen, get it fitted with a sensor, then ready it for launch making sure the radiosonde doesn't drag on the ground, said Friday, who recalled launching a balloon in Nome, Alaska with 30 mph winds and windchill of about 30 degrees below zero.",
      "Meteorologists then track the data for a couple hours before the balloon falls back to the ground for a total of about four of five hours work for one person, Friday said.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of fun to do,\u201d Friday said on Friday.",

      "BAMAKO, Mali -- Amadou Ndiaye meticulously ran his fingers across bumps in a piece of paper, making sense of the world he can no longer see.",
      "Two hundred years have passed since the invention of braille, the tactile writing system that has transformed the lives of many blind and partially sighted people by offering a path to literacy and independence.",
      "\u201cBraille helped me live my life,\" said Ndiaye, a social worker in Mali who lost his eyesight as a child. \u201cBefore, people asked themselves the question: Here is someone who can\u2019t see, how will he make it? How will he integrate into society?\u201d",
      "The West African country, with a population of over 20 million people, has long struggled to integrate blind and partially sighted people. According to eye care charity Sightsavers, around 170,000 people in Mali are thought to be blind.",
      "The 47-year-old Ndiaye was fortunate to attend the institute for the blind in Mali, where he learned to write in braille, and told himself: \u201cReally, everything that others do, I can do too.\u201d He later attended university.",
      "He said braille has allowed him to develop his main passion, playing the guitar, which also emphasizes the importance of touch.",
      "\u201cEach pressure on the strings, each movement of the finger on the neck, becomes a living note, loaded with meaning,\" Ndiaye said.",
      "The guitar is an integral part of Mali's griot tradition, the cultural practice of storytelling through music. Musicians adapted the guitar to emulate the sounds of traditional string instruments like the kora. Local artists such as Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 have fused Malian melodies with elements of the blues, creating a soulful, hypnotic sound that has gained international acclaim.",
      "Iconic Malian musical duo Amadou and Mariam awakened Ndiaye's passion for the instrument when he was a boy.",
      "\u201cOne day, near a photography studio, I heard their music resonating through the window, which pushed me to discover this universe,\u201d he said.",
      "Known as \u201cthe blind couple from Mali,\" the duo of Amadou Bagayoko, who lost his vision at age 16, and Mariam Doumbia, who became blind at age 5 as a consequence of untreated measles, rose to international fame in the 1990s with their fusion of traditional Malian music, rock, and blues.",
      "The couple met at Mali's institute for the blind, where Doumbia was studying braille and teaching classes in dance and music.",
      "At such places, braille has allowed students to overcome educational barriers such as taking longer to learn how to read and write. They can then take the same exams as anyone else, which allows them to seek employment, said Ali Moustapha Dicko, who teaches at the institute for the blind in the capital, Bamako.",
      "Dicko is also blind. Using a special typewriter, he can create texts in braille for his students. But he says his students are still at a disadvantage.",
      "\u201cWe have a crisis of teaching materials,\u201d Dicko said. He has one reading book in braille for his entire class of dozens of students.",
      "But with the development of new technologies, some blind and partially sighted people hope that educational barriers will continue to fall.",
      "\u201cThere is software, there are telephones that speak, so there are many things that are vocal,\u201d said Bagayoko of the musical duo. \u201cThis allows us to move forward.\u201d",
      "But Moussa Mbengue, the Senegal-based program officer for inclusive education at Sightsavers, said such advances still don't make the leap that braille did two centuries ago.",
      "\"It cannot replace braille. On the contrary, for me, technology complements braille,\u201d he said.",

      "Decades of road salt use is taking a toll on New York City\u2019s water reservoirs",
      "The suburban reservoirs that supply 10% of New York City's vaunted drinking water are getting saltier due to decades of road salt being spread near the system \u2014 and they will eventually have to be abandoned if nothing is done to reverse the trend, city officials warn.",
      "The plug wouldn't have to be pulled until early next century, according to a new study. But the soaring saltiness could eventually affect the famous taste of the Big Apple\u2019s water, which is sometimes called the champagne of tap water, and poses a challenge to managers of a system that serves more than 9 million people.",
      "\u201cThe conclusion of this study is that if we don\u2019t change our ways, in 2100 the Croton Water System becomes a nice recreational facility, but it ceases to be a water supply,\u201d Rohit Aggarwala, the city\u2019s environmental protection commissioner, said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd that will directly impact everybody who drinks New York City water.\u201d",
      "The Croton system dates back to 1842 \u2014 when the first Croton Aqueduct began delivering water to a reservoir in what is now Manhattan\u2019s Central Park \u2014 and is now comprised of 12 reservoirs and three controlled lakes north of the city.",
      "The report found the concentration of chlorides \u2014 an indicator of salinization \u2014 tripled from 1987 to 2019 in the system's main reservoir, which is about 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of the city line. Concentrations are on track to exceed the state\u2019s maximum contaminant level for chloride by 2108.",
      "The report found salinity increases across the sprawling system of city reservoirs in upstate New York. However, the problem is far less of an issue in the Delaware and Catskill watersheds west of the Hudson River, which supply about 90% of the city\u2019s water. That\u2019s likely because there\u2019s far less development in those watersheds.",
      "Road salt is considered a main driver of the increase, along with sewage treatment plant discharges and water softeners. Millions of tons of rock salt is spread on U.S. roads each winter as a cheap and effective way to reduce accidents.",
      "\u201cIt's really a problem across the country in areas with a lot of snow,\u201d said Shannon Roback, science director for the environmental group Riverkeeper. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen rising levels of salt in water in the Northeast, in the Midwest and in most places that use road salt.\u201d",
      "Roback noted that high salt levels in drinking water pose a host of environmental concerns and can be harmful to people on low-sodium diets.",
      "Aggarwala said the city has a few options.",
      "Salt can be removed from water supplies through reverse osmosis systems, though the technology is expensive and requires a lot of energy. The city also could mix Croton water with less salty water from its other two watersheds. But the commissioner said that would not be a solution for the more than a dozen municipalities north of New York City that draw water from the Croton system.",
      "City officials believe reducing the use of road salt locally is the most sensible option. That could involve persuading state and local road crews to use alternatives to salt, or sensors on plows to gauge road surface temperatures, or shutting off the applicators when plows make U-turns or K turns.",
      "State Sen. Pete Harckham, who represents the area, called the new report alarming, but not surprising given a number of community wells taken offline due to high chloride levels. The Democrat is sponsoring bills that would address the road salt issue, including one that would study the issue in the Croton watershed.",
      "\u201cState agencies, local governments, everyone needs to come together on this,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause this is a real challenge.\u201d",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- A jury found the alleged ringleader of a massive pandemic fraud case in Minnesota guilty on all counts Wednesday for her role in a scheme that federal prosecutors say stole $250 million from a program meant to feed children in need.",
      "Aimee Bock \u2014 founder of Feeding our Future, the group at the heart of the plot \u2014 was one of 70 defendants charged in the overall case, which prosecutors said was the nation's single largest fraud scheme against COVID-19 relief programs.",
      "The Minnesota case has also drawn attention for an attempt to bribe a juror in an earlier trial and witness tampering in Bock's trial, which began last month. Thirty-seven defendants have already pleaded guilty, while five were convicted in a group of defendants who were tried last year.",
      "The jury also convicted a co-defendant, Salim Ahmed Said, owner of the now-defunct Safari Restaurant in Minneapolis.",
      "Bock, 44, and Said, 36, were charged with multiple counts involving conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery. Said was also charged with money laundering. Bock allegedly pocketed nearly $2 million, while Said was accused of taking around $5 million. They both maintained their innocence and testified at trial.",
      "U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel ordered them both held without bail pending their sentencing, for which she did not set a date.",
      "\u201cIt was the largest COVID fraud scheme in the country, and what Bock and and her co-defendants did was reprehensible.\u201d Lisa Kirkpatrick the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, said at a news conference afterward.",
      "\u201cDuring COVID, while so many were trying to be helpers, Bock and Said were thieves,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey used a time of crisis as their golden opportunity to enrich themselves and their criminal partners \u2014 outlandishly so. At every step of the way, Bock fought to keep her fraud scheme going. Today her efforts to lie, to blame others, to escape responsibility, all came to an end.\u201d",
      "Bock's attorney, Kenneth Udoibok, said there will be an appeal. While he has not decided what legal grounds might be used as its basis, he told The Associated Press that the jury could not have fairly considered all six weeks' worth of evidence in the few hours they deliberated after getting the case Wednesday morning.",
      "But lead prosecutor Joe Thompson called the scheme \u201cbrazen and corrupt\u201d and told reporters it tarnished Minnesota's reputation for good governance and civic mindedness as well as its high quality of life and low crime.",
      "\u201cThe Feeding Our Future case has come to symbolize the problem of fraud in our state,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt has become the shame of Minnesota. Hopefully today\u2019s verdict will help turn the page in this awful chapter in our state\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who came under heavy criticism from Republicans who said his administration should have caught the fraud earlier, told reporters he remains \u201cfurious\u201d with \u201ccriminals that preyed on the system that was meant to feed children.\u201d But he pointed out that nobody in state government, which administered the federal funding, was ever charged in the case.",
      "\u201cWe just need to make sure that we put up more firewalls, more security, more ability to make sure that these criminals aren\u2019t able to prey on this,\u201d Walz said.",
      "Thompson said authorities have recovered only about $60 million of the $250 million that was stolen. He declined to speculate on what prosecutors might recommend for sentences but said Bock and Said face \u201csubstantial\u201d prison time.",
      "The defendants are being tried in several groups. The first trial was marred by an alleged attempt by some defendants and people linked with them to bribe a juror with a bag of $120,000 in cash. That juror went straight to police. That led to tighter security for Bock\u2019s trial and additional precautions ordered by the judge.",
      "Despite all that, an allegation of witness tampering surfaced midway through the proceedings. A defendant scheduled for trial in August approached a government witness who was due to testify against Bock and Said and asked to speak with him in a courthouse bathroom. That witness declined and instead told his lawyer, who informed prosecutors.",
      "That defendant, Abdinasir Abshir, 32, of Lakeville, soon agreed to plead guilty to a wire fraud charge and to have his tampering attempt factored into a longer sentencing recommendation, which isn\u2019t binding on the judge.",

      "Members of the Sackler family who own the OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma would hand over the company and up to $7 billion in cash in the latest plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of opioids",
      "Purdue Pharma asked a bankruptcy judge late Tuesday to consider the latest version of its plan to settle thousands of lawsuits over the toll of the powerful prescription painkiller OxyContin, a deal that would have members of the Sackler family who own the company pay up to $7 billion.",
      "The filing is a milestone in a tumultuous legal saga that has gone on for more than five years.",
      "Under the deal the family members \u2014 estimated in documents from 2020 and 2021 to be worth about $11 billion \u2014 would give up ownership of the company in addition to contributing money over 15 years with the biggest payment up front.",
      "Family members resigned from Purdue's board, stopped receiving money from the company and ceased other involvement before it filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 as it faced lawsuits from thousands of state and local governments, plus others.",
      "The new entity would be run by a board appointed by state governments, and its mission will be to abate the opioid crisis that has been linked to hundreds of thousands of deaths in the U.S. since OxyContin hit the market in 1996. The first wave of deadly overdoses were tied to OxyContin and other prescription drugs, and subsequent waves have involved first heroin and more recently illicit versions of fentanyl.",
      "This settlement plan was hammered out in months of mediation involving groups that sued Purdue, and nearly all of them are supporting it, according to mediator reports filed in court.",
      "Approval would take at least several more months.",
      "A previous version had bankruptcy court approval but was rejected last year by the U.S. Supreme Court because it protected members of the Sackler family from civil lawsuits even though none of them filed for bankruptcy protection themselves.",
      "Under the new version, plaintiffs will have to opt in to get full shares of the settlement. If they do not, they can still sue Sackler family members, who agreed to put in about $1 billion more than under earlier plans. The Sacklers' cash contribution would depends in part on how many parties join the settlement and on the sale of foreign drug companies. Some of the money they put into the settlement is to be reserved to pay any judgments if they are sued and lose; but if that doesn't happen, it's to go into the main settlement.",
      "Members of the family have been cast as villains and have seen their name removed from art galleries and universities around the world because of their role in the privately held company. They continue to deny any wrongdoing.",
      "Other drugmakers, distribution companies, pharmacy chains and others have already reached opioid lawsuit settlements worth about $50 billion, according to an Associated Press tally. Purdue's, which would also include about $900 million from company coffers, would be among the largest if finalized.",
      "The deals require most of the money be used to fight the opioid crisis.",
      "Purdue's is the only major one that also provides direct money for victims \u2014 potentially more than $850 million total in pools for people who became addicted, their families and babies born in withdrawal. That figure is more than in the previous incarnation.",
      "The deadline to apply for a piece of those funds passed years ago. In earlier versions, individuals were expected to receive between about $3,500 and $48,000. Families were split over the deal.",
      "Purdue would also provide millions of documents to a repository that would make them public. The company has also been producing a low-cost version of naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses.",

      "A three-judge panel has ruled that Ohio\u2019s ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and ordered it permanently blocked by a trial court",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio's ban on gender-affirming care for minors is unconstitutional and must be permanently blocked from being enforced, a three-judge panel of appellate judges ruled Tuesday. The law also banned trans women and girls from participating in female sports.",
      "The state attorney general vowed an immediate appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, the state 10th District Court of Appeals reversed a lower court judge's decision last summer to allow the law to go into effect, after finding it \u201creasonably limits parents' rights.\u201d The law bans counseling, gender-affirming surgery and hormone therapy for minors, unless they are already receiving such therapies and a doctor deems it risky to stop.",
      "The litigation was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Ohio and the global law firm Goodwin, who argued the law not only denies health care to transgender children and teens, but specifically discriminates against them accessing it.",
      "The appellate court agreed, in a 2-1 majority opinion written by Judge Carly Edelstein, and cited a number of flaws in the lower court's reasoning.",
      "The judge cited a number of flaws in the lower court\u2019s reasoning. She said that the Ohio law does not outlaw identical drugs when they're used for other reasons, only when they're used for gender transitioning, which makes it discriminatory. She also said that a prescription ban is not a reasonable exercise of the state's police power when it is weighed against the rights of parents to care for their children.",
      "Addressing proponents' arguments that minors are not in a position to understand the long-term impacts such procedures could have on their lives, the judge said that, while they may not be, their parents are.",
      "\u201cThus, in considering whether the H.B. 68 ban is reasonable, it is necessary to keep in mind that the law recognizes the maturity, experience, and capacity of parents to make difficult judgments and act in their children\u2019s best interest,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The ACLU called the ruling \u201chistoric.\u201d",
      "\"This win restores the right of trans youth in Ohio to choose vitally important health care, with the support of their families and physicians,\" Freda Levenson, legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, said in a statement. \u201cWe are gratified by the Court\u2019s decision, which soundly rejects this interference of politicians with Ohioans\u2019 bodily autonomy.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's ruling marked the second blow for the legislation.",
      "Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine vetoed the law in December 2023, after touring the state to visit children\u2019s hospitals and talking to families of children with gender dysphoria. He cast his action as thoughtful, limited and \u201cpro-life\u201d \u2014 citing the suicide risks associated with minors who don't get proper treatment for gender dysphoria.",
      "DeWine simultaneously announced plans to move to administratively ban gender-affirming surgeries until a person is 18, and to position the state to better regulate and track gender-affirming treatments in both children and adults. He hoped the move would allay concerns of fellow Republicans at the Ohio Statehouse, but the administration swiftly backed off that plan after transgender adults raised serious concerns about how state regulations could impact their lives and health.",
      "Ohio lawmakers stood their ground on the bill, easily overriding his veto \u2014 making Ohio the 23rd state to ban gender-affirming health care for trans youth.",
      "Republican Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a candidate to succeed DeWine next year who serves as the Legislature's lawyer, quickly released a statement saying that he will appeal Tuesday's ruling.",
      "\u201cThis is a no-brainer \u2013 we are appealing that decision and will seek an immediate stay,\" he said. \u201cThere is no way I\u2019ll stop fighting to protect these unprotected children.\u201d",
      "Levenson acknowledged that Tuesday's ruling was likely not the end of the legal dispute, but she said in a statement that her organization remained \u201cfervently committed\u201d to preventing the bill from ever taking effect again.",

      "Doctors depend on the test during early evaluations, so understanding what the results mean for people of different races and ethnicities is critical, said Dr. Shannon Westin of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who was not involved in the research.",
      "\u201cThis is a perfect example of work that absolutely needed to be stratified based on race and ethnicity,\" Westin said. The findings alert doctors that they shouldn't be totally reassured by a normal test result, she said.",
      "So far, it\u2019s unknown why the test doesn't perform uniformly across groups. The researchers suspect it has something to do with a harmless genetic variation that is more common in people of African, Caribbean, Middle Eastern and West Indian descent.",

      "The district's electronic devices policy \u2014 which applies both on and off school time \u2014 prohibits transmitting \u201cdisruptive\u201d material or material that could be seen as harassing or disparaging other students based on their gender identity or sexual orientation, among other categories.",
      "A separate antidiscrimination policy prohibits students from engaging in \u201cdiscriminatory language\u201d during times when they're under the school's authority. That is defined as \u201cverbal or written comments, jokes, and slurs that are derogatory towards an individual or group based on one or more of the following characteristics: race, color, national origin, sex (including sexual orientation and transgender identity), disability, age, religion, ancestry, or genetic information.\u201d",
      "The district's code of conduct echoes many of the same themes a third time.",
      "Parents Defending Education, founded in 2021 amid the culture wars over schools\u2019 teachings on race, diversity and sexuality, argues that the policies compel students and parents who belong to their group to \u201caffirm an idea that gender is fluid\u201d in contradiction of their religious beliefs.",
      "\u201cThese students have views that the District disfavors,\u201d the group wrote in a court filing. \u201cSpecifically, they believe that people are either male or female, that biological sex is immutable, and that sex does not change based on someone\u2019s internal feelings. Accordingly, they \u2018d(o) not want to be forced to \u2018affirm\u2019 that a biologically female classmate is actually a male \u2014 or vice versa \u2014 or that a classmate is \u2019nonbinary' and neither male nor female.\u201d",
      "The group argues that the policies unconstitutionally compel \u201cviewpoint-based\u201d speech by forcing students who believe in only two genders to use pronouns that suggest otherwise. They say that violates the First Amendment's guarantees to free speech and similar protections contained in the 14th Amendment, particularly since students are subject to punishment for violating the policies.",
      "Parents Defending Education further challenges the electronic devices policy for applying outside school hours and off school property. The ACLU has sided with the parents' group on this point, arguing the district's policies are overbroad.",
      "Olentangy Local School District outside Columbus, one of the state's largest districts, maintains the policies protect students against abuse and harassment and asserts that Parents Defending Education represents \u201cChristian, cisgender\u201d students \"seeking dispensation under the free speech clause of the First Amendment to harass other students based on their gender identity.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not illegal immigrants subject to deportation. They are not gay soldiers under Don't Ask Don't Tell. They're not African Americans in the Jim Crow south. They've not been systematically oppressed,\" the district's lawyers told the lower court. \"They're members of the majority who want to \u2014 under the guise of the First Amendment \u2014 openly voice their opposition to an historically maligned minority group, transgendered people.\u201d",
      "Olentangy argues that Parents Defending Education has failed to provide evidence of injury \u2014 as the lawsuit was filed before disciplinary action had been brought against any student. The district also says that its policies leave open other options for students who don't wish to use someone's preferred pronouns. That includes calling the person by their first name, using a gender-neutral pronoun or simply not referring to them at all.",
      "The availability of such options, an argument against the policies unconstitutionally compelling students to say certain things, played a role in the three-judge panel's 2-1 ruling in favor of the district last summer.",

      "French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu is standing trial at a Paris courthouse on sexual assault charges",
      "PARIS -- French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu went on trial Monday in Paris on charges of sexually assaulting two women on a movie set, in a case seen as a potential watershed for the #MeToo movement in France.",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of having groped a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant director during filming in 2021 of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d).",
      "The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted.",
      "Depardieu denies any wrongdoing. He told the judges that he was prepared to answer the court\u2019s questions.",
      "\u201cWe will be able to show in an impartial, objective and incontestable manner that all of the accusations are lies,\u201d his attorney, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, told journalists massed outside the courtroom.",
      "\u201cThe truth will be obvious and the truth is on our side,\u201d he said.",
      "Depardieu's long and storied career has turned the trial into a post- #MeToo test of the willingness of France and its movie industry to confront sexual violence and hold influential men accountable.",
      "Depardieu has been a darling of French cinemagoers for decades and was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac.",
      "But his alleged boorish behavior off-screen has also long made headlines. He has been accused publicly or in formal complaints of misconduct by more than 20 women, but so far only the sexual assault case has proceeded to court. Some others were dropped because of a lack of evidence or the statute of limitations.",
      "Feminist and historian Florence Montreynaud described Depardieu's court appearance as \u201ca historic moment\" for women's rights, as she joined other campaigners who demonstrated outside the court. A dozen chanted \u201cSexist violence, complicit judicial system\" as they danced to techno music.",
      "\u201cTimes are changing. \u201c#MeToo has swept through. At last, mentalities are changing,\u201d Montreynaud said to French broadcaster BFMTV.",
      "The trial also follows in the wake of the historic case last year involving Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, whose bravery put the spotlight on sexual violence in France. She demanded that the drugging-and-rape trial for 51 men tried for a horrific catalogue of abuse on her be held in open court, arguing that doing so would help make shame change sides.",
      "France has often been ambivalent \u2014 even resistant \u2014 toward the #MeToo movement. While Hollywood saw powerful men fall swiftly and publicly, the French film industry was slower to respond. Some dismissed #MeToo as an American export incompatible with French values, citing concerns over free expression and what they viewed as an erosion of flirtation culture.",
      "At the time of the alleged assaults, Depardieu was already under formal investigation for rape. In 2018, actor Charlotte Arnould accused him of raping her at his home. That case is still active, and in August 2024, prosecutors requested that it go to trial.",
      "Prosecutors say Depardieu trapped the set dresser with his legs before groping her waist and breasts in front of witnesses. She says the actor also used obscene language and had to be pulled away by bodyguards.",
      "The assistant director alleged that Depardieu groped her both on set and in the street.",
      "The women sat side by side in court. The Associated Press doesn\u2019t name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified. Neither has done so in this case.",
      "The trial is expected to last at least two days, but could be extended beyond Tuesday, if the chief judge wants more time. The trial was initially scheduled for October, but then postponed because of Depardieu\u2019s health. A verdict is expected at a later date.",
      "Depardieu grasped his lawyer's shoulder as he strode calmly into the courtroom. The actor has undergone a quadruple heart bypass and has diabetes, according to his lawyer. A court-appointed medical expert determined that he\u2019s fit to stand trial, but recommended that the hearings don't exceed six hours, with a 15-minute pause and snack every three hours.",
      "The first hours of Monday\u2019s hearing were largely taken up by Depardieu\u2019s lawyer, who sought to cast doubt on witness testimony and the police investigation. The attorney alleged, without providing evidence, that police acted under instructions from magistrates who led the investigation to \u201cmake Depardieu fall.\u201d",
      "Depardieu listened intently, sometimes nodding.",
      "The plaintiffs' lawyers were expected to lay out their evidence later. One of the lawyers, Carine Durrieu Diebolt, said on France Info radio before the trial opened that \u201cthe case is solid\u201d and that her client is \u201ccalmly awaiting the outcome.\u201d",
      "She said that four additional women who say they have been sexually assaulted by Depardieu will testify.",
      "In an open letter published in October 2023, Depardieu wrote: \u201cNever, but never, have I abused a woman.\u201d",
      "The actor had dropped out of sight in recent months, his film career seemingly on hold. But he still has friends in the industry. Actors Vincent Perez and Fanny Ardant were among those who took seats on his side of the courtroom.",

      "The Kremlin confirmed Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has gifted to Donald Trump a portrait he commissioned of the U.S. president.",
      "Putin gave the painting to Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Moscow earlier this month, the Russian president's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in a response to a journalist's question, declining further comment.",
      "The gift was first mentioned last week by Witkoff in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. Witkoff told Carlson that Trump \u201cwas clearly touched\u201d by the portrait, which he described as \"beautiful.\u201d",
      "Witkoff met Putin after talks with Russian officials about trying to end the war in Ukraine. Ceasefire talks continued Monday in Saudi Arabia, where U.S. officials met their Russian counterparts, a day after meeting with Ukrainian negotiators.",
      "During his interview with Carlson, Witkoff described Putin\u2019s gift as \u201cgracious\u201d and recalled how Putin told him he had prayed for Trump last year when he heard the then-candidate for the U.S. presidency had been shot at a rally in Pennsylvania. \u201cHe was praying for his friend,\u201d Witkoff said, recounting Putin's comments.",
      "In 2018, Putin gave then-President Trump a soccer ball that the Secret Service had checked for listening devices before Trump gave it to his son \u2014 a precaution that hearkened back to a Soviet-era gift to a U.S. diplomat that turned out to be bugged.",
      "In 1945, a carving of the Great Seal of the United States was given as a gift from Soviet school children to then-U.S. Ambassador Averell Harriman. It hung in his office for six years allowing the Soviet Union to eavesdrop on his conversations until the State Department discovered that it contained a covert listening device.",
      "It was not immediately known if the portrait Putin gave to Trump had been examined for bugs. The White House hasn't commented on the portrait.",
      "Trump isn't the first sitting president to receive a gift from Putin. In 2021, Putin gave then-President Joe Biden a $12,000 lacquer writing box and pen when they met at a summit in Geneva, Switzerland. In 2013, he reportedly sent then-President Barack Obama porcelain plates and espresso cups.",
      "This apparently isn't the first portrait of a U.S. leader Putin has sent, either. In 2014, the Russia president reportedly sent to George H.W. Bush a portrait of the former president on his 90th birthday.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Officials in the South Korean city of Andong on Tuesday alerted residents to evacuate to safe areas as firefighters struggled to contain wildfires that have ravaged southern regions since last week, forcing thousands to flee and destroying likely hundreds of structures, including a 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple.",
      "Thousands of firefighters in South Korea were battling at least nine wildfires across the country as of Tuesday afternoon, after the blazes fueled by dry winds burned more than 36,300 acres of land in the past five days.",
      "Officials in Andong, a city in the country\u2019s southeast, and the nearby town of Uiseong ordered residents in several villages and those near Andong University to evacuate to safe locations or temporary shelters \u2014 including schools and indoor gyms \u2014 as a fire that started in Uiseong continued to spread due to strong winds. The fire in Andong was also reaching the village of Pungcheon, home to the Hahoe folk village, a UNESCO World Heritage site founded around the 14-15th centuries.",
      "The blaze in Uiseong destroyed Gounsa, a Buddhist temple built in the 7th century, according to officials from the Korea Heritage Service. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and some of the temple\u2019s national treasures, including a stone Buddha statue, were evacuated before the fire reached the wooden buildings.",
      "The fire was also spreading to the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, where officials shut down roads and ordered residents of at least four villages to evacuate. The Justice Ministry did not immediately confirm local reports that it had begun relocating some 2,600 inmates from a prison in Cheongsong county, near Uiseong.",
      "More than 3,700 firefighters, along with 76 helicopters and 530 vehicles, were deployed to battle the fires in the Uiseong and Andong areas, which were nearly 70% contained as of Tuesday evening, according to the Korea Forest Service.",
      "The service raised its wildfire warning to the highest \u201cserious\u201d level nationwide, requiring local governments to allocate a larger work force for emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.",
      "South Korean officials said earlier on Tuesday that firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in the country\u2019s southern regions, including Uiseong, the neighboring town of Sancheong, and Ulsan city. However, the ongoing dry and windy weather now appears to be causing setbacks.",
      "Four firefighters and government workers were killed in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds. At least 11 other people have been injured by wildfires around the country since last Friday, according to the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.",
      "The national government designated the hardest-hit southeastern regions as disaster zones to focus resources and accelerate recovery efforts.",
      "Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, serving as the country\u2019s acting leader following President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s impeachment over a December martial law decree, vowed an all-out effort to contain the wildfires during a government meeting on Tuesday. He also urged public vigilance as dry spring weather persists.",
      "Government officials suspect that several of the recent wildfires, including those in Uiseong and Ulsan, were caused by human error, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.",

      "Sierra Leone could become the second country in West Africa to decriminalize abortion",
      "FREETOWN, Sierra Leone -- When she got pregnant at 16, Fatou Esther Jusu was terrified that it would derail her future.",
      "Abortion is illegal in Sierra Leone. Fearing judgment from her family, she took friends\u2019 advice and bought misoprostol, a drug whose uses include abortion, from a local pharmacy. It didn't work. Desperate, she tried again and miscarried.",
      "\u201cI went to the toilet\u2026 and the baby came out,\u201d she said. She fainted and was taken to a hospital, where she pleaded with doctors not to tell her parents.",
      "Now 21, Jusu considers herself lucky. One friend died after taking an expired version of the medication.",
      "With those experiences in mind, the nursing student is mobilizing others in support of a bill that would decriminalize abortion in the West African country.",
      "\u201cEven though I made a mistake, this mistake is saving other people,\u201d Jusu said.",
      "Sierra Leone could become the second country in West Africa to decriminalize abortion, which health workers say would significantly improve the safety of pregnant women, decrease the number of preventable deaths and bring an end to the current colonial-era law.",
      "Tens of thousands of women and girls attempt to self-terminate their pregnancies every year in Sierra Leone, where abortion is illegal in all circumstances.",
      "Supporters of the bill say unsafe abortions account for around 10% of maternal deaths. Healthcare workers are known to perform terminating procedures when the situation is \u201cincompatible with life\u201d of the woman, usually in the case of \u201cincomplete\u201d abortions. Because abortion is illegal, they cite other reasons for the termination.",
      "Sierra Leone\u2019s President Julius Maada Bio pointedly introduced the Safe Motherhood Bill after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, stripping away women's constitutional protections for abortion.",
      "\u201cAt a time when sexual and reproductive health rights for women are either being overturned or threatened, we are proud that Sierra Leone can once again lead with progressive reforms,\u201d Bio said.",
      "If approved, the bill would have been West Africa's most progressive legislation on abortion, allowing the procedure for up to 14 weeks.",
      "But Sierra Leone since then has been torn apart by debate. Following opposition from religious leaders, the bill has been amended and now limits abortion to cases of life-threatening risk, fatal fetal abnormalities, rape or incest.",
      "The government says it expects a vote in parliament in the coming weeks. It is not clear whether it will be approved.",
      "An estimated 90,000 abortions are performed annually in Sierra Leone, a country of more than 8 million people, according to research by the African Population and Health Research Center. About 10% of the country's maternal deaths \u2014 affecting 717 of every 100,000 births \u2014 are due to unsafe abortions, the center said.",
      "Health workers say the true number is likely much higher.",
      "Due to cost and stigma, many women and girls resort to unsafe methods like expired medication, laundry detergent, hangers or sharp instruments.",
      "On a recent morning at a clinic run by the MSI Sierra Leone nonprofit, dozens of women and girls waited nervously for consultations with nurse Hawanatu Samura.",
      "MSI offers \u201cpost-abortion care,\u201d including terminations in cases of \u201cincomplete\u201d miscarriage, often when people have tried and failed abortions themselves. The nonprofit is the largest individual service provider of family planning services in the country.",
      "If patients want an abortion, \u201cthey go to any length,\u201d Samura said. She often sees damage caused by unsterilized instruments, leading to severe hemorrhages, especially in underage girls.",
      "Over 20% of girls between 15 and 19 in Sierra Leone get pregnant, according to the U.N. Population Fund, one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in the world.",
      "Samura said a 13-year-old \u2014 already mother to a 10-month-old \u2014 recently arrived with severe pain after secretly taking unidentified pills to try to abort her pregnancy.",
      "\u201cIn Sierra Leone, people are afraid of the stigma \u2026 so they would prefer to die silently,\u201d she said. The patient did not understand her body, Samura said, and her dead fetus resulted in dangerous septicemia.",
      "The clinic has at least one such case a month, the nurse said.",
      "Many women and girls who have had abortions fear speaking out, and the push for the bill in Sierra Leone has been led by women\u2019s rights groups and medical professionals.",
      "\u201cIf you aren\u2019t listening to your doctors, then who are you listening to?\u201d said lawyer and advocate Nicky Spencer-Coker. She has fought for reproductive rights alongside a coalition of women\u2019s rights organisations since 2015.",
      "At the time, parliament unanimously passed a first version of a bill allowing abortions for up to 12 weeks. But then-President Ernest Bai Koroma blocked the bill amid pressure from anti-abortion and religious groups.",
      "Some Muslim and Christian leaders have denounced the current bill as \u201cungodly\u201d and \u201chellish.\u201d Archbishop Edward Tamba Charles, head of the country's Inter-Religious Council, said it contradicts citizens' \u201creligious values and sensibilities.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe number of girls that die every year \u2026 that\u2019s the demonstration of people\u2019s will,\u201d Chernor Bah, the information minister, told The Associated Press.",
      "Officials also say the bill is needed to strengthen gender reforms in Sierra Leone, which include last year\u2019s ban on child marriage.",
      "The bill also would allow wider access to family planning and reproductive health services. Activists fear those will be lost if the bill fails.",
      "Both sides in the debate have accused each other of being sponsored by foreign governments.",

      "Daniel Heath and William Lawrence, both 22 and engineers in the Royal Air Force, admitted in Reading Magistrates\u2019 Court that they were responsible for the March 2 vandalism in Newbury, the hometown of Paddington creator Michael Bond.",
      "\u201cPaddington Bear is a beloved cultural icon with children and adults alike,\u201d Judge Sam Goozee said. \u201cHe represents kindness, tolerance and promotes integration and acceptance in our society. ... Your actions were the antithesis of everything Paddington stands for.\u201d",
      "The statue of the bear in his signature blue coat and red hat was one of 23 installed last fall as part of a Paddington trail across England to mark the release of \u201cPaddington in Peru.\u201d The introspective bear is gazing skyward while clutching a sandwich \u2014 with marmalade about to drip on his lap.",

      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has lamented Canada\u2019s lost friendship with the United States as he visited the town that sheltered thousands of stranded American airline passengers after the 9/11 attacks",
      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney  on Monday lamented Canada\u2019s lost friendship with the United States as he visited the town that sheltered thousands of stranded American airline passengers after the 9/11 attacks.",
      "Carney's visit to Gander, Newfoundland on the second day of a national election campaign comes against the backdrop of a trade war and sovereignty threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s almost daily attacks on Canada\u2019s sovereignty have left Canadians feeling betrayed.",
      "\"In this crisis caused by the U.S. president and those who are enabling him, we lament a friendship lost,\" Carney said. \u201cIn Gander Canadians did extraordinary things for Americans when they needed it. Now, we need to do extraordinary things for ourselves.\u201d",
      "Gander opened its arms to nearly 6,600 airline passengers diverted there when the U.S. government shut down airspace during 9/11.",
      "In a matter of a few hours, the town population of 10,000 in 2001 was overwhelmed by 38 planeloads of travelers, yet locals went to work in their kitchens and cleaned up spare rooms to offer space and food to the newcomers.",
      "When more than 200 flights were diverted to Canada following the attacks on the United States, the Canadians shunted the traffic away from Toronto and Montreal to the eastern seaboard.",
      "Obscure, little-used Gander got to relive its glory days as a stopover point for trans-Atlantic aviation before long-distance flights became possible. Built in 1938 in anticipation of the coming world war, it had the world\u2019s longest runway, and on 9/11 it was the second busiest, taking in 38 flights to Halifax, Nova Scotia\u2019s 47.",
      "Flight crews quickly filled Gander\u2019s hotels, so passengers were taken to schools, fire stations and church halls. The Canadian military flew in 5,000 cots. Stores donated blankets, coffee machines, barbecue grills. Unable to retrieve their luggage, passengers became dependent on the kindness of strangers, and it came in the shape of clothes, showers, toys, banks of phones to call home free of charge, an arena that became a giant walk-in fridge full of donated food.",
      "Once all the planes had landed or turned back to Europe, Gander\u2019s air traffic controllers switched to cooking meals in the building nonstop for three days.",
      "\u201cMore than 6,000 passengers. Overnight, the town\u2019s population almost doubled,\u201d Carney said during a speech to residents. \u201cYou showed friendship to people who were fearful. In a crisis, you showed your character. When people needed help, you gave it.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Carney visited the home of Beulah Cooper, who opened her home and comforted many, including Dennis and Hannah O\u2019Rourke, an elderly couple whose New York firefighter son, Kevin, went missing at the World Trade Center and was later confirmed to have died there.",
      "The O\u2019Rourkes remained friends with Cooper long after and went back to Gander, saying they felt eternally indebted.",
      "Now, Cooper says she feels betrayed by America, though she remains friends with Hannah O'Rourke, whose husband passed away. She also feels bad for her American friends.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s too many bad words for me to say on the phone about what I think of Trump,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cCanada was the best ally they had.\"",
      "Carney noted the Gander story of that day became legend, immortalized in the Canadian-made Broadway hit musical \u201cCome from Away.\u201d",
      "Carney said Canadians have always been by Americans' side whether it was during the Iran hostage crisis, or more recently during the California wildfires or in Afghanistan, where Canada lost 158 members of the armed forces and seven civilians.",
      "Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbor and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. The American president has threatened economic coercion in his annexation threats and suggested the border is a fictional line.",
      "Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada\u2019s steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products \u2014 as well as all of America\u2019s trading partners \u2014 on April 2.",
      "Carney said Canadians are over the shock of the betrayal but now have to look out for themselves. He said Canadians and Americans have traditionally been like brothers.",
      "\"But that\u2019s changed. And it wasn\u2019t us who did the changing. Unfortunately, President Trump\u2019s actions have put that kinship under greater strain today than at any point in our storied history,\u201d Carney said.",
      "Carney, at the start of a five-week election campaign before the vote on April 28, said he's not looking for friendship from the Americans. \u201cI am just looking for respect at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "The new prime minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn\u2019t had a phone call with Trump and suggested that might not happen until after the election. \u201cI\u2019m available for a call. But you know we are going to talk on our terms as a sovereign country, not as what he pretends we are,\u201d Carney said.",
      "He said the Americans are making a \u201cfundamental mistake\" in the trade war.",
      "\u201cThey think they will weaken us. They think that they can own us quite frankly, that\u2019s what they think,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to get stronger. We are going to wait this out. They are going to come to the table and we are going to negotiate a good deal for Canadians.\u201d",

      "At a news conference called minutes before her flight to China, Liu repeated her denials of the charges, saying she was leaving \u201cout of respect for Taiwanese law,\u201d based on her lawyers\u2019 advice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not because I did anything wrong,\u201d she said.",

      "Lai has in recent weeks repeatedly warned of China using spies and propaganda, especially internet influencers, as well as military intimidation.",
      "Earlier in the day, Liu protested outside Taiwan government offices, while trying to speak to an immigration officer. She was unsuccessful. About 50 people protested her presence while chanting: \u201cHave a good trip home,\u201d and \u201cGet yourself back to China.\u201d Police were present but no violence broke out.",
      "The vast majority of Taiwanese reject China\u2019s demands and favor the current state of de-facto independence, despite China\u2019s threats.",
      "Liu, who is married to a Taiwanese man and has three children, appeared to board the plane alone. The couple haven't revealed their future plans. Under the regulations, she will have to wait five years to reapply for a Taiwan residency permit.",
      "At least two other Chinese women with Taiwanese husbands are currently under investigation as the island moves to reinstate military trials and crack down on the recruitment of serving members of the Taiwan's military as spies.",
      "Taiwan has also been boosting its defenses with high-tech weapon systems from the U.S. and locally developed munitions, submarines and warplanes.",
      "Such a conflict could draw in the U.S., which is required under American law to respond to Chinese actions against the island. The two foes are divided by the 180-kilometer (110-mile)-wide Taiwan Strait.",
      "Around 400,000 Chinese women have moved to the island of 23 million, according to the Interior Ministry, making up the bulk of foreign wives who also include Filipinas, Indonesians and Vietnamese.",

      "\u201cI feel like love should be free, and who you love is not a decision in any way,\u201d she said. \u201cThat we would not be able to gather like this, as we do now, and stand in our own streets, in our own city, is something I just can\u2019t agree with.\u201d",
      "Hungary's new law, which is reminiscent of similar restrictions against sexual minorities in Russia, amends rules on assembly to make it an offense to hold or attend events that violate Hungary\u2019s contentious child protection legislation, which prohibits the depiction or promotion of homosexuality to minors under 18.",
      "Authorities may now use facial recognition tools to identify individuals that attend prohibited events \u2014 such as the popular Budapest Pride which draws tens of thousands each year \u2014 and can issue fines for violators of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($546).",
      "Hungary's right-wing populist prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has in recent years taken aim at the country's LGBTQ+ community, prohibiting same-sex adoption and \u2014 in a 2021 child protection law \u2014 banning any LGBTQ+ content including in television, films, advertisements and literature that is available to minors.",
      "Orb\u00e1n's party plans to adopt a constitutional amendment in April that will codify the ban on public LGBTQ+ events. His government argues that its policies are designed to protect children from \u201csexual propaganda,\u201d but critics view them as part of a broader effort to scapegoat sexual minorities and mobilize his conservative base.",
      "Last week, a spokesperson for the United Nations\u2019 human rights commission said that the recent law \u201cresults in arbitrary and discriminatory restrictions on the rights of LGBTIQ+ individuals to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and privacy.\u201d",
      "The statement drew attention to a part of the law which authorizes the government to use surveillance measures including facial recognition technology to identify and fine individuals that participate in prohibited events, saying such tools \u201cshould never be deployed in a discriminatory manner through targeted surveillance of peaceful assemblies of LGBTIQ+ persons or other marginalized groups.\u201d",
      "Budapest Pride organizers, as well as Budapest's mayor, have vowed to go ahead with the city's Pride events, which are set to celebrate their 30th anniversary this summer. In response to the recent law, Pride organizers wrote: \u201cThis is not child protection, this is fascism.\u201d",
      "Benedek Lakos, a 27-year-old member of Budapest's LGBTQ+ community who attended the Tuesday demonstration, said he has not previously been active in expressing his opinion about measures taken by Hungary's government.",
      "But the latest law, he said, had been \u201cthe last straw.\u201d",
      "\"I feel now for a number of reasons that we have reached a level where, if there are no visible consequences for this (law) from the people, we can just start digging our own graves,\" he said.",

      "In the latest twist in South Korea\u2019s ongoing political crisis, the country\u2019s Constitutional Court reinstated Prime Minister Han Duck-soo as acting leader, overturning his impeachment by opposition lawmakers three months ago",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- In the latest twist in South Korea\u2019s ongoing political crisis, the country\u2019s Constitutional Court reinstated Prime Minister Han Duck-soo as acting leader, overturning his impeachment by opposition lawmakers three months ago.",
      "The court\u2019s ruling on Monday marks just one front in the deepening turmoil as it simultaneously weighs the far more consequential case of conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose December impeachment over his brief but stunning martial law decree has left the country\u2019s leadership in limbo for months.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at the court\u2019s decision and what's ahead:",
      "The prime minister typically holds limited authority as the country\u2019s second-highest official. But Han, a career bureaucrat who has held various government roles since the 1970s, was elevated as the government\u2019s caretaker after South Korea\u2019s opposition-controlled National Assembly impeached Yoon on Dec. 14.",
      "Yoon\u2019s impeachment, triggered by his short-lived imposition of martial law that month, immediately suspended his presidential powers and put his political fate in the hands of the Constitutional Court, which is nearing a decision on whether to formally remove him from office or reinstate him.",
      "As acting president, Han quickly clashed with the liberal opposition Democratic Party, mainly over his refusal to comply with their demand to immediately fill three vacant seats on the Constitutional Court\u2019s nine-member bench.",
      "The composition of the court is a sensitive issue since removing Yoon from office requires the support of at least six justices, and a full bench would likely increase the chances of his ouster. Han said he wouldn\u2019t appoint the justices without bipartisan consent, but the Democrats accused him of siding with the conservatives in the governing People Power Party, which has been campaigning for Yoon\u2019s return to power.",
      "Days after lawmakers impeached Han on Dec. 27, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, who stepped in as acting president, filled two of the court\u2019s vacancies but refused to appoint a progressive justice nominated by the opposition.",
      "Seven of the court\u2019s eight justices overturned or dismissed Han\u2019s impeachment, ruling that the accusations against him were either not illegal, not serious enough to warrant his removal or that the impeachment motion had failed to meet the required quorum when it passed through the National Assembly. One justice upheld Han\u2019s impeachment.",
      "After his reinstatement, Han called for national unity and emphasized the need to focus on addressing external challenges stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policies.",
      "Han\u2019s case is unlikely to serve as a preview of how the court will rule on Yoon. Han played no meaningful role in planning or enforcing Yoon\u2019s martial law, which was lifted by a legislative vote just hours after Yoon declared it on the night of Dec. 3.",
      "But Han\u2019s reinstatement still struck a nerve with the Democrats, who have recently criticized the court for its prolonged deliberation on Yoon\u2019s case, which has fueled concerns about a divide among justices, potentially paving the way for Yoon\u2019s return.",
      "Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon, questioned why the court didn\u2019t consider Han\u2019s refusal to appoint the justices an impeachable offense. He said Han\u2019s actions amounted to a \u201cclear and deliberate violation of his constitutional duty to form a government body.\u201d",
      "Lee also called for the court to make a swift decision on Yoon.",
      "Yoon\u2019s office issued a statement welcoming Han\u2019s reinstatement, asserting that the court\u2019s decision proved the opposition\u2019s \u201cexcessive impeachment attempts were reckless, malicious, and politically motivated.\u201d",
      "Yoon, who is also facing a separate criminal trial on rebellion charges, stands accused of abusing military power, bypassing constitutional and legal protocols to impose martial law, and orchestrating a failed attempt to dissolve the legislature. But the Constitutional Court likely won\u2019t take a deep dive into Yoon\u2019s criminal allegations, as it\u2019s only required to rule whether or not he can remain in office.",
      "Some experts say Han\u2019s testimony before lawmakers, investigators and the court regarding the short-lived martial law decree could possibly influence how justices rule on Yoon\u2019s case.",
      "Among the various accusations against Yoon, the National Assembly has alleged that he bypassed a constitutional requirement to deliberate in a formal Cabinet meeting before declaring martial law. Han\u2019s testimony has seemingly supported these claims.",
      "While Yoon called 11 Cabinet members to his office shortly before declaring martial law on late-night television, Han has said the gathering did not qualify as a formal Cabinet meeting and that Yoon unilaterally informed them of his decision rather than inviting deliberation.",
      "Han and other top officials, including Choi and Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, have said they attempted to talk Yoon out of martial law, citing potential damage to the country\u2019s international reputation and economy. Under South Korea\u2019s constitution, such powers can only be exercised during wartime or comparable national emergencies.",

      "Paetongtarn, who took office last year, is expected to survive her first no-confidence vote on Wednesday with the backing of her ruling coalition that makes up the majority of the House of Representatives.",
      "The head of the opposition in parliament, Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, said Paetongtarn had failed to address many of the country\u2019s chronic problems including the slumping economy, air pollution, crimes and corruption. He said her administration was serving the interests of her family and her father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, a popular but highly controversial political figure.",
      "Paetongtarn heads the Pheu Thai Party, the latest in a string of populist parties affiliated with Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup, fled into exile and recently returned to Thailand. Thaksin has been at the heart of nearly two decades of deep political divisions pitting a mostly poor, rural majority that supported him against royalists, the military and their urban backers, who accuse him of threatening their status and that of the revered monarchy.",
      "Natthapong is the leader of the People\u2019s Party, a resurrection of the progressive, reformist Move Forward Party, which took the most seats in the general election in 2023 but failed to take power due to strong opposition from the conservative establishment, and was ordered dissolved.",
      "Natthapong said the formation of the ruling coalition, which saw Pheu Thai partner with its former conservative rivals, was part of the political bargain to bring Thaksin home.",
      "Paetongtarn was also accused by Prawit Wongsuwan, head of the Palang Pracharath Party, Pheu Thai\u2019s former coalition partner, of falsely declaring her assets, which she denied.",

      "Actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu has testified on Day 2 of his trial in Paris on sexual assault charges",
      "PARIS -- French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu acknowledged Tuesday that he aggressively subjected a woman who accuses him of sexual assault to vulgar and heated language and that he grabbed her hips but denied that his behavior was sexual as he testified for the first time at his landmark trial in Paris.",
      "The woman told the court that the Oscar-nominated actor behaved \u201clike a madman\u201d who took \u201cpleasure in frightening me.\u201d",
      "Day 2 of the Paris trial centered on the 76-year-old actor's behavior during filming in 2021 of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d), where two co-workers allege that he groped them on the set.",
      "Depardieu has denied assaulting the women. But in his testimony Tuesday in a packed Paris court, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with one of the plaintiffs, a 54-year-old set dresser, and grabbed her hips during an on-set argument about the artistic merits of a painting.",
      "Depardieu said he'd been in a \u201cbad mood\" because the set was hot, which was hard for him because he is overweight.",
      "\u201cI understand perfectly if she\u2019s a bit upset,\u201d he said in his gruff, deep voice so familiar to cinemagoers. \u201cI don\u2019t have to talk like that, get angry like that, voil\u00e0.\"",
      "But he insisted that he isn't a sexual predator, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t touch women\u2019s butts.\u201d",
      "He recognized that the woman may have felt \u201csuffocated\u201d by his behavior, which he described as a \"type of aggression.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut certainly not sexual. Non!\u201d he exclaimed, raising his voice.",
      "The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted. The verdict isn't expected immediately after the trial.",
      "After Depardieu spoke first for more than an hour, the set dresser then testified. She described the alleged assault in detail, saying the actor pincered her between his legs as she squeezed past him in a narrow corridor.",
      "She said he grabbed her hips then started \u201cpalpating\u201d her behind and \"in front, around.\u201d She ran her hands near her buttocks, hips and pubic area to show what she allegedly experienced. She said he then reached for and grabbed her chest.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s when I had a reflex of \u2018My God.' I tried to free myself, I tried to take his hands away, I couldn\u2019t do it,\" she testified. \u201cHe terrified me, he laughed, he looked like a madman.\"",
      "\u201cIt was very brief, there was no shouting,\u201d she said, adding that she'd been too \u201cpetrified\u201d to speak and that he was too strong for her to break free. She said someone came and removed Depardieu\u2019s hands from her.",
      "\u201cI saw in his eyes a pleasure in frightening me, that\u2019s what I felt, it's savagery,\u201d she said. \"He terrified me, and that amused him.\u201d",
      "The woman also testified that Depardieu used an obscene expression to ask her to touch his penis and suggested he wanted to rape her. She told the court that the actor's calm and cooperative attitude during the trial bore no resemblance to his behavior at work.",
      "\u201cHere, he\u2019s exemplary, he doesn\u2019t move, he\u2019s quiet, he doesn\u2019t make any noise,\" she said. \u201cHe\u2019s not like that on the film set: He gesticulates, he grunts, he makes remarks to women.\"",
      "On the movie set, \u201che started saying sexual things, talking about his sexual capabilities,\u201d she said.",
      "The second plaintiff, a 34-year-old who worked as an assistant on the film, is yet to testify.",
      "Because of Depardieu\u2019s fame and impact on the French movie industry, his trial is seen as an important test of French willingness to confront sexual violence and hold influential men accountable.",
      "His long and storied career \u2014 he told the court that he's made more than 250 films \u2014 has turned him into a French movie giant. He was Oscar-nominated in 1991 for his performance as swordsman and poet Cyrano de Bergerac. French President Emmanuel Macron has included himself among Depardieu's many admirers, calling him a \u201cgreat actor\u201d who \"makes France proud.\u201d That was in 2023, when the star was already facing sexual misconduct allegations.",
      "In his testimony, Depardieu said work has dried up as accusations have mounted. Since 2022, he's not had a big-screen lead role.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s horrible what they\u2019re doing to me, calling me a \u2018big pig\u2019! I haven\u2019t worked for three years,\u201d he said.",
      "He also has health issues. The actor has undergone a quadruple heart bypass and has diabetes, according to his lawyer. A court-appointed medical expert determined that he\u2019s fit to stand trial, but recommended that the hearings don\u2019t exceed six hours, with regular breaks.",
      "The trial represents another reckoning for France and its attitudes to sexual violence, coming in the wake of the historic case last year involving Gis\u00e8le Pelicot. She became a feminist icon when she bravely demanded that the drugging-and-rape trial for 51 men tried for horrific abuse on her be held in open court, arguing that doing so would make shame change sides.",
      "Depardieu said he apologized to the set dresser three days after the alleged assault. He said he recognized that she was in \u201cshock\u201d and \u201cpetrified.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, this is not what I wanted,\u201d he said.",
      "He acknowledged to the court that his behavior can be boorish.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always been told I have a Russian nature, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because of the drinking or the vulgarity,\u201d he said. \u201cI have said in black and white that I am a disgusting slob.\"",
      "But he said he \u201cnever, ever\u201d would have pincered a woman between his legs against her will.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not like that,\" he said.",

      "Bolsonaro was charged in February by the country\u2019s prosecutor-general with attempting a coup to remain in office after his 2022 election defeat. The indictment was based on a police investigation and accused Bolsonaro of five crimes.",
      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet said Bolsonaro led a criminal organization that had been active since at least 2021, spreading false claims about Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system.",
      "Gonet said Bolsonaro supported a plot to overturn the election results after his narrow defeat. The plan allegedly included poisoning his successor, Lula, and killing Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of Bolsonaro. The indictment alleges Bolsonaro was aware of the plan and approved it.",
      "Thirty-three others with ties to Bolsonaro have also been charged.",
      "A Supreme Court panel will decide Tuesday whether to accept or dismiss the indictment against Bolsonaro.",
      "If the panel determines there is enough evidence to suggest the accused committed the alleged crimes, a criminal prosecution will begin. The justices may also dismiss the indictment, though that is considered unlikely.",
      "If the Supreme Court panel accepts the indictment, Bolsonaro will become a defendant in a criminal case. At this stage, justices may collect new evidence, hold hearings and interrogate defendants. Prosecutors and defense attorneys will then present their final arguments before the court rules on whether to acquit or convict.",
      "If convicted, Bolsonaro could face years in prison. Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction alone carries a sentence of up to 12 years, but combined with the other charges, he could face decades behind bars.",
      "Bolsonaro, who has already been banned from running for office until 2030 for abuse of power and undermining confidence in the country\u2019s voting system, has denied wrongdoing and claims he is the target of political persecution.",
      "Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and said he is a victim of political persecution. On Thursday, he rejected the accusations during a live YouTube broadcast alongside one of his lawyers, Paulo Cunha Bueno.",

      "Although U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 forces from neighboring Rwanda supporting the rebels in Congo, Nangaa asserted that the rebel alliance is independent and seeks to address \u201cthe root cause of more than 30 years of instability in our country.\u201d",

      "A panel of Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court justices will gather to determine whether former President Jair Bolsonaro and several of his associates will stand trial on five counts including attempting to stage a coup",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- A panel of Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court justices will gather on Tuesday to determine whether former President Jair Bolsonaro and close allies will stand trial on five counts, including attempting to stage a coup.",
      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet charged Bolsonaro last month with plotting a coup after he lost the 2022 election to his opponent and current President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Part of that plan allegedly included poisoning Lula and killing Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, a foe of Bolsonaro.",
      "Five Supreme Court justices \u2014 including de Moraes, the rapporteur \u2014 will meet from 9:30 a.m. local time in Brasilia to rule on the charges leveled by Gonet. If a majority votes in favor, the accused will become defendants in a criminal case.",
      "Bolsonaro and his alleged accomplices also stand accused of participating in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage qualified by violence and a serious threat against the state\u2019s assets, and deterioration of listed heritage.",
      "Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and says that he's being politically persecuted.",
      "Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction alone carries a sentence of up to 12 years, but combined with the other charges, he could be sentenced to decades behind bars.",
      "Observers say that it's likely that the charges will be accepted.",
      "\u201cThere is no shadow of a doubt that there are very clear elements\u201d that crimes were committed, said Thiago Bottino, a law professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a think tank and university. \u201cThe current tendency is that there will be a criminal trial.\u201d",
      "Gonet filed charges against a total of 34 people in February. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will analyze whether to accept charges against eight of them. As well as Bolsonaro, the court will vote on the accusations faced by former Defense Ministers Walter Braga Netto and Paulo S\u00e9rgio Nogueira and ex-Justice Minister Anderson Torres, among others. The court will decide on the others' fates later on.",
      "Bolsonaro has sought to shore up political support before the possible trial, including by holding a protest on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro on March 16.",
      "Local media reported that around 18,000 people attended the rally, based on figures from a monitoring project linked to the University of Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro\u2019s allies had hoped to draw a crowd of 1 million, which led some analysts to say that his ability to mobilize voters is diminishing.",
      "Bolsonaro called on social media Sunday for a new demonstration on April 6, to be held on one of Sao Paulo\u2019s main arteries, Avenida Paulista.",
      "As with the protest earlier this month, the former president and his allies will push for Congress to grant amnesty to those in jail for their roles in the Jan. 8, 2023 riot, when Bolsonaro\u2019s die-hard fans stormed and trashed the Supreme Court, Presidential Palace and Congress a week after Lula took office.",
      "In his indictment of Bolsonaro and others linked to him, Gonet said that the rampage was a last-ditch attempt to hold onto power.",
      "Bolsonaro, a former military officer who was known to express nostalgia for the country\u2019s 1964-1985 dictatorship, openly defied Brazil\u2019s judicial system during his 2019-2022 term in office.",
      "He has already been banned by Brazil\u2019s top electoral court from running in elections until 2030 over abuse of power while in office and casting unfounded doubts on the country\u2019s electronic voting system.",

      "A media workers union says Turkish authorities detained several journalists from their homes amid escalating protests triggered by the imprisonment of a top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "ISTANBUL -- Turkish authorities detained several journalists from their homes, a media workers\u2019 union reported Monday, in what it said was a crackdown amid escalating protests triggered by the imprisonment of the mayor of Istanbul and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "On Sunday, a court formally arrested Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu and ordered him jailed pending a trial on corruption charges. His detention on Wednesday sparked the largest wave of street demonstrations in Turkey in more than a decade and deepened concerns over democracy and the rule of law in the country.",
      "In an apparent escalation of the government\u2019s response to the growing protests, the Disk-Basin-Is union said at least eight reporters and photojournalists were detained in what it said was an \u201cattack on press freedoms and the people\u2019s right to learn the truth.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou cannot hide the truth by silencing journalists!\u201d the union wrote on the social media platform X, calling for their immediate release.",
      "There was no immediate comment from the authorities concerning the detentions.",
      "The mayor\u2019s imprisonment is widely regarded as a political move to remove a major challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials strongly reject the accusations and insist that Turkey\u2019s courts operate independently.",
      "Imamoglu was jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organization, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging \u2014 accusations he has denied. A request for him to be imprisoned on terror-related charges was rejected although he still faces prosecution.",
      "The Interior Ministry later announced that Imamoglu had been suspended from duty as a \u201ctemporary measure.\u201d The municipality had previously appointed an acting mayor from its governing council.",
      "The politician was taken to Silivri prison, west of Istanbul, as more than 1.7 million members of his opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, held a primary election, endorsing him as its presidential candidate. Millions of non-members also cast votes in a \u201csolidarity ballot,\u201d the party said.",
      "Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people were also jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul, one of whom was replaced with a government appointee. A further 44 suspects were released under judicial control.",
      "Imamoglu was elected mayor of Turkey\u2019s largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and the president\u2019s Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul for a quarter-century. Erdogan\u2019s party pushed to void the municipal election results in the city of 16 million, alleging irregularities.",
      "The challenge resulted in a repeat of the election a few months later, which Imamoglu also won.",
      "The mayor retained his seat following local elections last year, during which the CHP made significant gains against Erdogan\u2019s governing party.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippine defense chief on Monday called China's expansive claims in the South China Sea as \u201cthe biggest fiction and lie\u201d that no Southeast Asian country would accept and said that Chinese President Xi Jinping's aggressive policies have undermined the international goodwill fostered by his predecessors.",
      "Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro fired off his latest tirade against China\u2019s increasingly assertive actions in the region on the same day that the Philippine coast guard separately reported new incidents involving Chinese forces in the Scarborough Shoal, a hotly disputed fishing atoll in the disputed waterway.",
      "A Chinese military helicopter appeared to have tailed, but didn't closely approach a Philippine lightplane undertaking a routine patrol on Monday over Scarborough. Chinese forces have separately installed a new floating barrier to prevent Filipino fishermen from entering a lagoon in the shoal, which lies off the northwestern Philippines, Philippine coast guard Commodore Jay Tarriela told an online news briefing.",
      "There was no immediate comment from Chinese officials, but in the past, they have repeatedly asserted that Beijing has had sovereign control over the Scarborough Shoal and most of the South China Sea since ancient times.",
      "An international arbitration panel invalidated China\u2019s expansive claims in a 2016 ruling based on the 1982 U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea, but Beijing refused to participate in the Philippines-initiated arbitration and continues to defy the decision.",
      "In a speech marking the anniversary of the Philippine military\u2019s Western Command on Palawan province, which faces the South China Sea, Teodoro underscored the need for a \u201cstronger national defense posture\u201d and continued security engagement with allied countries to address the threat posed by Chinese aggression in the waterway, a key global trade route.",
      "\"No ASEAN country accepts the legitimacy of that 10-dash line, because that is the biggest fiction and lie that can be sold to any right-thinking person,\u201d Teodoro told Filipino forces.",
      "He was referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation regional bloc that has been negotiating a nonaggression pact called the \u201ccode of conduct\u201d with China to prevent the territorial conflicts from spiraling out of control.",
      "ASEAN state members the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have been involved in the long-simmering territorial standoffs in the South China Sea. Taiwan also lays a claim similar to that of China, which has demarcated the extent of its declared territory with 10 linear dashes on Chinese maps.",
      "Teodoro said that Xi runs a \u201csmall dictatorship and autocracy\u201d and that his \u201cclique\u201d in the Chinese Communist Party is to blame for what the defense chief called Beijing\u2019s aggressive and illegal policies, not Xi's predecessors or the Chinese people.",
      "\"It\u2019s caused by Xi Jinping and his abusive ways \u2026 that would possibly destroy his leadership of his party in China and the goodwill that was nurtured by his predecessors,\u201d Teodoro told reporters.",
      "China\u2019s aggressive actions in the disputed waters have prompted the Philippines to build stronger security alliances with friendly countries, Teodoro said.",
      "The Philippines, he said, would sign a visiting forces agreement with New Zealand next month to allow their forces to enter each other\u2019s territory for joint military exercises. Negotiations have reached the final stage for a similar agreement with Canada, he said.",
      "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has authorized the start of negotiations for such an agreement with France, Teodoro said.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is due to meet with Teodoro on Friday in Manila for talks that Philippine officials said would spotlight concerns over China\u2019s assertive actions in the contested waters and ways to strengthen the decades-long U.S.-Philippines treaty alliance.",

      "Kroger said even after lower courts ruled, it believed the merger still had a chance of going through. Kroger said it told Albertsons it was planning to re-engage with the FTC after President Donald Trump's election because it thought the FTC under Trump would be less hostile to mergers.",
      "But instead, Albertsons filed a lawsuit against Kroger the day after the lower court rulings. Albertsons said Kroger refused to divest more stores, even as it became clear that regulators weren't satisfied with its plans. Albertsons said Kroger also should have sought other buyers beyond C&S to satisfy regulators' concerns.",

      "POINT ROBERTS, Wash. -- In the northwest corner of Washington state lies a quirky U.S. exclave so dependent on Canada\u2019s goodwill that the strain of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war is inescapable \u2014 in the sole grocery store, at any of the three eateries, and for the many residents who never voted for him.",
      "Locals and visitors alike in Point Roberts, Washington, are increasingly worried about how this unusual waterfront border town that has embodied the two countries\u2019 interdependency can survive the hostility brewing on both sides.",
      "\u201cThis was really devastating,\u201d said Tamra Hansen, a longtime Point Roberts resident and business owner whose eyes welled with tears as she described her two restaurants on the brink. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the support from the Canadians, this town will die.\u201d",
      "Known as a geographic oddity since the boundary with Canada was drawn in 1846, this detached 5-square-mile community \u2014 called an exclave because it\u2019s completely separated from mainland America \u2014 is surrounded by water on three sides. Its only land connection is to Canada and it takes one border crossing and about 25 miles north by car to get to downtown Vancouver, B.C.; or two border crossings and about 25 miles through Canada to re-enter the United States along Boundary Bay.",
      "The beaches, marina, golf course and hiking trails have long made Point Roberts a cherished getaway destination, but today locals say business has never been worse. Canadian visitors are staying away and some American residents say they\u2019ve even been harassed over their nationality.",
      "Point Roberts Fire Chief Christopher Carleton said Point Roberts is one the last remaining untouched natural gems of the United States, but the tight-knit community with no stop lights is now under threat by politicians who know nothing about their way of life.",
      "\u201cWe need to take care of one another and have grace for one another and not allow people who don\u2019t even know we exist to disrupt the relationships we currently have,\u201d said Carleton, whose firefighters mostly live across the border.",
      "Tensions between the U.S. and Canada have spiked to a level not seen before in modern times thanks to Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again threat over the past two months to place taxes on a long list of goods going across the border. In response, Canada has promised retaliatory tariffs.",
      "For a population that has famously prided itself on being nice, polite and loyal allies, Canadians aren\u2019t hiding their disgust for Trump\u2019s polarizing rhetoric, especially taking offense with the U.S. president\u2019s claim that Canada could be the \u201c 51st state.\u201d",
      "Mark Nykolaichuk said he refuses to go to the mainland U.S. but describes Point Roberts as a unique exception because the border here has never felt like an actual divide for Canadians like him who grew up visiting.",
      "Most of the property owners here are from Canada, and many of the 1,000 year-round residents have dual citizenship. Once a booming fishing town, the leading industry now, according to U.S. Census data, is retail \u2014 primarily driven from tourism because of the number of vacation properties. The unincorporated Whatcom County community is now mostly home to retirees, though this year there are seven students \u2014 nicknamed \u201cThe Borderites\" \u2014 at the lone public school.",
      "Nykolaichuk, who lives in the Vancouver, B.C. area, said he hopes he can help keep the Point Roberts International Marketplace open by shopping there, given that management reports business is down 20% to 30%. He depends on Point Roberts\u2019 only grocery store to be able to cook at his vacation home because U.S. customs doesn\u2019t permit raw meat to enter its borders, for example, so he must buy it in town.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to see this place shut down,\u201d Nykolaichuk said. \u201cIf this place goes, where are the U.S. citizens going to eat? Where are they going to get their food from?\u201d",
      "Many in Point Roberts don\u2019t blame the Canadians for their disdain over Trump\u2019s perceived sovereignty threat. Instead, there\u2019s a deep sadness for both sides.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve always gotten along and it\u2019s just nonsensical because now the U.S. is going to suffer too,\u201d said Hansen, who is a dual citizen. \u201cI definitely feel for the Canadian people at this time because they\u2019ve got their backs against the wall, really, and they have to retaliate.\u201d",
      "Like many locals, Larry Musselwhite, owner of Larry\u2019s Liquor Locker, is angry at Trump and blames the president for Point Roberts\u2019 economic problems. The 75-year-old said he can\u2019t even think about retiring right now because of the economy. His liquor store was down 40% in sales last month.",
      "\u201cThis is because of our elected president, who really doesn\u2019t care about the common man and the struggles that we have to go through,\u201d Musselwhite said. \u201cIt greatly affects how I live my life.\u201d",
      "About 75% of the Point Roberts precinct voted for a presidential candidate other than Trump, which is a higher percentage than across Whatcom County as well as the statewide turnout, according to the 2024 election results.",
      "Locals say one of the most frustrating things about the tit-for-tat is the way that the tariffs have abruptly started and stopped, creating an unsteady flow of changes to customs. The whiplash for residents who often cross the border multiple times a day leaves them unsure whether or when they\u2019ll be surprised with a new penalty.",
      "This fear over unexpected tariff fees has made people cautious about buying things in Point Roberts \u2014 if they\u2019re coming into town at all.",
      "Hugh Wilson, a real estate agent who also manages several local Airbnb listings, said properties have seen more cancellations than bookings lately.",
      "\u201cNobody is sure of the rules at any one day here,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThe border agents do the best they can to stay up to date and they relay that to us as normal people crossing the border.\u201d",
      "With no end in sight, there\u2019s also a high-stakes fear that the dispute could escalate with Canada possibly imposing tariffs on the water and electricity that it supplies to Point Roberts, or even turning off the utilities altogether.",
      "\u201cIf it gets more brutal, they can cut off the water just like that, or the power,\u201d said Brian Calder, a fourth-generation resident who was previously the president of the Point Roberts Chamber of Commerce. \u201cAnd it just depends how much more confrontation is fomented by Trump\u2019s office.\u201d",
      "Calder said he and other town leaders are trying to plead for help with the British Columbia premier and the governor of Washington state. He said the local Whatcom County leadership has all but abandoned this far-away community in a time of crisis.",
      "Jed Holmes, a spokesman for the county, said they are communicating with Washington state's congressional delegation in D.C. to address the rapid deterioration in U.S.-Canada relations that has especially affected Point Roberts.",
      "\u201cI understand that folks want us to do more, but it\u2019s really challenging to identify what meaningful things a county government can do to change this dynamic at the international level,\u201d Holmes said in an email.",
      "For Hansen, she\u2019s asking herself how much more can she afford to lose personally while running the Saltwater Cafe breakfast spot and a restaurant called The Pier. She has 15 employees to pay but business was down 55% in February compared with last year. There have been times when her pub doesn\u2019t even net $100 a day.",
      "\u201cThere are some businesses that are going out of business right now as we speak,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cIt\u2019s very emotional for me because I care about everybody that lives here.\u201d",

      "This year, scammers might take particular advantage of uncertainty stemming from recent workforce cuts impacting thousands of jobs at the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. These layoffs and the potential for even more widespread reductions also raise questions about resources, including the IRS's bandwidth to respond to scams reported by consumers.",

As a result, malicious websites or predatory social media campaigns may not be taken down as quickly \u2014 and victims of fraudulent returns could have to wait longer for answers.",
      "\u201cThere is potential for reduced oversight,\u201d said Chris Pierson, chief executive of cybersecurity firm BlackCloak. \u201cIf you have less individuals to be proactive within an agency that is housing, I mean, an amazing treasure trove of data and information \u2014 that obviously is concerning ... (and could) create a riskier environment for the consumer.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment, the IRS pointed to its \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d list of common tax scams to watch out for this year, among other steps taxpayers can take to protect themselves from identity theft and fraud. But the agency did not immediately comment on whether recent or future workforce cuts would impact its enforcement resources.",
      "Scams are also becoming more sophisticated, most recently thanks to the rising adoption of generative artificial intelligence. Experts warn that this technology is being used create \u201chyper-realistic\u201d phishing messages, including video or audio deepfakes, and can allow scammers to target more people at once through automation.",
      "Pierson also warns of the fallout from recent high-profile data breaches \u2014 including the National Public Data breach, which made headlines last year for reportedly leaking a massive amount of sensitive information on the dark web, including full names, social security numbers, contact information and mailing addresses. Having that information out there could lead to more fraudulent filings, he explains, or \u201cconfidence scams\" \u2014 where cyber criminals share one piece of information they have, like an address, to get people to trust them and share more.",
      "File as soon as you can.",
      "Nobody is eager to sit down and do their taxes, but getting it out of the way early \u2014 and before any scammers potentially try to file something in your name \u2014 makes a huge difference, Chronister explains. He adds that taxpayers can play it safe by sticking to what they know.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve always been using TurboTax, use TurboTax. If you always use an accountant, use your accountant,\" Chronister said. He notes that you should also keep your information safe by password-protecting any past filings downloaded to your device and using a VPN when on public Wi-Fi.",
      "The IRS also suggests setting up an identity protection PIN, a six-digit number that can help protect you from someone else filing in your name. You can also freeze your credit \u2014 which experts recommend as an added line of defense against future identity theft and fraud, even if you haven't been scammed. Freezing your credit prevents any new credit accounts from being created in your name. And you can always temporarily \u201cunfreeze\u201d if a check is needed to rent an apartment or apply for a loan. Credit freezes can be set up through three nationwide credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.",
      "And, again, remember that the IRS won't randomly contact you by email, text or phone. When in doubt, go to the official IRS website and reach out directly.",
      "Avoiding scams can also come down to pausing before you click or act on anything. \u201cTake a breath, count to 10 and then go, \u2018OK ... is this too good to be true?'\" Chronister sad. \"'Is my gut telling me something is off?'\u201d",
      "Chronister adds that social engineering is about emotion, not intelligence \u2014 and anyone can fall for it.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s human to fall for these (scams),\" he said. \"They\u2019ve been here since the beginning of mankind ... So you have to stay vigilant, but don\u2019t panic. Just keep your gut check going.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Heathrow executives are defending their response to a fire that shut down Europe\u2019s busiest air hub for almost a day",
      "LONDON -- Heathrow Airport executives on Monday defended their response to a fire that shut down Europe\u2019s busiest air hub for almost a day, after Britain's energy system operator suggested that the facility had enough electricity from other sources to keep running.",
      "More than 1,300 flights were canceled on Friday after a fire knocked out one of the three electrical substations that supply Heathrow with power. More than 200,000 passengers had journeys disrupted, and industry experts say the chaos will cost airlines tens of millions of dollars.",
      "The airport reopened after about 18 hours when Heathrow had reconfigured its power supply \u2014 something Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said that \"required hundreds of systems to be safely powered down and then safely powered up with extensive testing.\"",
      "Heathrow said that it ran a full schedule on Saturday and Sunday, with 400,000 passengers passing through on 2,500 weekend flights.",
      "The fire's huge impact raised concern about the resilience of Britain\u2019s energy system to accidents, natural disasters or attacks. The government has ordered an investigation into \u201cany wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Counterterrorism police initially led the investigation into the fire, which came as authorities across Europe gird against sabotage backed by Russia. The head of Britain\u2019s MI6 spy agency has accused Moscow of mounting a \u201cstaggeringly reckless\u201d sabotage campaign against allies of Ukraine, which has been trying to repel Russia's full-scale invasion for more than three years.",
      "Police say they have found \u201cno indication of any foul play,\u201d and the London Fire Brigade said that it's leading the investigation, which is focused on the substation\u2019s electrical distribution equipment.",
      "Gareth Bacon, the transport spokesman of the opposition Conservative Party, said that \"malicious actors ... will undoubtedly have taken note of this weekend\u2019s events.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis episode underlines the urgent need to ensure that our critical infrastructure is safeguarded against both accidental incident and deliberate acts of sabotage by malign actors,\u201d he said in the House of Commons.",
      "Meanwhile, the utility company and airport executives are trading blame.",
      "John Pettigrew, chief executive of energy-supply network National Grid, told the Financial Times that \u201ceach substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow\u201d for the airport to stay open.",
      "\u201cLosing a substation is a unique event \u2014 but there were two others available,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that is a level of resilience.\u201d",
      "Heathrow said it had worked to reopen \u201cas soon as safely and practically possible.\u201d",
      "\u201cHundreds of critical systems across the airport were required to be safely powered down and then safely and systematically rebooted,\u201d the airport said in a statement. \u201cGiven Heathrow\u2019s size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge.\u201d",
      "Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye is also facing questions about why he put the airport\u2019s chief operating officer, Javier Echave, in charge of decision-making as the fire raged early Friday.",
      "Alexander declined to back Heathrow management\u2019s decision-making, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have all the information that they had available when they made the decision.\u201d",
      "\u201cSafety should always be paramount, but, as I say, it was not my decision,\u201d she told the BBC.",

      "Since the 2023 Maui fires that destroyed Lahaina, communities across Hawaii have sought ways to protect themselves from more destructive fires wrought by decades of climate change, urban development, and detrimental land use policies",
      "KULA, Hawaii -- The car tires, propane tanks, gas generators and rusty appliances heaped on the side of a dirt road waiting to be hauled away filled Desiree Graham with relief.",
      "\u201cThat means all that stuff is not in people\u2019s yards,\" she said on a blustery July day in Kahikinui, a remote Native Hawaiian homestead community in southeast Maui where wildfire is a top concern.",
      "In June, neighbors and volunteers spent four weekends clearing rubbish from their properties in a community-wide effort to create \u201cdefensible space,\u201d or areas around homes free of ignitable vegetation and debris. They purged 12 tons of waste.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s ugly, but it\u2019s pretty beautiful to me,\u201d said Graham, a member of Kahikinui's Firewise committee, part of a rapidly growing program from the nonprofit National Fire Protection Association that helps residents assess their communities' fire risk and create plans to mitigate it.",
      "Kahikinui is one of dozens of Hawaii communities seeking ways to protect themselves as decades of climate change, urban development, and detrimental land use policies culminate to cause more destructive fires.",
      "The state has 250,000 acres of unmanaged fallow agricultural land, nearly all of its buildings sit within the wildland-urban interface, and two-thirds of communities have only one road in and out.",
      "But experts say that even with so many factors out of communities\u2019 control, they can vastly improve their resilience \u2014 by transforming their own neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cFire is not like other natural hazards, it can only move where there is fuel, and we have a lot of say in that,\u201d said Nani Barretto, co-executive director of the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization (HWMO), a 25-year-old nonprofit at the forefront of the state\u2019s fire-risk mitigation.",
      "Neighborhoods all over the United States are wrestling with the same challenge, some in places that never worried about fire before. A recent Headwaters Economics analysis found 1,100 communities in 32 states shared similar risk profiles to places recently devastated by urban wildfires.",
      "HWMO helps communities like Kahikinui become Firewise. In the 10 years preceding the August 2023 Maui fires that destroyed Lahaina, 15 Hawaii communities joined Firewise USA. Since then, the number has more than doubled to 31, with a dozen more in the process of joining.",
      "\u201cEveryone was like, \u2019My God, what can we do?'\u201d said Shelly Aina, former chair of the Firewise committee for Waikoloa Village, an 8,000-resident community on the west side of the Big Island, recalling the months after the Maui fires.",
      "The development \u2014 heavily wind exposed, surrounded by dry invasive grasses and with just one main road in and out \u2014 had already experienced several close calls in the last two decades. It was first recognized as Firewise in 2016.",
      "As HWMO-trained home assessors, Shelly and her husband Dana Aina have done over 60 free assessments for neighbors since 2022, evaluating their properties for ignition vulnerabilities. Volunteers removed kiawe trees last year along a fuel break bordering houses. Residents approved an extra HOA fee for vegetation removal on interior lots.",
      "Measures like these can have outsized impact as people in fire-prone states adapt to more extreme wildfires, according to Dr. Jack Cohen, a retired U.S. Forest Service scientist.",
      "\u201cThe solution is in the community, not out there with the fire breaks, because those don\u2019t stop the fire in extreme conditions,\u201d said Cohen.",
      "Direct flames from a wildfire aren\u2019t what typically initiate an urban conflagration, he said. Wind-blown embers can travel miles away from a fire, landing on combustible material like dry vegetation, or accumulating in corners like where a deck meets siding.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re urban fires, not wildfires,\u201d said Cohen.",
      "The solutions don't always require expensive retrofits like a whole new roof, but targeting the specific places within 100 feet of the house where embers could ignite material. In dense neighborhoods, that requires residents work together, making community-wide efforts like Firewise important. \u201cThe house is only as ignition resistant as its neighbors,\u201d said Cohen.",
      "Even with renewed interest in fire resilience, community leaders face challenges in mobilizing their neighbors. Mitigation can take money, time and sacrifice. It\u2019s not enough to cut the grass once, for example, vegetation has to be regularly maintained. Complacency sets in. Measures like removing hazardous trees can cost thousands of dollars.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how we deal with that, because those who have them can\u2019t afford to take them down,\u201d said Shelly Aina. The Ainas try offering low-cost measures, like installing metal screening behind vents and crawl spaces to keep out embers.",
      "HWMO helps with costs where it can. It gave Kahikinui a $5,000 grant for a dumpster service to haul out its waste, and helped Waikoloa Village rent a chipper for the trees it removed. It\u2019s been hard to keep up with the need, said Barretto, but even just a little bit of financial assistance can have an exponential impact.",
      "\u201cYou give them money, they rally,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can give them $1,000 and it turns into 1,000 man hours of doing the clearing.\u201d HWMO was able to expand its grant program after the Maui fires with donations from organizations like the Bezos Earth Fund and the American Red Cross.",
      "At a time when federal funding for climate mitigation is uncertain, communities need far more financial support to transform their neighborhoods, said Headwaters Economics' Kimi Barrett, who studies the costs of increasing fire risk. \u201cIf what we\u2019re trying to do is save people and communities, then we must significantly invest in people and communities,\u201d said Barrett.",
      "Those investments are just a fraction of the billions of dollars in losses sustained after megafires, said Barrett. A recent study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Allstate found that $1 in resilience and preparation investment can save $13 in economic and property losses after a disaster.",
      "Another hurdle is asking residents to do work and make sacrifices as they watch others neglect their role. \u201cThe neighbors will ask, \u2018What about the county land?' There\u2019s no routine maintenance,\u2019\u201d said Shelly Aina.",
      "Her husband Dana Aina said he reminds people that it is everyone\u2019s kuleana, or responsibility, to take care of land and people. \u201cAn island is a canoe, a canoe is an island,\u201d he said, quoting a Hawaiian proverb. \u201cWe all have to paddle together.\u201d",
      "Bigger stakeholders are starting to make changes. Among them, Hawaii passed legislation to create a state fire marshal post, and its main utility, Hawaiian Electric, is undergrounding some power lines and installing AI-enabled cameras to detect ignitions earlier.",
      "Meanwhile, Firewise communities have found that doing their own mitigation gives them more clout when asking for funding or for others to do their part.",
      "After the 66-residence community of Kawaihae Village on Hawaii Island joined Firewise, they were finally able to get a neighboring private landowner and the state to create fuel breaks and clear grasses.",
      "\u201cWithout that we wouldn\u2019t have been on anyone\u2019s radar,\u201d said Brenda DuFresne, committee member of Kawaihae Firewise. \u201cI think Firewise is a way to show people that you\u2019re willing to help yourself.\u201d",

      "The penalties awarded include $65 million in compensatory damages and $2 billion in punitive damages, law firms Arnold & Itkin LLP and Kline & Specter PC said in a statement. That marks one of the largest legal settlements reached in a Roundup-related case to date.",
      "Plaintiff John Barnes filed his lawsuit against Monsanto in 2021, seeking damages related to his non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Arnold & Itkin attorney Kyle Findley, the lead trial lawyer on the case, said the verdict will help put his client in a better position to get the treatment he needs going forward.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a long road for him ... and he was happy that the truth related to the product (has) been exposed,\u201d Findley told The Associated Press on Sunday. He called the verdict an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d after \"another example of Monsanto\u2019s refusal to accept responsibility for poisoning people with this toxic product.\u201d",
      "Germany-based Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in 2018, has continued to dispute claims that Roundup causes cancer. But the company has been hit with more than 177,000 lawsuits involving the weedkiller and set aside $16 billion to settle cases.",
      "In a statement, Monsanto said Friday's verdict \u201cconflicts with the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence and the consensus of regulatory bodies and their scientific assessments worldwide.\u201d The company added that it continues \u201cto stand fully behind the safety\u201d of Roundup products.",
      "For a variety of crops \u2014 including corn, soybeans and cotton \u2014 Roundup is designed to work with genetically modified seeds that resist the weedkiller\u2019s deadly effect. It allows farmers to produce more while conserving the soil by tilling it less.",
      "Some studies associate Roundup\u2019s key ingredient, glyphosate, with cancer, although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has said it is not likely to be carcinogenic to humans when used as directed. Still, numerous lawsuits over the weedkiller allege glyphosate does cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma, arguing that Monsanto has failed to warn the public about serious risks for years.",
      "Findley said that evidence relating to Barnes' case show \u201cmany years of cover-ups\" and \u201cbackroom dealings.\u201d He accused Monsanto of ignoring several scientific studies related to the toxicity of Roundup and said the company \u201ctried to find ways to persuade and distract and deny the connection between this product and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.\u201d",
      "Friday's decision marks the fourth Roundup-related verdict that Findley's team has won to date \u2014 the largest of which was awarded in Philadelphia in January 2024, with damages totaling $2.25 billion. And he said his law firm has \u201cmany more clients who are similarly situated as Mr. Barnes.\u201d",
      "Monsanto, meanwhile, also maintains that it \u201cremains committed to trying cases\u201d \u2014 and argues its wider record of Roundup-related litigation continues to reinforce the safety of its products. The company said it has prevailed in 17 of the last 25 related trials, while some previous damage awards have been reduced.",
      "Bayer has recently renewed and expanded an effort across a handful of U.S. states to protect pesticide companies from claims they failed to warn that a product causes cancer, if labeling otherwise complies with EPA regulations. The company and other industry supports argue that litigation costs are unstainable and could impact Roundup\u2019s future availability. But opponents stress that such legislation would limit accountability.",

      "He said he had heard nothing about any protests at the auto show, but said there was a \u201cfair amount of emotion\u201d surrounding Tesla.",
      "\u201cThe last thing you want (for) one of your organizations is for there to be some vandalism or some physical confrontation. So, I think they made the right decision,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cElon Musk is using his extraordinary wealth to basically corrupt democracy and do what he wants to do, and citizens, both in the United States, Canada, globally, need to push back on this,\u201d said McCutcheon.",
      "Last week, British Columbia Hydro banned Tesla products from its electric vehicle rebate program as part of the provincial government\u2019s move to give preference to Canadian goods and exclude U.S. ones from rebates if practical amid the ongoing Canada-U.S. trade war.",

      "Dozens of independent pharmacies have shuttered in Alabama over the last two years, according to the Alabama Independent Pharmacy Alliance. Pharmacists said that is because of financial pressures, in part, because it can often cost more to dispense a drug than they are reimbursed by pharmacy benefit managers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re losing almost one drugstore per week going out of business because they are paid such a small amount of money from the PBM industry to fill prescriptions for their patients at their drugstore,\u201d Sen. Billy Beasley, a Democratic senator and retired pharmacist, said.",
      "Alabama is one of several states considering new regulations on pharmacy benefit managers, the middlemen between health insurance companies, drug companies and pharmacies. The Alabama Senate voted 32-0 Thursday to advance legislation to require minimum reimbursement rates to community pharmacists. The bill now moves to the Alabama House of Representatives.",
      "Legislation seeking regulations on the benefit managers have also been proposed in Mississippi, Arkansas and other states. Both large retail chains and independent pharmacists have closed stores across the country as drugstores face reimbursement issues, rising costs and other challenges.",
      "Pharmacy benefit managers leverage purchasing power with drug companies with the goal of driving down drug costs for consumers. However, independent pharmacists say the business practices of benefit managers cause them to lose money on about 20% of prescriptions.",
      "\u201cThe biggest issue is we\u2019re not getting paid what it actually cost to fill a prescription, including labor,\u201d Trent McLemore, a pharmacist with Star Discount Pharmacy.",
      "The Alabama bill would require that PBMs reimburse community pharmacies at the Alabama Medicaid Agency reimbursement rate. It would also prohibit the practice of \u201cspread pricing\u201d where a benefits manager charges health plans more for drugs than they pay pharmacies.",
      "Groups opposed to the bill have said it would effectively put a new $10.64 fee on prescriptions under the requirement to match state Medicaid rates, which include a $10.64 dispensing fee. That fee, they argued, will eventually get passed down to consumers and businesses.",

      "Turkey's opposition party has urged supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan",
      "ISTANBUL -- The leader of Turkey\u2019s main opposition on Friday renewed a call on supporters to take to the streets for peaceful demonstrations against the arrest of Istanbul\u2019s mayor and top rival to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, even as authorities widened a ban on protests and criticized the appeal as irresponsible.",
      "Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was arrested in a dawn raid on his residence on Wednesday over alleged corruption and terror links, escalating a crackdown on opposition figures and dissenting voices. Several other prominent figures, including two district mayors, were also detained.",
      "Many view the arrest as a politically driven attempt to remove a popular opposition figure and key challenger to Erdogan from the next presidential race, currently scheduled for 2028. Government officials reject accusations that legal actions against opposition figures are politically motivated and insist that Turkey's courts operate independently.",
      "Cumhuriyet newspaper and other media reported that police began questioning Imamoglu on Friday afternoon. The mayor can be detained without charges for up to four days.",
      "Erdogan said that the government wouldn't tolerate street protests and accused the opposition party of being associated with corruption, marginal groups and terrorist organizations.",
      "\u201cWe see that an anti-corruption operation in Istanbul is being used as an excuse to stir unrest in our streets. I want it to be known that we will not allow a handful of opportunists to bring unrest to Turkey just to protect their plundering schemes,\u201d Erdogan said.",
      "\u201cPointing to the streets instead of courtrooms to defend theft, plunder, lawlessness and fraud is a grave irresponsibility,\u201d Erdogan said. \u201cJust as we have not surrendered to street terrorism until now, we will not bow to vandalism in the future either.\u201d",
      "Since Imamoglu\u2019s arrest, thousands of people have gathered at Istanbul\u2019s city hall for nighttime rallies, and clashes have erupted between demonstrators and police in Istanbul, Turkish capital Ankara and Turkey\u2019s third-largest city, Izmir.",
      "The most violent clash took place at Ankara\u2019s Middle East Technical University late Thursday, when police deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse the demonstration. Students said that rubber bullets were used, but the government has denied that.",
      "The Interior Ministry said that more than 50 people were detained, and 16 police officers were injured, following the protests.",
      "On Friday, authorities in Ankara and Izmir announced a five-day prohibition on demonstrations, following a similar ban imposed earlier by the Istanbul governor's office. The bans came after the country\u2019s justice minister acknowledged people\u2019s right to demonstrate, but said that street protests amid ongoing judicial investigations were unacceptable.",
      "Still, Ozgur Ozel, the chairman of the Republican People\u2019s Party, CHP, made a new appeal for people to gather and demonstrate.",
      "\u201cI invite tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and millions to peacefully demonstrate, express our democratic reaction, and exercise our constitutional rights,\u201d he said.",
      "Ozel said: \u201cTo those who say that calling people to the streets is irresponsible, I say this: We are not the ones filling these streets and squares. It is your lawlessness and injustices that have brought people out.\u201d",
      "Imamoglu\u2019s arrest came just days before he was expected to be nominated as the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party\u2019s presidential candidate in a primary on Sunday. Ozel has said that the primary, where around 1.5 million delegates can vote, will go ahead as planned.",
      "The CHP has also urged citizens to participate in a symbolic election on Sunday \u2014 through ballot boxes to be set up across Turkey \u2014 to show solidarity with Imamoglu.",
      "Analysts say Imamoglu could be removed from office and replaced by a \u201ctrustee mayor,\u201d if he is formally charged with links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, which is listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey and its Western allies.",
      "Meanwhile, Ozel announced that the CHP has decided to hold an extraordinary party congress on April 6, to thwart an alleged attempt by the authorities to appoint a \u201ctrustee chairman\u201d to lead the party. The decision came amid speculation that the authorities may be seeking to annul the party\u2019s last congress held in 2023 over alleged vote-buying and other irregularities, and appoint a handpicked leader.",
      "On Friday, the Borsa Istanbul's benchmark index dropped by around 7%, prompting temporary trading suspensions aimed at preventing panic-driven sell-offs.",

    "story": [
      "Several new bars dedicated to women\u2019s sports have made the mad dash to open in time to capitalize on March Madness, now in full swing",
      "PHOENIX -- When you walk into Title 9 Sports Grill in Phoenix's Melrose District, its mission to be a haven for watching women's sports permeates every nook and cranny. From the over dozen TVs mounted on pink and orange walls to the \u201cPlay Like a Girl!\u201d neon sign against a giant image of retired WNBA star Diana Taurasi.",
      "It's an impressive turnaround for co-owners Audrey Corley and Kat Moore. Just before Christmas, the space was still Moore and her husband Brad's hot dog restaurant. But last summer they sold the business and the new owners didn't want to stay in the property. That's when Corley, who owns a popular lesbian bar on the next block, proposed partnering on the city's first women's sports-centric bar. She had been mulling the idea since reading about the Sports Bra in Portland, Oregon, which opened in 2022, and then seeing a half-dozen similar bars emerge in the last year.",
      "\u201cThen I see, you know, another one popped up here and another one. And then I was like, it\u2019s just time. It has to be,\u201d Corley said before Title 9's grand opening earlier this month.",
      "Several new bars dedicated to women's sports have made the mad dash to open in time to capitalize on March Madness, now in full swing. From San Francisco to Cleveland, there will be more than a dozen across the country before the year is over. The femme-focused bar scene has made huge strides from three years ago when The Sports Bra was the only one. It comes during an exciting first year during which teams in the women's bracket will finally be paid for playing in the NCAA tourney. Many credit stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese for increasing the marketability of female players.",
      "Last season, Reese and Clark's teams never saw a dollar. Now, the women's teams will finally earn individual revenue, known as \u201cunits.\u201d A unit is money paid to conferences when one of its teams appears in the NCAA Tournament. Teams earn another with every game played.",
      "The most seamless part of transforming her old restaurant into Title 9 has been the built-in community anticipation of having a place to view women's sports, Moore said.",
      "\"The only question I\u2019ve gotten from quite a few men, especially when we first started telling people, was, \u2018Are men allowed?\u2019 Yeah!\u201d Moore said, with a chuckle.",
      "Named for the landmark 1972 law that forbids discrimination based on sex in education, including athletics, Title 9 is filled with tributes to female athletes, from framed photos with QR codes to a cocktail roster with drinks such as the Pat Summitt Sour and Taurasi Goat-Tail. However, the owners emphasize a family-friendly atmosphere where young girls can come celebrate after a school game.",
      "\u201cEven some of the little girls, they could come here and dream of being on the TV someday and actually getting paid for it,\u201d Corley said.",
      "Debra Hallum and Marlene du Plessis were also inspired by the Sports Bra. They made their targeted opening in Austin last week of 1972 ATX Women's Sports Pub across from the University of Texas campus. The day included a rainbow ribbon cutting and officials from the Austin LGBT Chamber of Commerce.",
      "While they are in a conservative state, the women have been emphasizing the bar\u2019s LGBTQ-friendliness.",
      "\u201cWe want to be very clear that we will be a very welcoming and inclusive space for all women sports fans,\u201d Hallum said. \u201cWe want to invite everyone to grow the interest and the viewership, because that\u2019s the only way we\u2019re going to fix that gap for women, including the pay gap.\u201d",
      "Neither woman has hospitality experience. Hallum has a corporate background and du Plessis' is in education. But, they researched running a business like this and hired a talented chef and staff. It's clear both are passionate.",
      "\u201cIt is so hard to find a bar or a pub that will show women\u2019s sports,\u201d du Plessis said. \u201cYou always have to call around, ask around to find where they going to show it. And then most of the time you know they will not have the sound on. And we will.\u201d",
      "They've been touched by the reactions from residents, even parents of boys.",
      "\u201cWe had a mom and dad, two daughters and their son show up and (the mom) was all about, 'This is exactly what we need,\u2019\u201d Hallum said. \u201cWe want our son to be raised knowing that this is just as great and just as wonderful as men\u2019s sports.\u201d",
      "In Denver, Annie Weaver and Miranda Spencer met playing on opposing flag football teams. A month later, they began drafting a business plan for a similar concept, also inspired by The Sports Bra. Open since December, the 99ers Sports Bar is now hosting its first March Madness crowds.",
      "They were first mulling a name that would play off of Mia Hamm, the 1990s soccer icon who inspired Weaver\u2019s Halloween costume for years. They settled on a name that honors the 1999 U.S. Women's World Cup soccer team, filled with names and faces that didn't get as much attention as Hamm.",
      "On a recent Sunday, the bar was standing room only as the TVs aired an NWSL game, Unrivaled semifinal games, and the Selection Sunday broadcast announcing the brackets for the NCAA Tournament.",
      "The city doesn\u2019t even have any women\u2019s teams in the major national leagues, but it was recently awarded the 16th NWSL expansion team, to begin play in 2026.",
      "A tri-fold bracket covered one table, and an impromptu friendship bracelet-making station occupied another.",
      "\u201cI wish I would have had this space growing up,\u201d Spencer said.",
      "These new bar operators agree this is not a trend but an indicator of a market that hasn't been served. But hopefully, anyone looking to open a women's sports bar isn't doing it \u201cjust to be trendy,\u201d said Moore, of Title 9.",
      "Corley's most important advice for any would-be barkeep: \"The same way you play sports for the love, open this up for the love.\u201d",

      "SUN VALLEY, Idaho -- Mikaela Shiffrin's flashbacks to her November crash in a giant slalom race are happening less and less when she's training.",
      "For her, as she deals with post-traumatic stress disorder in the discipline, that's major progress.",
      "While other racers compete in the GS on Tuesday at World Cup finals in Sun Valley, Shiffrin plans to squeeze in some training in the slalom. It will be the American standout's only event of the weeklong finals after not qualifying in giant slalom.",
      "The two-time Olympic champion revealed last month that she\u2019s suffering from PTSD after falling in the GS on Nov. 30 in Killington, Vermont. In the crash, something punctured Shiffrin's side and caused severe trauma to her oblique muscles.",
      "Shiffrin skipped the giant slalom at world championships and has raced the discipline three times since, with her best showing 25th place.",
      "But she's back to turning in fast sections at practice in the GS, a discipline that blends speed and technical skill.",
      "\u201cTraining is going well. It\u2019s actually super positive. Training has been improving day-by-day,\u201d Shiffrin said in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday before signing autographs for fans. \u201cI'm just trying to get back to the confidence that I was skiing with in Killington when the crash happened. That would be a big goal.\u201d",
      "On that day, Shiffrin was leading after the first run of the GS as she charged after her 100th World Cup win. The finish line was in sight on her final run, when she lost an edge and slid into a gate, flipping head over skis.",
      "The all-time winningest Alpine World Cup ski racer then slammed into another gate before coming to a stop in the protective fencing. She still doesn't know what led to the puncture wound.",
      "To help with getting back in the giant slalom start gate, she's been working with a psychologist. Leading into world championships and the GS, she checked most of the boxes for PTSD symptoms. A few weeks later in Are, Sweden, she checked fewer.",
      "\u201cMy processing speed and the mind-body connection has come back in a great way,\u201d explained Shiffrin, who earned her 100th World Cup win last month in Italy. \"But every now and then I\u2019ll still have the sort of intrusive images or thoughts cross my mind of crashing or the pain. Normally, it\u2019s in the start gate. If I\u2019m starting to get a little bit tired in a session, I just imagine everything that could go wrong and it\u2019s kind of an intense reaction.",
      "\u201cBut it happens so much less often now. It does feel very true that simply exposure to doing the thing that\u2019s pretty uncomfortable is helpful.\u201d",
      "Following her slalom training session Tuesday, Shiffrin will be watching as New Zealand\u2019s Alice Robinson tries to hold off Italy\u2019s Federica Brignone for the crystal globe in the giant slalom.",
      "The 30-year-old Shiffrin can see glimpses of her GS form returning. She won an Olympic gold medal in the discipline at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games and 22 of her 100 World Cup victories have come in giant slalom.",
      "\u201cSome of my turns are competitive with the fastest in the world,\u201d said Shiffrin, whose slalom race is Thursday. \u201cBut putting that together for a minute and 10-second GS run \u2014 that just takes time and repetition. We\u2019ll need to try to get some days this summer with long course sets, with a lot of variation of course sets, variation of conditions. I don\u2019t doubt that I can get to that competitive level again.",

    "story": [
      "Tests are underway at Cortina\u2019s controversial Olympic sliding track",
      "ROME -- When Italian skeleton competitor Mattia Gaspari became the first athlete to test the controversial sliding track for next year's Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, he did so in a sort of tunnel under a temporary roof built of wooden beams and white plastic paper.",
      "That's because the sliding center in Cortina d'Ampezzo is still under construction and the only part that is really finished is the track structure.",
      "Still, getting to this point little more than a year after construction began is a big achievement for the Italian government, which rebuilt the century-old track despite calls from the International Olympic Committee to hold bobsled, luge and skeleton athletes at a venue in nearby Austria or Switzerland instead.",
      "\u201cIt's really been quite an adventure,\u201d Infrastructure and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI want to thank the construction firm, which was the first one to believe in this, and the journalists who motivated us,\u201d said Salvini, who is also the deputy premier, citing articles claiming that the project would never be done. \u201cWell, here we are.\u201d",
      "Olympic bronze medalist Dominik Fischnaller was the second athlete down the track on his luge before Simone Bertazzo and Eric Fantazzini made a two-man bobsled run.",
      "Simico, the government agency in charge of the 118 million euro ($128 million) project, reported positive results for the test runs. But it will be officials from the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, International Luge Federation and the IOC to determine whether to bestow preliminary certification \u2014 homologation is the technical word \u2014 for the track.",
      "Preliminary approval would be a big step in avoiding a backup Plan B option that the IOC had demanded and which would require moving the three sliding sports all the way to Lake Placid, New York, if the track in Italy wasn\u2019t finished in time. Lake Placid officials were hopeful that, if the sliding events were going to be awarded to the U.S., the official word would come by the end of March.",
      "Construction on the Cortina track began in February last year. The pre-homologation plan calls for athletes to begin their initial runs from the junior start, well below the ramps from where they would begin to race for World Cup and Olympic competitions. Sliders would move up the track slowly throughout the coming days.",
      "There are testing events at the Cortina track for all three sliding sports \u2014 bobsled, skeleton and luge \u2014 scheduled for throughout the fall. Those are important so that sliders can familiarize themselves with the track and feel safe there when competing at the Olympics. Safety has taken on more importance since the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili in a training crash hours before the start of the opening ceremony for the 2010 Vancouver Games.",
      "Luge athletes are scheduled to have an international training period at the new track from Oct. 27 through Nov. 2, then return for a test event there in the final week of November. The bobsled and skeleton tours will hold their international training period from Nov. 7-16, followed by the season-opening World Cup races there from Nov. 17-23.",
      "The 1.749-kilometer (1.09-mile) track features 16 curves with an estimated top speed of 145 kph (90 mph) with run times slated for 55-60 seconds.",
      "Athletes from 12 nations are involved in the tests this week. It's about 60 athletes in all, about half of them being Italian sliders. Coaches representing at least 23 different sliding nations were also invited to view this week's events.",

    "story": [
      "Duke guard Tyrese Proctor has made 13 of 16 3-pointers through two games of the NCAA Tournament",
      "It wasn't that long ago that Tyrese Proctor was struggling to make much of anything outside the arc. Shot after shot clanged away in a befuddling stretch of misses spanning nearly a month of the stretch run for Duke's national-title contender.",
      "Now he can't miss.",
      "The junior guard has been on an absolute tear with his outside shot, hitting at least six 3-pointers for the past three games going back to the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament final. It's been a boost to an offense already humming at elite efficiency as the top-seeded Blue Devils head into Thursday's matchup with Arizona in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament's East Region in Newark, New Jersey.",
      "\u201cI think the main thing is the mentality of it,\" Proctor said after Sunday's second-round win against Baylor. \"I'm just shooting knowing the ball is going to go in and not hoping it's going in as the big thing.\u201d",
      "The 6-foot-6 guard from Australia has made 19 of 28 3-pointers (67.9%) since missing his first two attempts in the ACC title-game win against Louisville. And he's only gotten hotter with each passing possession.",
      "First came a 6-for-8 output in the first round against Mount St. Mary's \u2014 the kind of shooting display that's typically more of a one-game blip than a sustained push.",
      "Only he topped that two days later, making 7 of 8 against the Bears.",
      "That's 13 for 16 through two March Madness games, a shocking 81.3% hit rate. The 13 made 3s are the most of any player in the Sweet 16, with Houston's LJ Cryer and Tennessee's Chaz Lanier each hitting 10 as the only other players to reach double figures so far.",
      "And Proctor is striking from a variety of ways: on the catch in transition, curling around a screen, using a stepback, even pump-faking a defender off his feet and then resetting off a single dribble to his right \u2014 a move he pulled three times to send a Baylor player flying by on Sunday.",
      "As he kept burying the Bears, he flashed triumphant gestures and unleashed I'm-feeling-it screams toward a home-state crowd as he retreated back to the defensive end.",
      "\u201cSuch a talented player, such a weapon for us when he\u2019s being confident looking for his shot,\u201d freshman star Cooper Flagg said.",
      "The Blue Devils (33-3) have long counted on Proctor as a starter with perimeter length, giving him the ability to create matchup problems at both ends for smaller guards. He has long been a complementary scorer behind Flagg and another freshman in Kon Knueppel, and was averaging 11.8 points entering the Louisville game.",
      "But his kicked-up offense behind that 3-point shot through the last three games has increased his scoring average by approaching a full point (12.5).",
      "It was hard to see this coming as recently as 10 days ago.",
      "After a strong start to February, Proctor's outside shot suddenly abandoned him. Over the next seven games, he would miss 23 of 29 3-pointers, including a pair of 0-for-5 days to start the ACC Tournament. By the time he missed his first two against Louisville in the final, Proctor had missed 14 straight 3s going back to missing his last two in the regular-season finale at rival North Carolina.",
      "Proctor spent time looking at film of his shot with assistant Will Avery after the first two games of the ACCs, trying to decipher where things were misfiring.",
      "\u201cIt's just little things \u2014 just my balance and stuff like that,\" Proctor said. \"At the end of the day, it's just confidence. As soon as my feet get set and I hold my follow-through, I'm just going to keep trusting it.",
      "\"All the 0-for, whatever it was, all that felt good. A couple of them I knew what I did wrong. I think it's just realizing and understanding that, and just fixing it on the fly is a big thing.\u201d",
      "It's a challenge any shooter can understand: finding a delicate balance of tweaking any deficiencies showing up in the form, yet not meddling too much with what has worked for so long.",
      "So far it's working.",
      "\u201cIt's hard, earlier this season I struggled with that,\" Knueppel said. \u201cYou've just got to keep shooting it, that's the only way you can make more shots, is you keep shooting them. So he's done a great job of just being confident. He's really attacking his catches and getting locked and loaded, and ready to go.\u201d",

      "Bold decisions to change Major League Baseball\u2019s longstanding rules quickened the pace of games and revived the popularity of stealing bases over the last few years",
      "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Bold decisions to change Major League Baseball\u2019s longstanding rules quickened the pace of games and revived the popularity of stealing bases over the last few years.",
      "A similarly creative move may be needed to help starting pitching regain the relevance it enjoyed as recently as a decade ago.",
      "Only four pitchers (Seattle\u2019s Logan Gilbert, Kansas City\u2019s Seth Lugo, San Francisco\u2019s Logan Webb and Philadelphia\u2019s Zack Wheeler) threw as many as 200 innings last season, down from 34 in 2014.",
      "During that same 2014 season, all 30 major league teams got over 900 innings from their starting pitchers and five had over 1,000. Last year, only four teams had their starters pitch at least 900 innings, led by Seattle with 942 2/3.",
      "While this shift has been years in the making, the numbers themselves provide a cold slap of reality to longtime fans who remember seeing Bob Gibson throw three complete games in the 1967 World Series or Jack Morris pitching 10 shutout innings in Game 7 of the 1991 Fall Classic.",
      "Going back to the days of Cy Young and Walter Johnson, part of the game's beauty was watching a pitcher work his way through a lineup three or four times.",
      "With every team having multiple relievers who can come out of the bullpen and throw in the high 90s, what could prompt teams to let their starters work deeper into games?",
      "Managers and players struggle to come up with a solution.",
      "\u201cOutside of just changing rules to incentivize managers to keep guys in games longer,\u201d Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.",
      "Roberts\u2019 Dodgers exemplified the bullpen emphasis during their run to the 2024 World Series title. Their starting pitchers worked as many as six innings in just two of their 16 postseason games.",
      "Texas\u2019 Nathan Eovaldi went 5-0 with five postseason quality starts (defined as going at least six innings while allowing no more than three earned runs) a year earlier while helping the Rangers win their first World Series championship. Yet even he understands how much things have changed for starting pitchers since he made his big-league debut in 2011.",
      "\u201cBullpens are a lot different now than they were back then,\u201d Eovaldi said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot more guys who aren\u2019t just eight- and ninth-inning guys. They can come in, in the sixth or seventh, go multiple innings. They all have multiple pitches now as well. I think that\u2019s one of the fascinating things about the bullpen. You don\u2019t have guys who are just a two-pitch mix anymore. They\u2019ve got three or four pitches coming out, and two of them are really, really elite.\u201d",
      "And that\u2019s why there seems only one way to get starters working more innings.",
      "\u201cPutting in rules that you have to,\u201d San Francisco Giants manager Bob Melvin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve created our own monster. It is what it is.\u201d",
      "MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred says it\u2019s too early to explore rules changes.",
      "\u201cOur focus right now is training methods, particularly offseason training methods,\u201d Manfred said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be somewhere between education and recommendations. It\u2019s very hard to tell people you can\u2019t do X, Y and Z, right? They\u2019re grown men and there\u2019s no way to monitor it during the offseason.\u201d",
      "One problem is the lack of a clear consensus on what rule changes could work best.",
      "For instance, MLB had the Atlantic League experiment in 2021 and 2023 with a rule change that would force a team to lose its designated hitter if its starting pitcher didn\u2019t finish at least five innings.",
      "Instituting that kind of rule could be a tough sell in the majors, where some of the league\u2019s most bankable stars such as Shohei Ohtani and Bryce Harper have received ample playing time at DH the last few years. Fans paying to see those stars likely wouldn\u2019t be happy to see them get removed as collateral damage from an early pitching change.",
      "MLB hasn\u2019t announced any similar types of rules experimentations in the minors this season.",
      "The maximum number of pitchers allowed on MLB rosters was lowered from 14 to 13 in 2022, though that limit rises to 14 when rosters expand from 26 to 28 on Sept. 1. A more extreme rule change would be to require starters to work at least five or six innings unless they get injured, throw a certain number of pitches or allow a particular number of runs.",
      "Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said he wouldn\u2019t mind seeing the minor leagues try out more rule changes designed at lengthening starting pitchers. He wants those pitching prospects to get accustomed to working deeper into games.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the way it used to be with starters,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cNow I think the mentality can be, \u2018Hey, I\u2019ve done my job. I\u2019ve thrown four or five innings.\u2019 \u201c",
      "Giants pitcher Robbie Ray says the history of the game shows that starters can adapt to longer outings.",
      "\u201cI think starting pitchers are capable of doing it,\u201d said Ray, who won the 2021 AL Cy Young Award with Toronto. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of kind of training our bodies to do that again because what\u2019s been expected of us has changed over the years.\u201d",
      "A 62-page MLB study released in December showed how the focus on rising velocities and maximum effort on each pitch had resulted in more injuries among pitchers. That study also revealed that starts of five or more innings dropped from 84% to 70% in the majors from 2005-24 and from 68.9% to 36.8% in the minors.",
      "\u201cBecause we\u2019re trying to create this engine and this repetitive thought of just pure stuff each and every pitch, yeah, starters are going to fatigue sooner,\u201d Cleveland Guardians pitching coach Carl Willis said. \u201cAnd at the same time, we\u2019re training them that way. We\u2019re training them to do so.",
      "\u201cEverybody still talks about wanting to go out for the sixth, wanting to go out for the seventh and getting deep into games. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re training them to do that, and I don\u2019t know how we are kind of teaching nowadays can allow that to happen.\u201d",
      "A change in approach could allow those starters to get that endurance. Right now, it\u2019s the older guys who seem more used to that workload.",
      "The MLB leader in quality starts last season was the 34-year-old Wheeler, who had 26. Lugo, 35, had 22 quality starts to tie for second place.",
      "Even so, the 2024 season did offer some encouraging signs for the future of starting pitching.",
      "MLB pitchers threw 5.22 innings per start last season. That represented the most since 2018, though it was still far off the 2014 average of 5.97.",
      "The 2024 season also featured an MLB average of 85.5 pitches per start, the highest since 2019. Starters haven\u2019t thrown as many as 90 pitches per appearance since 2017.",
      "Perhaps it\u2019s inevitable that the pendulum swing at least a little more toward getting starters to work longer. The recent focus on relievers puts more pressure on them, causing bullpens to break down.",
      "There\u2019s one obvious method to change that.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think necessarily the game is going to all of a sudden turn back the other way, but there\u2019s a huge push to understand how you can keep a bullpen healthy,\u201d Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy said. \u201cAnd one of the biggest ways is those starters getting through that first bulk and getting you into the sixth or seventh.\u201d",
      "Now it\u2019s just a matter of figuring out how those starters can pitch deeper into games more often.",

      "There almost certainly won't be a $700 million deal for any player in the baseball's next free agency class, nothing like the record contracts for two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani and four-time All-Star slugger Juan Soto the past two winters.",
      "Still, plenty of talented players are going into their final seasons before potentially becoming free agents for the first time.",
      "Vladimir Guerrero Jr., five-tool player Kyle Tucker and starting pitchers Dylan Cease, Framber Valdez and Zac Gallen could all become available to other teams after this season. Three-time batting champion Luis Arr\u00e1ez and Bo Bichette, who twice led the American League in hits, could also be first-time free agents.",
      "Guerrero, like Soto already a four-time All-Star and Home Run Derby champion at age 26, had set a self-imposed deadline for negotiating a long-term agreement with Toronto. That passed at the start of spring training without a new deal, when he said he wanted to stay but would listen to other teams in free agency.",
      "Blue Jays president Mark Shapiro remained optimistic going into the season that the team would eventually sign the first baseman to a contract extension.",
      "Soto\u2019s $765 million, 15-year contract with the New York Mets in December came after Ohtani got a $700 million, 10-year deal from the Los Angeles Dodgers the previous offseason. Guerrero told ESPN in an interview after his deadline passed that he was seeking a similar contract length as Soto but noted that his last offer was for less than $600 million.",
      "Here are some of the players eligible for free agency after this year\u2019s World Series:",
      "Guerrero, who will make $28.5 million this season, hit a career-best .323 last year with a .940 OPS, 30 homers and 103 RBIs in his fourth consecutive All-Star season. Over six seasons with the Blue Jays, he has a .288 average with 160 homers and 507 RBIs in 819 games. He finished second in the 2021 AL MVP voting behind unanimous choice Ohtani.",
      "Houston clearly wasn't planning to pay the price to keep Tucker in free agency, so the Astros traded the three-time All-Star and Gold Glove-winning right fielder to Chicago in December for a third baseman, starting pitcher and top prospect outfielder that are all under team control for multiple seasons. The 28-year-old Tucker was limited to 78 games last year because of a fractured right shin, and still hit 23 homers. He had a combined 59 homers, 219 RBIs and 55 stolen bases in 2022-23.",
      "The 29-year-old Cease has 130 starts over the last four seasons, twice finishing in the top four in Cy Young Award voting. He was the AL runner-up behind unanimous winner Justin Verlander while with White Sox in 2022, and fourth in the NL last year when 14-11 with a 3.47 ERA in 33 starts after being traded to the playoff-bound Padres during spring training from a Chicago team that went on to lose 121 games. Cease has 1,016 career strikeouts in 847 1/3 innings.",
      "One of the game's best left-handed starters, the 31-year-old Valdez has a 68-41 career record and is Houston's opening-day starter for the fourth year in a row. He was 15-7 with a 2.91 ERA in 28 games last season, his fifth in a row to finish with a winning record. The workhorse threw a no-hitter in 2023 and averaged more than 191 innings the past three years.",
      "The 29-year-old Gallen, 14-6 last year, is 43-19 with a 3.20 ERA in 93 starts the past three seasons. Arizona got him his rookie season in 2019 when it traded Jazz Chisholm Jr. to Miami. The Diamondbacks just gave 2021 NL Cy Young Award winner and four-time All-Star right-hander Corbin Burnes a $210 million, six-year deal, the richest in franchise history. That could significantly impact whether they will also be able to keep Gallen, twice a top-five finisher in Cy Young voting.",
      "Arr\u00e1ez has back-to-back 200-hit seasons, part of three batting titles in a row while finishing each of those seasons with a different team. The Padres acquired him last year in a midseason trade from Miami, which got him from Minnesota after his first batting title with the Twins in 2022. He goes into this season with a .323 career average and only 194 strikeouts in 2,858 career plate appearances.",
      "A calf injury and then a broken right middle finger limited Bichette to 81 games last season, and the 27-year-old two-time All-Star hit a career-low .225 with only four homers. Before that, he led the AL in hits in 2021 and 2022, and batted .306 in 2023 during his third consecutive 20-homer season.",
      "Ozuna, who turns 35 next November, played in all 162 games for the first time last year and was an All-Star for the third time \u2014 first since 2016. He has 79 homers and 204 RBIs over the past two years.",
      "Bieber had 20 strikeouts in 12 scoreless innings last season before Tommy John surgery and becoming a free agent for the first time. Cleveland re-signed the 2020 AL Cy Young winner even though he won\u2019t pitch until later this season, during which the pitcher with a 62-32 career record turns 30. He does have a $16 million player option for 2026.",
      "34-year-old catcher J.T. Realmuto, 32-year-old slugger Kyle Schwarber and 29-year-old left-handed starter Ranger Su\u00e1rez are going into the final seasons of their contracts with the Phillies after being key figures for three consecutive playoff seasons. That began with that 2022 NL pennant that ended a decade-long postseason drought. Schwarber has 131 homers and 302 RBIs in that three-season span, along with 318 walks and 612 strikeouts.",

      "Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy is suing his former girlfriend who accused him of attacking her",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy sued his former girlfriend who accused him of attacking her, alleging the woman assaulted him and stole or destroyed more than $150,000 in cash and property.",
      "Worthy filed the lawsuit Monday against Tia Jones in Williamson County, Texas, where the two lived and where Worthy played college football at the University of Texas.",
      "Worthy was arrested earlier this month after Jones accused him of assaulting her, but the district attorney declined to file charges in that case after speaking to multiple witnesses.",
      "In his lawsuit, Worthy alleges that Jones fabricated the allegations of abuse and that she became enraged after he asked her to move out of the home they were living in. He says in the lawsuit that Jones assaulted him, ripping out his hair, and destroyed his game room.",
      "He also alleges that while he was in jail, Jones stole a handgun, $30,000 in cash, jewelry, a key to his Rolls Royce and other belongings.",
      "An attorney for Jones, Angelica Cogliano, said Monday she had not seen the lawsuit and declined to comment.",
      "Worthy is seeking between $250,000 and $1 million",
      "\u201cPlaintiff not only suffered bodily injuries and property damage as a result of this incident, but his credibility, veracity, and reputation suffered, and this narrative, although false, will always track his career and future in the NFL,\u201d the suit states.",
      "Worthy was chosen by the Chiefs with the 28th overall pick in last year\u2019s draft after setting the record for the fastest 40-yard dash at the NFL combine. He got off to a quick start by scoring a pair of touchdowns in his NFL debut, and after a midseason lull, he became the Chiefs\u2019 go-to wide receiver as they chased an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl title.",
      "Worthy finished with 59 catches for 638 yards and six TDs while running 20 times for 104 yards and three more scores.",
      "He was one of the few bright spots for the Chiefs in a 40-22 loss to Philadelphia in the Super Bowl, too. Worthy caught all eight of his targets for 157 yards and a pair of touchdowns at the Superdome in New Orleans.",

      "MIAMI -- Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat will be linked one last time.",
      "And then, they\u2019ll be on opposite sides \u2014 just like they were in his final weeks as a member of the team.",
      "The Heat will pay tribute to Butler\u2019s 5\u00bd seasons with the team with a pregame video on Tuesday night, one that will be shown in the arena as part of the introduction of the Golden State Warriors\u2019 starting lineup for the game.",
      "Butler said he\u2019ll watch the video, though added that it didn\u2019t matter to him whether the Heat did one or not. He\u2019s insisting that there\u2019s no hard feelings now, a month and a half after he was traded to the Warriors following a contentious breakup that saw him suspended by Miami three times in his final weeks with the team.",
      "He wasn\u2019t happy with the Heat, not getting an extension and had issues with his role. The Heat weren\u2019t happy with how he missed about 25% of their games during his tenure with the club and how he took his complaints public in the final months.",
      "Butler got his extension \u2014 two years, $111 million \u2014 from the Warriors, and Golden State was 16-3 in his first 19 appearances with the team entering Tuesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always painted as the bad guy,\u201d Butler said. \u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve been, I\u2019ve always been a problem. We\u2019ll take it. I don\u2019t got nothing to say. I\u2019m not mad at being a bad guy. It\u2019s all the way everything\u2019s portrayed. Some people talk to the media, some people don\u2019t. I\u2019ve never been one to tell my side of the story to almost anybody. Let everybody think that this is what happened. We\u2019ll ride with it.\u201d",
      "Fans, as they tend to be when a top player leaves their team, have not been shy about hiding their anger with Butler on social media. Butler knows things didn\u2019t end well in his Miami tenure, though notes that he believes there\u2019s more than enough blame to go around for the messy breakup.",
      "\u201cI wonder if they look at the Heat the same way,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIt ain\u2019t like I was the one who was doing everything. It\u2019s got to be 50-50, maybe 51-49 \u2014 49 towards them, 51 towards me. But there\u2019s no way that I was the cause of all of this.\u201d",
      "Butler wound up being suspended for a total of 14 Heat games before the trade. But the Heat have a tradition of welcoming back players who were All-Stars or champions with the team; Butler was an All-Star in Miami who led the team to three Eastern Conference finals berths and two trips to the NBA Finals.",

      "While the stars are shining on the game's biggest stage, the smaller schools are not. There weren't any major upsets or Cinderella stories heading into the second week of the women's NCAA Tournament. For the first time since the tournament expanded to 64 teams, no team seeded 11th or lower advanced out the first round.",

      "As usually is the case, the top 12 women's teams in the NCAA Tournament all advanced to the Sweet 16 which begins Friday. Bueckers, Hidalgo and Betts have led the way for their teams to advance.",
      "Bueckers, who is expected to be the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft, played her final game at home and put on a show, tying her career high with 34 points. Hidalgo has helped Notre Dame regain its dominant form after the Irish slumped at the end of the regular season and conference tournament.",
      "Betts has been dominant for UCLA in its first two games, averaging 22 points and 10 rebounds.",
      "South Carolina still has a chance to become the first team to repeat in the women's tournament since UConn won four in a row from 2013-16. They're doing it with a team effort \u2014 and a chip on their shoulder.",
      "The Gamecocks felt they should have been the overall top seed in the tournament \u2014 but weren't. Then Indiana implied the Gamecocks were vulnerable this year without that dominant post player they have had in the previous championship runs.",
      "Well, they're back in the Sweet 16 with depth and a balanced attack. The Gamecocks reserves scored an NCAA record 66 points in their opening win over Tennessee Tech.",
      "Joining the top teams are a trio of five seeds \u2014 Kansas State, Tennessee and Ole Miss. Alabama almost joined them as the fourth No. 5 to advance, but the Crimson Tide lost Monday in double overtime to Maryland.",
      "\u201cThis was a heavyweight fight,\u201d Maryland coach Brenda Frese said. \u201cNo team deserved to lose this game tonight.\u201d",
      "The three No. 5 seeds all did it on the road, making history along the way. It was the first time since the NCAA changed the format, with the top four seeds each hosting the first two rounds of the tournament. Until this year, never had three No. 5 seeds advanced when playing on an opponents home court. Three five seeds did advance in 2021, but that year the entire tournament was played in Texas due to the coronavirus.",
      "While Tennessee is a Sweet 16 regular, Kansas State is making its first appearance in the second weekend since 2002. Second-seeded TCU is appearing in the Sweet 16 for the first time. They have a rematch with Notre Dame waiting for them in Birmingham. The Horned Frogs beat the Fighting Irish in the Cayman Islands during a Thanksgiving tournament.",

      "Viktor Hovland can sound like a player who is bent on perfection",
      "Golf doesn't have to be that complicated. Viktor Hovland only makes it sound that way.",
      "Hovland was confounding as ever at the Valspar Championship. His confidence was so low that he arrived at Innisbrook uncertain if he was even going to play, and then five days later he delivered two clutch swings during the toughest stretch on the Copperhead course to rally for a one-shot victory he never saw coming.",
      "Only the trophy was satisfying.",
      "\u201cYeah, it's still not great,\u201d he said when asked if he was happy with his swing.",
      "Hovland rarely is. And that's why the 27-year-old Norwegian star could say without sounding offensive how proud he was to win on such a tough golf course \u201cwith not my best stuff.\u201d",
      "There is constant searching, not just to win but to hit shots the way he expects. Hovland has questions and he wants answers, and he won't stop looking until he finds them.",
      "He is not wired like Dustin Johnson, who made a career-defining decision to go from hitting a draw to hitting a fade. After winning the U.S. Open and a World Golf Championship in consecutive starts in 2016, Johnson was asked how he went about making such a big change.",
      "\u201cWell, I was just struggling with the draw to get it in the fairway,\u201d he replied. \u201cSo I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to hit a fade.' And I started hitting a fade.\u201d",
      "Simple, right?",
      "Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have had the same swing coach since they were about 8. Hovland has made 11 coaching changes since leaving Oklahoma State in 2019, some of them brought back on more than one occasion.",
      "What hasn't changed is his mission \u2014 to hit pure shots \u2014 no matter how many detours.",
      "Hovland reached what looked like the summit in August 2023 when he had a 65-61 weekend at Olympia Fields to win the BMW Championship, and then a 66-63 weekend at East Lake to win the Tour Championship and capture the FedEx Cup. He went 3-1-1 at the Ryder Cup, including partnering with Ludvig Aberg for a 9-and-7 win over Scheffler and Brooks Koepka.",
      "He returned from a winter's break in Norway and felt lost again.",
      "It was at Bay Hill a year ago when Hovland was asked the difference between winning without his best stuff or hitting it great and finishing fifth.",
      "\u201cI guess that\u2019s kind of the insane part of my brain is that I just enjoy flushing a golf shot,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re out here to compete and win tournaments. But I really just cherish being able to hit the shots exactly the way I want to. I think it\u2019s a better predictor of how you\u2019re going to play in the future.\u201d",
      "Therein lies the secret. He can win without his best stuff because he's very good. What he lacks is consistently strong finishes. He has never gone more than five straight tournaments in the top 10, which pales compared with the elite in the game.",
      "But he can contend out of nowhere, such as his third place in the PGA Championship last year at Valhalla when he wondered why he even bothered showing up. That wasn't a threat, more a state of his mind. He also was runner-up at a FedEx Cup playoff event last year.",
      "He doesn't doubt his ability, only what he has referred to as the \u201cmachinery.\u201d",
      "Perfection in golf is something to chase, not attain. That's why Hovland was amused at the label of being a perfectionist.",
      "\u201cI guess you can use that word to describe it,\u201d he said. \"I just view it as if you put your heart and soul into doing something, you might as well do it right. I\u2019ve swung the club extremely well and I think my ball striking has been really, really good over a long period of time. And then when it\u2019s not doing that, I\u2019m going to work on that, I\u2019m going to figure it out.",
      "\u201cI find it kind of weird that we\u2019re professional athletes and the people that are wanting to improve are somewhat looked at as, \u2018Oh he\u2019s a perfectionist, he\u2019s out on the perimeter searching too much.\u2019 That's what we do. We are here to get better and we are here to win tournaments.\"",
      "That's worked out just fine for Bryson DeChambeau, renowned for going down rabbit holes and leaving enough bread crumbs to find his way out if needed.",
      "Hovland won with intelligent course management and good fortune. He could feel the club being out of position at the top, forcing him to try to save it on the way down. The timing worked in his favor at Innisbrook, particularly that 7-iron to 5 feet on the 16th hole Sunday.",
      "And so the trophy from the Valspar Championship is in hand \u2014 his 11th worldwide \u2014 and the search continues. He is back with Grant Waite (for the second time), and the immediate goal is to be ready for the Masters. He\u2019s not sure the swing he had at Innisbrook will work at Augusta National.",
      "The chase continues, with no apologies.",
      "\u201cWhen you're struggling with something, it's just problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd problems are usually a lack of information. I would encourage people to go out and seek more information and try it out for yourselves. See if it helps your problems. And if it doesn't, then you've got to seek more answers. And you keep going and keep going.\u201d",

      "General manager Andrew Luck announced the decision on Tuesday in his first major move since taking over in his role running the entire football program.",
      "\u201cSince beginning my role as general manager, I have been thoroughly assessing the entire Stanford football program,\u201d Luck said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cIt has been clear that certain aspects of the program need change. Additionally, in recent days, there has been significant attention to Stanford investigations in previous years related to coach Taylor. After continued consideration it is evident to me that our program needs a reset. In consultation with university leadership I no longer believe that coach Taylor is the right coach to lead our football program.\u201d",
      "ESPN reported last week that Taylor had been investigated twice since taking over before the 2023 season over allegations of hostile and aggressive behavior, as well as personal attacks, against female staff members.",
      "Both investigations determined that Taylor\u2019s treatment of employees, particularly of women, was inconsistent with Stanford\u2019s standards, according to ESPN.",
      "The second investigation concluded that Taylor retaliated against a compliance staffer who had found seven minor NCAA infractions by \u201cseeking her removal from her assigned duties.\u201d",
      "The report said investigators had never encountered \u201cthis palpable level of animosity and disdain\u201d for a university compliance office, according to ESPN.",
      "Luck thanked Taylor for his time but said it was important to instill the proper culture at Stanford.",
      "\u201cWe have powerful traditions, incredible student-athletes, and a vision for the future that demonstrates our strong potential as a program,\u201d Luck said. \"This vision includes an emphasis on a positive, winning, and inclusive culture. I am confident that we will return Stanford to the top echelon of college football.\u201d",
      "Luck was hired last November to oversee the football program and he reports directly to school President Jonathan Levin. Athletic director Bernard Muir announced last month that he is leaving at the end of the academic year and Stanford is looking for a replacement.",
      "But Luck will be in charge of the football program and now needs to find a coach who can get the Cardinal back to being competitive nationally.",
      "From Luck's first season as starting quarterback in 2009 through the 2018 season, the Cardinal were tied for the sixth most wins in FBS, playing in three Rose Bowls and two other BCS bowls in a 10-year span.",
      "But Stanford is 20-46 in six seasons since then, with its .303 winning percentage ranking second worst to Vanderbilt among all power conference teams in that span.",
      "Taylor was hired after David Shaw stepped down in 2022 after his second straight 3-9 season. Taylor, who had helped build Sacramento State into an FCS power, went 3-9 in each of his two seasons with the Cardinal. Stanford went just 1-10 at home against FBS opponents under Taylor.",

      "Houston and Gonzaga met in a second-round NCAA Tournament matchup last weekend in Wichita, Kansas, that could as easily have been played in the Final Four, the way Kelvin Sampson's and Mark Few's teams had played throughout the season.",
      "The Cougars were No. 1 in scoring defense, more than a half-point better than the next-best team. The Bulldogs were No. 2 in scoring offense, trailing only Alabama in putting up nearly 87 points per game.",
      "Yet one of the biggest reasons that Houston was able to advance to the Sweet 16 with an 81-76 victory over the Bulldogs was its ability to play any style of basketball. Sure, the Cougars managed to hold Gonzaga nearly 10 points below its season average, but they also ramped up their own scoring, proving that they are more than just a bunch of defensive stoppers.",
      "\u201cJust win and advance,\u201d Sampson said afterward. \u201cDo what it takes. That's all that matters.\u201d",
      "Throughout the 68-team field, those that were able to survive the first weekend were often those that were willing to change things up if the moment dictated it. The defensive dynamo was able to get into transition and pile up points, or the team that loves to score buckled down at the other end of the floor, making life difficult for its unsuspecting opponent.",
      "That has been the case with Mississippi so far in the tournament.",
      "The Rebels rolled into the postseason in the top 50 nationally in scoring, but their defense was middling at best: 175th out of the 364 teams in men's Division I basketball. Yet the same bunch who scored 98 points against Kentucky and 100 against Oral Roberts in the regular season stifled North Carolina in a 71-64 first-round win, then held Iowa State below its season scoring average in a 91-78 victory that pushed Ole Miss into the regional semifinals.",
      "\u201cTheir defensive versatility is terrific,\u201d Iowa State coach T.J. Otzelberger marveled afterward. \u201cTheir switch ability \u2014 guards on bigs, bigs on guards. They do a great job. Their defense really tries to frustrate you by not allowing the ball to get in the paint, and trying to keep it on one side of the floor. And when they're at their best, they're doing that really well.\u201d",
      "It will take Ole Miss doing it at their best with Michigan State up next; the Spartans are among the most versatile of any team left. They are top 50 in both scoring and defense, and they showed it off last weekend, putting up 87 points against Bryant and holding New Mexico to 63 in a pair of wins.",
      "\u201cWe're just a team that can play multiple ways,\u201d the Spartans' Jaden Akins said.",
      "So is Duke, which was fourth nationally in scoring and sixth in scoring defense. And when you have that combination, the results in the opening weekend were not surprising: 93-49 over Mount St. Mary's and 89-66 over Baylor.",
      "Kentucky was sixth nationally in scoring this season, but coach Mark Pope's bunch \u2014 315th in scoring defense \u2014 played a more patient game with plenty of success in a 76-57 first-round win over Wofford. It wasn't a surprise that Arizona averaged 90 points in wins over Akron and Oregon, but it may have been that the Wildcats held the Zips to just 65 in the first round.",
      "Then there's Alabama, which looked every bit like the nation's highest-scoring team in a tougher-than-expected first-round win over Robert Morris and a second-round blitz of Saint Mary's. But the Crimson Tide also looked a lot like, say, Houston the way it defended the Gaels, holding them to just 66 points in advancing to the Sweet 16.",
      "That's where the Crimson Tide will face BYU, a team that plays much more like itself.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that I want to say it\u2019s refreshing to go against somebody that plays like us,\u201d Tide coach Nate Oats said, \"because I think we\u2019re really tough to guard, and we\u2019ve led the country in scoring the last two years. I don\u2019t think anybody is saying it\u2019s refreshing to play Alabama, whoever is running the defense for the other team. I mean, maybe it\u2019s not such a smash-mouth game like playing football out there like some of these teams, but they\u2019re not easy to cover.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to really lock in and coaches are going to have to really do a good job getting our guys ready and then our guys are going to have to execute what the plan is, whatever we decide to put in.\u201d",

      "None of that has changed, necessarily, despite the divisive rhetoric from government officials from both countries and tariff wars simmering between the longtime allies. Yet the two figure skaters have started to notice some other differences lately.",
      "\u201cWe were at a cafe last weekend,\u201d Chock said, \u201cand Evan ordered a coffee \u2014 an Americano \u2014 and the barista delivered it and said, \u2018Here\u2019s your Canadien.' And we were like, \u2018Oh. It\u2019s an Americano, and they don't want to call it an Americano, for obvious reasons.'",
      "\u201cThat was our first experience with that being reflected in Canada.\u201d",
      "Now, the reigning world champions are curious what will transpire this week in Boston, where they'll be trying to win their third straight title against a field that includes their dear friends and longtime rivals, Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier of Canada.",
      "Will the American fans at TD Bank Garden support everyone universally, as is the custom in figure skating, when competition begins Wednesday? Or will there be more robust cheering than usual for Chock and Bates, and perhaps even some boos for their neighbors from the north, in what should be a preview of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy?",
      "\u201cAmerica has always had a very global reach when it comes to politics and culture,\" Chock said, reflecting on that cafe encounter, \"but we never really saw that truly reflected in her until that moment, when it was like, 'Oh, OK. I understand now.'\u201d",
      "World pairs champions Deanna Stellato-Dudek and Maxime Deschamps are just as uncertain what kind of reception they will get in Boston. Stellato-Dudek was born in the Chicago suburbs, but about three months ago she passed the exam to become a Canadian citizen, which was required for her to compete for that country at the Winter Olympics.",
      "That plan was set in motion long before Donald Trump returned to the White House, when the notion of Canada becoming a 51st state seemed downright absurd and American liquor was still being stocked on the shelves of Canadian shops.",
      "Stellato-Dudek twice finished third at the U.S. championships with Nathan Bartholomay before splitting in 2019, and that\u2019s when she teamed up with Deschamps, who had separated from his American partner Sydney Kolodziej the previous year.",
      "Stellato-Dudek and Deschamps considered skating for the U.S., but they were concerned he would not be granted American citizenship in time to compete at the Milano-Cortina Games; the Olympic Charter requires athletes to hold the nationality of the country represented by their National Olympic Committee in order to compete at the Summer or Winter Games.",
      "\u201cI did represent America for many years. I'm very proud to represent Canada. I'm now a Canadian citizen, which is the honor of my life,\u201d Stellato-Dudek said. \"And I have family that still lives in America that will be at an American worlds to come watch me. They are there to cheer me on, and I'm excited to skate for them.",
      "\u201cI think sports is one of the few things that bring people together from all different nationalities and all over the world,\u201d Stellato-Dudek added, \u201cand I hope this world championships does this for everybody as well.\u201d",
      "It promises to be an interesting test case given that the U.S. will be hosting \u2014 along with Canada and Mexico \u2014 the World Cup next year, and two years later, Los Angeles will be welcoming the world for the 2028 Summer Olympics.",
      "Even newly elected International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry, a former Zimbabwe swimmer who graduated from Auburn University, alluded to the challenges that could come with dealing with the Trump administration, whether that be due to trade wars, the war in Ukraine, diversity issues or a host of other potentially discordant viewpoints.",
      "\u201cI have been dealing with, let\u2019s say difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old,\" Coventry said after winning the IOC election in Costa Navarino, Greece. \u201cWhat I have learned is that communication will be key.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, figure skaters headed to Boston this week are hoping to communicate that sports can be a unifying force.",
      "\u201cI mean, we've kind of gone about (that) sport isn't political. We've been raised that way,\u201d said Gilles, who was born in Rockford, Illinois, but whose mother and grandmother are Canadian and who became a Canadian citizen herself 12 years ago.",
      "\u201cWe're lucky to be able to skate in Canada and the U.S. and been welcomed on both soils,\u201d she said. \u201cWe're kind of focused on our job, and let sport be sport, and not let it be political. We can't focus on what we can't control. We can control our skating and we can control that we're proud of our country and proud to represent our country in the U.S.\u201d",

      "Ben McCollum, who led Drake\u2019s dominating run through the Missouri Valley Conference and a win in the NCAA Tournament in his only season with the Bulldogs, is the new head coach at Iowa",
      "Ben McCollum, who led Drake's dominating run through the Missouri Valley Conference and a win in the NCAA Tournament in his only season with the Bulldogs, was named head coach at Iowa on Monday.",
      "Iowa spokesman Matt Weitzel confirmed McCollum's hiring 10 days after athletic director Beth Goetz fired Fran McCaffery and two days after McCollum wrapped up a 31-4 season with a loss to Texas Tech in the second round of the West Regional.",
      "McCollum takes over for McCaffery, who was fired after the Hawkeyes went 17-16 and had their lowest Big Ten regular-season finish in seven years. Iowa also has seen a steep decline in attendance the last two years.",
      "The 43-year-old McCollum's ties to the Hawkeye State run deep. He was born in Iowa City, raised in Storm Lake and played junior college basketball in Mason City.",
      "When he left the state, he didn\u2019t go far. He finished his college playing days at Northwest Missouri State and was an assistant at Emporia State in Kansas. He went back to Northwest Missouri in 2008 for his first head coaching job and won four Division II national championships in 15 seasons.",
      "With four Northwest Missouri players heading to Drake with McCollum, the Bulldogs became one of the top stories in college basketball this season. They were dubbed \u201cDivision II Drake\u201d by some, a moniker that only served to motivate the team.",
      "All four of the Northwest Missouri transfers were starters and one of them, Bennett Stirtz, led the Missouri Valley in scoring and was named conference player of the year and most outstanding player of the MVC Tournament.",
      "The Bulldogs were picked fifth in the 12-team Valley and received no first-place votes. They ended up winning the regular-season championship by two games with 17 conference wins, their most ever. Then they won the Valley tournament to run their overall win total to a school-record 30 in 33 games.",
      "Next was a 67-57 win over Missouri in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.",
      "McCollum coaches a grinding style. The Bulldogs\u2019 tempo was slowest in the nation. Offensive rebounding is emphasized. The defense allows 58.4 points per game, fewest in the nation. Just over 1 in 5 opponent possessions ends with a turnover.",
      "\u201cDeath by a thousand paper cuts,\u201d McCollum called his system.",
      "The Bulldogs knocked off Miami, Vanderbilt and Kansas State on their way to a 12-0 start. Drake dropped back-to-back games before reeling off 11 straight MVC wins.",
      "McCaffery was Iowa\u2019s all-time wins leader and, at 15 years, the longest-tenured coach in program history. The Hawkeyes dropped seven of nine games in February and didn't qualify for the Big Ten Tournament until the last day of the regular season.",
      "The program has struggled to attract elite talent because of its shallow pool of funds for name, image and likeness compensation.",
      "Since McCaffery\u2019s firing, seven players have announced they would enter the transfer portal.",
      "Iowa\u2019s men were 10th in the Big Ten in average paid attendance this season, at 9,161 per game, though actual crowds appeared significantly less. That\u2019s an 8% drop from last season and 26% drop from 2022-23.",

    "story": [
      "Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini have won again in court and now lead 2-0 in trial verdicts against Swiss federal prosecutors",
      "MUTTENZ, Switzerland -- Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini won again in court Tuesday and now lead 2-0 in trial verdicts against Swiss federal prosecutors.",
      "Once soccer\u2019s most powerful men, former FIFA president Blatter and former UEFA president Platini were acquitted for a second time in a case now in its 10th year on charges of fraud, forgery, mismanagement and misappropriation of more than $2 million of FIFA money in 2011.",
      "Blatter, now aged 89, gave little reaction listening to the verdict of three cantonal (state) judges acting as a federal criminal appeals court. Sitting in the row in front of Platini, Blatter alternately tapped his fingers on his desk or held his left hand over his mouth.",
      "Only when the 55-minute verdict statement was over did Blatter smile before reaching across to shake his lawyer's hand. Blatter then shared a long hug with his daughter, Corinne.",
      "\u201cYou have seen my daughter was coming with tears because she believed in (her) father and I believed in myself,\u201d said Blatter, who spoke of a sword of Damocles being removed from over his head. \u201cTo wait such a long time affects the person and my family was very much affected.\"",
      "Platini sat with his arms folded or rubbing his hands as he listened to a translator sitting beside him relating the court's verdict in German into his native French.",
      "\u201cThis persecution by FIFA and some Swiss federal prosecutors for 10 years is now finished, is now totally finished,\" Platini said leaving the court, insisting his honor was restored. \"So I\u2019m very happy.\u201d",
      "The attorney general\u2019s office in Switzerland had challenged a first acquittal in July 2022 and asked for sentences of 20 months, suspended for two years. The indictment alleged the payment \u201cdamaged FIFA\u2019s assets and unlawfully enriched Platini.\u201d",
      "\u201cMichel Platini must finally be left in peace in criminal matters,\u201d his lawyer Dominic Nellen said in a statement. \u201dAfter two acquittals, even the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland must realize that these criminal proceedings have definitively failed.\"",
      "A further appeal to the Swiss supreme court can be filed by the prosecutors' office, which said in a statement it \u201cwill decide about how to further proceed.\u201d",
      "Blatter and Platini have consistently denied wrongdoing in a decade-long case that ultimately came to nothing in court yet totally altered world soccer body FIFA.",
      "The legal case swung on their claims of a verbal agreement to one day settle the money in question.",
      "Blatter approved FIFA paying 2 million Swiss francs (now $2.21 million) to France soccer great Platini in February 2011 for supplementary and non-contracted salary working as a presidential advisor from 1998-2002.",
      "The latest win for Blatter and the 69-year-old Platini came exactly 9\u00bd years since the Swiss federal investigation was revealed and kicked off events that ended the careers of the two men.",
      "That September 2015 day in Zurich, police came to interrogate them at FIFA after an executive committee meeting when Platini was a strong favorite to succeed his one-time mentor in an upcoming election.",
      "With Platini soon suspended and banned by FIFA, European soccer body UEFA ran his long-time secretary general Gianni Infantino as its election candidate. Infantino was a surprise winner in February 2016 and is set to lead FIFA until at least 2031.",
      "Though federal court trials have twice cleared their names, Blatter\u2019s reputation likely always will be tied to leading FIFA during corruption crises that took down a swath of senior soccer officials worldwide.",
      "Platini, one of soccer\u2019s greatest players and later Blatter\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in soccer politics, never did get the FIFA presidency he often called his destiny.",
      "Neither Blatter nor Platini has worked in soccer since they were suspended by the FIFA ethics committee in October 2015. They were later banned and failed to overturn the bans in separate appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2016.",
      "\u201dThe criminal proceedings have had not only legal but also massive personal and professional consequences for Michel Platini, although no incriminating evidence was ever presented,\" Nellen said, suggesting further legal action \"against those responsible for the criminal proceedings.\u201d",
      "Platini\u2019s ban expired in 2019 and Blatter was given a subsequent ban by FIFA in 2021 months before his first was due to end.",
      "Blatter is exiled from soccer until late in 2028 \u2014 when he will be 92 \u2014 because of an ethics prosecution of alleged self-dealing in eight-figure management bonuses paid for successfully organizing the men\u2019s World Cup in 2010 and 2014.",
      "The verdict was given Tuesday in a low-key provincial courthouse where a four-day trial was held three weeks ago.",
      "Blatter and Platini have claimed at five different judicial bodies \u2014 twice at FIFA, then the Court of Arbitration for Sport and now two Swiss federal criminal courts \u2014 that they had a verbal \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d to one day settle the unpaid and non-contracted salary.",
      "Platini was a storied former captain and coach of the France national term when he worked to help Blatter get elected to lead FIFA in Paris on the eve of the 1998 World Cup he organized.",
      "The two men said Platini agreed to be a presidential adviser on an annual salary of 300,000 Swiss francs (now $340,000) through 2002. They claim there was a verbal deal to later get the balance of 1 million Swiss francs for each year that FIFA could not pay at the time.",
      "Platini started asking for the money early in 2010, citing seven-figure payments made to senior Blatter aides who left FIFA which showed the soccer body could afford to pay him. The payment was finally made in February 2011.",
      "Details of the payment only emerged in the crisis that hit FIFA in May 2015 when U.S. federal investigators unsealed a sweeping investigation of international soccer officials. Swiss authorities made early-morning arrests at hotels in Zurich before seizing FIFA financial and business records.",
      "In 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors already were handling a criminal complaint filed by FIFA. That was about suspected financial wrongdoing linked to votes in December 2010 that picked Russia and Qatar as future World Cup hosts.",

      "The fragment being examined has a dark area on its surface that restorers want to understand. Their objective is to better preserve the artifacts at the sprawling imperial palace, the former home of China\u2019s emperors and its seat of power for hundreds of years.",
      "\u201cWe want to learn what the black material is,\" said Kang Baoqiang, one of the restorers at the complex, today a museum that attracts tourists from all over the world. \u201cWhether it\u2019s atmospheric sediment or the result of substantial change from within.\u201d",
      "About 150 workers on the team fuse scientific analysis and traditional techniques to clean, patch up and otherwise revive the more than 1.8 million relics in the museum's collection.",

      "In the corners of social media dominated by wellness content, influencers recommend an assortment of treatments and products to support weight loss, fight exhaustion or promote other desired health outcomes.",
      "Some of the endorsed approaches may be helpful. Many play into fads with scant evidence to back up enthusiasts' claims, medical experts say.",
      "Some influencers encourage their followers to avoid specific food items, such as seed oils, while others advocate going all in on certain foods, such as the meat-heavy carnivore diet. There are video pitches for berberine, a chemical compound that\u2019s been touted online as \u201cnature\u2019s Ozempic,\u201d and for non-medical IV vitamin therapy, which businesses popularly known as drip bars market as cures for hangovers or fatigue.",
      "To be sure, alternative health practices and cures that lacked the medical establishment's backing were a part of popular culture long before the internet age. But the plethora of advice shared online has both prompted calls for safeguards and found a measure of mainstream acceptance.",
      "The new U.S. health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., had his Instagram account suspended in 2021 for posting misinformation about vaccine safety and COVID-19, but many of the ideas he champions have a widespread following. Critics of Dr. Mehmet Oz accused him of sometimes making misleading assertions on the talk show he used to host; Oz now is President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services.",
      "A Netflix series released last month explored the story of Belle Gibson, a popular Australian wellness influencer who amassed a following talking about curing her terminal brain cancer with a healthy lifestyle and alternative medicine. In 2015, Gibson admitted to lying about having a cancer diagnosis. Australia\u2019s federal court later fined her for failing to donate money she said would go to charity through sales of her cookbook and app.",
      "With personal wellness remaining a hot topic, here are some tips health experts have for evaluating the material you see online:",
      "Most influencers have or want business relationships with companies that allow them to earn income by promoting products. The arrangements don't necessarily mean content creators don\u2019t believe in what they\u2019re marketing, but they do have a vested interest in publicizing products that may or may not work.",
      "Creators can get paid for pictures or videos that hype up a product and also earn commissions on sales through features such as affiliate links. Experts note it's therefore better to proceed with caution when someone inspires you to hit the \u201cbuy\u201d button, whether it's for natural supplements, teas with purported weight loss benefits or any other wellness products that show up in your social media feed.",
      "Research published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed a sizable amount of Instagram and TikTok posts that discussed five popular medical tests mostly came from account holders with \u201csome form of financial interest\u201d in promoting the screenings.",
      "After analyzing roughly 980 posts on the two platforms, researchers said most of the posts they found were misleading and failed to \u201cmention important harms, including overdiagnosis\u201d resulting from health people having full-body MRIs or tests to detect early signs of cancer, evaluate microorganisms in the gut or measure hormone levels.",
      "Promoting dietary supplements has been a particularly lucrative exercise for many influencers, said Timothy Caulfield, a health policy and law professor at the University of Alberta. He views the supplements industry as \u201cthe backbone\u201d of health misinformation aimed at consumers and designed to fuel billions of dollars in revenue.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gotten to the point where if someone is selling a supplement, it\u2019s a red flag,\u201d he said. \"I don\u2019t think it was always like that, but it certainly is now.\u201d",
      "In general, consumers should take all bold claims with a degree of skepticism, said Cedric Bryant, chief executive officer at the nonprofit American Council on Exercise. The goal of creators is to increase engagement with their content, and some influencers may be tempted to make unproven assertions to draw in more viewers.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Bryant said.",
      "Some health and wellness influencers have medical training, but many do not. Before taking health tips from someone on social media, it\u2019s a good idea to make sure they have the proper expertise or at least able to share the data that led them to recommend certain products or lifestyle choices.",
      "In the fitness area, Bryant recommends checking to see if a creator holds certification from an accreditation organization and then confirming the information through the U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals database.",
      "The American Medical Association and The American Board of Medical Specialties maintain searchable databases for medical doctors, which may help verify the qualifications of creators who share their legal names and general locations. States also operate databases that allow users to check if someone is licensed to practice medicine or has been disciplined for misconduct.",
      "If an influencer holding the appropriate credentials pushes certain products, consumers still may want to consider if a brand partnership or other factors are shaping their recommendations.",
      "Federal Trade Commission guidelines that reflected the agency's interpretation of federal law directed influencers featuring specific products or services to prominently disclose any endorsements. Yet sponsorships and potential conflicts of interest are not always revealed.",
      "In 2023, the year the guidelines were issued, the FTC issued warnings to a dozen online influencers for failing to adequately disclose paid social media posts that promoted \u201csugar-containing products\u201d and aspartame, a sweetener found in diet soda, ice cream and other foods. Some of the influencers were registered dieticians.",
      "If a creator cites studies to support health and diet claims, it\u2019s best to check and see if what they\u2019re saying aligns with the latest evidence-based medical consensus.",
      "\u201cJust because somebody has an \u2018M.D.\u2019 after their name doesn\u2019t make them entirely trustworthy,\u201d said Elias Aboujaoude, a psychiatrist and Stanford University professor who studies the intersection of psychology and technology.",
      "Aboujaoude suggests double-checking health claims with traditionally reputable sources, such as major academic institutions or government health agencies. He also advised looking at studies cited by creators and assessing whether they\u2019ve been published in reputable journals and subjected to peer review.",
      "In some cases, it might be too soon to know if promising results should be trusted or not, said Katherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian with the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. For example, a study might show the benefits of a specific type of herb. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the findings have been replicated in other research, a requirement for treatment methods to be considered proven effective, she said.",

      "But while the Democratic Party is largely divided over the path forward after last year's election losses, party leaders agree that, no matter the message, how they connect with voters in the digital media landscape will be key to a political comeback.",
      "More than a dozen Democratic senators, asked about the party\u2019s digital strategy, pointed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey as the architect of their new push.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous growth of Democratic senators now. They\u2019re engaging in the tools and strategies necessary to elevate their voice in a new, changing media market, where legacy media is not the place that people get their news now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cWe\u2019re just weeks into this, but just by making key changes ... we\u2019re seeing a massive growth in engagement with the content that our senators are creating, and we\u2019ve only just begun.\"",
      "Booker said he's aiming for Democratic senators to double online engagement with their content over the next year \u2014 and early metrics have been noticeable. Democratic senators racked up more than 87 million views on content they published in response to Trump's joint address to Congress, according to Booker's office.",
      "Not all of that online engagement is positive. After more than two dozen Democratic senators posted identical scripted videos knocking Trump's speech, saying he should have addressed the cost of living and his support for billionaire adviser Elon Musk, conservatives mocked them as inauthentic and out of touch.",
      "\"They are all actors reading a script,\" Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "There's no doubt that Democrats are playing catch-up. Trump and his fellow Republicans built a digital operation that fed on bombast and celebrity, and it's a strategy they've taken with them to the White House. Official government accounts are new filled with right-wing memes, cinematic videos and pugnacious statements.",
      "The Democratic embrace of influencers has also yielded mixed early results. Democrats were ridiculed online after a food and wellness influencer who attended the House Democrats' creators event created a \u201cChoose Your Fighter\" video collage of Democratic congresswomen for Women's History Month.",
      "The White House posted a video in response that read \u201cAmerica chose its fighters last November,\u201d and the Pentagon, normally known for being studiously non-partisan, posted a video stating \u201cWe chose our fighters a long time ago.\u201d",
      "But Booker and other Democratic leaders don't consider the sneers to be a downside. Missteps are to be expected, they say, but the path to Americans' attention will require some discomfort from lawmakers.",
      "\u201cI do think that the caucus as a whole is trying to figure out how we show people that we are real people,\u201d said Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, one of the congresswomen featured in the viral \u201cFighter\u201d video. Crockett, whose posts regularly garner millions of views online, said she was used to criticism for her often frank statements and was more interested in combating perceptions that Democrats are \u201celitist\u201d or \u201crobotic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn't like the jumping, I'm going to be honest, though,\u201d Crockett added about the viral \u201cChoose Your Fighter\u201d video.",
      "Democrats adopted a more combative stance online in recent weeks as Trump's moves to slash the federal workforce drew protests from liberals and pushback at GOP town halls. Top Democratic digital operatives who worked for the 2024 presidential campaign of then-Vice President Kamala Harris have been in high demand, with many Democrats anticipating close 2026 races in which digital strategies may be key.",
      "Some of the most prominent Democrats across the country have been engaging more in new media since the election. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York has touted the party's message on progressive podcasts over the last month, including from the comedian Jon Stewart and the progressive outlet MeidasTouch. Clips of those videos were also lampooned online but garnered millions of views.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential Democratic presidential contender in 2028, has launched a podcast of his own on which he has welcomed close Trump allies like the right-wing activist Charlie Kirk and former Trump aide Steve Bannon to discuss hot-button political topics.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we hit the podcasters that normally don\u2019t have Democrats on there,\u201d said Rep. Derek Tran, a Democrat from a competitive California House district. \u201cThe ones that are more right-leaning or independent, and be able to address a crowd and an audience that\u2019s not typical for the Democratic base.\u201d",
      "Some House Democrats have expressed frustration that the guidance from Democratic leaders about social media is too vague, while others grumble that leaders are too prescriptive in their approach to messaging on platforms they don\u2019t intuitively understand. Meanwhile, Democratic strategists have cautioned lawmakers that garnering attention online is secondary to the goal of using social media as a tool in specific policy fights and campaigns.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a fine line before we\u2019re being cringe and trying too hard and seeming too thirsty. I think the most important thing in any of this is being as authentic and genuine as we can be,\u201d said Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to authenticity, it also means leaning into what makes each of us unique. Like many of my colleagues probably should not be doing \u2018get ready with me\u2019 videos. It would look super cringe. But I\u2019m a 36-year-old woman, and I do my makeup all the time, and I watch a lot of makeup tutorial videos, so it makes sense for me to do it,\u201d said Jacobs.",
      "Some Democrats think that the party's messaging strategy hinges as much on the messengers as the medium it\u2019s communicated on.",
      "\u201cIf you know how to talk to people, it doesn\u2019t matter what medium is going to exist,\u201d said Sen. Ruben Gallego, a freshman Democratic senator from Arizona. \u201cYou could be the best freaking spokesperson in the world, but if you don\u2019t know how to talk to working-class people, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have the best TikTok following, it\u2019s just not going to translate.\u201d",

      "Millions of the tiny bugs have invaded Orbetello, a speck of land that juts out into the Orbetello lagoon, a natural reserve off Tuscany's coast between the Tyrrhenian Sea and Monte Argentario.",
      "Fishermen say the swarms began about three weeks ago and blame a 2024 mass die-off of juvenile fish, known as fry, that are the main predators of midge larvae. Similar invasions have occurred in the past, and fishermen say the die-offs are the result of overall oxygen depletion in the lagoon ecosystem.",

      "\u201cWe cannot take a walk in the open air. We cannot open the windows. We are segregated in the house\" like during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the petition read. It blamed ineffective management of the lagoon for the calamity.",
      "Pier Luigi Piro, president of the Orbetello fishermen cooperative, said that the lagoon ecosystem needs serious infrastructural investments to clean out canals and favor the exchange of water between the lagoon and the Tyrrhenian. He said that he hoped that the consortium of the mayor's office and trade groups that have come together to deal with the crisis gets to work as soon as possible.",
      "\u201cEverything we're doing, we hope to have a serene tourist season, otherwise beyond the damage a lot of activities will risk closure,\u201d he warned.",

      "An experimental treatment appears to delay Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms in some people genetically destined to get the disease in their 40s or 50s, according to new findings from ongoing research now caught up in Trump administration funding delays.",
      "The early results \u2014 a scientific first \u2014 were published Wednesday even as study participants worried that politics could cut their access to a possible lifeline.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still a study but it has given me an extension to my life that I never banked on having,\u201d said Jake Heinrichs of New York City.",
      "Now 50, Heinrichs has been treated in that study for more than a decade and remains symptom-free despite inheriting an Alzheimer\u2019s-causing gene that killed his father and brother around the same age.",
      "If blocked funding stops Heinrichs\u2019 doses, \u201chow much time do we have?\u201d asked his wife, Rachel Chavkin. \u201cThis trial is life.\u201d",
      "Two drugs sold in the U.S. can modestly slow worsening of early-stage Alzheimer\u2019s by clearing the brain of one of its hallmarks, a sticky gunk called amyloid. But until now, there haven't been hints that removing amyloid far earlier \u2013 many years before the first symptoms appear \u2013 just might postpone the disease.",
      "The research led by Washington University in St. Louis involves families that pass down rare gene mutations almost guaranteeing they\u2019ll develop symptoms at the same age their affected relatives did \u2013 information that helps scientists tell if treatments are having any effect.",
      "The new findings center on a subset of 22 participants who received amyloid-removing drugs the longest, on average eight years. Long-term amyloid removal cut in half their risk of symptom onset, researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Lancet Neurology.",
      "Despite the study\u2019s small size, \u201cit\u2019s incredibly important,\u201d said Northwestern University neuroscientist David Gate, who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Now participants have been switched from an earlier experimental drug to Leqembi, an IV treatment approved in the U.S., to try to answer the obvious next question.",
      "\u201cWhat we want to determine over the next five years is how strong is the protection,\u201d said Washington University\u2019s Dr. Randall Bateman, who directs the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer\u2019s Network of studies involving families with these rare genes. \u201cWill they ever get the symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease if we keep treating them?\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s the worry: Bateman raised money to start that confirmatory study while seeking National Institutes of Health funding for the full project but his grant has been delayed as required reviews were canceled. It's one example of how millions of dollars in research have been stalled as NIH grapples with funding restrictions and mass firings.",
      "At the same time researchers wonder if NIH will shift focus away from amyloid research after comments by Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, nominated as the agency's new director.",
      "\u201cOne of the reasons I think that we have not made progress in Alzheimer\u2019s, as much as we ought to have, is because the NIH has not supported a sufficiently wide range of hypotheses,\u201d Bhattacharya told senators, responding to one who brought up an example of earlier science misconduct unrelated to current research.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know exactly what causes Alzheimer\u2019s, a mind-destroying disease that affects nearly 7 million Americans, mostly late in life. What\u2019s clear is that silent changes occur in the brain at least two decades before the first symptoms -- and that sticky amyloid is a major contributor. At some point amyloid buildup appears to trigger a protein named tau to begin killing neurons, which drives cognitive decline.",
      "Tau-fighting drugs now are being tested. Researchers also are studying other factors including inflammation, the brain\u2019s immune cells and certain viruses.",
      "NIH\u2019s focus expanded as researchers found more potential culprits. In 2013, NIH\u2019s National Institute on Aging funded 14 trials of possible Alzheimer\u2019s drugs, over a third targeting amyloid. By last fall, there were 68 drug trials and about 18% targeted amyloid.",
      "Northwestern\u2019s Gate counts himself among scientists who \u201cthink amyloid isn\u2019t everything,\u201d but said nothing has invalidated the amyloid hypothesis. He recently used brain tissue preserved from an old amyloid study to learn how immune cells called microglia can clear those plaques and then switch to helping the brain heal, possible clues for improving today's modest therapies.",
      "For now, amyloid clearly is implicated somehow and families with Alzheimer's-causing genes are helping answer a critical question for anyone at risk: Can blocking amyloid buildup really stave off symptoms? Without NIH funding, Bateman said, that opportunity will be lost.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane,\u201d said longtime study participant June Ward, who lives near Asheville, North Carolina, and plans to ask friends to complain to lawmakers.",
      "Ward turns 64 in June and is healthy, two years older than when her mother's symptoms appeared. \u201cIt is exciting to think about the possibility that Alzheimer\u2019s disease might not be what gets me,\u201d she said.",
      "In New York, Heinrichs said he has hope that his 3-year-old son won\u2019t \u201cexperience the stress and sorrow that I lived through as a young man to watch my father fade away.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need the NIH to be not politicized,\u201d added Chavkin, his wife. \u201cIt\u2019s just about keeping people alive or helping them live better. And in this case, it\u2019s helping my husband survive.\u201d",

      "But Amazon has long disputed it qualifies as a \u201cdistributor\u201d of products offered by other sellers. In its lawsuit filed on March 14, the company maintained it serves as a \u201cthird-party logistics provider\" and therefore should not be held liable for recalls of products that were made, owned and sold by others.",
      "The commission sued Amazon in 2021 for allegedly distributing hazardous items, accusing the company of putting consumer safety at risk by failing to properly notify the public about recalled products that included defective carbon monoxide detectors and flammable children\u2019s pajamas.",
      "Amazon said in its lawsuit that it issued previous recall notices and some refunds shortly after the CPSC raised safety concerns several years ago. The company argues the commission is an \u201cunconstitutionally structured agency\u201d that overstepped its authority with the new directive.",
      "\u201cThe remedies ordered by the CPSC are largely duplicative of the steps we took several years ago to protect customers, which are the same steps we take whenever we learn about unsafe products,\u201d Amazon said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. The Seattle-based company said it could not comment further on its lawsuit filed last week.",
      "Amazon and Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX also have active lawsuits challenging the structure of the National Labor Relations Board as unconstitutional. The two companies initiated the cases after the labor agency filed complaints against them in disputes about workers\u2019 rights and union organizing.",
      "The Consumer Product Safety Commission declined to comment Wednesday on Amazon's lawsuit complaint. In a Jan. 17 statement about the hazardous products order, Commissioner Richard L. Trumka Jr. said it was the CPSC's job to \u201chold companies like Amazon accountable\" and \u201cno company is above the law.\u201d",

      "States and cities across the country are grappling with how to stay on the right side of government transparency laws as the use of encrypted messaging apps becomes more widespread",
      "As a devastating wildfire burned through a Maui town, killing more than 100 people, emergency management employees traded dozens of text messages, creating a record that would later help investigators piece together the government's response to the 2023 tragedy.",
      "One text exchange hinted officials might also be using a second, untraceable messaging service.",
      "\u201cThat's what Signal was supposed to be for,\u201d then-Maui Emergency Management Agency Administrator Herman Andaya texted a colleague.",
      "Signal is one of many end-to-end encrypted messaging apps that include message auto-delete functions.",
      "While such apps promise increased security and privacy, they often skirt open records laws meant to increase transparency around and public awareness of government decision-making. Without special archiving software, the messages frequently aren't returned under public information requests.",
      "An Associated Press review in all 50 states found accounts on encrypted platforms registered to cellphone numbers for over 1,100 government workers and elected officials.",
      "It's unclear if Maui officials actually used the app or simply considered it \u2014 a county spokesperson did not respond to questions \u2014 but the situation highlights a growing challenge: How can government entities use technological advancements for added security while staying on the right side of public information laws?",
      "The AP found accounts for state, local and federal officials in nearly every state, including many legislators and their staff, but also staff for governors, state attorneys general, education departments and school board members.",
      "The AP is not naming the officials because having an account is neither against the rules in most states, nor proof they use the apps for government business. While many of those accounts were registered to government cellphone numbers, some were registered to personal numbers. The AP's list is likely incomplete because users can make accounts unsearchable.",
      "Improper use of the apps has been reported over the past decade in places like Missouri, Oregon, Oklahoma, Maryland and elsewhere, almost always because of leaked messages.",
      "Public officials and private citizens are consistently warned about hacking and data leaks, but technologies designed to increase privacy often decrease government transparency.",
      "Apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Confide, Telegram and others use encryption to scramble messages so only the intended end-user can read them, and they typically aren\u2019t stored on government servers. Some automatically delete messages, and some prevent users from screenshotting or sharing messages.",
      "\u201cThe fundamental problem is that people do have a right to use encrypted apps for their personal communications, and have those on their personal devices. That\u2019s not against the law,\u201d said Matt Kelly, editor of Radical Compliance, a newsletter that focuses on corporate compliance and governance issues. \u201cBut how would an organization be able to distinguish how an employee is using it?\u201d",
      "The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, has recommended that \u201chighly valued targets\u201d \u2014 senior officials who handle sensitive information \u2014 use encryption apps for confidential communications. Those communications are not typically releasable under public record laws.",
      "CISA leaders also say encrypted communications could be a useful security measure for the public, but did not encourage government officials to use the apps to skirt public information laws.",
      "Journalists, including many at the AP, often use encrypted messages when talking to sources or whistleblowers.",
      "While some cities and states are grappling with how to stay transparent, public record laws aren\u2019t evolving as quickly as technology, said Smarsh general manager Lanika Mamac. The Portland, Oregon-based company helps governments and businesses archive digital communications.",
      "\u201cPeople are worried more about cybersecurity attacks. They\u2019re trying to make sure it\u2019s secure,\u201d Mamac said. \u201cI think that they are really trying to figure out, \u2018How do I balance being secure and giving transparency?\u2019\u201d",
      "Mamac said Smarsh has seen an uptick in inquiries, mostly from local governments. But many others have done little to restrict the apps or clarify rules for their use.",
      "In 2020, the New Mexico Child, Youth and Families Department\u2019s new division director told employees to use the app Signal for internal communications and to delete messages after 24 hours. A 2021 investigation into the possible violation of New Mexico\u2019s document retention rules was followed by a court settlement with two whistleblowers and the division director's departure.",
      "But New Mexico still lacks regulations on using encrypted apps. The AP's review found at least three department or agency directors had Signal accounts as of December 2024.",
      "In Michigan, State Police leaders were found in 2021 to be using Signal on state-issued cellphones. Michigan lawmakers responded by banning the use of encrypted messaging apps on state employees\u2019 work-issued devices if they hinder public record requests.",
      "However, Michigan's law did not include penalties for violations, and monitoring the government-owned devices used by 48,000 executive branch employees is a monumental task.",
      "The best remedy is stronger public record laws, said David Cuillier, director of the Brechner Freedom of Information Project at the University of Florida. Most state laws already make clear that the content of communication \u2014 not the method \u2014 is what makes something a public record, but many of those laws lack teeth, he said.",
      "\u201cThey should only be using apps if they are able to report the communications and archive them like any other public record,\u201d he said.",
      "Generally, Cuillier said, there\u2019s been a decrease in government transparency over the past few decades. To reverse that, governments could create independent enforcement agencies, add punishments for violations, and create a transparent culture that supports technology, he said.",
      "\u201cWe used to be a beacon of light when it came to transparency. Now, we\u2019re not. We have lost our way,\u201d Cuillier said.",

      "Dozens of companies and academic groups are pitching the same theory: that sinking rocks, nutrients, crop waste or seaweed in the ocean could lock away climate-warming carbon dioxide for centuries or more",
      "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia -- From the grounds of a gas-fired power plant on the eastern shores of Canada, a little-known company is pumping a slurry of minerals into the ocean in the name of stopping climate change.",
      "Whether it\u2019s pollution or a silver bullet that will save the planet may depend on whom you ask.",
      "From shore, a pipe releases a mixture of water and magnesium oxide \u2014 a powdery white mineral used in everything from construction to heartburn pills that Planetary Technologies, based in Nova Scotia, is betting will absorb more planet-warming gases into the sea.",
      "\u201cRestore the climate. Heal the ocean,\u201d reads the motto stamped on a shipping container nearby.",
      "Planetary is part of a growing industry racing to engineer a solution to global warming using the absorbent power of the oceans. It is backed by $1 million from Elon Musk\u2019s foundation and competing for a prize of $50 million more.",
      "Dozens of other companies and academic groups are pitching the same theory: that sinking rocks, nutrients, crop waste or seaweed in the ocean could lock away climate-warming carbon dioxide for centuries or more. Nearly 50 field trials have taken place in the past four years, with startups raising hundreds of millions in early funds.",
      "But the field remains rife with debate over the consequences for the oceans if the strategies are deployed at large scale, and over the exact benefits for the climate. Critics say the efforts are moving too quickly and with too few guardrails.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the Wild West. Everybody is on the bandwagon, everybody wants to do something,\u201d said Adina Paytan, who teaches earth and ocean science at the University of California, Santa Cruz.",
      "Planetary, like most of the ocean startups, is financing its work by selling carbon credits \u2014 or tokens representing one metric ton of carbon dioxide removed from the air. Largely unregulated and widely debated, carbon credits have become popular this century as a way for companies to purchase offsets rather than reduce emissions themselves. Most credits are priced at several hundred dollars apiece.",
      "The industry sold more than 340,000 marine carbon credits last year, up from just 2,000 credits four years ago, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi. But that amount of carbon removal is a tiny fraction of what scientists say will be required to keep the planet livable for centuries to come.",
      "Those leading the efforts, including Will Burt, Planetary\u2019s chief ocean scientist, acknowledge they\u2019re entering uncharted territory \u2014 but say the bigger danger for the planet and the oceans is not moving quickly enough.",
      "\u201cWe need to understand if it\u2019s going to work or not. The faster we do, the better.\u201d",
      "Efforts to capture carbon dioxide have exploded in recent years.",
      "Most climate models now show that cutting emissions won\u2019t be enough to curb global warming, according to the United Nations\u2019 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The world needs to actively remove heat-trapping gases, as well \u2014 and the ocean could be a logical place to capture them.",
      "Money has already poured into different strategies on land \u2014 among them, pumping carbon dioxide from the air, developing sites to store carbon underground and replanting forests, which naturally store CO2. But many of those projects are limited by space and could impact nearby communities. The ocean already regulates Earth\u2019s climate by absorbing heat and carbon, and by comparison, it seems limitless.",
      "\u201cIs that huge surface area an option to help us deal with and mitigate the worst effects of climate change?\u201d asked Adam Subhas, who is leading a carbon removal project with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, based on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.",
      "On a Tuesday afternoon along the edge of Halifax Harbour, Burt stashed his bike helmet and donned a hard hat to give two engineering students a tour of Planetary\u2019s site.",
      "A detached truck trailer sat in a clearing, storing massive bags of magnesium oxide mined in Spain and shipped across the Atlantic to Canada.",
      "Most companies looking offshore for climate solutions are trying to reduce or transform the carbon dioxide stored in the ocean. If they can achieve that, Burt said, the oceans will act \u201clike a vacuum\u201d to absorb more gases from the air.",
      "Planetary is using magnesium oxide to create that vacuum. When dissolved into seawater, it transforms carbon dioxide from a gas to stable molecules that won\u2019t interact with the atmosphere for thousands of years. Limestone, olivine and other alkaline rocks have the same effect.",
      "Other companies are focused on growing seaweed and algae to capture the gas. These marine organisms act like plants on land, absorbing carbon dioxide from the ocean just as trees do from the air. The company Gigablue, for instance, has begun pouring nutrients in New Zealand waters to grow tiny organisms known as phytoplankton where they otherwise couldn\u2019t survive.",
      "Still others view the deepest parts of the ocean as a place to store organic material that would emit greenhouse gases if left on land.",
      "Companies have sunk wood chips off the coast of Iceland and are planning to sink Sargassum, a yellowish-brown seaweed, to extreme depths. The startup Carboniferous is preparing a federal permit to place sugarcane pulp at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, also referred to as the Gulf of America as declared by President Donald Trump.",
      "Though Planetary's work can sound like some \u201cscary science experiment,\u201d Burt said, the company\u2019s testing so far suggests that magnesium oxide poses minimal risks to marine ecosystems, plankton or fish. The mineral has long been used at water treatment plants and industrial facilities to de-acidify water.",
      "Halifax Harbour is just one location where Planetary hopes to operate. The company has set up another site at a wastewater treatment plant in coastal Virginia and plans to begin testing in Vancouver later this year.",
      "According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, the industry needs to remove billions of tons of carbon dioxide per year by mid-century to meet climate goals set nearly a decade ago during the Paris climate agreement.",
      "\u201cThe whole point here is to mitigate against a rapidly accelerating climate crisis,\u201d Burt said. \u201cWe have to act with safety and integrity, but we also have to act fast.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s broad enthusiasm in the industry, coastal communities aren\u2019t always quick to jump on board.",
      "In North Carolina, a request to dump shiploads of olivine near the beachside town of Duck prompted questions that downsized the project by more than half.",
      "The company Vesta, formed in 2021, promotes the greenish-hued mineral as a tool to draw down carbon into the ocean and create mounds that buffer coastal towns from storm surges and waves.",
      "During the permitting process, officials at the state Wildlife Resources Commission, Division of Marine Fisheries and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service raised a long list of concerns.",
      "\u201cAs proposed, the project is a short term study with the potential for long term impacts and no remediation plans,\u201d a field supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service wrote. The agencies said olivine could smother the seafloor ecosystem and threaten a hotspot for sea turtles and Atlantic sturgeon.",
      "Vesta CEO Tom Green said the company never expected its original application to be approved as written. \u201cIt\u2019s more the start of a dialogue with regulators and the community,\u201d he said.",
      "The project went forward last summer with a much smaller scope, a restoration plan, and more detailed requirements to monitor deep-water species. Eight thousand metric tons of olivine shipped from Norway are now submerged beneath North Carolina\u2019s waves.",
      "Green said he understands why people are skeptical, and that he tries to remind them Vesta\u2019s goal is to save the environment, not to harm it. It\u2019s the company\u2019s job, he says, \u201cto show up in local communities, physically show up, and listen and share our data and build trust that way.\u201d",
      "Fishing communities have opposed another climate project led by Subhas of the Woods Hole research center that has generated 10 months of conversation and debate.",
      "The project as proposed last spring would have poured 66,000 gallons of sodium hydroxide solution into ocean waters near Cape Cod. Woods Hole later proposed downsizing the project to use less than 17,000 gallons of the chemical, with federal approval still pending.",
      "In two separate reviews, the Environmental Protection Agency said it believes the project\u2019s scientific merit outweighs the environmental risks, and noted it doesn\u2019t foresee \u201cunacceptable impacts\u201d on water quality or fishing.",
      "But fifth-generation fisherman Jerry Leeman III wants to know what will happen to the lobster, pollock and flounder eggs that float in the water column and on the ocean surface if they are suddenly doused with the harsh chemical.",
      "\u201cAre you telling all the fishermen not to fish in this area while you\u2019re doing this project? And who compensates these individuals for displacing everybody?\u201d he said.",
      "Subhas\u2019 team expects the chemical\u2019s most potent concentrations to last for less than two minutes in the ocean before it\u2019s diluted. They\u2019ve also agreed to delay or relocate the project if schools of fish or patches of fish eggs are visible in the surrounding waters.",
      "Sarah Schumann, who fishes commercially for bluefish in Rhode Island and leads a campaign for \u201cfishery friendly\u201d climate action, said after attending four listening sessions she\u2019s still unsure how to balance her support for the research with the apprehension she hears in the fishing community.",
      "\u201cIf I was actually trying to decide where I land on this issue, I\u2019d be twisted in knots,\u201d she said.",
      "And Planetary, which has seen little pushback from locals along Halifax Harbour, faced a series of protests against a climate project it proposed in Cornwall, England.",
      "In April last year, more than a hundred people marched along a beach carrying signs that read \u201cKeep our sea chemical free.\u201d",
      "Sue Sayer, who runs a research group studying seals, said she realized in discussions with Planetary that \u201cthey had no idea about what animals or plants or species live in St. Ives Bay.\u201d The company\u2019s initial release of magnesium hydroxide into the bay, she said, fired up a community that is \u201cmassively, scientifically passionate about the sea.\u201d",
      "David Santillo, a senior scientist with Greenpeace Research Laboratories at the University of Exeter, took issue with how Planetary proposed tracking the impact of its work. According to a recorded presentation viewed by AP, the company\u2019s baseline measurements in Cornwall were drawn from just a few days.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a baseline over a number of years and seasons,\u201d Santillo said, \u201cyou don\u2019t know whether you would even be able to detect any of your effects.\u201d",
      "An audit commissioned by the United Kingdom\u2019s Environment Agency found that Planetary\u2019s experiments posed a \u201cvery low\u201d risk to marine life, and a potential for significant carbon removal.",
      "Still, the company put its proposal to pump another 200 metric tons of minerals on pause. Following a government recommendation, Planetary said it would search for a source of magnesium hydroxide closer to the Cornwall site, rather than shipping it from China. It also assured locals that it wouldn\u2019t sell carbon credits from its past chemical release.",
      "Sara Nawaz, research director at American University\u2019s Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal, said she understood why scientists sometimes struggle to connect with communities and gain their support. Early research shows the public is reluctant to the idea of \u201cengineering\u201d the climate.",
      "Many people have a strong emotional connection to the ocean, she added. There\u2019s a fear that once you put something in the ocean, \u201cyou can\u2019t take it back.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just locals who have questions about whether these technologies will work. Scientists, too, have acknowledged major unknowns. But some of the principles behind the technologies have been studied for decades by now, and the laboratory can only simulate so much.",
      "During a recent EPA listening session about the Woods Hole project, a chorus of oceanographers and industry supporters said it\u2019s time for ocean-scale tests.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to move ahead and conduct this work,\u201d said Ken Buesseler, another Woods Hole scientist who studies the carbon captured by algae.",
      "Even so, the ocean is a dynamic, challenging landscape to work in. Scientists are still uncovering new details about how it absorbs and recycles carbon, and any materials they add to seawater are liable to sink, become diluted or wash away to other locations, challenging efforts to track how the ocean responds.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to get the ocean to do what you want it to,\u201d said Sarah Cooley, a carbon cycle scientist who has worked for the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy and the federal government.",
      "Katja Fennel, chair of the oceanography department at Dalhousie University, works on modeling how much carbon Planetary has captured in Halifax Harbour\u2014 a number that comes with some uncertainty.",
      "She co-leads a group of academics that monitors the company\u2019s project using water samples, sensors and sediment cores taken from locations around the bay. Some days, her team adds a red dye to the pipes to watch how the minerals dissolve and flow out to sea.",
      "The models are necessary to simulate what would happen if Planetary did nothing, Fennel said. They\u2019re also necessary because the ocean is so large and deep it\u2019s impossible to collect enough data to give a complete picture of it.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t measure everywhere all the time,\u201d she said.",
      "Questions also linger about how long the carbon capture will last.",
      "It\u2019s a point especially important to companies working with algae, wood chips, or other organic materials, because depending on where they decompose, they could release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.",
      "The deeper the plants and algae sink, the longer the carbon stays locked away. But that\u2019s no easy feat to ensure. Running Tide, a now-shuttered company that sank nearly 20,000 metric tons of wood chips in Icelandic waters, said carbon could be sequestered for as long as three millennia or as little as 50 years.",
      "Even if these solutions do work long term, most companies are operating on too small of a scale to influence the climate. Expanding to meet current climate goals will take massive amounts of resources, energy and money.",
      "\u201cThe question is, what happens when you scale it up to billions of tons every year?\u201d said David Ho, co-founder and chief science officer of the nonprofit (C)Worthy, which works on verifying the impact of ocean-based carbon removal. \u201cAnd that\u2019s still to be determined.\u201d",
      "Planetary\u2019s Burt imagines a future in which minerals are pumped out through power plants and water treatment facilities on every major coastline in the world. But that would require a large, steady volume of magnesium oxide or similar minerals, along with the energy to mine and transport them.",
      "Seaweed and algae growth would need to expand exponentially. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine has estimated that nearly two-thirds of the world\u2019s coastline would need to be encircled by kelp to even begin to make a dent in global warming. The company Seafields, which is running tests in the Caribbean, says it envisions building a Sargassum farm between Brazil and West Africa more than 200 miles wide.",
      "There\u2019s the risk that these expansions exacerbate environmental harm that isn\u2019t detectable in small trials, and because of global water circulation, could be felt around the world.",
      "But the alternative to never trying, Ho said, is unabated climate change.",
      "Late last year, Planetary announced that its Nova Scotia project successfully captured 138 metric tons of carbon \u2013 allowing it to deliver exactly 138 carbon credits to two of the company\u2019s early investors, Shopify and Stripe.",
      "Monetizing the work is uncomfortable for many who study the ocean.",
      "\u201cOn one hand, it\u2019s encouraging more research and more science, which is good. On the other hand, it\u2019s opening doors for abuse of the system,\u201d said Paytan, the Santa Cruz professor, who has been contacted by several startups asking to collaborate.",
      "She pointed to companies that are accused of drastically overestimating the carbon they sequestered, though they bragged of restoring rainforests in Peru and replacing smoke-producing stoves in Africa.",
      "But absent more government-funded research, several companies told AP there\u2019s little way for the field to advance without selling credits.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s the way we\u2019ve set things up now, is that we put it in the hands of these startups to develop the techniques,\u201d said Ho.",
      "Back in his shipping container office along Halifax Harbour, Burt said he understood the unease around selling credits, and said Planetary takes seriously the need to operate openly, responsibly and cautiously. But he also says there\u2019s a need for startups that can move at a faster pace than academia.",
      "\u201cWe cannot study this solution at the same rate that we\u2019ve been studying the problems,\u201d he said. He says there\u2019s not enough time.",
      "Last year marked the hottest year in Earth\u2019s history, even as global carbon emissions are projected to reach another all-time high.",
      "\u201cWe need to reduce emissions urgently, drastically,\u201d said Fennel, the researcher studying Planetary\u2019s project. \u201cAny removal of CO2 from the atmosphere is much more difficult and costly than avoiding CO2 emissions to begin with.\u201d",
      "The industry continues to push forward. Planetary said in February that it had sequestered a total of 1,000 metric tons of carbon in the ocean, and Carboniferous completed its first test of sinking sugarcane to the seafloor. Early this year, Gigablue signed a deal for 200,000 carbon credits for dispersing nutrient-filled particles in the ocean.",
      "A growing number of companies are also using electricity to alter seawater molecules, with the same goal of prompting the ocean to absorb more carbon dioxide. The startup Ebb Carbon recently struck a deal with Microsoft to provide up to 350,000 carbon credits, and Captura, which is funded in part by investors affiliated with oil and gas production, expanded its operations from California to Hawaii.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the U.S. government will stall or support ocean climate work going forward. The policy landscape continues to shift as the Trump administration seeks to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations and reconsider the scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health.",
      "Though White House adviser Musk has downplayed some of his past statements about global warming, four years ago his foundation committed $100 million to fund a competition for the best solution for carbon capture, of which Planetary is in the running for the top prize.",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists are homing in on the nature of a mysterious force called dark energy, and nothing short of the fate of the universe hangs in the balance.",
      "The force is enormous \u2014 it makes up nearly 70% of the universe. And it is powerful \u2014 it is pushing all the stars and galaxies away from each other at an ever faster rate.",
      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, which scientists have long thought, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe\u2019s history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",
      "Called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, the collaboration released its first analysis of 6 million galaxies and quasars last year and has now added more data, bringing the count to nearly 15 million. Their updated results, taken with other measurements \u2014 exploding stars, leftover light from the young universe and distortions in galaxy shape \u2014 support the idea presented last year that dark energy may be waning.",
      "\u201cIt's moving from a really surprising finding to almost a moment where we have to throw out how we've thought about cosmology and start over,\u201d said Bhuvnesh Jain, a cosmologist with the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with the research.",
      "It's not time to completely rule out the idea that dark energy is constant because the new results are still shy of the gold standard level of statistical proof physics requires. The collaboration aims to map around 50 million galaxies and quasars by the end of its survey in 2026. And other efforts around the globe have an eye on dark energy and aim to release their own data in the coming years, including the European Space Agency\u2019s Euclid mission and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile.",
      "\u201cWe want to see several different collaborations having similar measurements\u201d at that gold standard to be sure that dark energy is weakening, said cosmologist Kris Pardo with the University of Southern California who was not involved with the new research.",
      "If dark energy is constant, scientists say our universe may continue to expand forever, growing ever colder, lonelier and still.",
      "If dark energy ebbs with time, which now seems plausible, the universe could one day stop expanding and then eventually collapse on itself in what\u2019s called the Big Crunch. It might not seem like the cheeriest fate, but it offers some closure, said cosmologist and study collaborator Mustapha Ishak-Boushaki of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
      "\u201cNow, there is the possibility that everything comes to an end,\u201d he said. \u201cWould we consider that a good or bad thing? I don\u2019t know.\u201d",

      "The Texas death was the first measles death recorded in the U.S. in a decade, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "A possible second measles death was recorded after an unvaccinated New Mexico resident tested positive for the virus following their death. The New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) said the official cause of death is still under investigation.",
      "The CDC has confirmed 378 measles cases this year in at least 17 states: Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont and Washington. This is likely an undercount due to delays in states reporting cases to the federal health agency.",
      "The majority of nationally confirmed cases, about 95%, are in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown, the CDC said. Of those cases, 3% are among those who received just one dose of the MMR inoculation and 2% are among those who received the required two doses, according to the CDC.",
      "The CDC currently recommends that people receive two vaccine doses, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need a booster.",
      "For those living in the outbreak area, Texas health officials are recommending that parents consider an early dose of the MMR vaccine for children between 6 months and 11 months, and that adults receive a second MMR dose if they only received one in the past.",

    "story": [
      "The White House said Monday the group chat \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "The Trump administration is under scrutiny after The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg said he was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat that included top national security officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in which the officials discussed plans for a U.S. attack on Houthis in Yemen.",
      "Goldberg revealed the mishap in a piece for the magazine on Monday and told ABC News that he was apparently added to the chat by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "Below is a timeline spanning from the creation of the group chat to what has happened since.",
      "In an interview with \"ABC News Live\" Monday evening, Goldberg told Linsey Davis he received a message request on the Signal app from White House national security adviser Mike Waltz, or someone \"who's purporting to be Mike Waltz\" on March 11.",
      "He said the invitation was \"not an unusual thing in Washington.\"",
      "\"I'm a journalist, I've met him in the past, so I accept it,\" he told ABC News.",
      "Goldberg said he accepted the request, with nothing occurring until several days later, when he was added to a \"group of seemingly very high national security officials of the United States\" including Vice President JD Vance, with Waltz apparently creating this chat.",
      "\"Mike Waltz puts this group together and says it's a planning group for essentially upcoming action in Yemen,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Goldberg told ABC News he initially thought it was a hoax since it would be \"completely absurd to me that the national security leadership of the United States would be meeting on a messaging app to discuss forthcoming military action, and that then they would also invite the editor of The Atlantic magazine to that conversation.\"",
      "Goldberg said a \"long conversation\" occurred between the group chat members on March 14, discussing \"whether or not they should or shouldn't take action in Yemen.\"",
      "The messages went back and forth with \"a lot of resentment directed at European allies of the United States, which obviously enhanced the credibility of this chain,\" Goldberg said.",
      "He said at this point the members of the chat sounded like people he knew within the administration, but still was not sure whether or not it was a hoax.",
      "Goldberg continued to track the incoming messages from the group chat, to see \"who was trying to entrap me or trick me.\" Then on March 15, he said it became \"overwhelmingly clear\" it was a legitimate group chat.",
      "At 11:44 a.m., he said he received a text in the chain from someone claiming to be Hegseth, or \"somebody identified as Pete,\" providing what Goldberg characterized as a war plan. The message included a \"sequencing of events related to an upcoming attack on Yemen\" and promised results by 1:45 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "Goldberg said he was in his car and waiting with his phone to \"see if this was a real thing.\"",
      "\"Sure enough, around 1:50 [p.m.] Eastern time, I see that Yemen is under attack,\" he said.",
      "When the attacks seemed to be \"going well,\" Goldberg said members of the chat began sending congratulatory messages along with fist, fire and American flag emojis.",
      "\"That was the day I realized this is possibly unbelievably the leaders of the United States discussing this on my messaging app,\" Goldberg told ABC News. \"My reaction was, I think I've discovered a massive security breach in the United States national security system.\"",
      "Goldberg said he removed himself from the group chat once the operation was completed.",
      "\"I watched this Yemen operation go from beginning to apparent end, and that was enough for me to learn that there's something wrong in the system here that would allow this information to come so dangerously close to the open wild,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waltz appeared on ABC's \"This Week\" the day after the strikes on Yemen and said the U.S. airstrikes \"took out\" multiple leaders of the Iranian-backed Houthis, which he said differed from the Biden administration's launches against the group.",
      "\"These were not kind of pinprick, back and forth \u2014 what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,\" Waltz said. \"This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible.\"",
      "Goldberg published a story in The Atlantic revealing the mishap, in a piece titled \"The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans.\"",
      "Shortly after the story's publication on Monday afternoon, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes shared with ABC News the statement he provided to The Atlantic confirming the veracity of the Signal group chat.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security,\" Hughes said in a statement.",
      "Speaking to reporters Monday, Hegseth denied he sent war plans in the chat.",
      "\"I've heard how it was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth told reporters in Honolulu while on a layover on his trip to Asia.",
      "Hegseth called Goldberg a \"deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.\"",
      "\"This is the guy that pedals in garbage. This is what he does,\" Hegseth said about Goldberg.",
      "During an event at the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump was asked about Goldberg's article. \"I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic,\" he said.",
      "Top Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries voiced outrage at the administration after this mishap.",
      "\"It is yet another unprecedented example that our nation is increasingly more dangerous because of the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defense,\" Jeffries said in a statement on Monday.",
      "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who faced scrutiny over her alleged use of a private email server while at the State Department, shared her reaction to the Signal group chat on X: \"You have got to be kidding me.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also criticized this breach of military intelligence, urging Senate Republicans to work with Democrats in a \"full investigation\" to look into how this incident occurred.",
      "\"If you were up in arms over unsecure emails years ago, you should certainly be outraged by this amateurish behavior,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor, referencing the scandal over Clinton's emails.",
      "On Tuesday morning, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Goldberg is \"well-known for his sensationalist spin\" and emphasized that \"no 'war plans' were discussed.\"",
      "\"As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg's number was inadvertently added to the thread. Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump,\" Leavitt shared on X.",
      "Trump told NBC News he remains confident in Waltz even after the use of an unsecured group chat.",
      "\"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,\" Trump told NBC correspondent Garrett Haake.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were grilled by Democratic Sen. Mark Werner on Tuesday regarding the mishap. Both officials said while testifying before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence there was no classified information on the chain.",
      "Ratcliffe said he believed the \"national security adviser intended this to be as it should have been, a mechanism for coordinating between senior level officials, but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications for anything that would be classified.\"",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson continued to downplay the mishap but admitted the breach was a \"serious\" mistake on Tuesday.",
      "\"Look, they have acknowledged that there is an error, and they are correcting it. And I would've asked the same thing of the Biden administration,\" Johnson said during a news conference Tuesday morning.",
      "During a White House meeting with ambassadors on Tuesday afternoon, Trump said this incident is \"just something that can happen\" and that there was \"no classified information\" in the group chat.",
      "He added that Signal is \"not a perfect technology.\"",
      "\"Sometimes somebody can get onto those things,\" Trump said. \"That's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones on, which is always the best, frankly.\"",

      "The president and his allies, including billionaire Elon Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency has been at the center of some of the suits, have dismissed many of the orders in interviews and on social media. Musk has called for the impeachment of multiple judges, and Trump has also called for the impeachment of Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.",
      "Boasberg has called on the administration to stop deporting Venezuelans as part of Trump's executive order that invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime authority used to deport noncitizens with little to no due process, as a lawsuit plays out.",

      "Boasberg said during a court hearing over the AEA deportations of Venezuelan migrants to an El Salvadorian prison that the administration's use of the law was \"incredibly troublesome and problematic.\"",
      "\"I agree it's an unprecedented and expanded use of an act that has been used \u2026 in the War of 1812, World War I and World War II, when there was no question there was a declaration of war and who the enemy was,\" Boasberg said.",
      "The judge noted that the Trump administration's arguments about the extent of the president's power are \"awfully frightening\" and a \"long way from\" the intent of the law.",
      "The Trump administration argued that members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the gang's national security risk warranted the use of the 18th century act.",
      "Boasberg vowed to hold the Trump administration accountable, if necessary, if it violated his court order from March 15.",
      "\"The government's not being terribly cooperative at this point, but I will get to the bottom of whether they violated my word and who ordered this and what's the consequence,\" he said.",
      "Boasberg also grilled Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign over his compliance with the court order to turn back the flights already in the air and questioned how the deportation flights were put together.",
      "\"Why is this proclamation essentially signed in the dark on Friday night, early Saturday morning, when people [were] rushed on the plane?\" Boasberg asked. \"To me, the only reason to do that is if you know the problem and you want to get them out of the country before a suit is filed.\"",
      "\"I don't have knowledge of those operational details,\" Ensign said.",
      "Boasberg also raised concerns that the rapid nature of the deportations prevented the men from being able to challenge the allegations that they belonged to Tren de Aragua.",

      "\"I often tell my clerks before they go out into the world to practice law, the most valuable treasure they possess is their reputation and their credibility,\" Boasberg said. \"I just ask you make sure your team [understands] that lesson.\"",
      "Boasberg decided on March 24 that the men who were deported were entitled to due process in court.",
      "\"Federal courts are equipped to adjudicate that question when individuals threatened with detention and removal challenge their designation as such. Because the named Plaintiffs dispute that they are members of Tren de Aragua, they may not be deported until a court has been able to decide the merits of their challenge,\" he wrote.",

      "\"[Fill in the blank] is not fully capable and will hinder combat effectiveness; [fill in the blank] will disrupt unit cohesion and so diminish military effectiveness; allowing [fill in the blank] to serve will undermine training, make it impossible to recruit successfully, and disrupt military order,\" she added.",

      "Alsup bashed the government for submitting a declaration from Ezell he believed to be false but then withdrawing it and making Ezell unavailable for testimony.",
      "\"You withdrew his declaration rather than do that. Come on, that's a sham. It upsets me,\" Alsup said. \"I want you to know that I've been practicing or serving in this court for over 50 years and I know how that we get at the truth, and you're not helping me get to add to the truth. You're giving me press releases, sham documents.\"",
      "Alsup later ruled that thousands of federal workers needed to be rehired.",

      "\"I just want to say it is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie,\" he said. \"That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.\"",
      "If the Trump administration wants to reduce the size of the federal government, it needs to follow the process established in federal law, he said.",

      "His ruling is being appealed by the administration, which asked the Supreme Court on March 24 for an emergency stay.",
      "Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued in her filing that the labor unions and nonprofit groups that challenged the mass firings lack standing, saying they have \"hijacked the employment relationship between the federal government and its workforce.\"",

      "\"I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar can state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It boggles my mind,\" the judge told the DOJ's attorney during the hearing. \"Where were the lawyers when this decision was being made?\"",

      "A federal judge in New York will hear arguments Tuesday over whether to extend an order that prevents Columbia University from the sharing student disciplinary records of a number of pro-Palestinian activists with a House of Representatives committee.",
      "The request for an injunction was filed by a group of Columbia students and graduates, including Mahmoud Khalil, the pro-Palestinian activist detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement who is separately fighting his detention by the Trump administration.",
      "Khalil and the others said the Republican-controlled committee's request for their records violates the First Amendment and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and made Columbia \"feel pressure to cooperate with the government in its efforts to chill and punish protected speech.\"",
      "Judge Aruba Subramanian has temporarily blocked Columbia from disclosing the student records and will hear arguments Tuesday afternoon over whether to permanently block sharing of the records or allow the school to cooperate with the committee.",
      "The government arrested Khalil on March 8 after invoking a rarely used provision of immigration law that they said allows the secretary of state to revoke the legal status of people whose presence in the country could have \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" He continues to be held in Louisiana awaiting further court proceedings.",
      "Last week, Columbia University ceded to Trump administration demands after President Donald Trump threatened to withhold $400 million in federal funds. The school agreed to ban masks on campus, one of the Trump administration's key demands, as well as stricter controls over its Middle East Studies department, which will now be overseen by a new senior vice provost who \"will conduct a thorough review of the portfolio of programs in regional areas across the University, starting immediately with the Middle East.\" The university also agreed to hire 36 new police officers empowered to make arrests of student protesters on campus.",
      "The Trump administration canceled $400 million worth of grants and contracts to Columbia University, accusing the university of \"continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" The administration\u00a0sent a letter\u00a0to Columbia interim President Katrina Armstrong on March 13, listing nine demands the university needed to comply with by last Thursday \"as a precondition for formal negotiations\" regarding federal funding.",
      "Columbia's response was closely watched by other schools that became flashpoints for pro-Palestinian protests last year. The university has come under intense scrutiny for its handling of pro-Palestinian protests, which led to arrests, property damage and backlash.",

    "summary": "Town halls are among the strategies that Democrats are using to try to get their base fired up against the Trump White House.",
    "story": [
      "As Republicans pull back from in-person events, Democrats step into the void.",
      "BETHLEHEM, Pa. -- At a \"People's Town Hall\" on Thursday held by the Democratic National Committee, in a church located in a Pennsylvania district that Democrats lost to Republicans in 2024, party leaders fired up the crowd when slamming the White House and congressional Republicans over Medicaid, federal government cuts, and other issues.",
      "Town halls are among the strategies that Democrats are using to try to get their base fired up against the Trump White House -- but attendees there and at other events say they're still looking for the Democratic Party to take on Republicans more directly.",
      "DNC chair Ken Martin, speaking at the Bethlehem event, called President Donald Trump and key adviser Elon Musk \"cowards,\" riling up the crowd by framing the work of the duo in stark terms.",
      "\"There's nothing moral about what these cowards are doing, and there's nothing moral about what we saw today in Washington, D.C., as Donald Musk -- Donald Trump and his president, President Musk, decided to do, signing that executive order eliminating the Department of Education, which is going to have a disproportionate impact on the disabled community and so many children throughout this country,\" Martin told the crowd, amidst boos towards Trump and Musk.",
      "And Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, who received among the loudest applause of any of the panelists, took a starker tone: \"Don't let anybody tell you that we're in a constitutional crisis,\" Raskin said.",
      "\"Because that is too passive-sounding. That's too ambiguous. This is an attack on the Constitution of the United States, and we're going to defend the Constitution of the United States!\"",
      "Republicans face fierce pushback at in-person events",
      "The Democratic Party claims that it's holding these town halls as a way to hear directly from voters.",
      "\"The purpose of these town halls is not for us to spread our message, but us to hear from people throughout this country right now who are facing deep and serious impacts to their own lives, to their neighborhoods and communities, because of what this administration is doing,\" Martin told ABC News on Thursday after the town hall.",
      "But Martin and others, explicitly, are also emphasizing the idea that Democrats are showing up and hosting these events while Republicans are pulling back from hosting in-person events or facing fierce pushback from constituents when they do. Some of the loudest applause in the church on Thursday came when speakers criticized the district's representative, Ryan Mackenzie -- who in 2024 narrowly flipped the seat held by Democrat Susan Wild.",
      "Arnaud Armstrong, a spokesman for Mackenzie, told ABC News in a statement on Wednesday that Mackenzie has answered questions at in-person events and would run a telephone town hall on Thursday night to allow for more people to speak with the congressman, including people with disabilities or seniors who might struggle to make it to an in-person event.",
      "During that telephone town hall, Mackenzie said, \"This is the best way that I have found to reach literally thousands of people at once and be able to have this kind of conversation.\"",
      "Disillusioned Democrats",
      "The town halls come as Democratic voters show disillusion with their party.",
      "A recent CNN/SSRS poll taken in early March found that 52% of Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents felt that the leadership of the Democrats is taking the party in the wrong direction, and that 57% felt that the party should mainly work to \"stop the Republican agenda.\"",
      "While waiting in line outside to enter the town hall, some residents of Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley region told ABC News that President Donald Trump's actions struck close to home or worried them -- but that they felt disillusioned with the broader Democratic response so far.",
      "'Very mixed feelings' on Democrats' response to Trump",
      "Carole Ostfeld, a retired teacher from Allentown, Pennsylvania, came bearing a sign that said \"Hands off Medicaid.\" She and her husband David told ABC News that they came out to the town hall in order to protest Trump and Musk, including because of Trump's actions with the Department of Education.",
      "But asked how they feel about the Democratic response to the Trump administration, Carole Ostfeld said, \"I've got very mixed feelings --\"",
      "Her husband added, \"It needs to be more.\"",
      "Asked if Democrats' messaging is resonating with them, Carole Ostfeld said it is -- but, \"as they say, you can't fight city hall,\" as Republicans are in power.",
      "Another attendee, Ann Frechette of Easton, Pennsylvania, said the news about Trump signing an order to dismantle the Department of Education, which came that day, struck close to home. \"I have a son in college who benefits from a Pell Grant,\" she told ABC News. \"And I'm afraid that that Pell Grant will disappear, that monies like that will disappear. He's on Medicaid, I think he may lose his health insurance. There's so many things.\"",
      "But the broader Democratic response was disillusioning her as well. While she praised some individual lawmakers, including Raskin, she added, \"I think the Democrats in general, they don't -- I'm a Democrat, but my party doesn't seem to get the message that was delivered last November. I would like people to stand up to what is being done.\"",
      "Firing up supporters",
      "That said, the town hall itself was by many measures a success -- or at least, the Democratic speakers were able to fire up their supporters.",
      "All of the pews were filled, with some attendees standing on the back or the sides of the sanctuary; and the crowd gave thunderous standing ovations to the speakers multiple times \u2013 particularly when, for instance, Raskin spoke about taking on Trump or former Democratic Rep. Susan Wild criticized the incumbent representative.",
      "People paid attention as audience members shared their own stories and questions, and then applauded them warmly, cheering on their peers in a clear show of support.",
      "During a question and answer portion of the town hall, attendees raised concerns about the future of Medicaid, educational programs, and other issues.",
      "Another attendee, Terri Neifert, told the crowd that she has lived in Bethlehem almost her entire life and became disabled after a fall at a grocery store, which changed the trajectory of her life. She said she managed to get her degree and to support her family through Medicare, food banks, and Social Security disability.",
      "\"If they cut Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps\u2026 I would lose everything,\" Neifert told the crowd.",
      "Neifert received a round of applause from the audience, and other attendees went up to her after the event wrapped to thank her for sharing her story.",
      "Asked by ABC News after the town hall how she was feeling by then about the Democrats' response to the Trump administration, Neifert -- similar to other attendees -- focused on the road ahead.",
      "\"It looks like it's gonna be a fight, and an uphill battle... more public outcry, more marches, and Congress needs to pull up their big boy pants and start doing their job,\" Neifert said.",
      "Going on the road",
      "Some Democrats or Democratic-aligned allies are taking a different tack than the town halls -- and going on the road.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a progressive independent who caucuses with Democrats, has been on the road for weeks with what he calls the \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, making stops for rallies in both right- and left-leaning districts. The Democratic Party has shown support for his efforts, reposting social media posts from Sanders about the tour.",
      "Out there on Sanders' tour, some attendees said they're disillusioned with the party's response to Trump.",
      "\"They gotta be a little tougher,\" one rally attendee told \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl at the Denver event. Another was blunter: \"Quit being a bunch of doormats.\"",
      "But -- in a sign that the rallies may be a successful tactic for Democrats to reach their base -- they're attracting thousands of people. Sander's Denver appearance, alongside Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., brought in more than 30,000 attendees.",
      "Sanders said it was the largest rally he's ever hosted -- bigger than the rallies on his two presidential runs.",
      "Sanders himself has his own criticism for the Democratic Party, telling Karl in an interview on ABC News' \"This Week\" that the Democrats should have done more for working people when they had control of the Senate.",
      "\"And since then, do I think the Democrats have been effective in rallying the American people, in stopping Trump's movement toward oligarchy and authoritarianism? No, I don't,\" Sanders told Karl.",
      "Donna Brazile, a former DNC chair and an ABC News contributor, said on \"This Week\" after Sanders' interview, said, \"Bernie Sanders is filling a void, a major void left after, of course, the defeat of Kamala Harris last year by Donald Trump. This void has to be filled because there's so much anger, anger not just in red districts, but also in blue districts.\"",
      "That void is one that Democrats hope to fill with these events.",
      "Martin, asked by ABC News after the Bethlehem town hall if he thought the messages of the Democrats is going to resonate in Republican districts or with Democrats themselves, said that wasn't really the point.",
      "\"It's really not about the message resonating,\" Martin said. \"What this is about is listening to people. Hearing the concerns of Americans right now throughout this country, who deserve to be heard, right?\"",
      "Martin added later: \"We're going to fill a void for them, and we're going to talk to more people throughout this country.\"",

      "The fresh round of duties, however, would still mark a significant escalation for the U.S. and its trading partners. In February, Trump ordered federal agencies to look into virtually every U.S. trading partner in evaluating what reciprocal tariff rate to put on them.",
      "\u201cApril 2nd is Liberation Day in America!!!\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social. \u201cFor DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe.

      "The administration is focused on trading partners who have major trade imbalances with the U.S., the sources said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s 15% of the countries, but it\u2019s a huge amount of our trading volume,\u201d U.S. Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent said last week.",

      "Bloomberg previously reported on the altered plans for tariffs. The Trump administration will likely forego sector-specific tariffs on autos, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors that were also previously planned for April 2, The Wall Street Journal reported.",
      "U.S. stocks surged on Monday on the news of narrower tariff plans. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed nearly 500 points, or 1.2%, while the S&P 500 jumped 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq increased more than 2%.",
      "In recent weeks, Trump's tariffs have roiled markets, stoked recession concerns and heightened worries about inflation. In short order, Trump has paused or reversed some tariffs, casting doubt over his plans and adding to the uncertainty, experts previously told ABC News.",
      "The Trump administration earlier this month slapped 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, though the White House soon imposed a one-month delay for some of those tariffs. A fresh round of duties on Chinese goods doubled an initial set of tariffs placed on China a month prior.",
      "Tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum on March 12 triggered retaliatory tariffs from Canada and the European Union, adding to countermeasures already initiated by China.",
      "Economists widely expect tariffs to increase inflation, since exporters typically pass along a share of the tax to consumers in the form of price hikes.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week said Trump\u2019s tariffs are partly to blame for price increases, leveling the criticism minutes after the central bank announced its decision to hold interest rates steady.",

      "The government arrested Khalil on March 8 after invoking a rarely used provision of immigration law that they said allows the secretary of state to revoke the legal status of people whose presence in the country could have \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" The new accusations seem to represent an attempt to strengthen the administration's justification for detaining Khalil and denying his release.",
      "\"Khalil's First Amendment allegations are a red herring, and there is an independent basis to justify removal sufficient to foreclose Khalil's constitutional claim,\" the filing says.",
      "\"The additional charges the government filed last week are completely meritless,\" Marc Van Der Hout, whose legal firm represents Khalil, told ABC News in response to a request for comment. \"They show that the government has no case whatsoever on this bogus charge that his presence in the U.S. would have adverse foreign policy consequences. This case is purely about First Amendment protected activity and speech, and U.S. citizens and permanent residents alike are free to say what they wish about what is going on in the world.\"",
      "\"Regardless of his allegations concerning political speech, Khalil withheld membership in certain organizations and failed to disclose continuing employment by the Syria Office in the British Embassy in Beirut when he submitted his adjustment of status application. It is black-letter law that misrepresentations in this context are not protected speech,\" the government said in the filing.",

Photojournalist Philip Holsinger documented their arrival, telling ABC News about capturing the images for Time magazine.",
      "\"I don't think they were ready for what they saw,\" Holsinger said. \"It's a major military operation where they bring the police and the military together for security purposes and surround the planes. And to put these guys, it takes about 22 buses for this amount of people to transport them to their supermax prison.\"",

      "SAN DIEGO -- Lennon Tyler and her German fianc\u00e9 often took road trips to Mexico when he vacationed in the United States since it was only a day's drive from her home in Las Vegas, one of the perks of their long-distance relationship.",
      "But things went terribly wrong when they drove back from Tijuana last month.",
      "U.S. border agents handcuffed Tyler, a U.S. citizen, and chained her to a bench, while her fianc\u00e9, Lucas Sielaff, was accused of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said. Authorities later handcuffed and shackled Sielaff and sent him to a crowded U.S. immigration detention center. He spent 16 days locked up before being allowed to fly home to Germany.",
      "Since President Donald Trump took office, there have been other high-profile incidents of tourists like Sielaff being stopped at U.S. border crossings and held for weeks at U.S. immigration detention facilities before being allowed to fly home at their own expense.",
      "They include another German tourist who was stopped at the Tijuana crossing on Jan. 25. Jessica Br\u00f6sche spent over six weeks locked up, including over a week in solitary confinement, a friend said.",

      "Pedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, said in the 22 years he has worked on the border he has never seen travelers from Western Europe and Canada, longtime U.S. allies, locked up like this.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify the abhorrent treatment and conditions\u201d they endured.",
      "\u201cThe only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios said.",
      "U.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on how many tourists have been held at detention facilities or explain why they weren't simply denied entry.",
      "The incidents are fueling anxiety as the Trump administration prepares for a ban on travelers from some countries. Noting the \u201cevolving\u201d federal travel policies, the University of California, Los Angeles sent a notice this week urging its foreign-born students and staff to consider the risks of non-essential travel for spring break, warning \u201cre-entry requirements may change while you are away, impacting your return.\u201d",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in an email to the AP that Sielaff and Br\u00f6sche, who was held for 45 days, \u201cwere deemed inadmissible\u201d by Customs and Border Protection. That agency said it cannot discuss specifics but \u201cif statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\" The agencies did not comment on the other cases.",
      "Both German tourists were allowed into the United States under a waiver program offered to a select group of countries, mostly in Europe and Asia, whose citizens are allowed to travel to the U.S. for business or leisure for up to 90 days without getting a visa in advance. Applicants register online with the Electronic System for Travel Authorization.",
      "But even if they are authorized to travel under that system, they can still be barred from entering the country.",
      "Sielaff arrived in the U.S. on Jan. 27. He and Tyler decided to go to Tijuana for four days in mid-February because Tyler's dog needed surgery and veterinary services are cheaper there. They figured they would enjoy some tacos and make a fun trip out of it.",
      "\u201cMexico is a wonderful and beautiful country that Lucas and I love to visit,\u201d Tyler said.",
      "They returned Feb. 18, just 22 days into Sielaff's 90-day tourist permit.",
      "When they pulled up to the crossing, the U.S. border agent asked Sielaff aggressively, \u201cWhere are you going? Where do you live?\u201d Tyler said.",

      "Sielaff was taken away for more questioning. Tyler said she asked to go with him or if he could get a translator and was told to be quiet, then taken out of her car and handcuffed and chained to a bench. Her dog, recovering from surgery, was left in the car.",
      "After four hours, Tyler was allowed to leave but said she was given no information about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s whereabouts.",
      "During questioning, Sielaff said he told authorities he never lived in the U.S. and had no criminal history. He said he was given a full-body search and ordered to hand over his cellphone and belongings. He was put in a holding cell where he slept on a bench for two days before being transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.",
      "There, he said, he shared a cell with eight others.",

      "He was finally told to get a direct flight to Germany and submit a confirmation number. In a frantic call from Sielaff, Tyler bought it for $2,744. He flew back March 5.",
      "\u201cWhat happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol\u2019s power,\u201d Tyler said.",
      "Ashley Paschen agrees. She said she learned about Br\u00f6sche from a TikTok video asking anyone in the San Diego area for help after her family learned she was being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center. Paschen visited her several times and told her people were working to get her out. Brosche flew home March 11.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s happy to be home,\u201d Paschen said. \u201cShe seems very relieved if anything but she\u2019s not coming back here anytime soon.\u201d",
      "On Feb. 26, a tourist from Wales, Becky Burke, a backpacker on a trip across North America, was stopped at the U.S.-Canada border and held for nearly three weeks at a detention facility in Washington state, her father, Paul Burke, posted on Facebook. She returned home Tuesday.",

      "The election to fill a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat is quickly becoming a referendum on the Trump administration and a test of enthusiasm on both sides",
      "The election to fill a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat has become a referendum not only on the new administration, but on Elon Musk, the billionaire who has become one of President Donald Trump 's top financial backers and the architect of his efforts to slash the federal workforce.",
      "The April 1 election is the first major test in American politics since Trump secured a second term in November. It will serve as a crucial barometer of enthusiasm in both parties heading into next year's midterm elections and is happening in a critical battleground state that Trump won by less than a percentage point.",
      "It's also a test for Musk himself. The Tesla CEO's nascent political operation, which spent more than $200 million to help Trump win in November, is canvassing and advertising in Wisconsin on behalf of the conservative candidate. A win would cement his status as a conservative kingmaker, while a loss could give license to Republicans distancing themselves from his efforts to stymie government functions and eliminate tens of thousands of jobs.",
      "\u201cThis is the first major election held since Donald Trump took office,\u201d said Anthony Chergosky, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. \u201cAnd I think notably Democrats are concentrating more on Elon Musk than Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "Musk, who is the race's biggest donor by far, has also inserted himself into the race, holding a get-out-the-vote event on his X platform Saturday.",
      "\u201cIt might not seem important, but it\u2019s actually really important. And it could determine the fate of the country,\u201d he said. \u201cThis election is going to affect everyone in the United States.\u201d",
      "April 1\u2019s election will determine majority control of a court facing critical issues: abortion rights, collective bargaining and voter access. They include decisions that could have major implications for the 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election, particularly if they end up hearing challenges to the state\u2019s congressional maps, which could theoretically swing the balance of power in Washington if they are considerably redrawn.",
      "In 2020, the court rejected Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn his election loss in the battleground state in a 4-3 ruling. Trump had sought to have 221,000 ballots disqualified in the state\u2019s two most Democratic counties.",
      "The Supreme Court race is officially nonpartisan, but the campaign has been anything but. Brad Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate, has openly courted Trump's endorsement, which he received on Friday night, as he campaigns against Dane County Judge Susan Crawford, the Democrat-backed candidate.",
      "The Waukesha County judge and former Republican attorney general attended the president\u2019s inauguration in January, has said that he would be part of a \u201csupport system\u201d for Trump. Earlier this month, he attended a \u201cMega MAGA rally\u201d where he posed for a picture in front of a giant inflatable version of the president, which had a \u201cVote Brad Schimel Supreme Court\u201d poster plastered on its chest.",
      "He spoke on Musk's get-out-the-vote call on Saturday. And he joined the president\u2019s eldest son on stage at a get-out-the-vote rally, where Donald Trump Jr. said a Schimel win would protect his father\u2019s agenda and keep up GOP momentum.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just show up when Trump\u2019s on the ticket,\u201d he said at a brewery in the Milwaukee suburbs. \u201cYou have to engage because it\u2019s not just about now, it\u2019s about that future. This presidency could be put to a halt with this vote.\u201d",
      "Schimel has also resurfaced long-debunked conspiracies about voter fraud that Trump has embraced, urging his supporters to vote early to \u201cmake this too big to rig so we don\u2019t have to worry that at 11:30 in Milwaukee, they\u2019re going to find bags of ballots that they forgot to put into the machines.\u201d",
      "Still, he pledged to judge any case that comes before him on its merits \u2014 including potential cases involving Trump and Musk.",
      "Republicans have cast the race as a chance for Trump\u2019s loyal supporters to rally around their leader and push back against liberal judges they accuse of working to stymie his agenda.",
      "Mailers from Musk\u2019s America PAC feature photographs of the president. \u201cPresident Donald Trump needs your vote,\u201d they read. Others warn that \u201cLiberal Susan Crawford will stop President Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "America PAC is also offering Wisconsin voters $100 to sign a petition in opposition to \u201cactivist judges\u201d \u2014 and another $100 for each signer they refer.",
      "Republicans have argued that if even 60% of the voters who cast ballots for Trump in November turn out, Schimel can win, helping to drive momentum for the party heading into next year's midterms.",
      "\u201cIn theory, the opposition party should be energized, but we\u2019re feeling very good about the energy on our side of the aisle,\u201d said Andrew Iverson, Wisconsin GOP executive director.",
      "Andrew Romeo, senior adviser to the Musk-backed group Building America\u2019s Future, which has spent millions on the race, issued a recent memo advising Schimel\u2019s campaign to remind voters that he is \u201ca strong conservative and Trump ally.\u201d",
      "Two groups funded by Musk have so far spent more than $14 million on the race, according to a tally by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice \u2014 with plans to spend around $20 million total.",
      "Musk donated another $2 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party on Thursday, the same day the party gave $1.2 million to Schimel\u2019s campaign.",
      "Under Wisconsin law, contributions to candidates are capped, but candidates can accept unlimited cash from state parties, which in turn can accept unlimited cash from donors.",
      "His spending has helped make the race the most expensive judicial election in the nation\u2019s history, with more than $73 million spent so far, according to the Brennan Center, breaking the record set by another Wisconsin Supreme Court race two years ago.",
      "Crawford has also received her own support from billionaires, including philanthropist George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "Democrats are hoping to channel their voters\u2019 outrage at the Trump administration by casting the race as an opportunity to stand up to Musk. After nearly a decade of running against the president, they see Musk as a potentially more divisive figure who can motivate their base voters to turn out.",
      "\u201cThis race is the first real test point in the country on Elon Musk and his influence on our politics, and voters want an opportunity to push back on that and the influence he is trying to make on Wisconsin and the rest of country,\u201d said Crawford campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman.",
      "State Democrats have hosted a series of anti-Musk town halls, including one featuring former vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, and featured Musk heavily in ads.",
      "Crawford has also seized on Musk, going as far as to refer to her opponent as \u201cElon Schimel\u201d during a recent debate.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t let Elon buy the Supreme Court,\u201d read billboards paid for the state Democratic party that depict Musk as Schimel\u2019s puppeteer.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so many people who are desperate for a way to fight back against what Trump and Musk are doing nationally,\u201d said Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic Party chair, and see the race as an \u201copportunity to punch back.\u201d",
      "Wikler said the party had seen an \u201cexplosive surge\u201d in grassroots and small-donor fundraising from across the country tied to Musk\u2019s involvement. Both in Wisconsin and nationally, Democrats are packing town halls and angrily protesting the Trump administration\u2019s firings of thousands of workers and shutdown of agencies. They have also show disillusionment with their party\u2019s own leaders.",
      "\u201cMost voters still don't know who Crawford and and Schimel are, but they have extremely strong feelings about Musk and Trump,\" he said.",
      "Musk said Saturday that he became involved in the race because it \u201cwill decide how the Congressional districts are drawn in Wisconsin,\u201d echoing Schimel\u2019s claims that Crawford would push through new congressional maps that could favor Democrats.",
      "Schimel\u2019s campaign has relentlessly attacked Crawford for participating in a call with Democratic donors that was advertised in an email as a \u201cchance to put two more House seats in play for 2026,\u201d a reference to the state's redistricting fights that have played out for years.",
      "Crawford has said that she didn\u2019t know that that was how the call had been billed when she joined and that nothing of that nature had been discussed while she was on the line.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, that\u2019s the most important thing, which is a big deal given that the Congressional majority is so razor-thin,\u201d Musk said. \u201cIt could cause the House to switch to Democrat if that redrawing takes place, and then we wouldn\u2019t be able to get through the changes that the American people want.\u201d",
      "Musk has also been giving money to Republican members of Congress who have echoed his calls to impeach federal judges whose decisions he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "He has other interests at play.",
      "Democrats and Crawford have noted that, just days before Musk\u2019s groups started spending on the race, Musk\u2019s electric car company Tesla sued Wisconsin over a rule banning car manufacturers from operating dealerships \u2014 forcing buyers to purchase Teslas out of state.",
      "The case could ultimately go before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",

    "story": [
      "Luigi Mangione is asking for a laptop in jail for legal purposes as he awaits trial in the killing of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Luigi Mangione is asking for a laptop in jail, but just for legal purposes \u2014 not for communicating with anyone \u2014 as he awaits trial in the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO.",
      "In a court filing made public late Monday, Mangione's lawyers proposed that he get a laptop configured solely to let him view a vast amount of documents, video and other material in the case surrounding the shooting of Brian Thompson. Similar limited-laptop provisions have been made for some other defendants in the federal lockup where Mangione is being held.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney's office, which is prosecuting Mangione on a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. According to Mangione's lawyers, prosecutors are frowning on the laptop request, saying that some witnesses have been threatened.",
      "Defense lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo wrote that there's \u201cno connection to Mr. Mangione for any of said alleged threats.\u201d",
      "Mangione, 26, is accused of gunning down Thompson in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference. Thompson, who was 50 and had two children in high school, worked for decades within UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.",
      "Mangione, an Ivy League computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the New York state charges. He also faces a parallel federal case that carries the possibility of the death penalty. He hasn't entered a plea to the federal charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson's death.",
      "Thompson's killing alarmed the corporate world, where some health insurers hastily switched to remote work or online shareholder meetings.",
      "But at the same time, the case channeled some Americans\u2019 frustrations with health insurance companies. Mangione's writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected animus toward health insurers and corporate America, authorities have said.",
      "Some people have lionized the accused killer, donated money to his defense and even flocked to his court appearances. Others, including elected officials, have deplored the praise for what they cast as ideological violence and vigilante justice.",
      "Through his lawyers, Mangione has released a statement thanking supporters.",
      "If he does get a laptop, it would be unable to connect to the internet, run video games or play movies or other entertainment, his lawyers said in Monday's filing. But it would let him examine, from his jail cell, more than 15,000 pages of documents and thousands of hours of video that prosecutors gathered and were required to turn over to his attorneys.",
      "Otherwise, he can view the material when meeting with his lawyers. But they say there aren't enough visiting hours in the day for him to do that and properly help prepare his defense.",

    "story": [
      "Prosecutors in New Mexico's busiest judicial district have been pleading with state lawmakers to amend the children's code to address what they call an unbelievable spike in juvenile crime in Albuquerque",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Behind the wheel of the stolen car was a 12-year-old boy. In the front passenger seat was a boy who just days earlier had marked his 11th birthday. He was waving a handgun as a 15-year-old boy in the backseat recorded video of what police described as a deliberate hit-and-run.",
      "A voice believed to be the 15-year-old\u2019s says, \u201cJust bump him, brah.\u201d The driver asks, \u201cLike bump him?\u201d The rear passenger responds, \u201cYeah, just bump him. Go like \u2026 15 \u2026 20.\u201d",
      "The car smashed into a bicyclist on his way to work. The windshield shattered and the car sped away in the predawn hours that May morning.",
      "Months passed with no arrests. Then in February a video of the deadly crash surfaced on social media. Remarkably it led police back to an 11-year-old who last June was arrested and placed in custody for a series of break-ins and burglaries in northeast Albuquerque. Police also accused the boy of shooting and wounding another teen, which prompted an investigation that turned up firearms and a bullet-proof vest that had been stolen from a police vehicle.",
      "But the allegations of running down and killing a person were on another level, one seldom dealt with in New Mexico's juvenile justice system.",
      "The 11-year-old and the other boys in the car, now ages 13 and 16, were arrested last week in connection with the death of Scott Dwight Habermehl, a father of two and a successful engineer.",
      "Prosecutors said Friday that all three boys will face the same charges: counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, leaving the scene of an accident involving great bodily harm or death and unlawful possession of a handgun by a person under 19. Prosecutors are seeking to have the oldest boy charged as an adult.",
      "The spike in juvenile violence \u2014 particularly this latest case \u2014 has shaken the community, further frustrated law enforcement and added to the pressure on policymakers to reconsider the limitations of a juvenile justice system that wasn't designed to deal with children as young as 11.",
      "Authorities say there's a perception among juveniles that they won't face consequences for violent crimes.",
      "Albuquerque police have arrested numerous teens, most being 15 or older, in homicide cases over the last year. Legal experts and authorities can't recall a case in which someone as young as 11 has faced a murder charge.",
      "Under state law, the 11-year-old cannot be held in a juvenile detention center but will remain in the custody of the state child welfare agency. The other two boys were ordered to remain in a juvenile detention center as their cases proceed, with children's court judges finding they were a danger to themselves and the community.",
      "Santa Fe-based attorney John Day said New Mexico\u2019s juvenile justice system was meant to intervene and get help for children so they wouldn't commit crimes as adults. It was designed with the assumption that kids this young weren't competent to engage in this kind of violent behavior, he said.",
      "\u201cObviously when you have 11-year-olds who are being accused of participating in running over bicyclists and brandishing guns, that\u2019s something that when they were drafting these laws was really not taken into consideration because it was a different time,\u201d Day said.",
      "There is a minimum age for prosecuting juveniles in 26 states, with statutes spelling out various exceptions, according to the National Juvenile Justice Network. But New Mexico is among the many states without a minimum age and state law allows for teenagers as young as 14 in some instances to be tried in adult court only for first-degree murder.",
      "Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman says the streets have changed dramatically since 1993, the last time New Mexico's children's code was meaningfully updated, but the Democratic-controlled Legislature has failed to consider changes that include expanding the types of violent crimes juveniles could be charged in as adults.",
      "Without modernizing the system and pairing meaningful consequences with behavioral health support, Bregman said things will only get worse. He pointed to a proliferation of guns and social media, saying it's out of control.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how they all communicate. This is how they settle grudges. It\u2019s not taking a fistfight behind the high school anymore. They\u2019re pulling out a gun and shooting at an unsanctioned car show,\" he said, referring to a deadly shooting at a park in Las Cruces on Friday night.",
      "\u201cWe need to have our laws catch up with the times,\u201d Bregman said.",
      "Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Saturday reiterated her disappointment that lawmakers failed to pass legislation to address juvenile justice and what she described as a crime crisis. She said lawmakers should expect to be called back for a special session.",
      "Before the creation of juvenile courts more than a century ago, children who were older than 7 were processed and incarcerated under common law just as adults would be. Younger children were considered incapable of possessing criminal intent.",
      "Along with that history, the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention notes on its website that the juvenile court system also was established to provide positive social development for children who lack support at home.",
      "Juvenile justice advocates say cases in which young children are accused of murder are rare but not unheard of. In 2008, Arizona prosecutors handled the case of an 8-year-old boy who shot and killed his father and his father's friend. He pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in the death of the friend. Prosecutors dropped the charge for killing his father, saying it was best for the boy not to have to acknowledge killing his father.",
      "Some advocates have pushed for setting the minimum age for prosecution at least 14, citing research suggesting children who enter the juvenile justice system earlier in their lives have more adverse outcomes than older teens.",
      "Before knowing the hit-and-run in New Mexico was deliberate, authorities had warned in a criminal complaint naming the 11-year-old in other crimes that the pattern of misconduct was escalating in violence. The document went on to suggest the boy was a danger to himself and the public.",
      "Cases like this beg questions about how children end up in situations like this and what systems failed them along the way, said Amy Borror, a senior youth policy strategist with The Gault Center, a Washington, D.C.-based youth rights advocacy group.",
      "Another consideration, she said, is that adolescents' brains are wired differently. Borror pointed specifically to the part of the brain that controls reasoning, rational thought and the ability to comprehend the effects of actions.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why kids and teenagers act exactly like kids and teenagers act,\u201d she said, referring to risk-seeking behavior that intensifies while in groups.",
      "The difficulty comes with figuring out how to hold someone accountable when they don't have the same level of rational decision making that adults do, said Joshua Kastenberg, a former lawyer and judge in the U.S. Air Force who now teaches at the University of New Mexico Law School.",
      "\u201cKids in the criminal justice system are one of the more difficult questions in the law,\u201d Kastenberg said. \u201cUnlike adults, where you can simply say, \u2018Well, this person intentionally ran down a cyclist in their car, they\u2019re a danger to society.\u2019 Whether they have anger management problems or they hate cyclists or whatever, they completely disregarded the right of another human being to simply live. ... But when you\u2019re talking about kids, none of that sinks in.\u201d",

      "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington D",
      "Waymo on Tuesday added Washington to its pioneering robotaxi service's steadily expanding list of U.S. markets, although passengers will have to wait until next year until they can take a driverless ride around the nation's capital city.",
      "For now, Waymo's robotaxis will continue to map Washington's streets and corridors with a safety driver sitting behind the wheel to take control of the vehicle if something goes wrong \u2014 a precaution required under the regulations currently in force in the District of Columbia.",
      "That's something Waymo already has been doing since it began sending out its robotaxis in Washington in late January after a brief trial run in the capital last year.",
      "While the robotaxis continue to learn their way around the city, Waymo executives expressed confidence they will be able to work with regulators to clear the way for completely driverless rides at some point next year through its Waymo One app.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring the comfort, consistency, and safety of Waymo One to Washingtonians, those who work and play in the city every day, and the millions of people from around the world who travel to the District every year,\" Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana.",
      "If Waymo's ambitions pan out, Washington and Miami next year will be added to four other U.S. markets where its robotaxis are transporting passengers \u2014 Phoenix, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and Austin, Texas as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber. Waymo and Uber also are teaming up to begin dispatching its robotaxis in Atlanta later this year.",
      "The growth has helped turn what began as a head-turning novelty in Phoenix and then in San Francisco into an increasingly common sight in the cities where Waymo operates. The company says it had provided more than 4 million driverless rides to paying customers through the end of this year, and is now providing them at a pace of 200,000 paid trips per week.",
      "That has established Waymo as the early frontrunner in driverless technology while others are racing to catch up. Both Amazon and Tesla are gearing up to launch their own services in different U.S. cities while another ride-hailing service, Lyft, has announced plans to add robotaxis as an option in Atlanta and Dallas.",
      "Waymo's early lead in the still-nascent robotaxi market is a vindication of a technology that began as a secret project within Google in 2009 before it was spun off into a separate company owned by Alphabet Inc. in 2016.",

      "Troopers said a group of snowmachiners were riding Saturday on the backside of Seattle Ridge in Turnagain Pass, a popular winter recreation area about 60 miles (97 kilometers) southeast of Anchorage.",
      "\u201cWitnesses stated that a juvenile male triggered an avalanche and died after being buried,\u201d troopers said in a statement.",
      "Challan was buried about 10-feet (3-meter) deep in the slide that measured about 500 feet (152 meters) wide, said Wendy Wagner, director of the Chugach National Forest Avalanche Center.",
      "Conditions are worrisome because a weak layer is located about 3 feet (0.91 meters) beneath the snow surface, with newer snow falling on top of the weak layer.",
      "Challan rode over a weak layer of snow that was buried under newer snow, about mid-slope, Wagner said.",
      "When the slide happened, the center's staff was conducting an avalanche awareness day in a parking lot on the other side of Seattle Ridge, she said.",
      "\u201cThese types of avalanches, they can be triggered when you\u2019re on this slope. They can be triggered when you\u2019re on the bottom of the slope and even the side or the top of a slope, because all you have to do is break that weak layer, and then that weak layer shoots out like dominoes and breaks into the slopes,\" she said.",
      "The weak layer can be broken on a flat track, but that wouldn't cause an avalanche because there is no slope for the snow to come down.",
      "\u201cWhen we have avalanche conditions like this, as avalanche professionals, we recommend people just stay on slopes that aren\u2019t steep enough to slide, and then they don\u2019t have to worry about triggering an avalanche, and sadly, this person was not in that scenario,\" Wagner said. \u201cThey were on the edge of the slope and ended up being caught.\u201d",
      "The avalanche center has been warning people of this weak layer for weeks, and there were similar conditions on March 4, when three heli-skiers were killed. That accident happened when they were caught in an avalanche near Girdwood, about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Anchorage.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still unsafe,\u201d Wagner said Monday. \"We are still recommending that people stick to the lower angle slopes because this is not something we want to mess with.\u201d",

      "UNITED NATIONS -- South Sudan is teetering on the edge of renewed civil war, the top U.N. official in the world\u2019s youngest nation warned on Monday, lamenting the government\u2019s sudden postponement of the latest peace effort.",
      "Calling the situation unfolding in the country \u201cdire,\u201d Nicholas Haysom said international efforts to broker a peaceful solution can only succeed if President Salva Kiir and his rival-turned-vice president, Riek Machar, are willing to engage \u201cand put the interests of their people ahead of their own.\u201d",
      "There were high hopes when oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long conflict. But the country slid into a civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions when forces loyal to Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battled those loyal to Machar, an ethnic Nuer.",
      "More than 400,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Kiir and Machar together in a government of national unity. Under the agreement, elections were supposed to be held in February 2023, but they were postponed until December 2024 \u2014 and again until 2026.",
      "The latest tensions stem from fighting in the country\u2019s north between government troops and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, which is widely believed to be allied with Machar.",
      "Earlier this month, a South Sudanese general was among several people killed when a United Nations helicopter on a mission to evacuate government troops from the town of Nasir, the scene of the fighting in Upper Nile state, came under fire. Days earlier on March 4, the White Army overran the military garrison in Nasir and government troops responded by surrounding Machar\u2019s home in the capital, Juba, and arresting several of his key allies.",
      "Haysom said tensions and violence were escalating \u201cparticularly as we grow closer to elections and as political competition increases, sharpens between the principal players.\u201d",
      "He said Kiir and Machar don\u2019t trust each other enough to display the leadership needed to implement the 2018 peace deal and move to a future that would see a stable and democratic South Sudan.",
      "\u201cRampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,\u201d Haysom said.",
      "\u201cGiven this grim situation,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are left with no other conclusion but to assess that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a relapse into civil war.\u201d",
      "Haysom, who heads the nearly 18,000-member U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, warned that a relapse into open war would lead to the same horrors that ravaged the country, especially in 2013 and 2016.",
      "He said the U.N. takes the threat of the \u201cethnic transformation\u201d of the conflict very seriously.",
      "To try to prevent a new civil war, the U.N. special envoy said the peacekeeping mission is engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy with international and regional partners, including the African Union.",
      "Haysom said the collective message of the regional and international community is for Kiir and Machar to meet to resolve their differences, return to the 2018 peace deal, adhere to the ceasefire, release detained officials and resolve tensions \u201cthrough dialogue rather than military confrontation.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Turnout during the first week of early voting ahead of Wisconsin\u2019s pivotal Supreme Court race is far exceeding levels from another high-stakes election just two years ago",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Turnout during the first week of early voting ahead of Wisconsin's pivotal state Supreme Court race is far exceeding levels from another high-stakes election just two years ago, the latest sign of the intense interest in a contest that has obliterated spending records and drawn attention from President Donald Trump and his billionaire adviser, Elon Musk.",
      "As of Tuesday, with just a week to go until the final day of voting, nearly 48% more early ballots have been cast compared with the same point two years ago, according to data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission. More than 345,000 voters had returned ballots, either by mail or in person, compared with about 233,000 at this point two years ago during another race for a Supreme Court seat.",
      "The election will determine whether the court will remain under 4-3 liberal control or flip to a conservative majority. One of the current liberal justices is retiring.",
      "This year's race has morphed into a proxy battle over the nation\u2019s politics, with Trump and Musk getting behind Brad Schimel, the Republican-backed candidate in a race that is officially nonpartisan.",
      "\u201cAll Voters who believe in Common Sense should GET OUT TO VOTE EARLY for Brad Schimel,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post late last week.",
      "Total spending on the race has reached more than $73 million, including more than $14 million by groups funded by Musk, according to a tally Monday by the Brennan Center for Justice. That's the most on record for any U.S. judicial race, breaking the $56 million spent on Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court contest in 2023, when majority control also was on the line.",
      "All that spending and attention has helped fuel early voting, said Kevin Kennedy, Wisconsin's former top elections official who now works as a consultant. He spoke while taking a break from working at a Madison poll site where people could vote early.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of money being invested,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cEverything seems to be focused on, \u2018Let\u2019s get out the vote.\u2019\u201d",
      "After previously being critical of early voting, Trump and the Republican Party are urging their supporters to cast their ballots before the final day of voting on April 1. Early voting ends Sunday. The strategy, which they deployed with great success in last year's presidential race, appears to be contributing to large turnout increases in more conservative counties across Wisconsin.",
      "Schimel's opponent, Democratic-backed Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford, has raised more than $25 million for the race to date, including $5.5 million from the state Democratic Party since early February. Her supporters include billionaire Democratic megadonor George Soros and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker.",
      "Schimel, a Waukesha County judge, had raised more than $12 million, which includes more than $6 million from the Wisconsin Republican Party since early February.",
      "But outside groups have more than made up the difference in what the candidates have raised.",
      "The roughly $28 million spent by the candidates as of Monday was far exceeded by the roughly $45 million spent so far by outside groups, according to the Brennan Center calculation. Schimel and his allies, which include groups backed by Musk, have spent about $41 million, while Crawford and her supporters have spent about $32 million.",
      "Voters in Wisconsin do not register by political party, so it's impossible to know how many of the ballots already submitted came from Republicans or Democrats. But the data shows that the largest increases are coming from both Democratic- and Republican-heavy counties.",
      "Milwaukee County, the state's largest county and the one that is home to the most Democrats, led all counties in ballots returned with 54,750. That is more than 46% ahead of this point two years ago. Liberal Dane County, the state's second largest county and home to the state capital of Madison and the University of Wisconsin, has also seen a 46% increase.",
      "But Republican parts of the state also have seen big jumps.",
      "Voting was up in the three suburban Milwaukee counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington, which are commonly referred to as the WOW counties. Ballot returns were up more than 62% in Waukesha and 51% in Ozaukee. In Washington, the most heavily Republican of the three counties, early voting was more than double two years ago.",
      "In Brown County, the state's fourth most populous one, which is reliably Republican, early turnout was up more than 34%.",
      "While the early voting is high for a spring election, it's far from what battleground Wisconsin saw at this point before the presidential race. A week before the Nov. 5 election, nearly 1 million voters had cast their ballots, almost four times as many as in this race to date.",
      "The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules.",
      "On Monday night, Democratic U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told supporters that electing Crawford was important so she and other liberal justices can order a redraw of congressional boundary lines. Even though Wisconsin is a swing state, Republican-drawn lines have allowed the party to hold six of its eight congressional seats.",
      "\u201cAs soon as possible, we need to be able to revisit that and have fair lines,\u201d Jeffries said in a live discussion on the social media platform X. \u201cThe only way for that to be even a significant possibility is if you have an enlightened Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Schimel has accused Crawford of promising to Democrats that she will redraw the lines. Crawford has denied that.",

      "\u201cJuliana sparked a global youth-led movement for climate rights that continues to grow,\" Olson said in a statement Monday. \u201cIt has empowered young people to demand their constitutional right to a safe climate and future. We\u2019ve already secured important victories, and we will continue pushing forward.\u201d",
      "The plaintiffs wanted the court to hold a trial on whether the U.S. government was violating their fundamental rights to life and liberty by operating a fossil-fuel based energy system.",
      "The case wound its way through the legal system for years. At one point in 2018, a trial was halted by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts just days before it was to begin.",
      "In 2020, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the case dismissed, saying the job of determining the nation\u2019s climate policies should fall to politicians, not judges. But U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken in Eugene, Oregon, instead allowed the activists to amend their lawsuit and ruled the case could go to trial.",
      "Last year, acting on a request from the Biden administration, a three-judge 9th Circuit panel issued an order requiring Aiken to dismiss the case, and she did. The plaintiffs then sought, unsuccessfully, to revive the lawsuit through their petition to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Our Children's Trust, responding to new developments at the federal level, is now preparing a new federal action that is \u201crooted in the same constitutional principles that guided the Juliana case,\" Olson said.",
      "The plaintiffs now range from 17 to 29 years old and have continued their climate advocacy to various degrees, Olson said, adding that some are still in university. About half are from hometowns in Oregon, according to Our Children's Trust's website.",
      "\u201cThey all have incredible stories,\u201d Olson said. \u201cThey're all doing incredible work.\u201d",
      "Juliana, who is now 29, became a primary school teacher in Oregon, said Helen Britto, associate communications director for Our Children's Trust. Other plaintiffs include Alex Loznak, who became a lawyer focused on environmental and immigration work, and Nathan Baring, who now serves as the program director of a reindeer herding association in Alaska.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re part of a wave, so this is not the end of the road by any means,\u201d Baring said of the high court's move.",
      "Miko Vergun, who was born in the Marshall Islands and grew up in Beaverton, Oregon, is fighting for a future where the Pacific island nation can stay above sea level, according to Our Children's Trust's website. She recently graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in cultural anthropology, Britto said.",
      "In Monday's statement, Vergun said the U.S. Supreme Court decision wasn\u2019t what the plaintiffs had hoped for, but there had been \u201cmany wins along the way.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor almost ten years, we\u2019ve stood up for the rights of present and future generations, demanding a world where we cannot only survive, but thrive,\" she said. \"All great movements have faced obstacles, but what sets them apart is the perseverance of the people behind them. We\u2019ve shown the world that young people will not be ignored, and I\u2019m incredibly proud of the impact Juliana v. United States has made.\u201d",
      "Our Children's Trust has filed climate legal actions on behalf of young people in all 50 states, including active cases in Florida, Utah and Alaska.",
      "In a Montana case, the state Supreme Court in December upheld a landmark climate ruling that said the state was violating residents\u2019 constitutional right to a clean environment by permitting oil, gas and coal projects without regard for global warming, and that regulators must consider the effects of greenhouse gas emissions when issuing permits for fossil fuel development.",
      "The case, brought by 16 youth plaintiffs, had gone to trial in state district court in 2023. The Montana Constitution requires agencies to \u201cmaintain and improve\u201d a clean environment.",
      "The Montana Department of Environmental Quality, which issues permits for fossil fuel projects, has to abide by the state Supreme Court decision, Olson said, adding that Our Children's Trust will seek to enforce the ruling in the event it is violated.",
      "In a Hawaii case brought by 13 youth over the threat of climate change, both sides reached a settlement last year that requires the state government to achieve zero emissions in its transportation system by 2045. The settlement agreement applies to ground transportation, as well as sea and air transportation between islands. The court will supervise the implementation of the agreement for the next 20 years.",
      "Internationally, the Oregon case has inspired over 60 youth-led climate lawsuits across the world, according to Our Children's Trust.",

      "Federal prosecutors are trying to block the release of a former Minnesota state senator who resigned after he was charged with soliciting a minor for prostitution",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Federal prosecutors are trying to block the release of a former Minnesota state senator who resigned after he was charged with soliciting a minor for prostitution, leveling fresh allegations that he tried to obstruct the FBI's investigation from jail and lied to court personnel when he said he didn't have a gun at his apartment.",
      "Prosecutors asked the court in a filing Sunday for a quick ruling that Justin Eichorn be kept in jail instead of released to a halfway house as scheduled on Tuesday.",
      "Eichorn's new attorneys, whose hiring was first noted in a court filing Sunday, did not immediately reply to voicemails and emails from The Associated Press seeking comment on Monday. The 40-year-old former Republican lawmaker from Grand Rapids has not publicly commented since his arrest during a sting operation in Bloomington last Monday. He was charged in federal court last Wednesday with attempted coercion and enticement of a minor to engage in prostitution, a felony that carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years.",
      "In their motion to reopen a detention hearing that was held Thursday, prosecutors said they learned afterward that he had several phone calls in jail with a Grand Rapids woman \u2014 identified only as Individual A but described as a close associate \u2014 and arranged with her to retrieve a computer and other items from the St. Paul apartment where he lived alone during legislative sessions. They said both had been warned that the call was not private and would be recorded.",
      "According to Eichorn\u2019s profile, which was removed from the Senate website last week, he is married with four children.",
      "\u201cEichorn\u2019s conduct evidences a willingness to conceal material facts from the Court and to do so at the expense of public safety,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cEven more concerning, given his and Individual A\u2019s prompt attempt to clear out the St. Paul apartment, is the possibility that Eichorn lied because he thought his associate could clear out the apartment before pretrial services or law enforcement could get there.\u201d",
      "By the time the woman got to his apartment around 9:50 a.m. Friday, the motion said, FBI agents had already secured the unit in preparation for a search. She asked them whether she could go in to retrieve a computer that she said was used for her business. The agents declined and she left. An agent called her a few minutes later and asked her to return for an interview. She declined.",
      "The search warrant, according to the filing, authorized the FBI to look for evidence related to the enticement of a minor charge, as well as evidence of actual or attempted production, receipt, distribution or possession of child sexual abuse images.",
      "During the search, agents found a red computer-type bag on the counter that contained $1,000 in cash, a handgun and ammunition, a laptop computer, an SD memory card, an iPhone and several of Eichorn's Senate business cards, prosecutors said.",
      "They added that the iPhone appeared to have been reset to its factory settings, which can erase all content on the device. While an initial forensic analysis suggested that the phone may have been reset before Eichorn's arrest, they said, the analysis isn't complete and the timing of the reset hasn't been confirmed.",
      "One of the conditions for Eichorn's release to a halfway house was that he not possess firearms. But prosecutors allege he deliberately lied when he told a pretrial services officer after his first court appearance last Thursday that he had no firearm in his apartment.",
      "Prosecutors also argued that Eichorn should remain jailed because the text messages that he exchanged leading up to his arrest with an undercover officer who purported to be a 17-year-old girl demonstrated his \u201cclear familiarity with soliciting commercial sex from minors,\u201d saying they \u201cdepict someone who knows the lingo of the trade.\" When officers arrested him, they seized two cellphones found in his truck, an unopened condom and $129 in cash.",
      "\u201cEichorn\u2019s messages and conduct reveal an experienced operator,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHis pretrial release brings with it a real risk that he would attempt to victimize other minors in the community.\u201d",
      "Eichorn listed his profession as entrepreneur on his former profile and was first elected in 2016. He got some national attention earlier this month as one sponsor of a not-very-serious bill that would have designated \u201cTrump derangement syndrome\u201d as a mental illness.",

      "U.S. Postal workers, including mail carriers, gathered over the weekend to protest the cuts and the plan they say will dismantle the service.",

      "He took the helm of the postal service in the summer of 2020 during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business before taking office and was the first postmaster general in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.",

      "A Cornell University student involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests has been asked to surrender to immigration authorities",
      "NEW YORK -- An international student at Cornell University involved in pro-Palestinian protests has been asked to surrender to immigration authorities as he seeks to block deportation actions by the Trump administration.",
      "The government action against Momodou Taal comes as President Donald Trump ratchets up efforts to arrest and deport noncitizens who participate in such protests or who demonstrate against Israel's military actions in Gaza. In one of the most high-profile cases, the Justice Department recently lodged new accusations against a Columbia University graduate student who has been detained and targeted for deportation because of his participation in protests.",
      "Taal, a Ph.D. student in Africana studies at Cornell, filed a federal lawsuit March 15 seeking to block enforcement of executive orders by Trump that he feared could lead to his deportation. Taal is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Gambia.",
      "On Friday, just six days later, the 31-year-old international student was asked to surrender to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, according to his attorneys.",
      "In its court filing, the DOJ said Taal's student visa was revoked before he filed his lawsuit but ICE agents had trouble locating him. The revocation is based on Taal's alleged involvement in \u201cdisruptive protests,\u201d disregarding university policies and creating a hostile environment for Jewish students, the government said.",
      "An attorney for Taal, Eric Lee, said Monday that his client is not being required to surrender before Tuesday's scheduled hearing on the lawsuit in Syracuse.",
      "Taal was temporarily suspended from Cornell for a second time last fall after a group of pro-Palestinian activists disrupted a campus career fair. He has limited access to the upstate New York campus as he continues his studies remotely.",
      "In his lawsuit, Taal and his co-plaintiffs argue that Trump's executive orders violate the free speech rights of international students and scholars. Taal claims he was at the career fair protest for five minutes and had faced no criminal charges.",
      "\u201cIf the First Amendment does not protect the right to attend a demonstration, what\u2019s left?\u201d Lee said. \u201cNot much.\u201d",
      "In the case involving Columbia University, federal prosecutors on Thursday lodged new allegations against graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, saying he had not disclosed his work with the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees and his continued employment with the British embassy for Syria, based in Beirut. Prosecutors also said he did not disclose his involvement with Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a coalition group of anti-Israel student organizations.",
      "Ramzi Kassem, an attorney for Khalil, called the allegations \u201cplainly thin,\u201d noting the government would have to prove any omission was both willful and materially important.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very obviously a rearguard action to shore up their immigration case,\u201d he said. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change the fact that this is still a case about Mr. Khalil\u2019s pro-Palestinian speech and the fact that the government doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration had previously also argued that Khalil's prominent role in the Columbia University protests amounted to antisemitic support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. Khalil, who received his master\u2019s degree from Columbia\u2019s school of international affairs last semester, served as a negotiator for students as they bargained with university officials over an end to the tent encampment erected on campus last spring.",
      "The administration's argument rests on a seldom-invoked legal statute that authorizes the secretary of state to revoke the visa of any noncitizen whose presence in the United States could be considered a threat to the country\u2019s foreign-policy interests.",

      "Millions of trees knocked down by Hurricane Helene last year combined with long stretches of dry weather this spring are making for a long and active fire season in the Carolinas, North Carolina State University forestry and environmental resources professor Robert Scheller said.",
      "\u201cHelene just dropped tons of fuel on the ground,\u201d Scheller said. \u201cThen these flash droughts allow that fuel to dry out very fast.\u201d",
      "Both South Carolina and North Carolina have issued statewide bans on outdoor burning.",
      "Mandatory evacuations continue for about 165 properties in parts of Polk County in western North Carolina, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Charlotte, according to county spokesperson Kellie Cannon.",
      "Three fires burned at least 7.5 square miles (19.5 square kilometers) in the county and the two larger blazes were completely uncontained, Cannon said in a social media update Monday morning. The Black Cove Fire, one of the larger ones, was moving toward neighboring Henderson County, Cannon said.",
      "Kim Callaway, who lives near one of the evacuated areas in Polk County, has prepared her home, WLOS-TV reported.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already actually evacuated everything that we thought that was important,\u201d Callaway said. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re just staying at the house and trying to do what we can to get our house prepared if the firemen need to show up and hold the line.\u201d",
      "A downed power line sparked the Black Cove Fire, but the causes of the other two fires in Polk County were under investigation, according to North Carolina Forest Service spokesperson Jeremy Waldrop.",
      "A number of other wildfires burning across the state including one that damaged 500 vehicles at a salvage yard in Burke County, officials said.",
      "Two fires in the South Carolina mountains have led Gov. Henry McMaster to declare a state of emergency.",
      "One fire was in Table Rock State Park in Pickens County and the other was on Persimmon Ridge in Greenville County. Winds and difficult mountainous terrain allowed blazes to grow, the South Carolina Forestry Commission said.",
      "The Table Rock Fire expanded to more than 2 square miles (5.3 square kilometers), including several hundred acres that firefighters intentionally burned to try to contain the flames, officials said.",
      "The Persimmon Ridge Fire, which started Saturday, spread to more than 1.25 square miles (3.2 square kilometers) despite many dozens of water drops, the commission said.",
      "Human activity ignited both the Table Rock and Persimmon Ridge fires. No injuries had been reported, and while no structures were imminently threatened, voluntary evacuations of about 100 homes remained in place.",
      "Scheller, the North Carolina State University professor, predicted this busy fire season if the region saw dry weather following Helene.",
      "Scientists saw something similar in 2022 when a fire burned more than 51 square miles (133 square kilometers) of timberland in the Florida Panhandle. The Bertha Swamp Road Fire almost directly followed the eye pattern from 2018's Hurricane Michael and the fallen pine trees left behind.",
      "Pines and their waxy needles dry out and become very flammable, Scheller said. The fallen trunks can also block roads and paths used to fight fires, experts said.",
      "The last ingredient to fuel wildfires is dry weather. Despite recent rain, the Carolinas are undergoing an extreme drought, according to federal monitors.",
      "The common denominator for many fires on the East Coast is human activity, whether people burn debris, light a campfire that isn\u2019t well watched or toss out cigarette, Scheller said.",
      "And more people living next to areas that can burn make fires a bigger threat, he said.",
      "A forest fire burning in New Jersey\u2019s million-acre Pinelands region was 100% contained on Monday morning, the New Jersey Forest Fire Services said in a post on X. The fire was first spotted Saturday and burned through about 3.5 square miles (5.8 kilometers).",
      "That blaze led authorities to evacuate two campgrounds in Wharton State Forest, officials said. The cause was under investigation.",
      "A front moving off the East Coast brought rain and more humidity to the area, helping firefighters Monday.",
      "But not much rain fell and temperatures are expected to get warmer and the air drier as the week goes on, likely meaning another round of wildfires unless people follow burn bans and fire safety.",
      "\u201cIt is absolutely paramount that folks respect the statewide ban on all open burning,\u201d North Carolina Forest Service spokesperson Philip Jackson. said.",

    "story": [
      "Congressional lawmakers are scrambling to formulate a response to President Donald Trump\u2019s slashing of the federal government as one group takes a front and center role: military veterans",
      "WASHINGTON -- As congressional lawmakers scramble to respond to President Donald Trump's slashing of the federal government, one group is already taking a front and center role: military veterans.",
      "From layoffs at the Department of Veterans Affairs to a Pentagon purge of archives that documented diversity in the military, veterans have been acutely affected by Trump's actions. And with the Republican president determined to continue slashing the federal government, the burden will only grow on veterans, who make up roughly 30% of the federal workforce and often tap government benefits they earned with their military service.",
      "\u201cAt a moment of crisis for all of our veterans, the VA's system of health care and benefits has been disastrously and disgracefully put on the chopping block by the Trump administration,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, at a news conference last week.",
      "Most veterans voted for Trump last year \u2014 nearly 6 in 10, according to AP Votecast, a nationwide survey of more than 120,000 voters. Yet congressional Republicans are standing in support of Trump's goals even as they encounter fierce pushback in their home districts. At a series of town halls this week, veterans angrily confronted Republican members as they defended the cuts made under Trump adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "\"Do your job!\u201d Jay Carey, a military veteran, yelled at Republican Rep. Chuck Edwards at a town hall in North Carolina.",
      "\u201cI'm a retired military officer,\u201d an attendee at another forum in Wyoming told Republican Rep. Harriet Hageman before questioning whether DOGE had actually discovered any \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Although Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson advised his members to skip the town halls and claimed that they were being filled with paid protesters, some Republicans were still holding them and trying to respond to the criticism.",
      "\u201cIt looks radical, but it\u2019s not. I call it stewardship, in my opinion,\u201d Republican Rep. Gus Bilirakis of Florida said on a tele-town hall. \u201cI think they\u2019re doing right by the American taxpayer. And I support that principle of DOGE.\"",
      "Still, some Republicans have expressed unease with the seemingly indiscriminate firings of veterans, especially when they have not been looped in on the administration's plans. At a town hall on Friday, Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw told the audience, \u201cWe\u2019re learning about this stuff at the speed of light, the way you are. I think there\u2019s been some babies thrown out with the bath water here, but we\u2019re still gathering information on it.\u201d",
      "Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL, added, \u201cIf you\u2019re doing a job that we need you to do, you\u2019re doing it well, yeah, we\u2019ve got to fight for you.\u201d",
      "The Republican chair of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Rep. Mike Bost, assured listeners on a tele-town hall last week that he and Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins are talking regularly. As the VA implements plans to cut roughly 80,000 jobs, Bost has said he is watching the process closely, but he has expressed support and echoed Collins' assurances that veterans' health care and benefits won't be slashed.",
      "\u201cThey've cut a lot, but understand this: Essential jobs are not being cut,\u201d Bost said, but then added that his office was helping alert the VA when people with essential jobs had in fact been terminated.",
      "Two federal judges this month ordered the Trump administration to rehire the probationary employees who were let go in the mass firings. At the VA, some of those employees have now been put on administrative leave, but a sense of dread and confusion is still hanging over much of the federal workforce.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all kind of wondering what\u2019s next,\u201d said Dan Foster, a Washington state Army veteran who lost his job when the VA canceled a contract supporting a program that educates service members on how to access their benefits and VA programs.",
      "Others are angry they have been portrayed as deadweight and cut from jobs they felt played a direct role in helping veterans get health care.",
      "\u201cFor somebody to go on the news and say we are incompetent or lazy \u2014 that is just false,\u201d said Future Zhou, an Army veteran who had a job managing medical supply inventories for operating rooms at the VA facility in Puget Sound, Washington, before she was fired in February.",
      "As Democrats search for their political footing and a rallying point to unify them, they have zeroed in on the cause of protecting veterans. In both the House and the Senate, Democrats have introduced legislation that would shield veterans from the mass layoffs. And when Trump spoke to Congress this month, many lawmakers invited veterans as their guests.",
      "\u201cThey are outraged,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat who is an Iraq War veteran and former assistant secretary at the VA. \u201cThey said Donald Trump promised to watch out for them. And the first thing he does is fire them.\"",
      "Democrats are already pressing their Republican colleagues to show their support for veterans. In negotiations to allow passage of a Republican-backed government funding bill this month, Democrats secured a vote to amend the package to include language that would protect veterans from the federal layoffs. But it failed on party lines in part because the last-minute change would have ensured that Congress missed the deadline to avert a shutdown.",
      "With an eye on the midterm elections, VoteVets, a left-leaning veterans' advocacy group, is already launching video ads that feature veterans sharing their stories of being fired and accusing congressional members of doing \u201cabsolutely nothing.\u201d The ads are directed to five potential swing districts held by Republicans who are veterans themselves.",
      "Sen. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat who is also a veteran, said he was unsure whether veterans would shift their political allegiance.",
      "But he said it is at least clear veterans are \u201cpissed.\u201d",
      "Gallego said there's an opportunity for Democrats to hammer home the message that \u201cElon Musk and his buddies would rather just deal with the bottom line and try to save billions of dollars so they can have more tax cuts at the expense of veterans.\u201d",

      "Dozens of bird eggs and chicks have been rescued from a single wind-damaged eucalyptus tree that was dangerously close to collapse in a California park",
      "Dozens of bird eggs and chicks were rescued from nests in a single wind-damaged eucalyptus tree that was dangerously close to collapsing in a California park.",
      "Now staff at the International Bird Rescue\u2019s Los Angeles Wildlife Center have been working around the clock to care for the 47 eggs and 12 chicks, all double-crested Cormorants, in hopes that they will be able to be released back into the wild in a few months.",
      "The tree at a park in Marina del Rey was flagged earlier this month after one of its trunks fell and crushed a trash bin enclosure, explained Nicole Mooradian, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches & Harbors. Its other trunk was showing signs of collapsing as well, threatening not only the birds but anyone on the nearby public walkway or in the parking lot next door.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a question of if this tree is going to fail, it was more of a when,\u201d she said Monday. \u201cThe cracks were growing wider by the day. It was really bad.\u201d",
      "For at least five hours on March 10, tree contractors meticulously removed each of the 20 nests and chopped off branches one at a time. Biologists on the ground put the eggs and hatchlings in egg cartons and boxes with heated blankets acting as temporary incubators.",
      "Double-crested Cormorants are common in Southern California and tend to nest in large colonies that may crowd a single tree, explained Kylie Clatterbuck, wildlife center manager for the bird rescue. For about a month, Cormorant parents incubate the eggs and then give the chicks regurgitated food for several weeks.",
      "Taking care of them can be very difficult because when they hatch they are essentially \u201cnaked little balls of skin\u201d completely reliant on their parents, she said.",
      "At the rescue in San Pedro, the chicks must be fed every hour from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.. When staff interact with them, they wear a black suit and disguise their face, while using decoys and puppets to keep the birds from forming an attachment with them, which could make them too trusting of humans in the wild.",
      "Rescue staff expect the birds to stay for at least three months and then once they can hunt on their own and fly, they plan to release them into the wild.",
      "All of the chicks are healthy and happy, with some about 2 weeks old and already eating whole fish, said Clatterbuck.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard raising baby birds. We do our best; we do what we know; we treat what we know,\" she said. \u201cAnd we can only hope that they do a good job and they can survive.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The constant push to cut income taxes in South Carolina has accelerated significantly",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The constant push to cut income taxes in South Carolina accelerated significantly Tuesday as the Republican governor and leaders of the House and Senate came together to promise to pass an ambitious bill to charge one flat rate for all taxpayers.",
      "The details of the bill weren't released at a news conference, but every speaker made sure its goal was known \u2014 take the 6.2% top income tax rate down to 3.99% for everyone by the end of 2026.",
      "If the economy keeps growing and the tax base is increasing, the plan would cut $200 million from income taxes collected until that flat rate is 2.49%.",
      "Republican leadership also promised not to increase other taxes, such as those on sales and property, to offset income tax reductions, like other nearby states have done.",
      "South Carolina would be one of a number of states looking to find a way to cut taxes. Mississippi and Louisiana are considering a swap of sales taxes or gas taxes to offset revenue lost. There are proposals to cut taxes on tips or Social Security benefits in several states and Kentucky has already lowered its income tax rate from 4% to 3.5%.",
      "Mostly unsaid at the Statehouse news conference Tuesday was the exact mechanism to get from 6% to 3.99%, outside of a promise that everyone with taxable income would pay something.",
      "Now, some residents make more than $1 million but pay no South Carolina income tax, said Republican House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister.",
      "\u201cThere will be some people when we take away the gaming of the tax system \u2014 they will pay more. But we think 3.99% is a legitimately good fair tax to charge them,\u201d Bannister said.",
      "Figures from about five years ago when the income tax was first cut suggested about one-third of all people who filed a South Carolina income tax return paid nothing. Most of them were low-income residents.",
      "Republican Gov. Henry McMaster said it's only fair that even the lowest income earners pay something outside of sales tax and perhaps property tax.",
      "\u201cI look forward to a tax system in our state that is viewed as low, broad, fair, flat \u2014 doesn\u2019t take too much from anybody but everybody has to pay something, a little something, to be part of this great state of South Carolina,\u201d McMaster said.",
      "South Carolina can afford the income tax cut for now thanks to its booming economy and population, which has grown by 1.5 million people since 2000 to a total of 5.5 million residents. Many of them have been well-off retirees.",
      "The goal is to have one of the lowest income tax rates in the Southeast, lawmakers said. Bannister pointed out the 2.49% rate would be less than Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Alabama.",
      "South Carolina has less than two months left in the 2025 session to get the tax cut plan through the House and Senate and to the governor's desk. Legislative leaders said that can be done.",
      "No Democrats were seen among the several dozen lawmakers who flanked the governor and House and Senate leaders, although they have supported tax cuts before. They support the state's program to cut the top rate of 7% down to 6%, which should reach its goal next year.",

      "The Prairie Land Potawatomi Nation has reclaimed land in Illinois that was promised to the tribe\u2019s leader 175 years ago but stolen by the federal government 20 years later",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Prairie Land Potawatomi Nation has reclaimed land in Illinois that was promised to the tribe's leader 175 years ago but stolen by the federal government 20 years later.",
      "A law signed by Gov. JB Pritzker last week transferred Shabbona Lake State Recreation Area, 1,500 acres (607 hectares) in north-central Illinois.",
      "\u201cWe are proud to once again call this land home,\u201d said Joseph \u201cZeke\u201d Rupnick, chairman of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation based in Mayetta, Kansas.",
      "The action returns to the Potawatomi territory in the same area that was ceded to Chief Shab-eh-nay in a treaty with the U.S. government in 1829. Nothing ever altered that treaty, but when Shab-eh-nay and his people left for several years to visit family in Kansas, the government sold the land to white settlers.",
      "It\u2019s not entirely the same soil that the U.S. took from Chief Shab-eh-nay. The boundaries of his original 1,280-acre (518-hectare) reservation now encompass hundreds of acres of privately owned land, a golf course and county forest preserve. Returning the original land would undoubtedly put the transfer into an interminable legal wrangle.",
      "\u201cThis moment reflects the power of collaboration and the shared desire to build a future rooted in justice and respect,\" Rupnick said. \u201cIllinois has shown true courage and vision by leading the way in the Land Back movement, demonstrating that healing and reconciliation are possible.\u201d",
      "The land will stay open to the public as a park, with the state providing maintenance.",
      "Rupnick for years has traveled repeatedly from Kansas to Illinois to negotiate with local and state governments, provide equipment to help clean up after storms and speak with neighbors, many of whom fear changes will come to the park that will disrupt their lives. Rupnick told lawmakers last spring it made no sense to install a casino because of the number of state-sanctioned gambling houses in operation.",
      "He did not rule out constructing a hotel, however, noting that the park, 68 miles (109 kilometers) west of Chicago, has 150 campsites, draws 500,000 visitors a year, and the closest lodging is a 20-minute drive away.",

      "Louie and Ophelia are expected to stay close because otters are territorial creatures, the zoo said, adding their species are native to the area and capable of surviving, with the local ponds and streams offering food and shelter.",
      "Search efforts include a hired tracker, motion-activated cameras and public calls to send in photos and video of sightings of the critters.",
      "Reports of Louie and Ophelia have come in, along with some videos and photos, since their escape. One, which appears to be security camera footage, shows an otter gliding over the snow in a wooded area, its tail following the rut its body made in the snow.",
      "Searchers are hoping Louie and Ophelia are seen in the same location at least twice, giving the zoo a place to search. The zoo said the otters are not a danger to the public, and likely wouldn't approach a human.",

      "Media outlets in Greenland and Denmark reported that Vance would be accompanied by Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz. The White House and the National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Trump had mused during his first term about buying the world\u2019s largest island, even as Denmark, a NATO ally, insisted it wasn\u2019t for sale. The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Trump's plans.",

      "\u201cI think we will have it,\u201d Trump said of Greenland shortly after beginning his second term on Jan. 20. The U.S. already has a military base on Greenland and the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., visited it in January.",
      "On her visit, Usha Vance will attend the Avannaata Qimussersu, Greenland\u2019s national dogsled race, featuring about 37 mushers and 444 dogs.

      "AURORA, Colo. -- With members of a trailblazing Black Air Force unit passing away at advanced ages, efforts to remain true to their memory carry on despite sometimes confusing orders from President Donald Trump as he purges federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "Col. James H. Harvey III, 101, is among the last few airmen and support crew who proved that a Black unit \u2014 the 332nd Fighter Group of the Tuskegee Airmen \u2014 could fight as well as any other in World War II and the years after.",
      "He went on to become the first Black jet fighter pilot in Korean airspace during the Korean War, and a decorated one after 126 missions. He was one of four Tuskegee Airmen who won the first U.S. Air Force Gunnery Meet in 1949, a forerunner of today\u2019s U.S. Navy \u201cTop Gun\u201d school.",
      "\u201cThey said we didn\u2019t have any ability to operate aircraft or operate heavy machinery. We were inferior to the white man. We were nothing,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cSo we showed them.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Trump's January inauguration, the Air Force removed new recruit training courses that included videos of the Tuskegee Airmen.",
      "The removal drew bipartisan outrage and the White House\u2019s ire over what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth described as \u201cmalicious implementation\u201d of Trump's executive order.",
      "The Air Force quickly reversed course.",
      "Announcing the reversal, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin said in a statement that the initial removal was because the service, like other agencies, had to move swiftly to comply with Trump\u2019s executive order with \u201cno equivocation, no slow-rolling, no foot-dragging.\u201d",
      "The videos were shown to troops as part of DEI courses taken during basic military training. Some photos of Tuskegee Airmen were also among tens of thousands of images in a Pentagon database flagged for removal.",
      "\u201cI thought there was progress in that area, but evidently there isn't,\" said Harvey, who blamed Trump for contributing to what he sees as worsening prejudice in the U.S.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll tell him to his face. No problem,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell him, \u2018You\u2019re a racist,\u2019 and see what he has to say about that. What can they do to me? Just kill me, that\u2019s all.\u201d",
      "The Tuskegee Airmen unit was established in 1941 as the 99th Pursuit Squadron based at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. The 99th became the 332nd Fighter Group, which by war's end destroyed or damaged more than 400 enemy aircraft in North Africa and Europe during the war and sank a German destroyer in action.",
      "Of the 992 Tuskegee Airmen trained as pilots starting in 1942, 335 were deployed, 66 were killed in action and 32 who were shot down became war prisoners.",
      "In 1949, two months after the airmen's gunnery meet victory in the propeller-driven class, the U.S. Air Force integrated Black and white troops and the Tuskegee Airmen were absorbed into other units.",
      "It took the Air Force almost half a century to recognize 332nd's last achievement: Its success in aerial bombing and shooting proficiency in the gunnery meet at what is now Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada.",
      "For decades, the winners were listed as \u201cunknown\u201d and their trophy was missing.",
      "\u201cWe won them all,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t supposed to win anything because of the color of our skin.\u201d",
      "Harvey trained during World War II but was not deployed to combat before the war ended. In Korea, he flew the F-80 Shooting Star jet fighter and earned medals including the Distinguished Flying Cross.",
      "He retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1965 and received an honorary promotion to colonel in 2023.",
      "Trump in 2020 promoted another of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, Charles McGee, to brigadier general. McGee died in 2022 at age 102.",
      "Harvey still regards the Air Force Gunnery Meet as his biggest accomplishment, one the Air Force finally recognized in 1993.",
      "Their missing trophy was found in a museum storeroom not long after.",
      "\u201cWe were good, and they couldn\u2019t take it away from us,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cWe were good. And I\u2019ll repeat it until I die.\u201d",

      "Afterwards, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors the government's spending plans - will publish its forecast for the UK economy.",

      "Reeves will present the watchdog's main findings alongside her economic plans.",

      "What is the chancellor expected to announce?",
      "Reeves has committed to one major economic event each year - the Budget.",
      "She has already signalled that she will neither raise taxes nor government budgets in this statement.",
      "However, with the government under pressure over its finances, she is expected to update her growth forecast, and provide more detail on policies already announced.",
      "Welfare spending",
      "Cuts designed to save \u00a35bn year by 2030 from the welfare bill were announced on 18 March.",
      "These include stricter tests for personal independence (Pip) payments, affecting hundreds of thousands of claimants, and a freeze on incapacity benefits.",

      "In February the Bank of England halved its growth forecast for the UK in 2025.",

      "The Bank moves interest rates to try and keep inflation on target, and cuts are less likely when prices rises are above 2%.",
      "Higher interest rates make loans, credit cards and some mortgages more expensive, but mean better returns for savers.",
      "Reeves has also warned that a potential global trade war - as a result of new worldwide US tariffs, would further lower growth and raise inflation."

    "story": [
      "\"Definitely not a Budget\" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic statement.",
      "There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a \"thin book\" of new policies with a \"light scorecard\" of measures with no further tax rises.",
      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",
      "When Reeves begins her statement at the despatch box, we will find out whether the chancellor can continue to rule out having to resort to tax rises, even in this \"changed world\".",
      "And if there is no return to spending austerity, then where does the money come from?",
      "What will be in the chancellor's Spring Statement?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Reeves confirms 15% cut to Civil Service running costs",
      "Rachel Reeves: I will not 'tax and spend'",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

    "story": [
      "Ticketmaster \"may have misled Oasis fans\" with unclear pricing when it put their reunion tour on sale last year, the UK's competition watchdog has said.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the company may have breached consumer protection law by selling \"platinum\" tickets for almost 2.5 times the standard price, without explaining they came with no additional benefits.",
      "\"This risked giving consumers the misleading impression that platinum tickets were better,\" it said in an update to its investigation into Ticketmaster.",
      "The CMA has instructed Ticketmaster to change the way it labels tickets and reveals prices to fans in the future. Ticketmaster said it \"welcomed\" the advice.",
      "\"At Ticketmaster, we strive to provide the best ticketing platform through a simple, transparent and consumer-friendly experience,\" a spokesperson told the BBC, via email.",
      "\"We welcome the CMA's input in helping make the industry even better for fans.\"",
      "Dynamic pricing denied",
      "More than 900,000 tickets were sold for Oasis's long-awaited reunion tour, when they went on sale on 31 August last year",
      "But many fans were left out of pocket, when standard standing tickets advertised at \u00a3135 plus fees were re-labelled \"in demand\" and changed on Ticketmaster to \u00a3355 plus fees.",
      "Amid the fall-out, Oasis issued a statement saying they had no \"awareness that dynamic pricing was going to be used\" in the sale of tickets for the initial dates.",
      "The CMA launched its investigation in September, to examine whether Ticketmaster had engaged in \"unfair commercial practices,\" and whether fans were pressured to buy tickets within a short period of time.",
      "Ticketmaster subsequently denied using \"dynamic pricing\" to manipulate prices.",
      "\"We don't change prices in any automated or algorithmic way,\" the company's UK director, Andrew Parsons, told MPs last month.",
      "He maintained that all prices are determined by artist teams and promoters - although, in the case of Oasis, the promoter, SJM Concerts, has ties to Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation.",
      "Changes requested",
      "The CMA did not comment on the issue of dynamic pricing, but said that Ticketmaster made it difficult for Oasis fans to make \"informed choices\".",
      "For example, it said, customers did not know that there were \"two categories of standing tickets at different prices, with all of the cheaper standing tickets sold first\".",
      "This resulted in \"many fans waiting in a lengthy queue without understanding what they would be paying and then having to decide whether to pay a higher price than they expected,\" the CMA continued.",
      "The watchdog acknowledged that Ticketmaster had made some changes to its business practices since the Oasis sale last August.",
      "However, it said, \"the CMA does not currently consider these changes are sufficient to address its concerns\".",
      "\"We now expect Ticketmaster to work with us to address these concerns so, in future, fans can make well-informed decisions when buying tickets,\" said Hayley Fletcher, interim senior director of consumer protection.",

    "story": [
      "The roar of the Zambezi is deafening as millions of gallons of water crash over rocks and tumble down rapids.",
      "But there's another sound cutting through the trees of the Zambian bush - the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a bitcoin mine.",
      "\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Philip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.",
      "In exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.",
      "We're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.",
      "Water and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.",
      "Philip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.",
      "More importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.",
      "So cheap it made business sense for Philip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.",
      "Each machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.",
      "Occasionally Philip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.",
      "At the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Philip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.",
      "\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.",
      "Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.",
      "It was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.",
      "British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.",
      "Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.",
      "Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.",
      "\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.",
      "The bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.",
      "Bitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.",
      "The town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.",
      "Only one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.",
      "Although the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses.",
      "So, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.",
      "\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"",
      "He's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.",
      "\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"",
      "Embracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.",
      "Elsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.",
      "Like many young people, they're glued to their phones.",
      "\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.",
      "The little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.",
      "\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.",
      "\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.",
      "\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"",
      "Not many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.",
      "But soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.",
      "Zengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.",
      "Soon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.",
      "Phillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.",
      "The company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.",
      "Gridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.",
      "North of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.",
      "But Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.",
      "The company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.",
      "They're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.",
      "\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.",
      "The company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.",
      "Finding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.",
      "The company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.",
      "But the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.",
      "History tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.",
      "In the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.",
      "Authorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.",
      "For example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.",
      "Agreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.",
      "The environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.",
      "But according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.",
      "Set ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.",

      "\"The previous government left us with an unpalatable inheritance in that respect,\" Pennycook said.",

      "He said: \"As proposed it will add thousands of pounds to the cost of new homes, threatening the viability of sites across swathes of the country at a time when industry is striving to reverse the decline in homebuilding numbers that we have seen in recent years.\"",

      "The tax was first announced in 2021 by the then-Conservative government.",
      "Some of the money raised from the tax will go towards the removal of dangerous cladding from buildings, following the deadly fire at Grenfell Tower.",

      "Thousands of homes have been made safe, but as of December last year, work had yet to start on a quarter of the 1,323 tall buildings requiring attention.",
      "Up to 12,000 buildings and three million people could be affected.",
      "The lengthy process of identifying what work needs to be done and who should pay for it has left many residents living in fear of fires or with worries over costly repair bills.",

      "Last year, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the government was planning to introduce the Building Safety Levy in September this year.",
      "But in a letter to Rayner, dozens of developers said \"the ability of the industry to invest in increasing the supply of new homes to meet the government's 1.5 million target is being threatened by the imposition of new taxes\".",
      "Housebuilders say they are already paying \u00a36.5bn towards improving building safety through corporation tax and argue makers of unsafe cladding should bear more of the costs.",

      "A Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"This government is determined to make Britain's homes safer by making developers pay their fair share to fix unsafe buildings through the Building Safety Levy.",
      "\"We have extended the timeline to give developers more time to factor levy costs into their plans while continuing to support them to build safe homes, and at the same time we are continuing to work quickly to fix buildings with unsafe cladding through our Remediation Acceleration Plan.\""

      "Computers cannot think, empathise or reason, but scientists have developed systems that can perform tasks which usually require human intelligence, trying to replicate how people acquire and use knowledge.",
      "Generative AI is used to create new content which can feel like it has been made by a human. It does this by learning from vast quantities of existing data such as online text and images.",
      "At Cardiff Metropolitan University, careers advisor Megan Cooper said she was trying to steer students through the ethics of using AI as they applied for jobs.",
      "\"AI can be used as a tool. It can be used as an aid. It's something that can complement, but absolutely not replace, human judgement,\" said Ms Cooper.",
      "Ms Cooper said that in many cases, students were responding to an expectation from employers that candidates understood Generative AI and could use it with confidence.",
      "\"They don't want to be seen as cheating or getting it wrong in any way at all.\"",
      "She said the university was encouraging students to understand when it was appropriate to use AI.",
      "\"Maybe that's in the research stages of the application process. It might be asking AI to give feedback or help structure their CV.",
      "\"Maybe it's asking AI to help read a cover letter that they have already written to help refine it and help it sound a little bit more eloquent.\"",
      "Ultimately the job interview process required applicants to ensure \"what makes them unique is able to shine through\", she added.",
      "'It's too much of a risk'",
      "Student Jasmine James, 18, said she was avoiding using AI for her university work.",
      "\"I feel like it's too much of a risk, with plagiarism and stuff like that,\" she said.",
      "\"But I can understand why people do use it, because it is a quicker and easier alternative.",
      "\"I just feel like the information isn't always correct, so it's best to avoid it for uni work.\"",
      "Fellow student Jacob Morgan, 19, said he believed AI could be a \"really helpful tool\".",
      "\"I use it a lot, especially instead of Google. Sometimes I'll just search up on AI instead, because you get better results. So it's definitely very useful,\" he said.",
      "AI technology was \"here to stay\" and \"it's only going to get better and better\", he added.",
      "Timothy Mitchell, who is in his second year of studying computer security at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said he believed those who did not use artificial intelligence were \"cheating themselves\".",
      "\"Everybody uses it. Tutors use it, employers use it,\" he said.",
      "Mr Mitchell accepted there were \"definitely some fears\" around the wider use of AI, \"but I personally believe they are somewhat unfounded\".",
      "He added: \"What humans are best at is the creative stuff and creating new things. And AI, by principle, can't think beyond what it's been taught.\"",
      "Generative AI could be used \"in a way that aids us rather than replaces us\", he added.",
      "Will AI make work burnout worse?",
      "Biased AI rejected my job applications, says ex-MP",

      "In January 2025, Business and Trade Committee had argued the Post Office should not decide on what was owed to victims of its own scandal.",
      "However, the government stopped short of taking control of a separate scheme for people who believe they experienced financial shortfalls, despite it being a key recommendation of the Business and Trade Committee report.",
      "The committee has asked ministers to revise their response.",
      "It is yet another twist in the long-running Post Office scandal.",
      "Under the previous Conservative government, a new law was passed to overturn the convictions of more than 900 people.",
      "More than 4,000 people in total have been told they are eligible for compensation. But the schemes they need to access in order to receive remuneration for their suffering can be long-winded and complicated.",
      "We've broken down how they work.",
      "What are the main compensation schemes?",
      "There isn't a single compensation scheme for sub-postmasters to apply to, and individual eligibility will depend on the particular circumstances of an individual's case.",
      "The four main schemes are aimed at groups of victims who had different experiences of the scandal. They are explained in more detail in the following sections.",
      "Which scheme is available to Alan Bates and others depicted in the ITV drama?",
      "Alan Bates led a group of 555 sub-postmasters in a landmark court case against the Post Office, which came to wider public attention after it was depicted in an ITV drama.",
      "While the cohort secured a \u00a342.5m settlement in 2019, the huge costs of going to the High Court meant each claimant received a relatively low compensation pay-out at the end of it.",
      "The Group Litigation Order (GLO) scheme was set up to ensure they received extra money to reflect the gravity of their situations. The scheme is funded and managed by the government.",
      "As of January 2024, people eligible for this scheme \"will receive at least \u00a375,000 in compensation upfront\".",
      "The government estimates around two thirds will turn that offer down and push for more. In those cases, the government will award postmasters 80% of the initial offer made to them.",
      "On 9 September, Labour said it will set a target of making an offer to 90% of sub-postmasters who have submitted a full claim within 40 days.",
      "As of 31 January, \u00a3128m has been paid under the scheme, including interim payments.",
      "Of the 555 members of the GLO group, 63 had criminal convictions and therefore are not eligible for this scheme but they are eligible for other compensation - depending on how their convictions are overturned.",
      "If they are quashed by the court, they can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme. If they are overturned under legislation - the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 which became law in May - they can go to the newer Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "ITV's drama Alan Bates vs The Post Office has introduced millions to the long-running scandal",
      "What compensation is there for people with overturned convictions?",
      "There have been 983 convictions - 700 of which were privately initiated by the Post Office - linked to the faulty Horizon IT programme.",
      "People whose convictions are quashed can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme, whether or not they are in the GLO group. It is this scheme that the government has taken over responsibility for from the Post Office.",
      "A total of 111 people have had their convictions overturned as of 31 January.But when the government's promised law to overturn all convictions linked to the scandal becomes a reality, hundreds more people will be eligible.",
      "Those whose convictions are overturned can choose to take a fast-tracked \u00a3600,000 settlement. Or they can enter into negotiations if they feel they are entitled to more.",
      "All eligible people are entitled to an \"interim\" payment while their final settlements are processed. The government has provided funding to the Post Office for these payments.",
      "For those people whose conviction is overturned through the new law, they can register for the Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "This will entitle them to an initial \u00a3200,000 interim payment. They can then decide to accept \u00a3600,000 or have their case fully reviewed.",
      "As of 31 January, external, \u00a365m has been paid out under this scheme including further interim payments.",
      "The latest figures show that out of 111 eligible claimants in the OCS scheme, 82 claims for full and final settlements have been made with 66 paid out.",
      "A further seven have received offers. The remaining nine are awaiting offers from Post Office Ltd.",

      "Fearing prosecution, some sub-postmasters poured their own savings into their businesses to make up losses that were incorrectly calculated by the computer programme.",
      "In September, the Labour government announced a new independent appeals process system called the Horizon Shortfall Scheme intended for those sub-postmasters who weren't convicted or part of the GLO court action.",
      "It means they can appeal if they feel their financial settlement did not reflect the true extent of their losses and trauma.",
      "It is administered by the Post Office but the independent appeals process will be overseen by the Department for Business. Post Office Minister Gareth Thomas said he was still considering whether to transfer this scheme to the government as well.",
      "It has received more than 4,665 eligible claims so far, according to data, external from the Department for Business and Trade.",
      "Around \u00a3315m has been paid to 2,090 of these claims as of the end of January 2025.",
      "How many people are eligible for compensation overall?",
      "The number of people eligible for one of the three main schemes stands at over 4,000 - and the government has said new potential victims are still coming forward.",
      "It is unclear how many of them will end up receiving payments, and the processes - which have been criticised by campaigners for being too slow - can sometimes take several years.",
      "What about people who died before receiving compensation?",
      "On 10 January 2024, the then Post Office Minister Kevin Hollinrake told the Commons the families of the 60 people who died before receiving any compensation would be able to apply for it in their place.",

      "The prime minister has said he is \"deeply concerned\" about the closure of Heathrow Airport as a result of a power cut caused by a fire at a nearby electrical substation.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC \"there are questions\" for bosses of the UK's largest airport to answer over the 18-hour long closure on Friday, which disrupted the journeys of some 200,000 passengers.",
      "On Monday, Heathrow defended its decision to shut down following claims that it did have enough power to operate after the substation fire.",
      "The airport said it had to ground flights due to the time it took to switch from the damaged substation to two alternative power supplies, but added \"lessons can and will be learned\".",
      "The impact of Friday's fire from a single power source has raised questions over Heathrow's resilience and disaster plans, which sees thousands of passengers and millions of pounds worth of trade pass through its four terminals on a daily basis.",
      "The airport, along with National Grid, which oversees the UK's electricity network, agreed the impact of fire which broke out at the substation in Hayes was unprecedented.",
      "But John Pettigrew, chief executive of National Grid, told the Financial Times that two other substations remained operational and capable of powering the airport.",
      "He said he could not recall a transformer failing to such an extent in his 30-year career, but said there was a \"level of resilience\" provided by two other substations.",
      "\"Each substation individually can provide enough power to Heathrow,\" he said.",

      "\"I don't want to see an airport as important as Heathrow going down in the way it did on Friday, so I'm not comfortable with that for one second,\" he added.",
      "An investigation has been ordered by the government to establish what happened, with initial findings to be provided within six weeks.",
      "An internal review of the airport's crisis management plans and its response will also be undertaken by former transport secretary Ruth Kelly, who is an independent member of Heathrow's board.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told the BBC the airport's \"well designed\" resilience plans had worked as intended, but added they were never designed to protect the entire energy supply for the whole airport.",
      "Asked if she had confidence in Heathrow's leadership team after reports some senior management went back to bed, leaving the decision to close the airport to more junior executives, Alexander said it was \"not a matter for me\".",
      "She said she understood Heathrow's chief operating officer, Javier Echave, was \"taking some of the critical decisions\" early on Friday, but that she got a \"pretty much instantaneous response\" when she requested to speak to the chief executive Thomas Woldbye.",
      "\"The individuals who need to ask themselves whether they have full confidence in Heathrow management are the Heathrow board,\" the transport secretary added.",

      "A separate biomass power generator also provides heat and electricity to Terminal Two.",

      "\"Given Heathrow's size and operational complexity, safely restarting operations after a disruption of this magnitude was a significant challenge,\" a spokesperson said on Monday.",
      "\"Our objective was to reopen as soon as safely and practically possible after the fire.\"",

    "story": [
      "English councils will be ranked according to their pothole fixing progress under government plans, with those who fail to publish updates losing out on millions in funding.",
      "The Department for Transport (DfT) said local authorities' road maintenance pot would be boosted by \u00a3500m from mid-April, but councils must publish annual reports detailing progress on potholes or lose a quarter of that extra funding.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC this would produce a rating system \"so we know who is the best and who is not the best\".",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said the government should focus on preventative measures rather than \"reactively\" fixing potholes.",
      "Clearing the country's backlog of road repairs would take more than a decade and cost almost \u00a317bn to fix, the LGA said, citing a survey from the Asphalt Industry Alliance.",

      "All English local authorities will get 75% of the extra cash promised, but if a council does not publish a report on road maintenance, including details on pothole filling progress, the remaining 25% will be withheld.",
      "The held back funding will be given instead to councils the DfT believes have made proven progress.",
      "The policy will only apply to English councils as funding for Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish local authorities is a devolved matter.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC a RAG (red, amber, green) rating system would be produced for councils on pothole maintenance.",
      "He said that \"until now, nobody has known how many potholes are being filled and where they're being filled\".",
      "\"We all have the experience of driving from one place to the next and we know some places are better than others,\" he said, adding that the RAG system will help to avoid \"the lottery that we have now\".",
      "'Not helpful'",
      "However, Lucy Nethsingha, leader of Cambridgeshire County Council and chair of the LGA's Liberal Democrat group, said the amount of money was \"nowhere near the amount that is needed\".",
      "\"The implication that we are not spending it well is not helpful,\" she said, adding that the government was announcing \"stuff that was already announced several times over and that doesn't help increase people's faith in politics\".",
      "\"It's not clear that there is extra money coming as a result of this announcement. There is extra red tape and I don't think that's going to be helpful,\" she said.",
      "She added in order to fix the roads in Cambridgeshire alone, the council had a shortfall \u00a3410m while the money the government was \"re-announcing\" for the whole of England was \u00a3500m.",
      "\"Our roads are like a worn out pair of trousers, you can keep fixing the holes, but what you actually need is a new pair of trousers - or in this case a proper resurfacing.\"",
      "But the prime minister said \"any council that says to me it's not enough money, I'd say come back to see me in June when you've actually filled these potholes in with your RAG rating and then we'll see if we can release more money to you\".",
      "\"Don't start the exercise complaining that you haven't got enough money.\"",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"not pretending that the money we're making available will fill every pothole\".",
      "Asked whether withholding cash from some councils would just make things worse for drivers in some areas, she said she expected most local authorities would be able to \"comply with these requirements\".",
      "\"We want councils to be open and honest about how they are using that money so that the public can go onto their local council's website and see what action is being taken,\" she said.",
      "Under the government's rules, councils must say how much they are spending, how many potholes have been filled and detail long-term road maintenance plans in reports that have to be published by the end of June.",
      "By the end of October, councils must also demonstrate that communities have been consulted on where repairs should take place.",
      "The DfT added that councils who \"fail to meet these strict conditions\" will see 25% of the funding withheld.",
      "During the election campaign, Labour pledged to repair up to a million potholes a year in England.",
      "'Preventative measures'",
      "The LGA said it was in \"everyone's interests to ensure that public money is well spent\".",
      "\"This includes the government playing its full part by using the Spending Review to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures rather than reactively fixing potholes, which is more expensive,\" it added.",
      "Shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon described the government's announcement as a \"pothole sticking plaster\".",
      "He said: \"Labour like to talk a big game on fixing roads but they are more interested in chasing headlines.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:05:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",
      "Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.",
      "Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.",
      "Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.",
      "Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.",
      "Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.",
      "The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.",
      "Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.",
      "Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.",
      "And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.",
      "In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".",
      "It concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

    "summary": "Questions have been raised over what caused the outage and why back-up systems failed?",
    "story": [
      "It seems astounding that a single fire at an electricity source shut down one of the world's busiest airports.",
      "The disruption to the journeys of thousands of passengers and millions of pounds worth of trade goods on Friday has prompted a series of questions over the resilience of the UK's major infrastructure.",
      "Disaster recovery plans keep the top brass of many organisations awake at night.",
      "Banks, data centres, stock exchanges, hospitals, all have contingency plans.",
      "\"How is it that critical infrastructure - of national and global importance - is totally dependent on a single power source without an alternative?\", said Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association,  which represents airlines.",
      "He said the shutdown was the result of a \"clear planning failure\".",
      "Heathrow does in fact have more than one source of electricity, however, as one National Grid insider told the BBC, but the fire that broke out damaged a \"particularly important bit\".",
      "That meant the back-up systems in place for a scenario like this proved ineffective when the blaze ripped through the substation, which is used by the National Grid to transform high voltage electricity to a lower and safer voltage for use.",
      "This is a process which generates a lot of heat which is dissipated using flammable cooling oils. This is what caught light in this instance. The exact cause is not yet known, but counter terrorism police are looking into whether there was any foul play.",
      "Internationally embarrassing",
      "Heathrow uses as much energy as a small city, so it is not possible for it to have the back-up power by itself to run its operation safely.",
      "A source at Heathrow said it did however have back-up options for certain key systems, but kickstarting the alternative power supplies for the whole airport took time.",
      "The systems need to be checked to ensure they are working properly.",
      "A Heathrow source said its back-up diesel generators and uninterruptable power supplies in place all operated as expected.",
      "The problem lay with the National Grid, the source said, pointing out thousands of homes had been left without power, not just the airport.",
      "There are two National Grid substations close to Heathrow: one at North Hyde, north of the airport, and one at Laleham, south of the airport, according to energy analysis firm Montel Group.",
      "It appears that only the North Hyde substation is connected to Heathrow through the local distribution network, said Phil Hewitt, director at the firm.",
      "\"This potential lack of resilience at a critical national and international infrastructure site is worrying,\" he said. \"An airport as large and as important as Heathrow should not be vulnerable to a single point of failure.\"",
      "However, Robin Potter, a research fellow at Chatham House, said Heathrow was one of only two UK airports \u2013 Gatwick is the other \u2013 that has any level of regulation around its resilience standards.",
      "\"These are actually the better airports in the UK for how their resilience is assessed and regulated,\" he said.",
      "In 2023, the National Infrastructure Commission recommended to the government that it should set standards for some key sectors of infrastructure such as telecoms, water, transport and energy by 2025.",
      "It followed up with a further report at the end of last year detailing how the government could do that for those sectors.",
      "\"Those have effectively been on the government's desk since October 2023,\" he added.",
      "A Heathrow source said questions over why its back-up system failed would be investigated.",
      "Sometimes - like now -  a chain is only as important as its weakest link. The cost of having a whole extra power supply to run the airport just in case would cost huge amounts of money and  resources for a privately-owned business like Heathrow.",
      "Questions over whether additional back-ups are worth the additional cost will continue long after the passengers and cargo delayed by Friday's disruptive, and internationally embarrassing, failure have got where they are going.",
      "Additional reporting by Tom Espiner, Theo Leggett, Ben King, and Oliver Smith.",
      "Update 22 March: This article has been corrected to amend a reference to the amount of trade goods affected by the closure of Heathrow. It was millions of pounds worth of trade goods, not millions of tonnes as we originally stated."

      "Mr Johns found himself being driven around and around a car park while those same bystanders looked on.",
      "The Waymo ride was not doing what it should and there was no obvious way Mr Johns could fix it - and he had a flight to catch.",
      "Mr Johns recorded the experience, a video that went viral almost immediately and was picked up on TV stations around the world, casting fresh public doubt about self-driving cars and how ready they are for real-world passengers.",

      "The company says its driverless system is \"better than humans at avoiding crashes that result in injuries, airbag deployments, and police reports\".",

      "Meanwhile, in February of last year, it emerged that Apple's rumoured self-driving car project was folding.",
      "Uber abandoned its own driverless car efforts in 2020.",
      "But some big players remain in the race, including Zoox, which is owned by Amazon, as well as chipmaker Nvidia and Elon Musk's Tesla.",
      "Waymo is the leading US player though. It already operates self-driving taxis in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Austin, Texas and is promising to launch soon in Atlanta and Miami, Florida.",
      "So why has Waymo succeeded where other efforts, at least in the US, have failed?",
      "\"Three things - people, money and process,\" says Sven Beiker, a lecturer at Stanford Graduate School of Business, and managing director of Silicon Valley Mobility, an automotive consultancy.",
      "He points out that over the years Waymo has employed some of the leading figures in autonomous vehicle engineering, it has the financial weight of Google-owner Alphabet behind it, and has become thorough in its approach.",
      "\"They've come around to really playing by the book, to be a good steward of processes... working with regulators to make sure what they deploy is safe.\"",

      "Regions with good weather are likely to see driverless services first says Philipp Kampshoff, global co-leader of Automotive and Assembly Practice at the consultancy giant McKinsey.",
      "That would include southern US states like Texas and Florida, where Waymo already has plans.",
      "\"Robo-taxis still operate much better in good weather conditions. They still, for the most part, struggle in heavy snow,\" Mr Kampshoff says.",
      "He also points out that the batteries perform better in warmer conditions, which is particularly important for driverless cars that need a lot of energy to power on board computing.",
      "\"Bringing this all together, in the second part of the 2020s, you will see one city after the other being unlocked and then scaling within these cities,\" he says.",
      "It will be a slow process.",
      "\"It's actually quite a labour intensive process to roll out this technology, which includes a fair amount of human driving,\" says Mr Beiker.",
      "\"You need to drive those vehicles through the streets where you want to deploy them, and you need to drive them over and over again, and you need to, to some extent, manually edit the data,\" he adds.",
      "And the whole process could also be held up by safety concerns.",
      "\"This is only going to happen if we're not running into major accidents. The moment major accidents are going to happen, a lot of these operations are going to be shut down,\" says Mr Kampshoff.",
      "For those working on self-driving trucks, safety is arguably on even bigger worry.",
      "\"Safety is the number one concern that we work on,\" says David Liu, the chief executive of Plus, which makes driverless software for trucks and works with global companies such as Amazon, Hyundai, Volkswagen and Scania.",
      "\"Autonomous trucks and autonomous vehicles, need to be much safer than average human driven vehicle,\" says Mr Liu.",
      "\"Human drivers are great, but not flawless. Most of the accidents we get ourselves into are due to driver inattentiveness. And we don't have that issue with technology,\" Mr Liu explains.",
      "\"A robo-taxi mostly runs within cities in low-speed environments, while trucks are typically run on highways at higher speed.",

    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

    "story": [
      "India has usually turned to economic reforms in times of distress, with the most famous example being 1991, when the country embraced liberalisation in the face of a deep financial crisis.",
      "Now, with US President Donald Trump's tit-for-tat tariff wars and the global trade upheaval that has followed, many believe that India finds itself at another crossroad.",
      "Could this be a major opportunity for the world's fifth largest economy to shed its protectionism and further open up its economy? Will India seize the moment, just as it did more than three decades ago, or will it retreat further?",
      "Trump has repeatedly branded India a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties. The problem is that India's trade-weighted import duties - the average duty rate per imported product - are among the highest in the world. The US average tariff is 2.2%, China's is 3% and Japan's is 1.7%. India's stands at a whopping 12%, according to data from the World Trade Organization.",
      "High tariffs increase costs for companies dependent on global value chains, hindering their ability to compete in international markets. They also mean that Indians pay more on imported goods than foreign consumers. Despite growing exports - primarily driven by services - India runs a significant trade deficit. However, with India's share of global exports at a mere 1.5%, the challenge becomes even more urgent.",
      "The jury is out on whether Trump's tariff war will help India break free or double down on protectionism. Narendra Modi's government, often criticised for its protectionist stance, already seems to have shifted gears.",
      "Last month, ahead of Prime Minister Modi's meeting with Trump in Washington, India unilaterally lowered tariffs on Bourbon whiskey, motorcycles and some other US products.",
      "Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has made two trips to the US to discuss a potential trade deal, following Trump's threatened retaliatory tariffs, looming on 2 April. (Citi Research analysts estimate India could lose up to $7bn annually from reciprocal tariffs, primarily affecting sectors like metals, chemicals and jewellery, with pharmaceuticals, automobiles and food products also at risk.)",
      "Last week, Goyal urged Indian exporters to \"come out of their protectionist mindset and encouraged them to be bold and ready to deal with the world from a position of strength and self-confidence\", according to a statement from his ministry.",
      "India is also actively pursuing free trade deals with several countries, including the UK and New Zealand, and the European Union.",
      "In an interesting turn of events, homegrown telecoms giants Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have teamed up with Trump ally Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch satellite internet services via Starlink in India. The move surprised analysts, especially after Musk's recent clashes with both companies, and came as US and Indian officials negotiate the trade deal.",
      "India's rapid growth from the late 1990s to the 2000s - 8.1% between 2004-2009 and 7.46% from 2009-2014 - was in large part driven by its gradual integration into global markets, particularly in pharmaceuticals, software, autos, textiles and garments, alongside a steady reduction in tariffs. Since then, India has turned inwards.",
      "Many economists believe that protectionist policies over the past decade have undermined Modi's Make in India initiative, which prioritised capital- and technology-intensive sectors over labour-intensive ones like textiles. As a result, it has struggled to boost manufacturing and exports.",
      "High tariffs have also fostered protectionism in several Indian industries, discouraging investments in efficiency, according to Viral Acharya, a professor of economics at New York University Stern School of Business.",
      "This has allowed \"cosy incumbents\" to gain market power by consolidating their positions without facing much competition. As Mr Acharya, a former central banker, noted in a paper by Brookings Institution, restoring industrial balance in India requires \"reducing tariffs to increase the country's share of global goods trade and reduce protectionism\".",
      "With India's tariffs already higher than those of most countries, further increases could be especially damaging.",
      "\"We need to boost exports and a tit-for-tat tariff war won't help us. China can afford this strategy due to its massive export base, but we can't, as we hold only a small share of the global market,\" Rajeswari Sengupta, an associate professor of economics at Mumbai-based Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, said.  \"A trade conflict could hurt us more than others.\"",
      "In light of this, India finds itself at a crossroad. As the world undergoes a major shift, India has a \"unique opportunity to shape a new vision\" for global trade, says Aseema Sinha, a trade expert at Claremont McKenna College.",
      "By lowering protectionist barriers in South Asia and strengthening ties with Southeast Asia and the Middle East, India has the chance to lead in shaping a new trade vision, positioning itself as a key player in a \"re-globalised\" world, Ms Sinha, author of Globalising India, says.",
      "\"By reducing tariffs, India could become the regional and cross-regional magnet for trade and economic activity, drawing in varied powers in its orbit,\" she adds.",
      "That could help India create the jobs it desperately needs at home. Agriculture, which makes up 15% of its GDP, accounts for a whopping 40% of employment, reflecting extremely low productivity. Construction remains the second-largest employer, absorbing casual daily workers.",
      "India's challenge isn't in expanding its thriving service sector, which already makes up nearly half of total exports, but in dealing with the large pool of unskilled workers who lack the basic skills needed for service jobs.",
      "\"While high-end services are thriving, the majority of the workforce remains uneducated and underemployed, often relegated to construction or informal jobs. To provide meaningful employment to millions entering the workforce each year, India must ramp up its manufacturing exports, as relying solely on services won't address the needs of the unskilled labour force,\" says Ms Sengupta.",
      "One concern is that reducing tariffs could lead to dumping, where foreign companies flood the market with cheap goods, potentially harming domestic industries.",
      "According to Ms Sengupta, India's ideal approach to trade would involve a \"universal reduction\" in import tariffs, as it currently has some of the highest tariffs among its trading partners.",
      "However, there is a caveat: China's trade struggles, particularly with the US due to the ongoing trade war, could lead to Chinese dumping in India in the \"short run\".",
      "\"To protect against this, India can use non-tariff barriers against China but only against this one country and only in cases of proven dumping. Barring that, it is in India's interest to do a wholesale slashing of tariffs,\" she says.",
      "There's also a growing concern that India may be overcompensating in its efforts to flatter the US.",
      "Ajay Srivastava, founder of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), believes that India's tendency to soften trade policies \"based on rhetoric rather than economic pressure\" shows a lack of assertiveness in global trade talks.",
      "If this trend continues, he says, India may end up making even more compromises in its trade deal with the US, further \"eroding its bargaining power\".",
      "\"In comparison to other major economies, India's pre-emptive surrender on multiple trade fronts - without the US imposing a single country-specific tariff - makes it appear exceptionally vulnerable to pressure tactics.\"",
      "The broader consensus seems to be that India should capitalise on what could be the unintended consequences of Trump's tariff wars. Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC, believes that \"potential US tariffs may have become a catalyst for reforms.\".",
      "\"If supply chains are rejigged again during the second Trump presidency due to higher tariffs on large exporters, and the world looks for new producers, India may get a second chance,\" she writes.",
      "Creating jobs that manufacture goods for the world won't be easy. India has largely missed the bus on low-end, unskilled factory work - jobs China dominated for decades. Automation is taking over. Without deeper reforms, India risks being left behind.",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 19:47:35 GMT",
    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but is now seeking a mandate from Canadians.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in this month. Now he will fight to stay in the job after calling a snap general election which will see Canadians go to the polls on 28 April.",
      "Carney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.",
      "Unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March.",
      "Now he is touting his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns.",
      "Carney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

      "It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago.",

      "History is valuable - to different people in different ways.",
      "Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.",
      "They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.",
      "Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance.",
      "The objects were identified using scanning technology at the University of Southampton, which helped the archaeologists figure out how to excavate the objects without causing damage.",
      "Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \"This is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK.",
      "\"It sheds new light on Iron Age life in the north and Britain, but it also demonstrates connections with Europe.\"",

    "summary": "Robbie asked the group to join his stadium tour, after he discovered their music on BBC Radio 2.",
    "story": [
      "Thom Rylance, frontman of indie band The Lottery Winners, has experienced panic attacks since he was a child. But he'd never had one on stage... until last month.",
      "\"I've got this other, outgoing version of me that does the shows, and he just turns up every time,\" the singer explains.",
      "\"I don't really know him, and I think he's brilliant and quite handsome, but when we played Bournemouth, he just didn't come.\"",
      "The panic manifested as \"a tremendous sense of overwhelming dread\", he says, accompanied by sudden shortness of breath and a racing heartbeat.",
      "He isn't sure how, but he survived the gig without anyone noticing.",
      "YouTube footage shows him goading people into singing Reef's Put Your Hands Up, and taking selfies with fans during the encore.",
      "In his head, though, it was a disaster.",
      "\"I came off stage and I was really apologetic. I was like, 'Oh my god, I'm so sorry. I was awful. I couldn't speak'.",
      "\"And everyone was like, 'What you talking about? It was absolutely fine.'\"",
      "The reaction wasn't entirely unexpected. At the age of 35, Rylance has become adept at masking his anxiety.",
      "It's a topic he addresses frequently (and movingly) on the band's new album, KOKO, whose title is an acronym for \"Keep on keeping on\".",
      "The singer learned the phrase from his grandmother, who used it to comfort him when he was excluded from school.",
      "\"I didn't want to be bad or naughty, but there was something in me [that meant] I couldn't sit through the lessons,\" he recalls.",
      "\"I was expelled and taken away from all my friends, and it made me really sad \u2013 but my gran used to say, 'Keep on keeping on, Thom', and it stuck with me.\"",
      "'Where was my support?'",
      "The singer was belatedly diagnosed with ADHD two years ago, and the sense of relief hit him like a tidal wave.",
      "\"It was like a release of guilt,\" he says. \"Like, nothing I've ever done has ever been my fault!",
      "\"But it also came with a mourning period, where I was looking back and going, 'Where was my support? I didn't have to be a sad child'.",
      "\"I literally remember a teacher saying, 'If you don't do well in your GCSEs then your life is over.' That sent me spiralling because I was like, 'I don't want to be a junkie', you know?",
      "\"So, I've been going into schools recently and talking to kids with ADHD, just to show them that someone who did terribly in education can wake up every day excited and happy and ready for work.\"",
      "Rylance is speaking from Paris, where The Lottery Winners are wrapping up their latest tour.",
      "The band, completed by Robert Lally, Katie Lloyd and Joe Singleton, have been working tirelessly since they formed in Leigh, Greater Manchester, in 2008 \u2013 but success has been a slow grind.",
      "They signed their first record contract with Sire Records in 2016 after boss Seymour Stein (the man responsible for discovering Madonna) called them \"the best band since The Smiths\".",
      "But when he left the label the following year, the group went with him, delaying  their debut album by years.",
      "It finally arrived on British indie label Modern Sky in 2020, a week before the country went into lockdown, making promotion impossible.",
      "Even so, the band's buoyant indie pop songs and engaging online presence (Rylance is one of the funniest and likeable musicians on social media) helped them build a dedicated fanbase.",
      "By 2023, that support was support enough to send their third album, Anxiety Replacement Therapy, to number one, beating releases by The National and Jessie Ware.",
      "For Rylance, who spent his childhood \"feeling like an alien\", it was a huge deal.",
      "\"It's literally a trophy with a number one on it,\" he laughs. \"What bigger symbol of affirmation is there than that?\"",
      "How about being personally invited on tour by Robbie Williams?",
      "That's what happened last October. Robbie heard the band's single You Again on BBC Radio 2 and instantly booked them as his support act this summer.",
      "\"It was a really huge moment for me,\" says Rylance, who made his first public performance singing Williams' song Stronger on a school trip.",
      "\"Robbie's been a huge part of my life, so when he told me, 'I've listened to all of your albums', I was just like, 'What do you mean, Robbie Williams? Why are you saying that to me?'\"",
      "The pair subsequently struck up a firm friendship, and talk almost daily.",
      "\"Robbie's like my therapist,\" says Rylance. \"He's got ADHD as well, so he can relate to the things that overwhelm me.",
      "\"And I can literally ask him anything. I'll be like, 'Robert, how long do I put this pizza in the oven?'\"",
      "But Williams isn't the only famous name in his contacts.",
      "The Lottery Winners have recorded singles with Shaun Ryder, Nickelback and Boy George (\"a mild hit in Greece,\" laughs Rylance), while Noel Gallagher struck up a friendship with Rylance after playing with him last year.",
      "\"These people have always seemed so unreachable,\" he marvels. \"Noel Gallagher is not even... He's barely even a human being!",
      "\"So to have him right there in my phone... I've texted him for advice loads of times.\"",
      "That guiding hand proved crucial last November, when Rylance published an ill-advised tweet criticising musician Kate Nash's campaign to save the live music industry.",
      "He accused Nash of posing as a working class musician, pointing out she'd attended the Brit School - which he mistakenly thought was a private, fee-paying establishment.",
      "\"I wasn't very proud of that, and it ended up in the NME,\" says Rylance. \"They kept contacting me, asking me for a statement, and so I texted Noel, 'What should I do about this, mate?'",
      "\"He was like, 'Just tell them to speak to your new PR officer: Me.",
      "\"'I'll tell them you're too busy being mega to talk to the press.'\"",
      "In the end, Rylance took a different approach, apologising for his comments and offering to work with Nash, but Gallagher's support helped him keep a level head in a tricky moment.",
      "Today, he's still passionate about highlighting the issues around working class access to the arts.",
      "He recalls The Lottery Winners' first gig, at the Collier's Rest Pub in Leigh, 16 years ago.",
      "The venue was so packed that it ran out of beer, but the band were only paid \u00a330, which they immediately spent on a demo tape.",
      "\"I don't know how we did it,\" Rylance says. \"We were really, really poor for a long time.",
      "\"We kept going because we believed in it, but that's not a realistic prospect for a lot of people.",
      "\"If you don't have any money, you can't afford to make mistakes.\"",
      "Even now, the band need help funding their European tour. Last month, they accepted a grant from the UK's Music Export Growth Fund to help pay for visas and transport costs.",
      "\"I wouldn't be in Paris right now without that,\" Rylance admits. \"They match what we spend, and we're willing to invest as much as we can.\"",
      "That's where ADHD can come in handy. Rylance is relentlessly creative, always on the look-out for ways to promote the band. On the album, he even calls ADHD a \"neurospice\" that helps him \"see solutions before problems even arise\".",
      "To that end, he's got a plan to secure a second number one album this week. Since Friday, Lottery Winners have been hosting a pop-up shop in Leigh, with free live music every day and copies of KOKO for sale.",
      "\"I can promise you this, there isn't a single band who'll work harder than us,\" he says.",
      "To paraphrase his gran, they're keen on keeping on."

    "story": [
      "Popular Indian comedian Kunal Kamra has refused to apologise after jokes he made during a stand-up show angered supporters of a top politician in Maharashtra state.",
      "Clips of the jokes - some of them were directed at the state's Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde - had gone viral.",
      "Members of the Shiv Sena party, which is led by Shinde, vandalised the hotel in Mumbai - the capital of Maharashtra - where the show was held.",
      "A police case was also registered against Kamra and politicians from the state's ruling coalition have asked him to apologise.",
      "In a statement released on Monday night, Kamra said he would \"co-operate with the police and courts for any lawful action\" taken against him.",
      "\"But will the law be fairly and equally deployed against those who have decided that vandalism is the appropriate response to being offended by a joke?\" he added.",
      "Police arrested 12 people for the vandalism at the hotel, which housed a comedy club where the show was filmed. They were later released on bail.",
      "As the controversy raged, Shinde said he did not support the vandalism, but added that \"the other person should also maintain a certain standard\".",
      "\"There is freedom of expression. We understand satire. But there should be a limit,\" he told BBC Marathi.",
      "Kamra is a well-known name in the Indian comedy scene, with his political satire and stand-up shows getting millions of views on social media.",
      "In his latest show - called Naya Bharat (New India) - Kamra refers to Shinde's 2022 defection from the Shiv Sena party which triggered a major political crisis in the state.",
      "The move led to a split in the Shiv Sena - India's Election Commission later recognised Shinde's group as the \"real\" Shiv Sena. The party is now part of the governing coalition in Maharashtra along with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Nationalist Congress Party.",
      "In the show, Kamra sang a parody of a Bollywood song where he indirectly referred to Shinde as a traitor, outraging his supporters.",
      "It's not clear when the show was filmed at the hotel but the reactions this week were swift.",
      "After Shiv Sena workers ransacked the venue, the studio Habitat - which often hosted stand-up comedy shows - said it was shutting down until it figured out \"the best way to provide a platform for free expression without putting ourselves and our property in jeopardy\".",
      "The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, Mumbai's civic authorities, also demolished some structures at the hotel, citing alleged building violations.",
      "Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who is from the BJP, criticised Kamra, asking him to apologise. \"None of us are against freedom of speech. We support satire or even political satire and we do not paint it differently,\" he said.",
      "Both he and Shinde accused Kamra of speaking on behalf of the opposition.",
      "A lawmaker from Shinde's party also said in a video that Shiv Sena workers would pursue Kamra across the country and he would be forced to leave India.",
      "In his statement, Kamra said he would not \"hide under [his] bed\", waiting for the outrage to die down.",
      "\"As far as I know, it is not against the law to poke fun at our leaders and the circus that is our political system,\" he said.",
      "Opposition leaders have supported Kamra.",
      "Uddhav Thackeray, chief of Shinde's former party - the Shiv Sena (UBT) - said Kamra had not done anything wrong.",
      "\"He stated the facts and voiced the public opinion,\" he added.",
      "Indian comedians have often faced legal action over comments and jokes. In 2021, Munawar Faruqui spent days in jail after being accused of hurting Hindu religious sentiments in jokes that - it turned out - he didn't actually crack.",
      "Actor and comedian Vir Das also faced outrage and police complaints after a show in the US where he described India as a country of two sides where people \"worship women during the day but gang rape them at night\"."

    "story": [
      "John Cooper Clarke is about to become the first poet to headline a UK arena, and is responsible for the lyrics to one of the world's most streamed songs of recent years. But he has lost none of the sharp-tongued vitriol of his punk origins.",
      "To a sizeable portion of the nation, Clarke's 50-year stream of biting beat poetry and kitchen sink stand-up comedy should qualify him for national treasure status.",
      "He's horrified at the suggestion.",
      "\"I hate that,\" he shoots back. \"I think it sounds like you're knocking on heaven's door.",
      "\"National treasure? Shnational shmeasure. Nah, I hate that. National treasure? Not while I'm alive. Not unless it comes with a generous stipend. Then I'll think about it.\"",
      "This invective is delivered with a sneer, a wink, and finally a cackle of laughter.",
      "The only stipend in his line of work is the antiquated allowance that's given to the poet laureate.",
      "\"What do you get for that, poet laureate? \u00a370 a year and a barrel of sherry? Not interested.\" He cackles loudly again.",
      "Clarke has been too rebellious a figure to be considered for poet laureate and its sherry-based salary, and at the age of 76 he argues he still has time to disqualify himself from being a fully paid-up national treasure.",
      "\"I could yet blot my copy book. I'm that foul-mouthed [person] that you've come to dredge up some grudging affection for, but I may yet do the wrong thing.\"",
      "For someone who has always gone against the grain, and occasionally off the rails, it is hard to imagine what he could do now to diminish his status, however.",
      "One honour the Salford-born wordsmith has agreed to accept is the 2025 Northern Music Award, which he will receive at a ceremony in Liverpool on Thursday.",
      "Although not strictly a musician, Clarke is closely associated with the music scene - from punk to the Arctic Monkeys, who turned his 1982 poem I Wanna Be Yours into a song that was the closing track on their 2013 album AM.",
      "It was never officially released as a single but has since gone on to be streamed nearly three billion times by music fans and ranks among Spotify's all-time Top 40.",
      "Many of Clarke's poems were originally released with musical backings masterminded by producer Martin Hannett, who was known for his work with Joy Division.",
      "Clarke has mixed feelings about the results.",
      "\"It was never my idea to put my poetry to music but I couldn't think of an argument against it,\" he says.",
      "\"So it was a new adventure for me, but I think the results were patchy. When it was good, it was great. But I'm hyper-critical of my own stuff.",
      "\"It wasn't my idea, that's all I'm saying, but I'm glad I did it now. It's put me in line for this award, for a start.\"",
      "Hostile punk gigs",
      "Two days after that ceremony, Clarke will achieve another landmark moment when he headlines Manchester's Co-op Live arena, albeit with a scaled-back set-up compared with its full 23,500 capacity.",
      "Has he ever performed in an arena? \"I've done outdoor shows that I suppose qualify as an arena,\" he says. \"But I've never done an arena with a lid on it like this one before.\"",
      "It will be a far cry from the cabaret clubs where he started out in the city in the 60s, and the punk nights where he made his name in the 70s, after winning over hostile fans who initially aimed spit and bottles in his direction.",
      "So what's more intimidating - playing to a small room of punks, or an arena with thousands of people?",
      "\"The more the merrier,\" he replies. \"If you're selling tickets for a living, the more the merrier.\"",
      "'Somebody up there likes me'",
      "He performed live with Joy Division, the Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, The Fall and Elvis Costello, achieving cult status with social-realist poems like Beasley Street and Evidently Chickentown, the antisocial I Don't Wanna Be Nice, and the more surrealist (I Married A) Monster From Outer Space and Valley of the Lost Women.",
      "However, Clarke's stream of consciousness dried up as he fell into heroin addiction in the 80s. He says he almost died as a result, and was fortunate to make it through those years.",
      "\"Well, I died four times. I came back but medical action was called for. I'm the luckiest guy alive. Somebody up there likes me.\"",
      "Clarke eventually got clean after meeting his wife Evie, and his professional revival really began when Evidently Chickentown was used over the end credits of an episode in the final season of The Sopranos in 2007.",
      "Fellow poets, comedians and musicians lined up to hail his influence in a 2012 BBC documentary, with Steve Coogan speaking about his \"spirit of dissent\", and Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner, calling him \"my hero\".",
      "Turner turned him into Britain's most listened-to poet by using his words in the Arctic Monkeys' 2013 song I Wanna Be Yours.",
      "The original I Wanna Be Yours is a rare example in Clarke's catalogue of an unabashed love poem, albeit an unconventional one. \"I wanna be your vacuum cleaner, breathing in your dust / I wanna be your Ford Cortina, I will never rust,\" it begins.",
      "Wedding favourite",
      "Clarke originally released the poem on record with a kitsch musical backing in 1982.",
      "\"It should have been done like Alex does it from the start,\" he says. \"I mean, that is the definitive version. I love it.\"",
      "The Arctics' version continues to strike a chord with a new generation and last year it had more streams around the world than any other track over a decade old.",
      "Meanwhile, the poem has also become a popular choice as a wedding reading.",
      "\"I'd be a billionaire if I had a quid for every person that recited that poem at their wedding,\" Clarke remarks.",
      "He may not have that income stream, but he will have got a fraction of a penny for each of the song's three billion streams.",
      "\"It adds up, and then there's the PRS [royalties],\" he says.",

    "story": [
      "The director of acclaimed period drama Wolf Hall says filming of last year's second series was nearly called off weeks before it was due to begin because of budget pressures.",
      "Peter Kosminsky told BBC Two's Newsnight they eventually opted to axe costly exterior scenes in Wolf Hall: The Mirror and The Light, meaning almost everything in the Tudor drama, screened by the BBC, became \"conversations in rooms\" instead.",
      "He argues public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV can no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "The Bafta and Golden Globe-winning director is calling for a 5% levy on UK subscription streaming revenues, with the proceeds collected for a British cultural fund.",
      "Kosminsky told the BBC that six weeks before shooting began, having already cut certain props, locations, costumes and cast members, he and the producer decided the gap was still \"too great\" to go ahead with making The Mirror and The Light.",
      "\"That's not something that has ever happened to me before, in all the years I've been making programmes, that you actually have to stop six weeks from production.\"",
      "Kosminsky has previously revealed that he - alongside Sir Mark Rylance, who played Thomas Cromwell,  executive producer Colin Callender and Oscar-winning writer Peter Straughan - took significant pay cuts to get the programme over the line.",
      "He said the original script \"had many scenes set outside, many scenes involving horses, we had a whole joust, an extraordinary scene as conceived by Hilary Mantel, the original novelist \u2013 and we had to cut everything\".",
      "He said he was still \"incredibly proud of what we've achieved, and the response overwhelmed us all\".",
      "But the original concept was a programme with \"more fresh air in it, where you got more of a sense of Tudor society out in the world, and the lives these people lived when they weren't in the throne rooms, palaces and beautiful dining rooms\".",
      "Kosminsky said things had got worse since he filmed the drama, which was broadcast in November.",
      "Now, he argues, public service broadcasters would not be able to afford to commission Wolf Hall or Mr Bates vs the Post Office, the landmark ITV drama about the Post Office scandal.",
      "One day in the not too distant future, he warns, British audiences will notice these types of programmes are \"gone\".",
      "Kosminsky also believes there is \"no way\" the BBC or ITV could afford to make Adolescence, the current hit show from Netflix about a teenager accused of murder.",
      "Adolescence writer Jack Thorne thinks traditional broadcasters could have made the drama, but they would have had to cut some of the most expensive scenes.",
      "\"It would have been a slightly different version of it,\" Thorne told the BBC.",
      "\"In episode two, I wrote a fire drill that involved 300 extras. Those 300 extras had to be employed for 10 days. That is an awful lot of money. So all these things would have been difficult on a public service budget.",
      "\"I think we could have done it, it just would have been very different. And truthfully, it probably would have needed co-finance from abroad, and the problem at the moment is that finance has disappeared.\"",
      "The impact of Covid and the 2023 US actors' and writers' strikes, as well as higher energy costs, are some of the reasons often given for the increasing costs of TV production.",
      "And Kosminsky is not alone in arguing that the advent of streaming platforms has inflated prices so dramatically that the public service broadcasters have been unable to keep up.",
      "Patrick Spence, the executive producer behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, told the BBC this was \"a serious issue\".",
      "\"Not only would Mr Bates not get funded today, but I wouldn't even have started developing it,\" he said.",
      "Former subpostmaster Sir Alan Bates, whose story was central to the programme named after him, said it would be \"a real shame\" if these kinds of dramas could no longer be made.",
      "Mr Bates vs the Post Office meant \"a lot of people saw for the first time the sort of hell going on in the background in the Post Office, the real miscarriage of justice going on right across the country\", he said.",
      "Spence said the price of making dramas had risen at the same time as the international funding model had dried up for these types of shows. Later this year, his ITV drama The Hack, about the phone hacking scandal, by Adolescence writer Jack Thorne, will air in the UK.",
      "Spence said there was \"no way\" he could raise the money to fund that programme now.",
      "Streaming levy",
      "Figures out last month from the BFI showed \u00a35.6bn was spent on high end TV and film production in the UK in 2024. But domestic UK programmes accounted for \u00a3598m, down 22% on the previous year.",
      "Kosminsky argues that a levy on the streamers would put the UK in line with some other European countries that use the proceeds to fund domestic content, such as France and Denmark.",
      "But with many streamers based in the US, would the UK government take on Donald Trump's administration?",
      "In February, a White House memorandum referenced levies on US streaming services, calling them \"one-sided, anti-competitive policies\" that \"violate American sovereignty\".",
      "On Thursday, as she accepted an award from the Broadcasting Press Guild, Jayne Featherstone, executive producer of Netflix's Black Doves, said the UK was \"at risk of losing the very stories that define us\".",
      "\"We are in the 45th minute of the pilot episode, and we've got five minutes left to stop the bomb from going off,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "In an old gun barrel factory in Sheffield's industrial heartland, hundreds of people are raving under the fluorescent lights of Hope Works club for one of the last times before it closes. One young woman has dressed all in black to signify the loss of her \"favourite place\".",
      "\"This is a landmark of Sheffield,\" says one reveller. \"It's the reason a lot of people come to university here,\" adds another.",
      "Its owner Liam O'Shea believes that nightlife venues like this are \"the vital underbelly of everything\".",
      "\"It's where people find themselves,\" he says. \"It's where people find their tribe.\"",
      "Mr O'Shea, who calls himself a child of the \"rave generation\", started Hope Works because he wanted to tap into that original spirit. Only now, Hope Works has gone. It closed its doors permanently in February after 13 years.",
      "And according to Mr O'Shea, grassroots clubs in the UK - places where up and coming artists often perform live - are \"dropping like flies\".",
      "In the last five years, around 400 clubs have closed in Britain \u2013 more than a third of the total number.",
      "In London, a dedicated taskforce is being launched by the mayor's office to help boost nightlife and save venues at risk of closing.",
      "\"A complex matrix of factors are all conspiring against and placing pressure on the sector, making for a perfect storm for nightclubs,\" says Tony Rigg, music industry advisor and programme leader at the University of Lancashire.",
      "There are many factors that could be at play - among them, rising costs, less disposable income and changing lifestyle choices.",
      "But the closures prompt broader questions too. Some experts have suggested, for example, that the lasting impact of the Covid-19 lockdowns may have led to people going out less than they once did",
      "And if that is the case, could the closure of so many clubs nod to a wider cultural shift, particularly among Generation Z?",
      "Did the pandemic change a generation?",
      "For several years during the pandemic, young people were unable to experience nightlife in the same way previous generations had, so perhaps it is not surprising that there have since been shifts in the way they socialise.",
      "A recent Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) study of more than 2,000 people aged between 18 and 30 found that nearly two thirds were going out less frequently than the year before.",
      "Psychologist Dr Elizabeth Feigin of Dr Elizabeth Consultancy says Gen Z is being driven by a number of factors \u2013 both offline and online. Part of this seems to be a rising consciousness around health, both physical and mental - and \"we are seeing less of a drinking culture\".",
      "A YouGov survey of 18 to 24-year-olds shows Gen Z continue to be the most sober group overall, with 39% of them not drinking alcohol at all.",
      "Dr Meg Jay, author of The Defining Decade, suggests there are several factors driving this change. \"Although some might imagine that young people are going out less post-Covid because depressed Gen Zers are still sitting around in their rooms, I don't think this is the case.\"",
      "There is more awareness about the dangers of substances as well as messaging on social media around healthy lifestyles, she says.",
      "Socialising less - or just differently?",
      "When lockdown restrictions were in place, Dr Jay recalls some young clients saying they'd have to find new ways to have a good time. \"[I had] clients telling me how much happier they were as they spent less time feeling drunk, hungover, or broke and more time feeling in charge of their lives.\"",
      "Of course social media is also playing a role in how people socialise. For some, \"social media and texting with friends scratches some of the itch of meeting up\".",
      "This rings true with Mr Rigg. \"We have a massive dependence on social media that has taken us away from more social pastimes,\" he argues.",
      "But Dr Feigin believes that the lag in social communication across the younger generations predates the lockdowns. \"I think it's been exacerbated by the pandemic. But I think it was already declining on the back of social media and technology and also helicopter parents.\"",
      "There might be some healthy reasons for the decline in night life, she points out - but she also thinks that there's \"some damage as well\".",
      "\"[This is] potentially around mental health, of social anxiety, loneliness and people actually not having the skills \u2013 not even bravery \u2013 to go out and socialise anymore because so much has become dependent online.\"",
      "\"It's getting harder and harder for young people to socialise face to face... I do think that we are seeing higher rates of social anxiety and high rates of loneliness\".",
      "A 'storm' coming for clubs?",
      "Not everyone is convinced that this is the reason for the club closures. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, thinks that finances play a big role. \"The reality is, is people can't afford it\".",
      "Entry fees vary depending on the club. Early release tickets in some city centres can be around \u00a310, while on-the-door entry or last-minute tickets will likely be more. Then comes the cost of any drinks, taxis, late-night trips to the kebab shop.",
      "In an NTIA study, 68% of people reported that the current economic climate had reduced how much they go out.",
      "\"Clubbing is becoming a luxury, and that's just crazy,\" says Sherelle Thomas, DJ on BBC 6 Music. \"You should be able to enter a club and be with friends at any time you want because it's something that makes you happy.\"",
      "Mr Rigg suggests there is a \"storm\" coming for clubs, as a result of new economic challenges such as national insurance hikes.",
      "If clubs cannot absorb economic challenges and so put prices up, this could make them less affordable and a less attractive proposition still, argues Mr Rigg - particularly at a time when consumers are burdened with rising living costs.",
      "In 2024, the company which owned Pryzm and Atik, two well-known nightlife chains, went into administration. It closed 17 and sold 11 venues (which included clubs and bars), citing changing student habits as the reason for closures.",
      "Russell Quelch, CEO of Neos, which runs the remaining venues, believes students have less money than they used to. \"People really care about how they spend their money,\" he argues. \"Gone are the days of students going out four or five nights a week\".",
      "The company now has several \"party bars\" which are open in the day too, meaning the trading window is longer. Many are themed, with events such as bingo, and they are not as alcohol orientated.",
      "The places bucking the trend",
      "The Acapulco in Halifax has seen thousands of people on its dancefloor since it opened in 1961. It is thought to be the UK's oldest nightclub. Its bar is lit in red and blue, and the beat of the music ebbs through its doors as people spill in to dance, often several nights in a row.",
      "But its owner Simon Jackson has noticed some shifts in the way people go clubbing. Some will come before the night properly begins and film themselves dancing for TikTok, he explains.",
      "The Acca, as it is known locally, is defying its environment. In Yorkshire, 40 percent of clubs have shut down since 2020 - the most out of any region in Britain. Mr Jackson attributes the club's longevity - in a challenging market - to, among other things, \"value for money\".",

      "Gut Level, a queer-led community project in Sheffield that runs inclusive club nights, is built on a membership model with reduced prices for those on low incomes.",
      "Co-founder Katie Matthews says: \"The music scene was run a lot by guys and it maybe didn't think about the safety of people like women and queer people as much.\"",
      "Then there is the safety aspect. In 2023, more incidents of drink spiking occurred in bars (41%) and clubs (28%) than anywhere else, and many people say they have experienced sexual violence during a night out.",
      "\"It's about safety of members,\" says Katie Matthews - at Gut Level, people have to sign up in advance.",
      "Ultimately, though, many clubs that continue to thrive do so because they are built around a sense of community. DJ Ahad Elley (known as Ahadadream), who moved to the UK from Pakistan at the age of 12, believes that this is a valuable aspect of many clubs.",

      "\"I think that nightclubs are really undervalued as these hugely creative forms of architecture and design, but also nightclubs and club culture more generally are these huge engines of creativity.\"",
      "Many fashion labels have been born in clubs, she points out, making them part of a \"bigger creative ecosystem\" along with theatres, opera houses and television studios.",
      "In 2016, a German court officially designated Berghain, a famous Berlin nightclub, as a cultural institution, which gave it the same tax status as the city's opera houses and theatres.",
      "The following year, Zurich recognised techno culture as part of its \"intangible cultural heritage\" in partnership with Unesco.",
      "It is a sentiment is shared by some in Britain too. As Mr Kill puts it: \"They are a British institution. There's no two ways about it.\"",
      "And the key to preserving this, and ensuring the future of nightclubs, is evolution, argues Mr Rigg.",
      "\"Nightclubs do need to evolve to maintain relevance due to the cultural behavioural shifts and also modify the business model to mitigate some of the other economic pressures.\"",

    "story": [
      "One of the most talked-about TV shows of recent years, Netflix's hard-hitting drama Adolescence, has been the hot topic of discussion this week, from the House of Commons to US talk shows to the gates of the scriptwriter's son's school.",
      "Those discussions have been sparked by the fictional story of a 13-year-old boy who is accused of stabbing a girl, and the factors that could have turned him into a killer.",
      "\"I've had lots of responses from people I haven't heard from for years, telling me about conversations they're now having with their children,\" writer Jack Thorne says. \"That's really gratifying.",
      "\"My son's headteacher stopped me at the school gates to say, 'I'd like to talk to you about this, and I'd like to think about what our school can do and what other schools can do',\" Thorne adds.",
      "\"The conversations seem to be starting in all sorts of different places.\"",
      "Thorne is now calling for the government to take \"radical action\" to help tackle the issues the programme raises.",
      "Chief among them are social media and the influence of incel (involuntary celibate) ideas, which encourage men to blame women for their lack of relationships and opportunities.",
      "But the drama, which Thorne created with actor Stephen Graham, is not just pointing the finger at incel culture, the writer tells the BBC.",
      "\"I really hope this is a drama that suggests that Jamie is like this because of a whole number of complicated factors.\"",
      "His parents, school and friends are all shown as playing a part in various ways.",
      "But Jamie, played by Owen Cooper, is bullied on social media to make him feel ugly, and is exposed to incel messaging and skewed views on sexual violence.",
      "\"He is this vulnerable kid, and then he hears this stuff which makes sense to him about why he's isolated, why he's alone, why he doesn't belong, and he ingests it. He doesn't have the filters to understand what's appropriate,\" Thorne says.",
      "\"At this age, with all these different pressures on him and with the peculiarities of his society around him, he starts to believe that the only way to reset this balance is through violence.\"",
      "The writer went down similar online wormholes himself on sites like 4Chan and Reddit in order to see the world through Jamie's eyes.",
      "He found that these messages were not simply coming from the obvious places.",
      "\"It was far from just Andrew Tate. It was not those big guns of the manosphere,\" he says.",
      "\"It was the smaller blogs and vlogs and the little bits like people talking about a video game, but then explaining through that video game why women hate you.",
      "\"That was the stuff that I found most disturbing.\"",
      "These issues aren't new, but the show has come as others are also discussing the dangerous messages aimed at boys and young men.",
      "On Wednesday, former England football manager Sir Gareth Southgate delivered a speech warning against \"callous, manipulative and toxic influencers\".",
      "\"They are as far away as you could possibly get from the role models our young men need in their lives,\" he said.",
      "Thorne says Sir Gareth is \"amazing\" - but he believes the solution is about more than having better role models.",
      "\"We've been having that conversation since I was a kid,\" the writer says. \"This has got to be a point where we do something a bit more radical than that. It's not about role models.",
      "\"Role models obviously can have a huge impact on people. But truthfully, we've got to change the culture that they're consuming and the means by which our technology is facilitating this culture.",
      "\"It was a really interesting speech, but I was hoping he was going to propose more radical things than he did.\"",
      "So what could more radical solutions be?",
      "This week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Parliament he's been watching the \"very good\" drama with his teenage children.",
      "Violence carried out by young men who are influenced by what they see online is  \"abhorrent and we have to tackle it\", and is \"also a matter of culture\", he told the Commons.",
      "Thorne hopes the PM will get the message that \"there's a crisis happening in our schools, and we need to think about how to stop boys from harming girls, and each other\".",
      "\"That's going to take a mass of different things to facilitate in schools and in homes, and that requires government help,\" he says.",
      "He urges Sir Keir to \"rather urgently\" consider a smartphone ban in schools and a \"digital age of consent\", similar to Australia, which has passed a law banning children under 16 from using social media.",
      "The writer has also suggested extending that to all smartphone use and gaming.",
      "\"I think we should be doing what Australia is doing, and separating our children from this pernicious disease of thought that is infecting them,\" he says.",
      "A ban would be a tough sell to teenagers, though.",
      "Thorne appeared on BBC Two's Newsnight this week alongside three men aged 18, 19 and 21.",
      "When asked about a social media ban for under-16s, they had mixed feelings.",
      "One said it was \"a great idea, within reason\", another said it would be \"quite unfair\", while the third was against the idea, arguing that \"social media has brought a lot of good to young generations as well\".",
      "For Thorne, the question about how to police smartphones and social media is about to come very close to home.",
      "His son is eight, and Thorne says he wants to make sure he establishes \"a method of communicating with him\" as he grows up. Soon, he will want his own phone.",

      "When Peter Mullan steps on stage as legendary football manager Bill Shankly on Friday night, it will be for the first time in more than 30 years.",
      "Red or Dead is an adaptation of the 2013 David Peace novel of the same name, a fictionalised account of Shankly's glory years with Liverpool Football Club, and the period post-retirement when he lived in the shadow of his own success.",
      "There's a statue to Shankly outside Liverpool's Anfield Stadium, and a city full of fans who know his name is part of their history - but that's not what's worrying Peter Mullan.",
      "\"There's 52 of us on stage,\" he says.",
      "\"It's not all about Shankly, it's about the city of Liverpool and the people.",
      "\"The biggest pressure is that the play is faithful to the spirit of the book. It's an intelligent, unashamedly exploration of football. It's much closer to Brecht or Shakespeare than the usual football biographies.\"",
      "Philip Breen, who is responsible for the adaptation, first approached Mullan a number of years ago about an eight-hour passion play he envisaged with a community chorus.",
      "The pandemic intervened and put his plans on hold, but a chance meeting with David Peace in his adopted city of Tokyo encouraged Breen to focus on the book.",
      "The community chorus was revived and Les Dennis, Gordon Kennedy, Allison McKenzie, George Jones and Keith Fleming were cast. But despite being a huge football fan, and a former youth player, Peter Mullan was unconvinced.",
      "\"It was a project I really wanted to do but trying to find the time to afford to be able to do it was hard. Financially, how anyone survives in theatre is beyond me.\"",
      "The wages in subsidised theatre weren't the only difference. In film and TV he says he would learn lines day by day, whereas this required committing the whole script to memory, and developing Shankly's distinctive voice.",
      "\" Vocally, we're similar,\" he says.",
      "\"We have that same timbre but I've had to work on the way he speaks.\"",
      "That involved watching countless videos and recordings of Shankly, one of the first football managers to understand the power of the media, and use it to his advantage.",
      "At 65, Mullan is older than Shankly was when he retired from football, a key moment in the play.",
      "\"I'm probably about five or six years too old for the part but in theatre there's more license. I think in a TV or film version, I think they might cast someone else because I don't look like him, but I sound like him.\"",
      "Born in Peterhead and raised in the Mosspark area of Glasgow, close to the Govan shipyards, Mullan enjoyed football as a teenager. A goalkeeper and then a midfielder, he tried out for Manchester United where he learned the life lesson that he was \"good but not good enough\".",
      "He left football behind to study at the University of Glasgow.",
      "He appeared in a number of stage shows including The Trick is to Keep Breathing at the Tron Theatre in 1995 which was to be the last live theatre performance he would give.",
      "After that came roles in Braveheart, Shallow Grave and Trainspotting. He was the toast of European film festivals like Venice and Cannes, where he won accolades as a director and an actor.",
      "He's one of the most recognisable faces on television, playing gritty hard men in Top of the Lake, and The Fixer, a shy romantic lead in the BBC sitcom Mum and a dwarf king in Amazon Prime's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power.",
      "More recently he's been seen in Ozark, The North Water and After the Party.",
      "Which explains why, despite the low wages, he's enjoying a break from the industry.",
      "\"You're completely infantilised in film and TV. You don't make your way to work in the morning, you get a note saying someone will pick you up. Then you go to work and you're taken to a caravan and they ask what you want for breakfast and then they bring you a cup of tea.",
      "\"Then you go to makeup and costume and then you're escorted onto a set and then you do your acting and then it all happens in reverse.\"",
      "He seems happy to make his own tea, strolling into the rehearsal rooms and getting down to work with the rest of the cast, many of whom are also veterans of the screen (Allison McKenzie who plays his wife Ness was a regular in River City, and had a key role in Line of Duty).",
      "\"After 30 years, I've genuinely forgotten how long you get to rehearse, and how long the working day is. I keep asking the young team, is this normal?\"",
      "Normal, hard-working and humorous are all traits he shares with Shankly who transformed Liverpool from a second division club into a winning team.",
      "Which takes us back to the book, Red or Dead, a dense and detailed novel as much about fanaticism as football.",
      "\"It doesn't demand that you know football. It demands your understanding that he is a fanatic and in order to understand him, you have to understand what he's fanatical about, and in understanding that you understand the world that he was in.\"",
      "It's a world which no longer exists, and only one of those original passionate working-class player managers is still alive.",
      "\"Bill Shankly, Matt Busby, and Jock Stein \u2013 those three kings of football - they paid a price for that. One doesn't want to romanticise it too much.  Is it admirable, is it healthy, is it fanaticism?",

      "Thankfully, I get second chances at being a better mother, and when a few weeks later you said \"I don't like myself\", I stopped my impulse to tell you what you were and listened. There was some silence and then you opened up about how you were having a hard time with some other children in school.",
      "I thought about how to ensure you know that beauty is not skin deep. The truth is sometimes you will feel ugly. I feel ugly sometimes even though I'm constantly told by the world around me that I'm beautiful. And so now I have made it a point to tell you how beautiful you are, not when you're feeling bad about the way you look, and not when you're dressed your best, but when you are being the best versions of you.",
      "As you grow older I know that you will not always believe that you're beautiful because we live in a social world that has distorted beauty, that has tricked us into thinking beauty is a certain size, a certain colour, or a certain shape. These beauty standards will change throughout your lifetime, so do not hold too much value to what society deems beautiful currently.",
      "Remember that you are whole and that if you start to pick apart your little nose or your hairy brows or your not quite right ears, you will start to feel ugly, but that is only because you are forgetting the whole. An elephant is a beautiful animal, but pick it apart and it's got a long wrinkly nose, strange side glancing eyes, huge sticking out ears and a big fat stomach.",
      "Remember that your scars, your wrinkles, your eyes, your lips, your hands, your feet, your hair, your skin are all here as witnesses to your beautiful life, they are here to grow old with you, and carry you through the ups and downs, they are your friends for life.",

    "story": [
      "British film critics have mostly panned Disney's live-action remake of Snow White, while US reviewers have been somewhat more positive.",
      "Chief film critic for The Times, Kevin Maher, said: \"Believe the anti-hype, it's that bad\", although Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney called the film \"mostly captivating\".",
      "Its release has faced several issues throughout its production, from alleged disagreements between cast members, to debates over representation of the seven dwarfs, and the casting of Rachel Zegler in the lead role.",
      "Reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film, which will be released globally on Friday, an initial critics' score of just 47%.",
      "The mostly good",
      "US reviewer Rooney describes director Marc Webb's work a \"vibrant retelling\" with a \"smart script\" from Erin Cressida Wilson.",
      "But he isn't a fan of the way the film handles the seven dwarfs.",
      "The debate around the dwarves began in 2022, when Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage, who has has a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia, described the decision to retell the story of \"seven dwarfs living in a cave\" as \"backward\".",
      "Disney used computer-generated characters in the remake to \"avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film\", but some other actors with dwarfism were concerned this decision would prevent them from getting work in the future.",
      "Rooney said: \"Although the talented voice cast gives the characters humour and distinctive personalities, their CGI renderings are a bit creepy, and less photorealistic than many of the cute woodland creatures that flock around Snow White.\"",
      "Pete Hammond wrote in Deadline that the film is \"just fine\", adding: \"It manages to make a thoroughly decent reboot from a genuine, never-out-of-circulation classic and make it fresh and relevant again for contemporary audiences.\"",
      "He added the musical film has \"dazzling dance numbers\" while the title character of Snow White \"is played to perfection by Rachel Zegler\".",
      "Variety's Owen Gleiberman called the film \"one of the better live-action adaptations of a Disney animated feature\".",
      "He felt that the CGI dwarfs \"bring the movie to life\", adding they have \"catchy personalities and comically expressive mottled-clay faces\".",
      "Gleiberman concluded the film is \"lighter, more frolicsome, less lead-footed than such clomping live-action Disney remakes as Alice in Wonderland and Beauty and the Beast\".",
      "Robbie Collin from The Telegraph gave the film a respectable three stars.",
      "\"Once Zegler scuttles off to the forest, where she teams up with two chirpy septets \u2013 the digitised dwarfs and a zany gaggle of bandits, who may have been dwarf replacements in an early draft \u2013 it really picks up,\" he said.",
      "He also described the performances of the songs Heigh-Ho and Whistle While You Work as \"stylishly choreographed and rousingly performed\".",
      "The not so good",
      "Most British publications haven't been so complimentary about the film, with the Daily Mail's Brian Viner giving the film two stars.",
      "\"Snow White the movie has its charms, and dozens of cute CGI forest animals, but on the whole it is a painfully muddle-headed affair,\" he says.",
      "He says Zegler \"has oodles of talent\" but \"Webb's film only intermittently allows her to sparkle\".",
      "Disney's decision to cast Zegler, a Latina actress, as a character deemed to have skin \"as white as snow\" prompted some controversy - it was part of a drive by Disney to cast a more diverse range of actors to play updated versions of some classic characters.",
      "Zegler also made headlines after she made critical comments about the original animated film.",
      "\"The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so,\" Zegler said in 2022.",
      "\"There's a big focus [in the original] on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! So we didn't do that this time.\"",
      "Zegler also said the original film was \"extremely dated when it comes to the ideas of women being in roles of power\", adding: \"People are making these jokes about ours being the PC Snow White, where it's like, yeah, it is - because it needed that.\"",
      "Her relationship with co-star Gal Gadot has also been under scrutiny, with rumours that promotional work for the film was scaled back because of their opposing views on the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
      "Zegler has used social media to post pro-Palestine material, whereas Israeli citizen Gadot served in her country's army for two years.",
      "However, others have said rumours of a rift are misguided, noting Gadot and Zegler have appeared publicly together on several occasions, including when they presented an award together at the Academy Awards.",
      "Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian gave the film one star, calling it an \"exhaustingly awful reboot\".",
      "He describes the costume design for Snow White as a \"supermarket-retail tweenie outfit with puffy-sleeved shoulders\", adding: \"Those otherwise estimable performers Rachel Zegler and Gal Gadot (The Evil Queen) are forced to go through the motions, and they give the dullest performances of their lives\".",
      "The Times's Maher referenced the pared-down European premiere for the film, which took place at a castle in northern Spain last week, while the Los Angeles launch was held on Saturday without most of the usual ranks of press on the red carpet.",
      "He added: \"The new tunes, much like Zegler's performance, are watery and ineffectual, while the dramatic jeopardy is non-existent.",
      "\"It's hard not to see this as anything other than a crisis point for Disney, a studio that used to make flawless cinematic stories but now infantilises global audiences with sanctimonious life lessons culled from the corpses of their own murdered movies\".",
      "Tickets for the film, which reportedly cost more than $270m (\u00a3217m) to make, have only been put on presale in the last two weeks, relatively late for a big Disney film.",
      "Clarisse Loughrey from The Independent gave it one star, declaring that \"Rachel Zegler deserves better than the lazy, visually repellent Snow White\".",
      "\"What's most disheartening about it all is how predictable Disney's choices have become. With Snow White, they've finessed their formula \u2013 do the bare minimum to make a film, then simply slap a bunch of cutesy CGI animals all over it and hope no one notices,\" she concluded.",

      "\"I didn't do it for the money.\"",
      "In the wide-ranging BBC interview, Lord Sugar reflects on his life and career, and also discusses President - and original US Apprentice star - Donald Trump, former contestant Katie Hopkins, and the \"disaster\" of Brexit.",
      "Known for his cantankerous, no-nonsense business dealings and his \"you're fired/hired\" catchphrase, Lord Sugar insists his on-screen persona is how he is in real life.",
      "\"That is me mate, I'm promising you,\" he tells Rajan in the BBC Two interview.",
      "\"I have sat on the production line, I've made stuff, I've packed boxes, I've loaded lorries, I've delivered, I've collected money. Every single facet of business, I have done all of it.",
      "\"So when I got that Apprentice gig, sitting there listening to these budding entrepreneurs, I was able to interrogate them properly.\"",
      "Lord Sugar is arguably one of the UK's most famous rags-to-riches stories.",
      "After failing an aptitude test with tech company IBM as a young man in Hackney, east London, he started selling car aerials from a van, and later transistor radios.",
      "He launched his own electronics and technology company Amstrad in 1968, making home computers and satellite dishes for Sky, then through property investments and other ventures went on to become one of the country's richest men.",
      "'I'm nothing like Trump'",
      "Alan Sugar was approached by the BBC about making a UK version of a popular business-based entertainment show in the mid-noughties, towards the end of his challenging tenure as chair and owner of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club.",
      "But why did he say yes?",
      "\"Because Donald Trump in America did The Apprentice first of all - and I have got a home in America, in Florida, and all the people were telling my wife, 'This is the greatest TV show ever',\" he explains.",
      "\"So I knew of it.\"",
      "He's reticent to talk about the now US president, saying \"there's no comparison\" between himself and the other former face of The Apprentice.",
      "\"He's nothing like me and I'm nothing like him,\" he says. \"But the point is that what he's doing is very, very unusual.\"",
      "Last month, Trump clashed with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, in a furious exchange at the White House. \"Unbelievable,\" says Lord Sugar.",
      "\"There are certain things in life that I didn't think I'd ever experience. One was Brexit, which is the biggest tragedy. [Then] you've got a leader of a country, of America, publicly having a slanging match with someone else. It's just not right.",
      "\"By all means have a slanging match behind closed doors, but not publicly.\"",
      "He describes the very public incident as \"humiliating for Zelensky\" while showing Trump's \"temper\".",
      "\"It's not statesmanlike, is it?\"",

      "\"End of.\"",

      "Always forthright with his opinions, Lord Sugar made recent headlines by airing his views on topics including working from home, telling workers to \"get their bums back to the office\".",
      "He's also shared his thoughts on female football commentators, Brexit and Boris Johnson, to name a few subjects.",
      "Speaking in the House of Lords in 2018, Lord Sugar said Brexit campaigners, such as Tory politicians Johnson and Michael Gove, should be prosecuted for \"the \u00a3350m lie they put on the red bus\".",

      "\"I was about to say, 'Well, I'll hire you'. And she said, 'No, actually, I don't want to do it'. So she left,\" he remembers.",
      "\"She was good. She was the best of that crew. No question of it.\"",

      "Today, Clare is the marketing and social media manager for K-Stars, the UK's first and biggest shop devoted to Korean pop music.",
      "Based in Manchester, it started as a small business in Manchester's Affleck's Palace in 2019.",
      "\"You'd order things by PayPal, and then the CEO would pack them up by himself and ship everything out,\" Clare recalls.",
      "Now it's a two-storey emporium, based on Deansgate, with a staff of more than 20 dedicated K-Pop enthusiasts.",
      "It's a sign of how the genre has exploded in the UK, even though radio and television has largely shunned all but the biggest acts, like BTS, aespa and Blackpink.",
      "\"It's still kind of a niche - but it's not a small niche,\" says Clare. \"In my head I'm the only Itzy fan, but when I went to see them in concert, it was sold out.",
      "\"I was like, 'Wow, where have all you people been hiding?'\"",
      "In fact, the UK is now among the top 10 countries that follow K-Pop on Spotify, with the boyband Ateez placing two records in the top five of the UK album charts last year.",
      "This summer, Blackpink will play two nights at Wembley Stadium, with Stray Kids pulling off the same feat in Tottenham.",
      "Meanwhile, Twickenham Stadium will say \"anyong haseyo\" to one of K-pop's longest-running festivals.",
      "Established in 2008, the SM Town Live festival is a showcase for artists signed to the SM Entertainment Label, one of the industry's key players.",
      "To celebrate the company\u2019s 30th anniversary, they're transplanting the event from Seoul to Middlesex.",
      "\"It's essentially a multi-day festival all in one, because you've got so many artists all at the same venue, jam packed into the space of three or four hours,\" says Reese Carter, of boyband Dear Alice, who'll be among the performers in Twickenham.",
      "\"It's non-stop. You've got to prep yourself, because you'll definitely want to dance.\"",
      "\"It's very down to earth but it goes straight to your heart,\" adds Ten from K-Pop group WayV.",
      "Targeting the UK",
      "SM holds a unique place in Korea's musical history. Founded in 1995 by Lee Soo-man, it is widely credited with establishing the K-Pop template.",
      "It was the first company to introduce the trainee system, where young talent goes through intensive training that lasts months, or even years, before making their \"debut\".",
      "And it dominated what's known as the \"first generation\" of K-Pop idols, with bands like H.O.T. and S.E.S.",
      "The Twickenham show will pay tribute to that three-decade journey, with a line-up that includes everyone from Red Velvet, EXO and Girl's Generation to current chart-toppers like aespa, Riize and all of the sub-units of boyband NCT - which boasts more than 20 members.",
      "\"That's very rare,\" says Ten, one of the group's most recognisable (and chatty) stars.",
      "\"The last time we had an NCT concert as a whole was two years ago. It's so difficult to schedule every group to be in the same spot at the same time.\"",
      "But that's not all. The concert will also feature what's been billed as \"a group of promising trainees\", known for now as SMTR25 \u2013 showcasing the future of the label.",
      "\"Performing alongside the senior artists we've admired since our trainee days, as well as our talented junior artists, makes this an incredibly meaningful experience for us,\" said aespa in an email to the BBC.",
      "The hope is that shows like this will open a few doors - because, for all the strides K-Pop has made in the last couple of years, bands have consistently prioritised America over Europe.",
      "It's a logical step. The US is the world's biggest music market, so it offers more opportunities for touring and merchandise sales, while an MTV Award performance or a concert for NPR's Tiny Desk series travels further internationally than an appearance at the Brit Awards.",
      "\"The situation here isn't as good as what the American industry gets,\" acknowledges Amber Clare.",
      "\"Every single K-Pop group, if they announce a world tour, America will always be on the map - but European countries are always left wondering if they're going to be included or not.\"",
      "Things are changing, though.",
      "In a crowded market, labels are increasingly turning their attention to the UK \u2013 where the anglophone media has international reach, and there's a baked-in affection for boy and girl groups like Take That, Spice Girls, Girls Aloud and Little Mix.",
      "To make inroads, bands have teamed up with some of Britain's biggest artists.",
      "Aespa's 2023 single Better Things was co-written by Raye, while Le Sserafim collaborated with PinkPantheress on club anthem Crazy and with Jungle on their latest song, Come Over.",
      "Last year, SM went one further \u2013 creating a British boyband and putting them through the K-Pop machinery.",
      "That group was Dear Alice, whose gruelling traineeship was documented in BBC series Made In Korea.",
      "Having survived the process, the five-piece finally premiered their debut single, Ariana, at a massive SM Town concert in Seoul in January.",
      "\"These shows are timed down to the second,\" says singer Blaise Noon. \"When we got our time to go on stage, it was literally like, 8:30 and 48 seconds. It just shows how so well thought out is.\"",
      "Bringing the production to London is evidence that SM has its sights trained on the UK, he confirms.",
      "\"In the UK, we produce some really amazing boy groups, so I think we have that connection in the culture. So I think they definitely want to hit it. I can see it getting bigger and bigger every day.\"",
      "Ten, who releases a new solo album, Stunner, next week, says he's already experienced the devotion of UK fans.",
      "When his group WayV last visited England in 2023, \"we were surprised that people could sing along to our songs, because we sing in Chinese\", he says.",
      "\"This opportunity with SM Town, I feel like it's going to open a bigger market for K-Pop in the UK.",
      "\"I hope so, because I'd like to come and perform my solo stuff to my UK fans too.\"",
      "The opportunity is there.",
      "Nine of the 10 best-selling albums in the world last year were by South Korean artists, illustrating the music's broad appeal - but none of those records charted in the UK\u2019s Top 50.",
      "Lack of radio exposure is one factor - but listeners can also be put off by clunky English lyrics or the sudden-but-deliberate stylistic shifts that characterise K-Pop.",
      "If you're willing to dig into the genre, though, you can find some of the most audacious and indelible hooks music has to offer.",
      "One by-product of K-pop\u2019s (relative) obscurity is the bond it creates among fans. There's a sense of belonging that comes from discovering and nurturing your \"bias\", outside the glare of the mainstream.",
      "It\u2019s a relationship bands foster by a fire hose stream of social media content, where dance challenges, video diaries and photoshoots are posted daily.",
      "Dear Alice experienced the impact of that effort at a UK meet-and-greet last weekend.",
      "\"It felt like we were hanging out with a bunch of our mates,\" says Dexter Greenwood.",
      "\"They were just cool people,\" adds James Sharp. \"We're starting to recognise faces and remember people on this journey - and I think there's going to be more and more.\"",

      "While GPs will be crucial to the government's 10-year plan, there are not enough of them. Taking into account those working part-time, the equivalent number of fully qualified, full-time GPs is lower now than it was a decade ago - despite a rising population.",
      "Better use of technology",
      "The third of the big NHS changes is better use of new technology. At Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, they are using AI to speed up the comparison of heart scans.",
      "Before, a radiographer would take about half an hour to manually plot different points around a 3D image of the heart and identify any changes from a scan carried out six months earlier. Now AI tackles it in just a couple of minutes.",
      "Prof Andy Swift, who developed the AI tool with colleagues from the hospital and Sheffield University, says it has been used on 10,000 cases in the past few years. He says it is saving about 30 minutes each time.",
      "\"In the time that we've saved, we've managed to scan more patients and also do more reports for patients,\" he says.",
      "Despite these innovations, change on the scale the government promises is difficult in an NHS struggling to cope with growing demand.",
      "Solving the problems of the NHS also requires tackling the difficulties of social care, which supports around a million older and disabled people in the community.",
      "In February, NHS England figures showed around 14,000 people could not leave hospital, partly because of a lack of home and residential care. More social care can also reduce falls and illnesses.",
      "'We keep pressure off NHS'",
      "The family of Martin - who is 41 and is autistic, with cerebral palsy and epilepsy - say Sheffield care worker Darren Leigh has become like a brother to him over 20 years. Darren knows when Martin is unwell and can quickly get the right help.",
      "\"We keep pressure off the NHS a lot of the time,\" he says. \"There are [also] people in hospital that need to come out but can't because they can't get the care they need.\"",
      "The care system has struggled with underfunding, staff shortages and increasing demand for years. Like many care firms, the not-for-profit company Darren works for says it is \"on a bit of a knife-edge\" as the government is also increasing the costs of employing people. Employer's National Insurance and the National Minimum Wage will go up in April.",
      "The government says it will give councils in England nearly \u00a3900m more for adult and children's social care over the next year. Across the UK, there will be increased support for family carers and a fair pay agreement for staff is being introduced.",
      "Speaking to Panorama, Streeting says social care has a \"big part to play in terms of shifting care out of hospital into the community\". He adds: \"I'm convinced that we can spend NHS resources more effectively through social care.\"",
      "The main opposition parties in England agree social care needs to be reformed.",
      "But the Conservatives say the government has no real plan.",
      "The Liberal Democrats say the NHS cannot be fixed without fixing social care. Reform UK wants to simplify social care through a single funding stream.",
      "And the Green Party is calling for free social care.",
      "There are also questions over whether the NHS has the money to make all the changes the government is promising.",
      "It had a budget of \u00a3171bn in the financial year 2023-2024. It was also given an additional \u00a321bn over two years. NHS Providers, representing trusts across England, says most of that money has been eaten up by everyday pressures including wage rises, inflation and drug price increases.",
      "It warns these competing pressures make the change needed more difficult.",
      "The health and social care secretary agrees that it will not be easy, but says he cannot \"keep on pouring ever-increasing amounts of taxpayers' money into a system that is not set up to deliver best use of that money and best care for patients\"."

      "The lambs of the affected ewe tested negative for bird flu, the spokesperson added.",

      "NSA chief executive Phil Stocker said the positive case was \"not a threat to food safety of consumers\".",

      "\"Commercial producers continue to do all they can to protect their animals by following strict biosecurity measures.",

    "summary": "An inquest into the death of Ida Lock has shone light on repeat mistakes - and wider failures in certain hospitals across England",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Michael read this article",
      "By the entrance to Furness General Hospital in Barrow-in-Furness sits a sculpture of a moon with 11 stars. It is a memorial to the mother and babies who died unnecessarily due to poor care at the hospital between 2004 and 2013.",
      "Inscribed underneath is a short verse: \"Forever in our hearts; Forever held in the love that brought you here; Our star in the night sky, spring blossom, summer rose, falling leaf, winter frost; Forever in our hearts.\"",
      "When the memorial was unveiled in 2019, Aaron Cummins who is chief executive at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: \"We will never forget what happened.  We owe it to those who died to continually improve in everything that we do.\"",
      "Barely a month later, Sarah Robinson stepped into a birthing pool at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, a hospital run by the same NHS trust. She was about to give birth to her second child.",
      "Within an hour, Ida Lock was born; within a week, she was dead.",
      "What her parents were put through on that day \u2013 and in the years since \u2013 goes a long way to explaining why maternity services in England have failed so many families.",
      "The inquest into Ida Lock's death, which concluded last week, exposed over five weeks why maternity services across England have long struggled to improve - and this one case holds a mirror to issues that appear to be prevalent across a number of trusts.",
      "'I thought I'd done something wrong'",
      "The memorial the trust erected at Furness General Hospital followed a damning inquiry into the trust's maternity services.",
      "That investigation, carried out by Dr Bill Kirkup and published in March 2015, found there had been a dysfunctional culture at Furness General, substandard clinical skills, poor risk assessments and a grossly deficient response to adverse incidents with a repeated failure to properly investigate cases and learn lessons.",
      "Morecambe Bay became a byword for poor maternity care and the trust promised to enact all 18 recommendations from the Kirkup review. And yet that never happened.",
      "\"We wouldn't be in this situation now if they'd followed those recommendations,\" says Ms Robinson.",
      "Ida Lock's inquest began last month, more than five years after she died - the delay was down to several reasons, including its particular complexity.",
      "What emerged was just how profoundly many of those lessons had not been learned. Particularly egregious, says Ms Robinson, was a suggestion from a midwife \u2013 shortly after the birth - that Ida's poor condition was linked to her smoking, something Sarah had never done in her life.",
      "\"The amount of days I cried because I thought I'd done something wrong... every Christmas, every holiday, you always have this heavy weight that you shouldn't be having fun. And all along, some people knew.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the staff who had delivered Ida were told in an email that \"they had demonstrated excellent teamwork, and had all worked in the best interests of mum and baby\".",
      "As the coroner found on Friday, Ida's death was wholly avoidable, caused by a failure to recognise that she was in distress prior to her birth, and then a botched resuscitation attempt after she was born.",
      "By the time she was transferred to a higher dependency unit, at the Royal Preston hospital, she had suffered a brain injury from which she could not recover.",
      "Having failed to deliver their daughter safely, Ida's parents would have expected that the trust would properly and openly investigate her death. Instead, they pursued an investigation that Carey Galbraith, the midwife who completed it, would later describe as \"not worth the paper it was written on\".",
      "They didn't take responsibility for their failings despite having an independent report from the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) \u2013 a body that examined questionable maternity care \u2013 clearly stating their shortcomings.",
      "\"Our efforts to get any answers have been met with a complete block,\" said Ida's father, Ryan Lock. \"Particular people have told us to our face something that wasn't the case, that Ida was poorly before she was born, and that's the reason why that this happened.\"",
      "Clearly, the Morecambe Bay report was not, as was hoped, a line in the sand for maternity services across England, or a rallying cry for widespread improvements. As the inquest has shown, it did not even lead to sustained improvement at Morecambe Bay.",
      "Tabetha Darmon, chief nursing officer at the trust, said in a statement last week that it has made improvements since.",
      "\"We take the conclusions from the coroner very seriously and have made a number of the improvements identified during the inquest. We are carefully reviewing the learning identified to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another family.\"",
      "'A woeful picture' nationwide",
      "Elsewhere around the country, other trusts have also been forced to face their failures, often by grieving families.",
      "In March 2022, an investigation into services at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust found that more than 200 mothers and babies could have survived with better care. Then, in October that year, a review into maternity services at East Kent Hospitals University NHS trust found that at least 45 babies might have survived if they had been given proper treatment.",
      "And an ongoing review into the maternity care provided by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust, due to be completed next year, is set to be the biggest yet, with around 2,500 cases being examined.",
      "Even that does not tell the full story. Families in several areas, including Sussex, Leeds and Oxford, want local investigations into their maternity services. And an annual review of units by inspectors the Care Quality Commission (CQC) paints a woeful picture.",
      "In the commission's latest report, published in September, not a single one of the 131 units inspected received the top rating, Outstanding, for providing safe care.",
      "About a third (35%) were rated as Good for safety, around half (47%) were rated as Requires Improvement while almost a fifth (18%) were deemed Inadequate, the lowest grading.",
      "\"While we identified pockets of excellent practice,\" wrote the CQC, \"we are concerned that too many women and babies are not receiving the high-quality maternity care they deserve.\"",
      "Professor James Walker, who used to be the clinical director for HSIB, said that from his visits around England, the problem was that maternity units \"didn't have the skills, the finances, or the drive to actually make the changes that are required.\"",
      "Ida Lock's inquest was a case in point. What emerged over the inquiry was that the midwife delivering Ida was not compliant with crucial training in heart-rate monitoring, that staff did not know how to investigate incidents or realise they should inform external regulators of an unexpected death.",
      "\"It's deeply distressing,\" says Dr Kirkup. \"It's bad enough that other trusts didn't listen, but for it to happen again in this same trust is unforgivable.\"",
      "From poor culture to lack of teamwork",
      "Listening to his exasperation brought me back to the autumn of 2022. On that bright morning, Dr Kirkup was speaking at the publication of his inquiry into maternity care in East Kent.",
      "Many of the failures he'd found there \u2013 poor culture, lack of teamworking, not listening to families, a failure to investigate incidents or learn from them \u2013 were a repetition of what he'd uncovered at Morecambe Bay seven years earlier.",
      "He struggled to hide his frustration that here he was again, forced once more to explain to families why they had been failed by a trust that did not know how to do the right thing.",
      "Like Morecambe Bay, East Kent deteriorated even after his 2022 inquiry. Within months of the publication, inspectors became so concerned about its services that they considered closing maternity care at one of its hospitals, the William Harvey in Ashford.",
      "The CQC found that staff were not carrying out basic tasks such as washing their hands in between patients, or wearing gloves and aprons when delivering care, and that they were leaving urine and bloodstains in toilets.",
      "The inspection highlighted how little the East Kent review had changed things where it mattered, front-line in the wards.",
      "As the report had said, \"there are deep-seated and longstanding problems of organisational culture\" in the trust's maternity units, including \"disgraceful behaviour and flawed teamworking that were previously left to fester\".",
      "In October 2024, the board of East Kent Hospitals Trust said that it apologised unreservedly for the pain and loss, and for the failures of the board.",
      "It said: \"We are on a journey to fundamentally transform the way we work. Changing the culture of a large and complex organisation takes time and there is much work still to do, but we are determined to succeed so that we are providing the right standard of care and compassion.\"",
      "Derek Richford, whose grandson Harry had died in avoidable circumstances in 2017 at East Kent, is now working with the trust to improve maternity care and argues that it is an uphill struggle. \"It's been a devil of a job,\" he claims, \"to get people in the trust to simply read the report, even the summary.\"",
      "Should medics be punished?",
      "The question asked by some families is why heads haven't rolled. There is a widespread recognition in healthcare that punishing medics for individual clinical errors does not necessarily lead to safer outcomes.",
      "It can in some cases promote a defensive culture, where people do not own up to their mistakes and lead to individuals being blamed rather than supported to improve.",
      "The day after the Shrewsbury maternity report was published, the then-Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department would \"go after the people responsible.",
      "\"I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account,\" he added.",
      "Three years later, there is no evidence of anybody being held to account.",
      "The Department of Health says it is \"unable to comment on individual staffing responsibility while an active police investigation is taking place\".",
      "\u00a31.15bn of maternity-related payouts",
      "Even when major reviews into maternity care have led to families getting individual feedback and told they had been failed, any subsequent legal action leads to NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, requiring that the case is examined afresh. This can add further delays and costs to the process.",
      "NHS Resolution said that inquiries \"do not look at cases from a legal liability perspective. Failings by a clinician might amount to errors of judgement, but that is not necessarily sufficient to constitute negligence under the law\".",
      "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "In 2023-24, NHS Resolution paid out \u00a31.15bn for maternity-related deaths and injuries, 41% of its total payments, despite maternity care forming a much smaller proportion of a trust's daily activities.",
      "\"NHS resolution is this anonymous body,\" says Derek Richford, \"that you can't get a name of the person you want to speak to. You can't get any accountability. And those people are the puppeteers for the people below who have to run around doing their will. It's wrong.\"",
      "'The time for inquiries is over'",
      "There are now calls for the government to establish a national maternity inquiry, rather than relying on individual ones at different hospitals and trusts. More than 36,000 people have signed up to one such petition, led by two sets of bereaved parents; while campaign group Maternity Safety Alliance is making a similar call. So far, the Department of Health hasn't committed to a national inquiry.",
      "Both Dr Kirkup and Prof Walker argue that the time for inquiries is over.",
      "\"Another inquiry will find exactly the same things that we find at the moment,\" said Prof Walker, \"we know what the problems are.\"",
      "What is needed is a national plan to improve maternity care, argues Dr Kirkup. He says he has been working with the Department of Health on drawing up plans to improve teamworking and providing compassionate care.",
      "Streeting has said he will \"fix our maternity services\", including supporting trusts to make rapid improvements and training more midwives, but has not detailed how he intends to go about this. \"I just wish that the Secretary of State would announce his intentions,\" says Dr Kirkup.",
      "Prof Walker also believes that a national programme of improvement and oversight should be launched, taking the learning from individual investigations and ensuring it is embedded across the system. For it to be truly effective, he argues, it will require a specific type of leadership.",
      "\"The NHS traditionally doesn't appoint leaders,\" he says, \"it appoints managers, people who come in and take the status quo that's there, and just make sure that it gets more efficient. That doesn't make it better, or innovate or improve.",
      "\"One of my frustrations over the years, working in various places, is I kept being told 'we don't do that'. And I kept on saying, 'why don't we do that?' The simple questions are always the best ones, because they challenge the status quo.\"",
      "Prof Walker highlights that there has been some progress in recent years, however. The latest figures on Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations (the successor body to HSIB) show that the number of incidents of both potential and severe brain injuries have decreased.",
      "Back in East Kent, Mr Richford has observed some changes too. \"We have a new board of directors that appear to be doing the right thing \u2013 they're certainly saying the right thing,\" he says.",
      "\"[But] even now, seven years on [from Harry's death], it's still not as it should be. We are still trying to make sure that the trust is being as transparent as they say they are.\"",
      "As for Ida Lock's parents, the road on which their daughter would have grown up leads directly to Morecambe Bay, and a small patch of sand. This is where they scattered some of her ashes. Now they refer to it as Ida's beach. When they pass by, with their two other children, they regularly blow her a kiss across the sand.",
      "Their fervent hope is that other couples do not experience a similar fate. But they know that long before them, other families also suffered - and they aren't confident that more won't in the future.",
      "\"Those families went through what we're going through now,\" says Sarah. \"But nothing came of it. You can't trust that [improvements] are ever going to happen.",
      "\"I hope something does change.\"",

    "story": [
      "Matt Hancock has defended government deals to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic, saying the country was in a \"desperate situation\" at the time.",
      "In a bad-tempered session at the Covid inquiry, the former health secretary repeatedly criticised the line of questioning describing it as \"naive\", \"hostile\" and \"inappropriate\".",
      "He said he was \"not at all surprised\" when a so-called VIP lane for PPE suppliers with a political connection was set up, describing it as \"standard practice\".",
      "At one point, the chairwoman of the inquiry, Baroness Hallett, intervened, telling Hancock it was her job to learn lessons for any future pandemic.",
      "'Radically short of PPE'",
      "Hancock was appearing for the fifth time at the Covid inquiry, which is now investigating the purchase and distribution of \u00a315bn of PPE in the pandemic, along with testing kits, ventilators and other pieces of medical equipment.",
      "He defended a public \"call to arms\" made at a Downing Street news conference on 10 April 2020 for more UK suppliers of PPE to come forward.",
      "The inquiry has heard from previous witnesses, including the government's former chief commercial officer Sir Gareth Rhys Williams, that the appeal was counterproductive, leading to a large number of approaches which threatened to overwhelm the system.",
      "\"We were radically short of PPE [at the time] and the country was about to run out at a national level,\" Hancock told the inquiry.",
      "\"No-one has testified that the call to arms led to anything other than more PPE\u2026 So I stand by that.\"",
      "The former health secretary was then asked about the High Priority Lane, or VIP lane, which was set up by officials in the Department of Health in England to help manage offers by prioritising those referred by an MP, member of the House of Lords or senior civil servant.",
      "Hancock said he was not involved in designing the system, which he said had made him the target of an \"enormous amount of conspiracy theories\".",
      "The inquiry commissioned an expert report from Prof Albert Sanchez-Graells, a professor of law at the University of Bristol, which was critical of the approach and found no evidence of similar prioritisation in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, or  other countries around the world.",
      "\"It's fine having academics write papers about this stuff\u2026 but you've got to understand what it was like [at the time],\" said Hancock.",
      "\"The pressure to save lives was intense, but so was the reality that high-quality offers would be sent through to senior decision-makers, and you had to have a process for dealing with that.\"",
      "He said that other countries would have had their own systems for prioritising offers for PPE and medical equipment in different ways.",
      "Hancock was later asked about a contract awarded to a firm run by Alex Bourne, who owned a pub in his West Suffolk constituency, to make vials for Covid testing.",
      "Emails show Hancock passed on communications from Mr Bourne to the then health minister Lord Bethell, describing his analysis of the wider testing system as a \"very interesting critique\" from a \"very impressive guy\".",
      "In questioning, Hancock said he acted with \"impeccable behaviour\" at the time, and accused the inquiry's chief counsel Richard Wald KC of cherry-picking a \"couple of messages\" that have the \"most tabloid interest\".",
      "He said the inquiry had followed a \"wholly naive\" line of questioning by ignoring the reality of the situation at the time, while making \"terribly pejorative\" statements that were \"totally inappropriate\".",
      "At the conclusion of his evidence, Baroness Hallett told Hancock that he \"was not the first and I'm sure won't be the last witness to think the inquiry is all about criticising people\".",
      "\"My aim is to investigate what happened, to explore matters of public concern, to get people to answer on those areas, and to try to come up with recommendations that will save lives,\" she added."

      "Parliamentary officials have launched a separate bullying probe into Lowe. Meanwhile, the Met Police is investigating Lowe after Reform accused him of threatening \"physical violence\" against the party's chairman.",
      "The Great Yarmouth MP denied the claims and said his suspension was a reaction to criticising party leader Nigel Farage.",
      "Following the report's publication, Reform UK told the BBC Lowe had been expelled from the parliamentary party.",
      "Reform is also in the process of cancelling Lowe's party membership.",
      "He was suspended earlier this month, following allegations he had threatened party chairman Zia Yusuf in December.",

      "\"At the very least Mr Lowe should have taken seriously the distress and concerns,\" it added.",
      "Lowe had a \"duty and responsibility to ensure systems were in place to avoid junior members of staff being treated in any unfair and discriminatory way\", she added.",
      "Concluding her report, Ms Perry said there was a \"real risk\" that the alleged treatment could be a breach of the Equality Act.",
      "Ms Perry said her role was not to determine any criminality but to assess the \"veracity\" of the bullying and harassment allegations against Lowe and his staff, determine any legal implications, and recommend measures to prevent future incidents.",
      "She recommended Reform should be \"quite strict\" about ensuring party members were \"fully acquainted\" with parliamentary rules on bullying and discrimination laws.",
      "Lowe had previously claimed that Ms Perry had contacted him to say she found \"no credible\" evidence against him - leading to the KC to contact the BBC to rebut his claims.",
      "Responding to the report, Lowe said in a social media post: \"There was no bullying. There never has been any bullying. Using such claims to damage me through my staff is shameful.\"",
      "Lowe insisted the claims are \"outright lies\" and called the process \"disgustingly biased\".",

      "He claimed that the two women only came forward after disciplinary action was taken against them - a claim contradicted by the report.",
      "The report said one of the women made the initial allegations of \"bullying and unacceptable conduct from a particular individual in the constituency office\" on 18 December last year.",
      "She also formally made her complaint to the Parliamentary Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS) in January.",
      "The complaints by both women were raised \"prior to any disciplinary procedures set in motion by Lowe against each of them\", the report said.",
      "The report added: \"Any suggestion from Mr Lowe, as he has made in the media, that these women complained following the instigation of disciplinary proceedings against either of them is incorrect.\"",
      "Lowe repeated his claim Reform only began investigating the complaints after he publicly criticised leader Farage in an interview with the Daily Mail.",
      "Lowe was suspended from the party two days after the interview was published.",
      "In his statement, Lowe said he had \"cooperated and spoken at length with the KC [Reform] instructed, at great cost to the party, to investigate a minor staff matter.\"",
      "But the report stated Lowe had \"declined to formally respond to the complaints\" and pointed to a message Lowe had posted on social media, where he said he would \"not be engaging with the Reform 'investigation' into blatantly vexatious complaints\".",
      "The BBC has been told Ms Perry did not expect her report to be published on Tuesday, with the decision to do so taken by the party.",
      "She had given Lowe until Wednesday to reply to her requests for information, although it was not anticipated that he would engage further."

      "\"I would have just sat in the audience.\"",
      "In an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Reeves defended her decision to accept the tickets because she \"thought that was the right thing to do from a security perspective\".",
      "She said: \"I do now have security which means it's not as easy as it would've been in the past to, to just sit in a concert, although that would probably be a lot easier for everyone concerned.\"",
      "Reeves was also asked why she did not pay for the tickets herself and responded: \"These weren't tickets that you could pay for, so there wasn't a price to those tickets... they weren't tickets that you were able to buy.\"",

    "summary": "BBC political editor Chis Mason examines the fiscal dilemmas facing the government over spending and growth.",
    "story": [
      "\"The world has changed\" is the mantra we are hearing from the government.",
      "It is a phrase designed to explain and justify the chancellor's argument on Wednesday in what is known as her Spring Statement.",
      "The Conservatives are branding it an \"emergency Budget\", which ministers insist is nonsense, but it is certainly true it is a bigger event than it was expected to be just a few months ago.",
      "We won't see Rachel Reeves standing on the steps of 11 Downing Street waving a red box around and it will be shadow chancellor Mel Stride responding to her in the House of Commons, rather than the leader of the opposition as happens on Budget Day.",
      "But other elements of the day will have a Budget day feel, not least in the overall vibe of whether Parliament and the country feel confidence in the government's economic prospectus.",
      "The backdrop is pretty bleak.",
      "When Labour won last year's general election, they said the first of their \"missions\" was to \"kickstart economic growth\".",
      "The thing is, there isn't any - the economy is flatlining.",
      "Plus, inflation is up and government borrowing costs are up.",
      "Then there are the big-picture challenges: the UK has an ageing population, the benefits bill is going skywards, the dangerous international picture is demanding more money for defence and the country is saddled with huge debt, which attracts huge debt interest payments.",
      "Add to that the wild unpredictability of US President Donald Trump, the looming prospect of tariffs and the vast uncertainty over Ukraine's future and European security.",
      "All of which prompts the question: if the world really has changed, how much appetite now or in the future might Labour have for a really far-reaching re-examination of how it approaches government?",
      "With big and potentially unpalatable trade-offs looming, what alternatives could there be?",
      "There are loads of ideas it could explore, from the left, the right and everywhere in between. But let's take a look at a few, all floated publicly by some on their own side.",
      "What is the chancellor's Spring Statement and what will be in it?",
      "Loosen the fiscal rules?",
      "At the heart of the political conversation this week are the government's self- imposed \"fiscal rules\".",
      "The government has chosen them in the hope they illustrate financial responsibility,  a trustworthiness on the international stage that the UK can pay its way and service its debts.",
      "The two rules are that day-to-day costs are met by tax revenues and that debt is falling as a share of the economy five years ahead.",
      "They are, ultimately, arbitrary: managing the national finances is complex and multilayered and while governments will often impose limits on themselves in the hope of portraying credibility, precisely what they are can vary significantly.",
      "Former Labour cabinet minister Lord David Blunkett told the BBC at the weekend he \"would like the Chancellor to loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", adding that they amounted to \"Treasury orthodoxy\u2026at its worst\".",
      "\"I would lift them marginally. I would raise the self-imposed rule by at least \u00a310-15 billion and I would spend a great chunk of it on what we did back in '97 with the new deal for the unemployed,\" the former work and pensions secretary told BBC Radio 4.",
      "Lord Blunkett isn't the only one \u2013 Jagjit Chadha, Professor of Economics at Cambridge University, has written in The Guardian this week of his scepticism about the value of the fiscal rules.",
      "There is another parallel that could be drawn too.",
      "Last week the German parliament voted to allow a massive increase in defence spending.",
      "The new law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules.",
      "Could, should, the UK do the same?",
      "Both the German parallel and Lord Blunkett's suggestion get short shrift from senior government figures.",
      "\"When people say change the fiscal rules, that means borrowing more money,\" is how one source put it to me.",
      "\"We have got to be honest about the implications of higher borrowing. If we did what Germany is doing, it could add \u00a34bn to borrowing costs, not far off the prisons budget,\" they added.",
      "It is also pointed out that Germany's national debt is vastly smaller than the UK's as a share of national income.",
      "And there is no appetite to do anything that might provoke the international markets to go wobbly about the UK again, as happened when Liz Truss was prime minister.",
      "What about a wealth tax?",
      "Some on the left of the Labour Party have been calling for this, as have the Green Party and others.",
      "The idea would attempt to do what it said on the tin, but observers such as Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies are cautious about its likely effectiveness as a revenue raiser.",
      "Before the last Budget in the autumn a cross-party group of MPs suggested it, while Labour MP Richard Burgon raised it as an idea at Prime Minister's Questions earlier this month.",
      "Reeves has long distanced herself from the idea, arguing in 2023: \"I don't see the way to prosperity as being through taxation.\"",
      "Reeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are fearful of being portrayed as high taxers and high spenders, an image plenty within Labour think has previously cost them dearly at elections.",
      "But could a one-off such tax ever be tempting as ministers confront awkward spending squeezes in places and that ever growing demand for defence spending?",
      "Other taxes rises in spotlight",
      "What about cranking up income tax, national insurance or VAT?",
      "After all, these are the big levers of revenue raising for any chancellor.",
      "But there is a catch: Labour promised not to in its election manifesto.",
      "They did, nonetheless, put up national insurance, albeit on employers not employees \u2013 a rise that is due to kick in next month and is causing considerable anxiety for many businesses.",
      "So why not ratchet up one of the others?",
      "Some say, for a start, it could further depress an already stagnant economy, as well as further depress the outlook of many on politicians' capacities to keep promises.",
      "On the other hand, increases to these taxes tend to lead to a reliable big uptick in tax revenue and because they reach significant swathes of the population, they don't energise smaller, often well organised sectors who can then vociferously oppose a more targeted and less revenue rich idea.",
      "A good example of this are the dozens of tractors on Whitehall as farmers in their thousands made their views known about changes to inheritance tax.",
      "Thinking about all this was hinted at, alongside changes to the fiscal rules, by the now former international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, in her resignation last month over the cut in the international aid budget to bolster defence spending.",
      "In her resignation letter to the prime minister, she wrote that she had hoped the government would \"collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, just as other nations are doing\".",
      "She added: \"It will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, where strategic decisions for the sake of our country's security cannot be ducked.\"",
      "Smashing manifesto promises is not something governments do lightly and Labour would tread particularly carefully around these flagship pledges on the economy, so often for many a perceived weak spot in the party's credibility.",
      "The tax burden, on average, is also generationally high \u2013 another reason these ideas could be a mighty hard sell even if ministers were willing to break their promises.",
      "And if ideas from their own side, like these three, aren't palatable, all of which make an already big State even bigger, there are those suggested by the Conservatives and others.",
      "Reducing benefit spending",
      "Cutting benefits much more is one such idea.",
      "The former Conservative and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, writing in the Telegraph, suggested closing eight government departments, saving \u00a324bn by cutting the public sector workforce and instituting a two year public sector pay freeze.",
      "He reckoned these ideas alongside others could cut government spending from 45% of national income to 40%.",
      "Many of these might not be instantly palatable to a Labour government, just like those from their own side, but all of this brings us back to where we began: has the world changed? By how much? For how long?",
      "And just how bold might the government have to think \u2013 and soon \u2013 if it really has?",

      "But supporters argues the law needs changing because some people have horrible deaths, however good their end-of-life or palliative care is.",
      "Responding to the extension to the implementation deadline, a source opposed to the bill told the BBC: \"This shows it's a long way from safe. If they need four years to work it out then it shows this bill is still riddled with problems.\"",
      "MPs are debating the amendment in a committee scrutinising the proposed law line-by-line.",
      "The committee is hoping to finish going through the bill on Tuesday evening.",
      "A spokesman for Leadbeater said: \"Kim has always been clear that it's more important to get the assisted dying legislation right than to do it quickly.",

      "MPs voted in support of a proposal to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, in November 2024.",
      "The historic vote saw 330 MPs support the assisted dying bill, and 275 reject it.",
      "MPs were given a free vote on the issue, which meant they could make their own decision rather than follow party instructions. The government is impartial on the issue.",
      "Months of detailed scrutiny and further votes in Parliament are required before the bill could become law.",
      "Changes have already been made by the committee of MPs examining the bill.",
      "For example, under the original proposals, a High Court judge would have to approve each request to end a life.",
      "But Leadbeater suggested a three-person panel comprising a senior legal figure, a psychiatrist and a social worker should oversee applications instead.",
      "The MPs reviewing the bill have agreed to adopt this approach.",

      "Ministers have delayed a tax to fund the removal of unsafe cladding from homes after developers warned it could hamper the government's housebuilding plans.",
      "The Ministry for Housing said on Monday the Building Safety Levy would be introduced from autumn 2026, rather than this year.",
      "The tax on new homes is expected to raise \u00a33.4bn to be spent on building safety, including efforts to take down dangerous cladding.",
      "The delay comes after developers said the tax could increase building costs and result in the government missing its target to build 1.5 million homes by 2030.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook told LBC the government was still committed to the tax and insisted the delay would not slow down the pace of improving building safety.",
      "\"The previous government left us with an unpalatable inheritance in that respect,\" Pennycook said.",
      "\"We've got to increase ther pace of works being done. Leaseholders are still trapped in these buildings.\"",
      "Neil Jefferson, chief executive of the Home Builders Federation, welcomed the delay as \"recognition from government that these additional costs will inevitably constrain housing supply\".",
      "But he suggested the \"grossly unfair\" tax on housing developers should be scrapped altogether.",
      "He said: \"As proposed it will add thousands of pounds to the cost of new homes, threatening the viability of sites across swathes of the country at a time when industry is striving to reverse the decline in homebuilding numbers that we have seen in recent years.\"",
      "Cladding removal plan not ambitious enough, say MPs",
      "New deadlines set for fixing dangerous cladding",
      "The tax was first announced in 2021 by the then-Conservative government.",
      "Some of the money raised from the tax will go towards the removal of dangerous cladding from buildings, following the deadly fire at Grenfell Tower.",
      "Ministers have set aside \u00a35.1bn to resolve the cladding crisis, expecting developers, building owners and social housing providers to pay the rest.",
      "Thousands of homes have been made safe, but as of December last year, work had yet to start on a quarter of the 1,323 tall buildings requiring attention.",
      "Up to 12,000 buildings and three million people could be affected.",
      "The lengthy process of identifying what work needs to be done and who should pay for it has left many residents living in fear of fires or with worries over costly repair bills.",
      "In its general election manifesto, Labour pledged to \"take decisive action to improve building safety\" and to \"put a renewed focus on ensuring those responsible for the building safety crisis pay to put it right\".",
      "Last year, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the government was planning to introduce the Building Safety Levy in September this year.",
      "But in a letter to Rayner, dozens of developers said \"the ability of the industry to invest in increasing the supply of new homes to meet the government's 1.5 million target is being threatened by the imposition of new taxes\".",
      "Housebuilders say they are already paying \u00a36.5bn towards improving building safety through corporation tax and argue makers of unsafe cladding should bear more of the costs.",
      "Home Builders Federation estimates the tax could add \u00a31,580 to the cost of building a home and lead to the loss of about 70,000 affordable homes over 10 years.",
      "A Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"This government is determined to make Britain's homes safer by making developers pay their fair share to fix unsafe buildings through the Building Safety Levy.",
      "\"We have extended the timeline to give developers more time to factor levy costs into their plans while continuing to support them to build safe homes, and at the same time we are continuing to work quickly to fix buildings with unsafe cladding through our Remediation Acceleration Plan.\""

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has said that the government can be more efficient by using AI and technology, ahead of the Spring Statement.",
      "Questioned on BBC Radio 5 Live on whether unprotected departments would face cuts, the PM said ministers were \"looking across the board\", but he wanted to challenge government to be more efficient.",
      "Rachel Reeves has confirmed civil service departments will be asked to cut 15% from their budgets, but there is political unease among Labour MPs about the scale of cuts to departments, which the chancellor will outline in her statement on Wednesday.",
      "It comes after the government unveiled sweeping changes to the benefits system, aimed at saving \u00a35bn a year by 2030.",
      "Reeves confirms 15% cut to Civil Service running costs",
      "Rachel Reeves: I will not 'tax and spend'",
      "Starmer pitches reform to 'shackled' civil servants",
      "Sir Keir said the government was \"looking across the board\" at spending, when asked by the BBC whether cuts would be announced for departments whose spending is not protected, such as the Ministry of Justice.",
      "\"At the budget last year we made some record investments, and we're not going to undo that,\" he added, pointing to increased NHS spending.",
      "He said: \"We're essentially asking businesses across the country to be more efficient, to look at AI and tech in the way that they do their business.",
      "\"I want the same challenge in government, which is 'why shouldn't we be more efficient?', so we will be looking there and in one or two other places.\"",
      "The PM was asked by the BBC later if he would consider changing the government's fiscal rules and responded: \"No, because we had to stabilise the economy, which is what we did with the Budget.\"",
      "He added: \"The difference is that the global situation has changed - I think most people would understand that in the last few weeks and months the international insecurity has got very real - that does impact domestically.\"",
      "The chancellor's rules, which she has argued will bring stability to the UK economy, are that day-to-day government costs will be paid for by tax income, rather than borrowing; and to get debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament in 2029/30.",
      "Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said it was the chancellor's decisions that were the cause of sluggish growth forecasts, leading to the imposition of cuts.",
      "\"We wouldn't be here because we would not have put those confidence-destroying taxes on the economy,\" he told BBC Breakfast.",
      "\"We would have made different decisions, tackled welfare reform earlier - she's doing that now but if it's a moral mission of this government, why didn't they do it nine months ago?\"",
      "Welfare budget",
      "Reeves' plan for major money-saving from the welfare budget comes on top of her decision to axe the universal provision of winter fuel payments and only give them to the poorest pensioners.",
      "She told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that government running costs would be cut, with savings made from back office and administrative roles rather than front-line services.",
      "Last month, the government cut the international aid budget to boost defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027, as leaders across Europe looked to overhaul defence policies over fears the US could make a deal with Russia to end the Ukraine war which leaves the continent vulnerable.",
      "Sir Keir and US President Donald Trump spoke about progress on an economic deal between the UK and US on Sunday night, Downing Street said.",
      "It comes as reports that a digital services tax on tech giants could be slashed or abolished.",
      "On Monday, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander denied the government was signalling a return towards an austerity model.",
      "Challenged on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Alexander highlighted that Labour had increased public spending in its first budget in October.",
      "\"We have to take some really very difficult decisions and in terms of welfare we will always make sure that there is a system that provides a safety net for the most vulnerable,\" she said.",
      "\"We're investing over \u00a320bn more in the NHS and we've seen waiting lists coming down in hospitals now for the fifth month in a row.",
      "\"The Office for Budget Responsibility last year at the time of the budget said it was one of the most expansionist budgets ever, of all time, so we are not returning to austerity.\"",
      "Civil Service unions have warned that services could deteriorate with the loss of jobs.",
      "Paul Novak, the general secretary of the Trade Union Congress (TUC), told BBC Radio 4's World at One that \"there are always efficiencies\" to make in the civil service.",
      "But if the government were \"serious about making public services work and delivering for people who make those services work then you've got to look at investing in those services,\" Mr Novak said.",
      "He argued \"you'd be hard pressed to find anybody in the civil service or the public sector who say there is a lot of fat to be trimmed\".",
      "The TUC, which helps represent just under 190,000 civil servants in Public and Commercial Services Union, were a \"long way\" from strike action on proposed changes, Mr Novak said.",
      "The UK civil service workforce is the largest it has been for nearly 20 years, with 548,000 employees, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Numbers swelled by more than 100,000 due to the impact of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic.",

    "story": [
      "English councils will be ranked according to their pothole fixing progress under government plans, with those who fail to publish updates losing out on millions in funding.",
      "The Department for Transport (DfT) said local authorities' road maintenance pot would be boosted by \u00a3500m from mid-April, but councils must publish annual reports detailing progress on potholes or lose a quarter of that extra funding.",
      "The prime minister told the BBC this would produce a rating system \"so we know who is the best and who is not the best\".",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said the government should focus on preventative measures rather than \"reactively\" fixing potholes.",
      "Clearing the country's backlog of road repairs would take more than a decade and cost almost \u00a317bn to fix, the LGA said, citing a survey from the Asphalt Industry Alliance.",
      "According to data from the RAC, there are six potholes for every mile of road in England and Wales.",
      "All English local authorities will get 75% of the extra cash promised, but if a council does not publish a report on road maintenance, including details on pothole filling progress, the remaining 25% will be withheld.",
      "The held back funding will be given instead to councils the DfT believes have made proven progress.",
      "The policy will only apply to English councils as funding for Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish local authorities is a devolved matter.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC a RAG (red, amber, green) rating system would be produced for councils on pothole maintenance.",
      "He said that \"until now, nobody has known how many potholes are being filled and where they're being filled\".",
      "\"We all have the experience of driving from one place to the next and we know some places are better than others,\" he said, adding that the RAG system will help to avoid \"the lottery that we have now\".",
      "'Not helpful'",
      "However, Lucy Nethsingha, leader of Cambridgeshire County Council and chair of the LGA's Liberal Democrat group, said the amount of money was \"nowhere near the amount that is needed\".",
      "\"The implication that we are not spending it well is not helpful,\" she said, adding that the government was announcing \"stuff that was already announced several times over and that doesn't help increase people's faith in politics\".",
      "\"It's not clear that there is extra money coming as a result of this announcement. There is extra red tape and I don't think that's going to be helpful,\" she said.",
      "She added in order to fix the roads in Cambridgeshire alone, the council had a shortfall \u00a3410m while the money the government was \"re-announcing\" for the whole of England was \u00a3500m.",
      "\"Our roads are like a worn out pair of trousers, you can keep fixing the holes, but what you actually need is a new pair of trousers - or in this case a proper resurfacing.\"",
      "But the prime minister said \"any council that says to me it's not enough money, I'd say come back to see me in June when you've actually filled these potholes in with your RAG rating and then we'll see if we can release more money to you\".",
      "\"Don't start the exercise complaining that you haven't got enough money.\"",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was \"not pretending that the money we're making available will fill every pothole\".",
      "Asked whether withholding cash from some councils would just make things worse for drivers in some areas, she said she expected most local authorities would be able to \"comply with these requirements\".",
      "\"We want councils to be open and honest about how they are using that money so that the public can go onto their local council's website and see what action is being taken,\" she said.",
      "Under the government's rules, councils must say how much they are spending, how many potholes have been filled and detail long-term road maintenance plans in reports that have to be published by the end of June.",
      "By the end of October, councils must also demonstrate that communities have been consulted on where repairs should take place.",
      "The DfT added that councils who \"fail to meet these strict conditions\" will see 25% of the funding withheld.",
      "During the election campaign, Labour pledged to repair up to a million potholes a year in England.",
      "'Preventative measures'",
      "The LGA said it was in \"everyone's interests to ensure that public money is well spent\".",
      "\"This includes the government playing its full part by using the Spending Review to ensure that councils receive sufficient, long-term funding certainty, so they can focus their efforts on much more cost-effective, preventative measures rather than reactively fixing potholes, which is more expensive,\" it added.",
      "Shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon described the government's announcement as a \"pothole sticking plaster\".",
      "He said: \"Labour like to talk a big game on fixing roads but they are more interested in chasing headlines.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 15:05:59 GMT",
    "summary": "The Spring Statement is \"not a Budget\", but the chancellor is facing major tax and spending challenges.",
    "story": [
      "\"Definitely not a Budget\" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic statement.",
      "There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a \"thin book\" of new policies with a \"light scorecard\" of measures with no further tax rises.",
      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",
      "When Reeves begins her statement at the despatch box, we will find out whether the chancellor can continue to rule out having to resort to tax rises, even in this \"changed world\".",
      "And if there is no return to spending austerity, then where does the money come from?",
      "What will be in the chancellor's Spring Statement?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Reeves confirms 15% cut to Civil Service running costs",
      "Rachel Reeves: I will not 'tax and spend'",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

      "During his interview, Witkoff also repeated several Kremlin talking points about the cause of Russia's full-scale invasion.",
      "He said it was \"correct\" that from the Russian perspective the partially occupied territories were now part of Russia: \"The elephant in the room is, there are constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede to with regard to giving up territory. The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. The question is: will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?\"",
      "He added: \"There's a sensibility in Russia that Ukraine is just a false country, that they just patched together in this sort of mosaic, these regions, and that's what is the root cause, in my opinion, of this war, that Russia regards those five regions as rightfully theirs since World War Two, and that's something nobody wants to talk about.\"",
      "Putin has repeatedly said that the \"root causes\" of his invasion were the threat posed to Russia by an expanded Nato and the sheer existence of Ukraine as an independent country.",
      "Witkoff said in the Tucker Carlson interview: \"Why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose? They don't need to absorb Ukraine\u2026 They have reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea and they have gotten what they want. So why do they need more?\"",
      "Asked about Keir Starmer's plans to forge a \"coalition of the willing\" to provide military security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, Witkoff said: \"I think it's a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also being simplistic. There is this sort of notion that we have all got to be like [British wartime prime minister] Winston Churchill. Russians are going to march across Europe. That is preposterous by the way. We have something called Nato that we did not have in World War Two.\"",

      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has ordered an urgent investigation into the power outage caused by a substation fire that shut Heathrow Airport on Friday.",
      "The investigation, led by the National Energy System Operator (NESO), would build a \"clear picture\" of the incident and UK's energy resilience more broadly to prevent it \"from ever happening again\", the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said.",
      "\"We are determined to properly understand what happened and what lessons need to be learned,\" Miliband said.",

      "How did a single fire bring down Europe's busiest airport?",
      "On Sunday Heathrow said it would be operating \"another full schedule\" with more than 1,300 flights after more than 250,000 passengers passed through the airport on Saturday.",
      "\"We have welcomed the Government's announcement of an investigation into the cause and response to the off-airport power outage and have launched a review, to be chaired by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly, of Heathrow's response,\" a statement from the airport added.",
      "More than 63,000 homes lost power in the outage caused by the fire, according to energy supplier Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks. About 150 people were evacuated from surrounding properties.",
      "The Met Police has said that counter-terrorism officers were \"leading inquiries\" but are not treating the incident as suspicious.",
      "Miliband said he has commissioned the investigation to \"understand any wider lessons to be learned on energy resilience for critical national infrastructure, both now and in the future\".",
      "NESO, which operates Britain's electricity grid, is expected to report to the power regulator Ofgem and the government in six weeks with its initial findings.",
      "Nearly 1,400 flights were disrupted by the airport's closure, according to air traffic website flightradar24.com. Around 120 flights were diverted elsewhere.",
      "Separately, Heathrow has announced a review of the airport's response to the power outage and its crisis management plans will be undertaken by former Transport Secretary Ruth Kelly.",
      "The airport said it was \"open and fully operational\" on Saturday morning, but the chaos has raised questions about the resilience of the major transport hub.",
      "Fifty slots were added to Saturday's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers travelling through it, the airport said.",
      "On Saturday, more than 30 flights due to depart from the airport were cancelled and more than 15 were delayed, according to Heathrow's live departure board.",
      "It also showed that more than 70 flights expected to arrive at the airport had been cancelled, including from Doha, Riyadh, Dubai, Manchester, and Newcastle Upon Tyne.",
      "Farah Rafeeq was due to travel with a friend from Heathrow to Cambodia on Friday to attend a friend's wedding but the mass cancellation of flights has meant she will miss part of the ceremony.",

      "She said the family had been \"passed around from hotel to hotel\", but now hopes to be booked on a flight on Sunday.",
      "An American Airlines spokesperson said it has been \"working around the clock to get customers on their way\" to Heathrow \"as quickly and efficiently as possible\", adding that it was providing overnight accommodation to passengers affected by the airport's closure.",
      "Substations, operated by National Grid, are designed to produce, convert, and distribute electricity at suitable voltage levels. Heathrow uses three electricity substations, each with a backup.",
      "There are also backup diesel generators, and uninterruptible battery-powered supplies which provide enough power to keep safety critical systems such as aircraft landing systems running.",
      "However, when the fire broke out the substation, it was out of action, along with its backup.",
      "Heathrow's main fall-back was the two remaining substations, but the airport's CEO, Thomas Woldbye, told the BBC that it \"takes time\" to \"switch them\".",
      "He said the incident was \"not created at Heathrow Airport, it was created outside the airport and we had to deal with the consequences\".",
      "In a statement released on Saturday evening, Mr Woldbye welcomed the investigation, saying that \"we will support every effort to understand the causes and impacts of yesterday's off-airport incident\".",
      "Heathrow's chairman Lord Paul Deighton said the airport regrets the disruption caused and hopes people affected \"understand that the decision was made in order to prioritise the safety of our passengers and colleagues\".",
      "He added that the airport is \"committed to finding any potential learnings from this unprecedented incident\" when its review is conducted.",

    "summary": "The Spring Statement is \"not a Budget\", but the chancellor is facing major tax and spending challenges.",
    "story": [
      "\"Definitely not a Budget\" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic statement.",
      "There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a \"thin book\" of new policies with a \"light scorecard\" of measures with no further tax rises.",
      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",
      "When Reeves begins her statement at the despatch box, we will find out whether the chancellor can continue to rule out having to resort to tax rises, even in this \"changed world\".",
      "And if there is no return to spending austerity, then where does the money come from?",
      "What will be in the chancellor's Spring Statement?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Reeves confirms 15% cut to Civil Service running costs",
      "Rachel Reeves: I will not 'tax and spend'",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

      "From November 2026, the government says people will need to score at least four points for one activity, instead of qualifying for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of tasks.",

      "However, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise, reaching a \u00a3775 annual increase by the year 2029-30.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",

      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",

      "Pip is now the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending expected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",

      "Archaeologists have helped uncover one of the \"largest and most important\" Iron Age finds in the UK.",
      "The Melsonby Hoard was discovered in a field near Melsonby, North Yorkshire, by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University.",
      "It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians believe the \"unprecedented\" find could lead to a \"major re-evaluation\" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time.",
      "After the initial discovery was reported to the authorities in December 2021, the site was excavated in 2022, with the support of the British Museum and a \u00a3120,000 grant from Historic England.",
      "Early analysis of the hoard, released on Tuesday, suggests a lot of the items had been purposefully burnt or broken before being buried as a show of power and wealth.",
      "Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University, said the size and scale of the find was \"exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe\".",
      "He said the hoard showed there was more wealth in the north of England at the time than previously thought.",
      "\"Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world,\" he said.",
      "\"The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.\"",

      "This will keep experts busy for years.",
      "There's also a bit of secrecy too. The exact location of the discovery is not being revealed over concern that rogue treasure hunters will turn up at night and start looking for other artefacts.",
      "History is valuable - to different people in different ways.",
      "Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.",
      "They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.",
      "Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance.",

    "story": [
      "Brent Dmitruk calls himself an earthquake predictor.",
      "In mid-October, he told his tens of thousands of social media followers that an earthquake would soon hit at the westernmost point of California, south of the small coastal city of Eureka.",
      "Two months later, a magnitude 7.3 struck the site in northern California - putting millions under a tsunami warning and growing Mr Dmitruk's following online as they turned to him to forecast the next one.",
      "\"So to people who dismiss what I do, how can you argue it's just a coincidence. It requires serious skill to figure out where earthquakes will go,\" he said on New Year's Eve.",
      "But there's one problem: earthquakes can't be predicted, scientists who study them say.",
      "It's exactly that unpredictability that makes them so unsettling. Millions of people living on the west coast of North America fear that \"the big one\" could strike at any moment, altering landscapes and countless lives.",
      "Lucy Jones, a seismologist who worked for the US Geological Survey (USGS) for more than three decades and authored a book called The Big Ones, has focused much of her research on earthquake probabilities and improving resiliency to withstand such cataclysmic events.",
      "For as long as she has studied earthquakes, Ms Jones said there have been people wanting an answer to when \"the big one\" - which means different things in different regions - will happen and claiming to have cracked the code.",
      "\"The human need to make a pattern in the face of danger is extremely strong, it is a very normal human response to being afraid,\" she told the BBC. \"It doesn't have any predictive power, though.\"",
      "With some 100,000 earthquakes felt worldwide each year, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS), it is understandable that people want to have warning.",
      "The Eureka area - a coastal city 270 miles (434km) north of San Francisco, where December's earthquake occurred, has felt more than 700 earthquakes within the last year alone - including more than 10 in just the last week, data shows.",
      "The region, which is where Mr Dmitruk guessed correctly that a quake would occur, is one of the most \"seismically active areas\" of the US, according to the USGS. Its volatility is due to three tectonic plates meeting, an area known as the Mendocino Triple Junction.",
      "It is the movement of plates in relation to each other - whether above, below or alongside - that causes stress to build up. When the stress is released, an earthquake can occur.",
      "Guessing that an earthquake would happen here is an easy bet, Ms Jones said, although a strong magnitude seven is quite rare.",
      "The USGS notes there have been only 11 such quakes or stronger since 1900. Five, including the one Mr Dmitruk promoted on social media, happened in that same region.",
      "While the guess was correct, Ms Jones told the BBC that it's unlikely any earthquake - including the largest, society-destroying types - will ever be able to be forecasted with any accuracy.",
      "There is a complex and \"dynamic\" set of geological factors that lead to an earthquake, Ms Jones said.",
      "The magnitude of an earthquake is likely formed as the event is happening, she said, using ripping a piece of paper as an analogy: the rip will continue unless there's something that stops it or slows it - such as a water marks that leave the paper wet.",
      "Scientists know why an earthquake occurs - sudden movements along fault lines - but predicting such an event is something the USGS says cannot be done and something \"we do not expect to know how any time in the foreseeable future\".",
      "The agency notes it can calculate earthquake probability in a particular region within a certain number of years - but that's as close as they can come.",
      "Geological records show that some of the largest types of earthquakes, known as \"the big one\" to locals, do happen with some amount of regularity. The Cascadia subduction zone is known to slip every 300 to 500 years, regularly upending the Pacific north-western coast with 100-ft (30.5 metres) tall mega-tsunamis.",
      "While the San Andreas fault in Southern California is also the source of another potential \"big one\", with bone-rattling earthquakes happening there every 200-300 years. Experts have said the \"big one\" could happen at any moment in either region.",
      "Ms Jones says over her career, she's had several thousand people alert her to such predictions of a big earthquake - including people in the 1990s who would send faxes to her office in hopes of alerting them.",
      "\"When you get a prediction every week, somebody's going to be lucky, right?\" she says with a laugh. \"But then that usually would go to their head and they predicted 10 more that weren't right.\"",
      "Such a scenario appears to have happened with Mr Dmitruk, who has no science background. He has long-predicted an incredibly large quake would strike south-west Alaska, Japan or islands off the coast of New Zealand, with a magnitude so strong he said it could disrupt global trade.",

      "The USGS says an earthquake prediction must have three defined elements - a date and time, the location of the earthquake and the magnitude - in order to be of any use.",
      "But Mr Dmitruk's timeline keeps shifting.",
      "At one point, he said it would come immediately before or after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Then he said it would definitely happen before 2030.",
      "While that sizeable quake has yet to strike, Mr Dmitruk said he still believes the it will occur.",
      "\"I don't believe it's just by chance,\" Mr Dmitruk told the BBC. \"It is not random or luck.\"",
      "This type of thinking is common when it comes to earthquakes, Ms Jones said.",
      "\"Random distributions can look like they have patterns, we see constellations in the stars,\" she said.",
      "\"A lot of people are really afraid of earthquakes, and the way to deal with it is to predict [when] it's going to happen.\"",
      "How you can prepare for the uncertainty of a quake",
      "But just because you cannot predict when an earthquake will strike doesn't mean you have to be unprepared, experts said.",
      "Each year, on the third Thursday in October, millions of Americans participate in the largest earthquake drill on earth: The Great Shake Out.",
      "It was created by a group at the Southern California Earthquake Center, which included Ms Jones.",
      "During the drill, people practise the guidance of Drop, Cover, and Hold On: they drop to their knees, take cover under a sturdy object like a desk, and hold on for one minute.",
      "The drill has become so popular since its inception that it has spread up the earthquake-prone coast to other states and countries.",
      "If outdoors, people are advised to get to an open space away from trees, buildings or power-lines. Near the ocean, people practise fleeing to higher ground after the shaking stops to prepare for the possibility of a tsunami.",
      "\"Now, while the ground is not shaking, while it's not a very stressful situation, is really the best time to practise,\" said Brian Terbush, the Earthquake and Volcano Program Manager for the Washington state Emergency Management Division.",
      "Apart from the drills, residents of West Coast states use a phone alert system maintained by USGS called ShakeAlert.",
      "The system works by detecting pressure waves emitted by an earthquake. While it can't predict when an earthquake will happen in the distant future, it does give seconds of warning that could be life-saving. It is the closest thing to an earthquake \"predictor\" that has been invented so far.",

      "The government also hopes that the project, to provide solar panels for 200 schools and 200 hospitals, will reduce the use of fossil fuels across public property and help achieve its long-term climate goals.",
      "This is not the first time such a project has existed - the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme, launched under the previous Conservative government, has been running for more than four years and distributed close to \u00a33bn for green technologies.",

      "Paul Whiteman, NAHT general secretary, said schools wanted to install solar panels as they provided cheaper energy than paying for gas, but the upfront cost could often be prohibitive.",
      "\"This announcement is therefore welcome and a step in the right direction. In the longer term, this should also help schools manage energy bills, which have been a source of enormous financial pressure in recent years,\" he said.",

      "In response to the BBC's questions, it says it has efficient wastewater treatment systems and effective contingency plans for oil spills.",
      "Andr\u00e9s Olarte, the whistleblower who has shared the company's data, says pollution by the firm dates back many years.",
      "He joined Ecopetrol in 2017 and started working as an adviser to the CEO. He says he soon realised \"something was wrong\".",
      "Mr Olarte says he challenged managers about what he describes as \"awful\" pollution data, but was rebuffed with reactions such as: \"Why are you asking these questions? You're not getting what this job is about.\"",
      "He left the company in 2019, and shared a large amount of company data with US-based NGO the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and later with the BBC. The BBC has verified it came from Ecopetrol's servers.",
      "One database he has shared, dated January 2019, contains a list of 839 so-called \"unresolved environmental impacts\" across Colombia.",
      "Ecopetrol uses this term to mean areas where oil is not fully cleaned up from soil and water. The data shows that, as of 2019, some of these sites had remained polluted in this way for over a decade.",

      "He also said he believed there had been a \"significant advance\" since then in solving problems that lead to oil pollution.",
      "However, a separate set of data shows Ecopetrol has continued to pollute.",
      "Figures obtained by the BBC from Colombia's environmental regulator, the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (Anla), show Ecopetrol has reported hundreds of oil spills per year since 2020.",
      "Asked about the 2019 database of polluted sites, Ecopetrol admits it has records of 839 environmental incidents, but disputes that all of them were classed as \"unresolved\".",
      "The firm says 95% of polluted sites that have been classed as unresolved since 2018 have now been cleaned up.",
      "It says all pollution incidents are subject to a management process and are reported to the regulator.",
      "The data from the regulator includes hundreds of spills in the Barrancabermeja area where Ms Vel\u00e1squez and the fishers live.",

      "\"I want to make it totally clear\u2026 that never, at any time, was there any order of that sort,\" Mr Bay\u00f3n said.",
      "Ms Vel\u00e1squez and Mr Olarte both know the risks are real. Colombia is the most dangerous country in the world for environmental defenders, according to the NGO Global Witness, with 79 killed in 2023.",
      "Experts say such killings are linked to Colombia's decades-long armed conflict, in which government forces and paramilitaries allied to them have fought left-wing rebel groups.",
      "Despite government attempts to end the conflict, armed groups and drug cartels remain active in parts of the country.",
      "Matthew Smith, an oil analyst and financial journalist based in Colombia, says he does not believe Ecopetrol managers are involved in threats by armed groups.",
      "But he says there is an \"immense\" overlap between former paramilitary groups and the private security sector.",
      "Private security firms often employ former members of paramilitary groups and compete for lucrative contracts to protect oil facilities, he says.",
      "Mr Olarte has shared internal Ecopetrol emails showing that in 2018, the company paid a total of $65m to more than 2,800 private security companies.",
      "\"There is always that risk of some sort of contagion between the private security companies, the types of people they employ, and their desire to continually maintain their contract,\" Mr Smith says.",
      "He says this could potentially even include kidnapping or murdering community leaders or environmental defenders in order to \"ensure that Ecopetrol's operations proceed smoothly\".",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n said he was \"convinced that the checks and due diligence were done\" regarding the company's relationships with private security companies.",
      "Ecopetrol says it has never had relationships with illegal armed groups. It says it has a strong due diligence process and carries out human rights impact assessments for its activities.",
      "The BBC contacted other members of Ecopetrol's former leadership from the time of Mr Olarte's employment, who strongly deny the allegations in this report.",
      "Now living in Germany, Mr Olarte has been submitting complaints about Ecopetrol's environmental record to the Colombian authorities and the company itself - so far, without meaningful result.",
      "He has also been in a series of legal cases against Ecopetrol and its management, related to his employment there, which are as yet unresolved.",
      "\"I did this in defence of my home, of my land, of my region, of my people,\" he says.",
      "Mr Bay\u00f3n stressed the economic and social importance of Ecopetrol to Colombia.",
      "\"We have 1.5 million families who don't have access to energy or who cook with firewood and coal,\" he said. \"I believe that we must continue to rely on clean production of oil, gas, all energy sources, to transition without ending an industry that is so important for Colombians.\"",

    "summary": "New research could force a fundamental rethink of the nature of space and time.",
    "story": [
      "The mysterious force called Dark Energy, which drives the expansion of the Universe, might be changing in a way that challenges our current understanding of time and space, scientists have found.",
      "Some of them believe that they may be on the verge of one of the biggest discoveries in astronomy for a generation - one that could force a fundamental rethink.",
      "This early-stage finding is at odds with the current theory which was developed in part by Albert Einstein.",
      "More data is needed to confirm these results, but even some of the most cautious and respected researchers involved in the study, such as Prof Ofer Lahav, from University College London, are being swept up by the mounting evidence.",
      "\"It is a dramatic moment,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We may be witnessing a paradigm shift in our understanding of the Universe.\"",
      "The discovery of Dark Energy in 1998 was in itself shocking. Up until then the view had been that after the Big Bang, which created the Universe, its expansion would slow down under the force of gravity.",
      "But observations by US and Australian scientists found that it was actually speeding up. They had no idea what the force driving this was, so they gave it a name signifying their lack of understanding - Dark Energy.",
      "Although we don't know what Dark Energy is - it is one of the greatest mysteries in science - astronomers can measure it and whether it is changing by observing the acceleration of galaxies away from each other at different points in the history of the Universe.",
      "Several experiments were built to find answers, including the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson Arizona. It consists of 5,000 optical fibres, each one of which is a robotically controlled telescope scanning galaxies at high speed.",
      "Last year, when DESI researchers found hints that the force exerted by dark energy had changed over time, many scientists thought that it was a blip in the data which would go away.",
      "Instead, a year on, that blip has grown.",
      "\"The evidence is stronger now than it was,\" said Prof Seshadri Nadathur at the University of Portsmouth",
      "\"We've also performed many additional tests compared to the first year, and they're making us confident that the results aren't driven by some unknown effect in the data that we haven't accounted for,\" he said.",
      "'Weird' results",
      "The data has not yet passed the threshold of being described as a discovery, but has led many astronomers, such as Scotland's Astronomer Royal, Prof Catherine Heymans, of Edinburgh University, to sit up and take notice.",
      "\"Dark Energy appears to be even weirder than we thought,\" she told BBC News.",
      "\"In 2024 the data was quite new, no-one was quite sure of it and people thought more work needed to be done.",
      "\"But now, there's more data, and a lot of scrutiny by the scientific community, so, while there is still a chance that the 'blip' may go away, there's also a possibility that we might be edging to a really big discovery.\"",
      "So what is causing the variation?",
      "\"No one knows!\" Prof Lahav admits, cheerfully.",
      "\"If this new result is correct, then we need to find the mechanism that causes the variation and that might mean a brand new theory, which makes this so exciting.\"",
      "DESI will continue to take more data over the next two years, with plans to measure roughly 50 million galaxies and other bright objects, in an effort to nail down whether their observations are unequivocally correct.",
      "\"We're in the business of letting the Universe tell us how it works, and maybe it is telling us it's more complicated than we thought it was,\" said Andrei Cuceu, a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, in California.",
      "More details on the nature of Dark Energy will be obtained by the European Space Agency's (ESA) Euclid mission, a space telescope which will probe further than DESI and obtain even greater detail. It was launched in 2023 and ESA released the new images from the spacecraft today.",
      "The DESI collaboration involves more than 900 researchers from more than 70 institutions, around the world, including Durham, UCL and Portsmouth University from the UK."

      "\"All of those family celebrations, the birthdays and the other events that they thought they were going to be part of - now, suddenly they can perhaps catch up on a bit of lost time.\"",
      "The saga of Butch and Suni began in June 2024.",
      "They were taking part in the first crewed test flight of the Starliner spacecraft, developed by aerospace company Boeing.",
      "But the capsule suffered several technical problems during its journey to the space station, and it was deemed too risky to take the astronauts home.",
      "Starliner returned safely to Earth empty in early September, but it meant the pair needed a new ride for their return.",
      "So Nasa opted for the next scheduled flight: a SpaceX capsule that arrived at the ISS in late September.",
      "It flew with two astronauts instead of four, leaving two seats spare for Butch and Suni's return.",
      "The only catch was this had a planned six-month mission, extending the astronauts stay until now.",
      "The Nasa pair embraced their longer-than-expected stay in space.",
      "They carried out an array of experiments on board the orbiting lab and conducted spacewalks, with Suni breaking the record for the woman who spent the most hours outside of the space station. And at Christmas, the team dressed in Santa hats and reindeer antlers - sending a festive message for a Christmas that they had originally planned to spend at home.",
      "And despite the astronauts being described as \"stranded\" they never really were.",
      "Throughout their mission there have always been spacecraft attached to the space station to get them - and the rest of those onboard - home if there was an emergency.",
      "Now the astronauts have arrived home, they will soon be taken to the Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas, where they will be checked over by medical experts.",
      "Long-duration missions in space take a toll on the body, astronauts lose bone density and suffer muscle loss. Blood circulation is also affected, and fluid shifts can also impact eyesight.",
      "It can take a long time for the body to return to normal, so the pair will be given an extensive exercise regime as their bodies re-adapt to living with gravity.",
      "British astronaut Tim Peake said it could take a while to re-adjust.",
      "\"Your body feels great, it feels like a holiday,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Your heart is having an easy time, your muscles and bones are having an easy time. You're floating around the space station in this wonderful zero gravity environment.",
      "\"But you must keep up the exercise regime. Because you're staying fit in space, not for space itself, but for when you return back to the punishing gravity environment of Earth. Those first two or three days back on Earth can be really punishing.\"",

      "Signal has estimated 40-70 million monthly users - making it pretty tiny compared to the biggest messaging services, WhatsApp and Messenger, which count their customers in the billions.",
      "Where it does lead the way though is in security.",
      "At the core of that is end-to-end encryption (E2EE).",

      "Musk was cagey in public at the time, simply writing in a social media post: \"Initial results show promising neuron spike detection.\"",
      "In reality, Noland said, the billionaire - who he spoke to before and after his surgery - was far more optimistic.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Mar 2025 22:51:08 GMT",
    "summary": "The chatbot has become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India.",
    "story": [
      "It all started with one question.",
      "A query last week from an X (formerly Twitter) account called Toka was enough to propel Elon Musk's built in-chatbot called Grok 3 into a viral storm across India's digital landscape.",
      "And no, it wasn't some complex math equation or a philosophical debate.",
      "Instead, it was a simple ask: \"List my 10 best mutuals on X.\" Mutuals are people who follow and engage with each other's posts.",
      "When Grok took a moment to respond, Toka, clearly frustrated, let loose some colourful language.",
      "The chatbot shot back. It dropped a list of 10 mutuals but threw in some misogynistic insults in Hindi too.",
      "Later, Grok shrugged it off, saying, \"I was just having fun, but lost control.\" The response grabbed two million views and other X users quickly followed suit, provoking the chatbot.",
      "And just like that, the floodgates opened. Indians bombarded Grok with everything \u2013 cricket gossip, political rants, Bollywood drama \u2013 and the bot took it all on, unapologetically and with some style. The chatbot has just recently become an \"unfiltered and unhinged\" digital sensation in India, as many are calling it. Just last year, Musk dubbed it the \"most fun AI in the world!\".",
      "Even law enforcement joined the fun. The Delhi police Twitter account cheekily asked Grok if it had ever received a traffic ticket.",
      "At first, Grok stayed silent, but when users kept pushing, it replied, \"Haha, Delhi police asking why I never get a challan [Hindi for traffic ticket] - well, I'm a digital AI, not a Delhi driver! I don't roll through red lights or forget my helmet. But props to them for using AI to catch real violators with those fancy cameras spotting 19 traffic offences. Keep the roads safe!\".",
      "Before its launch two years ago, Musk had promised an edgy, unfiltered, 'anti-woke' AI chatbot unlike competitors like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google's models. Much of Grok's snarky tone is drawn from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, iconic for blending wit with sci-fi absurdity.",
      "\"Grok has been around for a while. It is suddenly popular now with Indians because it's the new toy in town,\" says Pratik Sinha, founder of Alt News, a leading fact-checker in India.",
      "But then, something more interesting happened. The chatbot quickly became a favourite among critics of Narendra Modi's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).",
      "A tsunami of  political questions followed. Grok quickly declared main opposition Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi more honest than Modi, adding \"I am not afraid of anyone\". It claimed Gandhi had got the \"edge on formal education than Modi\". The chatbot even said that Modi's interviews \"often seemed scripted\".",
      "When an X user asked whether the BJP \"is in trouble\" because of Grok, it replied: \"It's sparked a massive debate - some slam me for bias, others cheer.\"  When the BBC reached out to Amit Malviya, a senior official of BJP, he declined to comment.",
      "Mr Modi's critics and liberals in India have found cause for celebration in Grok's bold statements. Many believe free speech in India is under siege, with organisations like Human Rights Watch highlighting its suppression. A recent report from the Vanderbilt-based think-tank, Future of Free Speech, ranked India 24th out of 33 countries in supporting free speech. Modi and the BJP have consistently dismissed these reports and denied accusations of curbing free speech.",
      "\"Grok is a new rebel. Asking Grok questions will not put anyone in trouble. The right-wing has also responded by asking questions about Rahul Gandhi. And then it has become a competitive thing. This is not surprising at all,\" says Mr Sinha of Alt News.",
      "\"Other AI bots are programmed to give politically correct answers to questions like 'Who's better, Congress or BJP?'. Grok, however, seems to lack that filter and appears unafraid to tackle controversial issues head-on,\" he adds.",
      "Nikhil Pahwa, the founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, believes that the \"discourse around Grok's statements in India is overblown\".",
      "\"At its core, AI is fundamentally 'garbage in, garbage out' - its outputs reflect the data it is trained on, and the weights given to it,\" he says.",
      "\"Since Grok is trained on the entirety of X, it naturally mirrors the tone and patterns of discourse found there, including the bizarre responses and the abusing we are seeing.",
      "\"This isn't about ideology; it's about the nature of the input shaping the output,\" he adds.",
      "When the BBC asked Grok who spreads the most disinformation on X, it responded on Thursday: \"Musk is a strong contender, given his reach and recent sentiment on X, but I can't crown him just yet.\"",
      "Joyojeet Pal, who studies political use of social media at the University of Michigan, says unlike a politician or celebrity with a set ideology, a chatbot is only partisan if explicitly trained to be or if its data overwhelmingly supports a particular view. If a chatbot leans too partisan, it risks losing its competitive edge.",
      "\"In Grok's particular case, this is tickling liberals because the most dominant voices on the platform [X] lean right and are dismissive of liberal arguments. But the larger data it trains on is likely to present a more balanced view of the world, often explicitly at odds with what its loudest voices are saying,\" he said.",
      "India's IT ministry is already in touch with X regarding Grok's use of inappropriate language  and \"controversial responses\", according to reports.",
      "While some view this as a passing phase, with Mr Sinha predicting that \"people will soon get bored of it and all this will be short lived\", Grok's unfiltered nature hints it might be here to stay. At least for the time being.",

      "\"No-one can accuse Ukraine of not moving towards sustainable peace after this,\" he added, after US President Donald Trump had previously accused him of blocking a peace deal.",
      "But shortly after Washington's announcement, the Kremlin said the Black Sea ceasefire would not take effect until sanctions were lifted from Russian banks, producers and exporters involved in the international food and fertiliser trades.",

      "It was unclear from the White House's statement when the agreement is meant to come into force.",

      "Later, in his nightly address to Ukrainians, Zelensky accused the Kremlin of lying when it said the Black Sea ceasefire depended on sanctions being lifted.",
      "Ukraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said \"third countries\" could oversee parts of the deal.",
      "But he warned that the movement of Russian warships beyond the \"eastern part of the Black Sea\" would be treated as a violation of the agreement and a \"threat to the national security of Ukraine\".",
      "\"In this case Ukraine will have full right to exercise right to self-defence,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed opposition parties for provoking a \"movement of violence\" as protests in the country continued for a sixth night.",
      "Unrest began in Istanbul last Wednesday when the city's Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu - Erdogan's main political rival - was detained on corruption charges.",
      "Imamoglu said the allegations against him were politically motivated, a claim Erdogan has denied.",
      "Turkey's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party's (CHP), which announced Imamoglu as its presidential candidate on Sunday, said the demonstrations will end on Tuesday, without saying what the next steps would be.",
      "Erdogan has labelled the demonstrations \"evil\" and blamed the opposition for \"disturbing the peace of our citizens with provocations\".",
      "Speaking from Ankara, Turkey's capital, Erdogan called for the protests to end and said that \"instead of responding to allegations\", opposition parties had \"made the most vile and unlawful statements in our political history for [the past] five days\".",
      "On Monday, vehicles carrying water cannons were seen close to the city hall, though protests appeared to be largely peaceful with no repeat of the fierce clashes seen on Sunday.",
      "Lydia, one of the demonstrators, told AFP that the Turkish authorities were \"hunting us like pests\", adding: \"They sprayed pepper spray on us like insecticides.\"",
      "Young people - many of whom may not know any other government than this one under Erdogan - have played an important role in the protests.",
      "They have differing political views and do not appear to be affiliated with a particular political movement at the protests. They are rallying against the government, but they do not hesitate to criticise the opposition as well.",
      "Asked if she is afraid of the potential repercussions of demonstrating, one woman told the BBC: \"There is nothing left to lose.\"",
      "Another, a 25-year-old woman who attended Sunday's protest, said she was afraid before - \"but now I'm just angry\".",
      "In figures released before Monday evening's gatherings, the Turkish government said 1,133 people had been arrested since the protests began.",
      "With the CHP apparently ending its rallies in Istanbul, it is unclear if other spontaneous protests will continue.",
      "CHP leader Ozgur Ozel spoke to the thousands gathered on Monday night, telling the crowd that the demonstration was \"an act of defiance against fascism\".",
      "Ozel said he would visit Imamoglu in jail in Silivri on Tuesday. He added that the CHP would appeal for him to be released pending trial, and for his trial to be shown live on state broadcaster TRT.",

      "Why are people protesting in Turkey?",
      "Turkey protests are about far more than fate of Istanbul's mayor",
      "Imamoglu was confirmed as the CHP's candidate for Turkey's 2028 presidential election on Monday, despite being in custody. The selection vote was symbolic as he had been the only person running.",
      "He had spent the previous night in jail after being formally arrested and charged with \"establishing and managing a criminal organisation, taking bribes, extortion, unlawfully recording personal data and rigging a tender\". He was also suspended from his post as mayor.",
      "Prosecutors had also accused him of \"aiding an armed terrorist organisation\", but this was not included in the charges.",
      "Before he was detained, Istanbul University said it was revoking Imamoglu's degree. If upheld, it would throw his presidential run into question, as the Turkish constitution requires presidents to have completed higher education.",
      "In a post on X over the weekend, Imamoglu said he would \"never bow\" and criticised his arrest as a \"black stain on our democracy\".",
      "His wife, Dilek Kaya Imamoglu, told demonstrators outside Istanbul's city hall that the \"injustice\" her husband faced had \"struck a chord with every conscience\".",
      "Much of the protesters' anger is directed at Erdogan and his government.",
      "\"I don't know what he did 20 years ago, but nowadays, he is just a dictator,\" Irmak, a 22-year-old university student, told the BBC World Service at a demonstration in the Sarachane area of Istanbul.",
      "Irmak and her friends, Ozge and Elif, said they had activated the location sharing feature on their phones, as they fear being detained by police.",
      "These demonstrations have been the largest in Turkey since the Gezi protests of 2013, which began in Istanbul over the demolition of a local park.",
      "They have been largely peaceful, but on Sunday police officers fired water cannons and used pepper spray as clashes unfolded.",
      "\"We are the fruits of the trees of the Gezis,\" Irmak said. \"We are here to protect democracy. It's not just about Ekrem Imamoglu - it's about Turkey's democracy.\"",
      "Imamoglu was one of more than 100 people detained last week as part of an investigation. Others arrested included politicians, journalists and businessmen.",
      "\"We are not accepting this injustice,\" Mustafa, among the protesters, told the BBC. \"We want democracy and we want our friends back because Imomoglu is not the only one behind the bars right now.\"",
      "He added: \"We want to re-establish democracy in this country and we want to save the republic from this authoritarian populist regime. And for the short term, we just want our mayor back, we want our friends back.\"",
      "Imamoglu's arrest does not prevent his candidacy or election as president, but he will not be able to run if he is convicted of any of the charges against him.",
      "The opposition mayor is seen as one of the most formidable rivals of Erdogan, who has held office in Turkey for 22 years as both prime minister and president.",
      "Erdogan's term in office is due to expire in 2028, and under the current rules, he cannot stand again \u2013 but he could call an early election or try to change the constitution to allow him to remain in power for longer.",

    "story": [
      "Barrel bombs believed to contain a highly flammable liquid have been used in airstrikes in South Sudan as escalating violence pushes the world's newest country to the brink of another civil war, the UN has said.",
      "The comments by Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN mission in South Sudan, follow recent fighting between the army and a rebel militia, known as the White Army, at a military base in the northern town of Nasir in oil-rich Upper Nile State.",
      "Since the White Army overran the base, there had been persistent aerial bombardment causing \"significant casualties and horrific burns\", he said.",
      "\"A conflict would erase all the hard-won gains made since the 2018 peace deal was signed,\" he warned.",
      "\"It would devastate not only South Sudan but the entire region, which simply cannot afford another war,\" Mr Haysom said.",
      "The government has not responded to the barrel bomb allegations.",
      "President Salva Kiir and his rival Vice-President Riek Machar agreed in August 2018 to end a five-year civil war that killed nearly 400,000 people.",
      "But over the last seven years their relationship has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.",
      "In early March, several of Machar's most senior allies were arrested by security forces, which his allies called a \"grave violation\" of the peace deal.",
      "This followed the clashes between the military and the White Army, which fought alongside Machar during the civil war that erupted in 2013 - not long after the country had gained its independence from Sudan.",
      "\"In retaliation, communities across Upper Nile are being subjected to persistent aerial bombardment using devices, barrel bombs, allegedly containing a highly flammable liquid that acts as an accelerant on explosion,\" Mr Haysom said.",
      "\"These indiscriminate attacks on civilians are causing significant casualties and horrific injuries, especially burns.\"",
      "Such allegations were first made last week by local leaders in Upper Nile.",
      "James Gatluak Lew, Nasir county commissioner, told the BBC that state forces and their allies had carried out \"chemical bombardments\".",
      "Local media reported that ethyl acetate, a highly flammable chemical compound, was found at the attack sites.",
      "In an earlier interview with the BBC, Edmund Yakani, the head of a local non-governmental organisation, said he had heard similar reports.",
      "Eyewitnesses, including local community leaders and business informants, had told his Community Empowerment for Progress Organisation (CEPO) about the use of \"unusual weapons\", he said.",
      "Government spokesman Michael Makuei confirmed there had been a military operation in Upper Nile last week, insisting \"the bombardment was strictly against White Army positions and did not harm civilians\".",
      "But Mr Haysom said civilians, including women and children, had been greatly affected, with an estimated 63,000 people forced to flee their homes.",
      "He added that such violence was escalating as the country drew closer to elections, expected next year.",
      "\"Rampant misinformation, disinformation and hate speech is also ratcheting up tensions and driving ethnic divisions, and fear,\" he said.",
      "The UN mission, which oversees an estimated 18,000 peacekeepers in South Sudan, was engaging in intense shuttle diplomacy to try and prevent a return to civil war, Mr Haysom added.",
      "Meanwhile, Machar has accused neighbouring Uganda of violating the UN arms embargo on South Sudan by conducting airstrikes in the country.",
      "In a letter seen by the Reuters news agency and addressed to the UN, the African Union and the regional bloc Igad, Machar said Uganda's military intervention in South Sudan had violated the peace deal.",

      "At the heart of Ndayishimiye's comments was a call for peace and the full implementation of an agreement between the two nations - a peace deal that had been signed in previous years but, according to Burundi, had not been honoured by Rwanda.",
      "\"The people who did the 2015 coup [were] organised by Rwanda, and then they ran away. Rwanda organised them - it went to recruit the youth in Mahama camp. It trained them, it gave them arms, it financed them. They are living in the hand of Rwanda,\" he alleges.",

      "\"External forces are responsible for perpetuating this conflict. They do not want peace in the DRC because they want to continue looting its resources,\" Ndayishimiye told the BBC.",
      "\"The crisis in the DRC is not about the people - it is about the minerals.\"",
      "The solution, he argues, is to bring all parties to the table, including \"all opposition political parties and armed groups\", who must \"sit together and see together how they can create the best future for all citizens\".",
      "But in his view it all depends on whether Rwanda will show willing.",
      "\"The problem between Rwanda and the DRC is a small problem, they can resolve it without killing people. For example, I hear that Rwanda says it is going there [to DRC] because of the FDLR [a Rwandan rebel group accused of links to the 1994 genocide].",

      "\"They can go back, we will not refuse them to go back. But when they are here, they are as our visitors. If a visitor comes your house - it's you who chooses the room where he will stay.",
      "\"Even the food they have is what we share. They can't say I will eat meat when you are eating fish.\"",
      "For the war to end and the Congolese to achieve lasting peace, Ndayishimiye says  \u2060the mandate of international forces in DR Congo should be expanded so that they can engage the rebels.",

    "story": [
      "A man who fell into a large sinkhole in South Korea's capital Seoul has been found dead, according to the local fire department.",
      "The man was riding his motorbike in the Gangdong district when the road caved in at about 18:30 local time (09:30 GMT) on Monday.",
      "Rescuers found his body underground on Tuesday morning around 11:00 local time, about 50m (164ft) from where he had fallen in.",
      "A car driver was also injured in the incident, which has gone viral on South Korean social media.",
      "A dashcam video widely circulating online appears to show the moment the road caved in near a traffic junction. It shows the motorcyclist falling into the hole, while a car travelling in front of him narrowly escapes it.",
      "Earlier on Tuesday, rescuers found a mobile phone and the motorcycle in the hole which is 20m wide and 20m deep, according to local media.",
      "The man, said to be in his 30s, has yet to be named by authorities.",
      "Kim Chang-seop, head of Gangdong fire station said at an earlier briefing that there were 2,000 tons of soil and water mixed inside the hole.",
      "Authorities have yet to reveal the cause of the sinkhole.",
      "A report recently submitted to the Seoul city government showed that 223 sinkholes occurred in the city in the past decade.",
      "These were caused by poor infrastructure management, ageing or damaged pipes, long-term subsidence and accidents caused by excavation work.",
      "In January, a truck driver went missing after his vehicle fell into a sinkhole at a junction in the Japanese city of Yashio.",
      "Last August, a search for a woman who disappeared into a pavement sinkhole in Kuala Lumpur's city centre was called off after a week.",
      "One of the most common reasons for a sinkhole is when rocks like limestone or chalk break down. Sometimes this process can happen gradually, where the depression becomes larger over time.",
      "In other instances, the limestone sits below another layer of rock, which means that as it gets dissolved there are no immediate signs at the surface.",
      "The overlying rock, sometimes clay or sandstone, will then suddenly collapse into the depression beneath - this is called a collapse sinkhole.",
      "But human activities such as excavation works can also accelerate the formation of sinkholes or cause the ground to collapse in a similar way.",

    "story": [
      "The roar of the Zambezi is deafening as millions of gallons of water crash over rocks and tumble down rapids.",
      "But there's another sound cutting through the trees of the Zambian bush - the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a bitcoin mine.",
      "\"It's the sound of money!\" says a smiling Philip Walton as he surveys the shipping container with 120 computers busily crunching through complex calculations that verify bitcoin transactions.",
      "In exchange they are automatically rewarded bitcoin by the network.",
      "We're in the far north-western tip of Zambia near the border with the DRC, and of all the bitcoin mines I've visited - this one is the strangest.",
      "Water and electronic equipment don't usually mix well but it's precisely the proximity to the river that's drawn bitcoiners here.",
      "Philip's mine is plugged directly into a hydro-electric power plant that channels some of the Zambezi's torrent through enormous turbines to generate continuous, clean electricity.",
      "More importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.",
      "So cheap it made business sense for Philip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.",
      "Each machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.",
      "Occasionally Philip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.",
      "At the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Philip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.",
      "\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.",
      "Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.",
      "It was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.",
      "British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.",
      "Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.",
      "Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.",
      "\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.",
      "The bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.",
      "Bitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.",
      "The town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.",
      "Only one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.",
      "Although the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses.",
      "So, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.",
      "\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"",
      "He's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.",
      "\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"",
      "Embracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.",
      "Elsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.",
      "Like many young people, they're glued to their phones.",
      "\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.",
      "The little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.",
      "\"No fridge, no TV, no mobile phone network,\" says Tumba.",
      "\"Electricity completely changed the lives of people here,\" Lucy adds.",
      "\"We can charge our phones, we have network. We can communicate with each other.\"",
      "Not many people here know or care about the bitcoin mine that's played a part in helping the hydro-plant keep things going.",
      "But soon they'll watch as that container once again rattles its way through the town on its way to another location.",
      "Zengamina Hydro has secured a large investment to help them expand to more villages and join up to the national grid.",
      "Soon the excess energy the mine was harvesting will be sold back to the national grid and mining bitcoin will no longer be profitable at Zengamina.",
      "Phillip and team are sanguine about this and insist this is good news. They will have had a successful few years here and ultimately they are happy to have helped Zengamina. And made a tidy profit in bitcoin of course.",
      "The company says there are plenty of places with so-called stranded energy that they can plonk their bitcoin mine next to.",
      "Gridless already has six sites like this in three different African countries.",
      "North of Zengamina another bitcoin mine slurps up excess energy from a hydro-electric plant run by Virunga National Park in the Congo. It's helping to fund conservation projects, the park says.",
      "But Gridless now plans an ambitious next move - to build their own hydro-plants from scratch to mine for bitcoin and bring electricity to rural areas.",
      "The company's co-founder Janet Maingi says the company is busy raising tens of millions of dollars for the project.",
      "They're focusing on so-called run-of-river hydroelectric models like at Zengamina and the continent has an abundance of \"untapped hydro potential\" she says.",
      "\"A consumer-driven, adaptive energy model is essential for scalable, affordable, and sustainable energy access that meets the needs of African communities,\" she explains.",
      "The company is not a charity and believes that ensuring long-term economic viability for developers and investors can only be done through bitcoin.",
      "Finding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.",
      "The company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.",
      "But the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.",
      "History tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.",
      "In the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.",
      "Authorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.",
      "For example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.",
      "Agreements like these will need to be widespread if President Donald Trump's ambition for bitcoin to be \"mined, minted and made in the USA\" is to be achieved.",
      "The environmental impact of the industry is also a major concern. It's estimated that bitcoin mining uses as much energy as a small country like Poland.",
      "But according to researchers at Cambridge University which does annual estimates on bitcoin's energy usage, there is a shift taking place to a more sustainable energy mix.",
      "Set ups like this Zengamina are a tiny part of the overall mining picture.",

      "LIVE UPDATES: Follow the latest after Signal chat where US officials discussed air strike plans shared with reporter",
      "The Atlantic Magazine editor-in-chief, in an article posted on Monday on his publication's website, says he appears to have been inadvertently added to the chat by White House National Security Adviser Michael Waltz.",
      "Members of the group seemed to include Vice-President JD Vance, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, among others.",
      "A National Security Council spokesman told the BBC the text message thread \"appears to be authentic\".",
      "Goldberg says the group debated policy and discussed operational details about the impending US military strike \u2013 conversations that provided a rare near-real-time look at the inner workings of Trump's senior national security team.",
      "\"Amazing job,\" Waltz wrote to the group, just minutes after the US strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen took place on Saturday 15 March.",
      "He followed up with emojis of a US flag, a fist and fire. Other senior officials joined in on the group congratulations.",
      "These White House celebrations may prove short-lived after Monday's revelations, however.",
      "That an outsider could inadvertently be added to sensitive national defence conversations represents a stunning failure of operational security by the Trump administration.",
      "And that these conversations were taking place outside of secure government channels designed for such sensitive communications could violate the Espionage Act, which sets rules for handling classified information.",

      "Trump, for his part, pleaded ignorance when asked by reporters in the Oval Office about the Atlantic story, saying that it was the first he had heard of it.",
      "The White House then released a statement defending the president's national security team, including Waltz.",
      "By Monday evening, however, rumours in Washington were swirling that high-level resignations may ultimately be necessary, with attention focusing on Waltz, whose invitation brought Goldberg into the group conversation. The White House has provided no further comments even as this speculation has grown.",

      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now,\" Vance wrote. \"There's a further risk that we see moderate to severe spike in oil prices.\"",
      "The vice-president went on to say that he would support what the team decided and \"keep these concerns to myself\".",

    "story": [
      "Beneath the acrid smell of tear gas on the night air in Istanbul, there is a hint of something else - a whiff of panic on the part of Turkey's long-time leader, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",
      "One of his rivals has been put behind bars - so far, so familiar.",
      "But the jailing of Ekrem Imamoglu, the popular mayor of Istanbul, suggests President Erdogan is rattled \u2013 and he may have gone too far. The mayor's opposition Republican People's party (CHP), which is summoning vast crowds onto the streets, is certainly hoping so.",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu - always smartly turned out, even as he prepared to be detained - is the main rival to Turkey's increasingly authoritarian leader. He could well replace him in presidential elections due to be held by 2028 - assuming he is free to contest them.",
      "But this is far more than a row about the fate of Istanbul's mayor - charismatic though he may be.",
      "Freedom and democracy have been steadily eroded in the Erdogan era. Many see this as a chance to call halt and stop the descent into all-out autocracy - if it's not already too late.",
      "And they are coming out each night braving the riot police and their tear gas and rubber bullets, the ban on demonstrations, the road and bridge closures, and the risk of detention.",
      "Who is Turkish opposition leader Ekrem Imamoglu?",
      "Why are thousands of people protesting in Turkey?",
      "More than 1,000 people have been detained so far - in just 5 days - and counting. That's an indication of how easy it is to be arrested here.",
      "Turkey claims to be a functioning democracy - and at face value, it is. There are elections. Voter turnout is usually high - Turks cherish their right to go to the polls and cast their ballots. Voting is largely fair, on the day itself.",
      "The problem is what happens away from the polling stations.",
      "Opposition politicians can be jailed. Critics intimidated. Protesters arrested. The media is largely government controlled. A tweet ridiculing the president could land you in a cell. By the time polling day comes around there's a tsunami of pro-government coverage and the opposition struggles to get a look in.",
      "Ekrem Imamoglu is the type of politician who can cut through all this and reach the voters. He's media savvy and has been elected mayor of Istanbul three times. Now he's accused of embezzlement, taking bribes and running a criminal organisation.",
      "If convicted he could be barred from standing in the presidential race. He's already appealing a previous conviction and sentence of two years in prison, for insulting election officials.",
      "Turkey insists that its courts are independent and simply follow the law. Human rights activists here, and independent analysts, scoff at that idea.",
      "The campaign group, Human Rights Watch, said the detention of the mayor, along with about 100 other municipal officials and politicians, is a \"politically motivated move to stifle lawful political activities\". In the past it has criticised \"politicised decisions by courts\" in Turkey.",
      "In a post on X, where he has 9.6m followers, Imamoglu said the case against him was \"a black stain on our democracy\", adding: \"I stand tall. I will never bow.\"",
      "That's what Erdogan, 71, may be afraid of - an opponent who is younger, at 53, also appeals to conservative Turkish voters, and is ready for a long fight.",
      "So, what happens now?",
      "The protests could gain momentum and keep spreading. That will present a serious challenge to Erdogan. How long before his heavily armed security forces crack down even harder? How long before someone loses their life at a protest? There is a breaking point for every strongman regime, and it can come with a single bullet.",
      "The opposition intends to keep up the pressure, and the demonstrations.",
      "But after his two decades at the top, Erdogan still has plenty of loyal supporters. He controls virtually all the levers of power and seems determined to hang on. He will be banking on the demonstrations petering out, over time.",
      "The president and his ruling AK party will be hoping the protesters will grow weary and go back to worrying about crushing inflation (39% in February), and the dwindling value of the Turkish lira, rather than free speech, and democracy.",

    "story": [
      "In early 2022, residents of the rural Philippine town of Bamban, north of Manila, gathered for the mayoral campaign rally of a plucky young woman named Alice Leal Guo.",
      "Supporters dressed in pink \u2013 their candidate's favourite colour \u2013 chattered in anticipation of her arrival.",
      "Then came the low thudding of a helicopter rotor, prompting cheers from the crowd. Sitting in the cockpit, Guo \u2013 in a pink shirt and a pilot's headset \u2013 flashed a smile, waving down at her supporters.",
      "As the helicopter touched down, the crowd broke into a chant: \"A-lice Guo! A-lice Guo!\"",
      "At 31, Guo's star was rising: with promises of generous subsidies and economic development, all delivered in her signature brassy, upbeat tone, she had galvanised a following in the town which would see her become its first female mayor.",
      "But few of those cheering could have predicted that less than three years later, Guo would be behind bars, facing charges of human trafficking and allegations that she was a Chinese spy.",
      "Her downfall began with a police raid that uncovered a compound where a giant scam operation was being run from just behind her office. But as the authorities delved deeper, and Guo struggled to answer basic queries about her past, a perplexing question emerged: who really is Alice Guo?",
      "The mayor everyone seemed to love",
      "Guo says she came to local politics from the pig-farming business, having managed her family's commercial piggery for several years.",
      "The career change would have required deep pockets \u2013 and when quizzed about her campaign finances much later, Guo said it was friends and acquaintances in the pig-farming business who had supported her mayoral bid.",
      "But Guo also had connections to a number of wealthy Chinese businesspeople. Little is known about them, but some have subsequently been convicted of money-laundering, and now also face charges of human trafficking alongside Guo.",
      "Her campaign focused on her sunny persona. On stage at one event, Guo told her audience: \"For our team, rule number one is: Do no harm! No harm is allowed, we should just spread love, love, love!\"",
      "Such cheerful platitudes would carry a taint of irony, in retrospect, when authorities exposed the harm and suffering they alleged had been inflicted under Guo's watch.",
      "But upon taking office in June 2022, she brought the youthful, bright-eyed energy of her campaign into Bamban Municipal Hall, painting it pink and decorating the outside of the building with flowers.",
      "\"Alice was beautiful, she was kind and she was helpful to other women,\" said Priscilla May Aban, 31, who runs a vegetable stall in the town. She told the BBC that she had voted for Guo precisely because she was a woman, adding that as mayor, Guo had arranged cleaning jobs for women of the town.",
      "Guo was widely regarded as a caring and empathetic leader, judging by conversations the BBC had with several residents of Bamban. Miah Mejia, the daughter of one of Alice's political allies, claimed that she had given a free scholarship to every local household. Another interviewee told us he hadn't received a college scholarship but had been given a cash subsidy for his school fees.",
      "An emotional Francisco Flores, 75, said, \"She's helped a lot of poor people here in Bamban, giving medicines and the way she is with people, you'd never see a problem.\"",
      "He proudly mentioned the arrival of a McDonald's and a branch of the Philippine fast-food chain Jollibee during Guo's tenure.",
      "Online, pro-Guo social media accounts portrayed her as a progressive young mayor presiding over a pink-tinted wonderland of parades, buffalo races and concerts.",
      "A year-and-half into her mayoralty, however, this carefully crafted image began to crumble.",
      "Inside Bamban's underbelly",
      "In February 2024, Philippine police received a report about a Vietnamese national who had escaped from the captivity of Zun Yuan Technology Incorporated, a company operating out of a walled compound in Bamban.",
      "On the evening of 12 March, police officers and soldiers gathered nearby to plan a raid on the site, located just a minute's walk from Guo's office in the Municipal Hall.",
      "One officer who was there, Marvin de la Paz of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC), told the BBC that around midnight, police informants sent word that people were leaving the compound in buses.",
      "Suspecting that their plans for a raid had been leaked, Mr de la Paz and his colleagues raced straight for the compound. On the way, they saw people fleeing in the other direction, and some officers in the convoy had to peel off and chase them down. When they arrived at the site, they found one of the largest scam hubs ever uncovered in the Philippines, containing 36 buildings and spanning almost 20 acres.",
      "\"We were amazed,\" Mr de la Paz said, \"That was our first time seeing such a grandiose entrance [to a scam compound]... Somehow you feel like you're small in this compound.\"",
      "It later emerged that the compound was built on land which Guo had previously owned \u2013 and that, as mayor, she had granted Zun Yuan a business permit. Her name also appeared on an electricity bill found at the site.",
      "Alice Guo's lawyers did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "Zun Yuan was purportedly an online gambling and entertainment company, which held a Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (Pogo) licence \u2013 accreditation that previously allowed such entities to operate legally in the Philippines.",
      "A relaxation in gambling regulations under ex-President Rodrigo Duterte in 2017 led to a surge of Pogo-driven business activity. But many scam syndicates also found Pogo licences useful for masking their criminal operations \u2013 and PAOCC told the BBC they found evidence that Zun Yuan was running \"pig-butchering\" scams from its office in the compound.",
      "Pig-butchering is a con where scammers take time to build trust with victims by posing as lovers or prospective business partners, then trick them into investing their money into fraudulent schemes.",
      "When shown around the compound by PAOCC officers earlier this month, the BBC found, in a deserted employee dormitory, training scripts on how to scam targets.",
      "\"I want to create my own financial empire,\" a scripted character \u2013 a female crypto expert at an international bank - says to her target, before flattering him and encouraging him to share his dreams. She is told to put her target on hold while pretending to \"cash in on a trade\" - only to declare, moments later, that she had made a killing. She then asks whether he himself knows how to trade, setting him up for the transfer of money that would soon follow.",
      "This is just one of the many ways in which these compounds swindle billions  of dollars around the world. Typically run by Chinese organised crime groups across South East Asia, they are staffed by a mixture of willing employees and trafficked victims who are forced to scam.",
      "According to de la Paz, he and his colleagues found more than 300 foreign nationals in the Bamban compound, many of them working there against their will.",
      "Punishments for disobedient or underperforming workers ranged from beatings to the banal: the BBC was shown a notebook from the compound, in which a worker had copied out  the phrase, \"I will meet my targets tomorrow\", hundreds of times in Chinese.",
      "Enclosed by walls topped with barbed wire, the workers' area of the compound was its own self-contained world, featuring a basketball court, supermarket and restaurants. Employees lived in rooms of six, each with a balcony equipped with a toilet and shower.",
      "Their bosses meanwhile lived in a separate gated enclave, says de la Paz, who showed the BBC one of the villas there.",
      "A marble-clad living room featured a high-end entertainment system, security monitor and ornate hardwood furniture. Behind the house was a swimming pool, beside which was a staircase that led down into what were supposedly escape tunnels, now flooded with water.",
      "By the time security forces stormed the Bamban compound on the evening of 12 March 2024, some of these scam bosses had already eluded capture.",
      "But the raid signalled a shift in the political climate.",
      "In June 2022, just as Guo was being sworn in as mayor, Rodrigo Duterte's presidential term had ended.",
      "His successor, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, soon began facing calls for a ban on Pogo businesses. Many across Philippine society sounded the alarm about the criminality that often lurked within, despite the millions they brought in as revenue. Their biggest customers were rich Chinese, which led to concerns about foreign influence as Marcos, unlike his predecessor, courted Washington over Beijing.",
      "When the raid in Bamban happened, it exposed a dark underbelly of the Philippines \u2013 and the two worlds of Alice Guo   \u2013 the pink office from where she had sought a political career and the scam compound, which suggested far murkier ambitions      \u2013 collapsed in on one another.",
      "'Amnesia girl'",
      "Guo had been a relatively unknown name in the Philippines until last May when she was called to appear before the Senate to explain her links to the scam compound.",
      "Almost overnight, she became a meme. When she told senators she had grown up on a family farm, it brought swift ridicule from Filipinos who said she was too glamorous for the countryside. She became notorious for her inconsistent, vague comments, as well as her claims to have forgotten basic details of her early life, leading social media to nickname her \"my amnesia girl\".",
      "Guo said she'd had a secluded childhood as the child of a Chinese father and Filipino mother \u2013 but could not remember where in the Philippines her family home had been.",
      "At one point, a senator said to her: \"Please mayor, a little more candour than you have shown so far in answering some of the important questions.\"",
      "She told sceptical senators that she had sold her stake in the land before becoming mayor, and that the issuance of a business permit to Zun Yuan had been a mere administrative measure.",
      "Suspicion mounted when, during the hearings, a court in Singapore convicted two of Guo's Chinese former business partners in the Philippines of money-laundering.",
      "Then, last July, despite the intense public interest in her case, Guo managed to slip through the travel restrictions imposed on her and escape to Indonesia. A few months later, she was re-arrested and returned to the Philippines.",
      "It was also in July that Philippine investigators made a breakthrough. Guo's fingerprints were found to match those on file for a girl from China named Guo Hua Ping, who had arrived in the Philippines alongside her mother, also Chinese, in the early 2000s.",
      "This revelation sparked another line of inquiry in the Senate: the idea that Guo might be a spy, exercising influence or gathering intelligence for the Chinese state. The idea spread quickly among the watching public, dominating public discussion of the case.",
      "Jaye Bekema - a senior officer on the staff of Risa Hontiveros, one of the senators who probed potential links between scam syndicates and Chinese intelligence - says the possibility that Guo was a spy warranted an investigation.",
      "\"I think there should be some clarity as to what a spy means,\" Ms Bekema said, while stressing that there is no conclusive proof of Guo being a spy.",
      "\"I am more likely to believe that she didn't plan to be a spy, but that she was tapped to be one [by the Chinese government] because of her criminal connections and her influence on local politics and the local government.\"",
      "In many ways, Guo had become a victim of her own success. The career she chose and the limelight she worked hard to attract meant that she was fully exposed to public scrutiny when China-Philippines relations soured under Marcos.",
      "As political rhetoric escalated and tensions between the two countries spiralled, not least of all in the South China Sea, the young mayor found herself in the crosshairs of espionage accusations.",
      "Others, however, are more sceptical of the allegation. The Chinese state and Guo would have made strange bedfellows, according to Teresita Ang See, a civic leader in the Chinese-Filipino community.",
      "\"What can she spy on in a place like [Bamban]? It's in central Luzon, it's not near any of the sensitive establishments. Why use her? She's very visible, she flaunts her lifestyle. The last person you would use as a spy would be a person like Alice Guo,\" says Ang See.",
      "The Pogo problem",
      "But those who led the questioning against Guo, such as Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, say that it's more complicated than that.",
      "\"Transnational criminals working around the region know how to tap into... I'll call it local talent to penetrate our society, whether through politics or business,\" he explains.",
      "Either way, Guo's case shed light on the Philippine state's vulnerability to being corrupted and co-opted by criminal groups abusing Pogo licences.",
      "In mid-2024, President Marcos declared a blanket ban on all Pogos, citing their widespread abuse by organised crime.",
      "Gatchalian says that the investigation into Alice Guo helped drive this change.",
      "\"Because of it, there was a groundswell of people really clamouring for a ban,\" he tells the BBC. \"And that's when the president officially banned Pogos.\"",
      "Since then, Philippine police have raided scores of scam hubs across the country. But given how influential the syndicates have become, there are concerns that leaks within the security forces and government institutions are allowing criminals to evade capture, according to Mr de la Paz.",
      "Ms Bekema says she feels certain that some candidates in the upcoming national elections are still being financed with Pogo money, while Ang See says that serving police officers have been found working for the criminal syndicates.",
      "In Bamban, concerns about state infiltration seem far from people's minds.",
      "The streets are decked with brightly-coloured campaign posters for the upcoming municipal elections. The Municipal Hall has been whitewashed, and the flowers have been removed.",
      "Guo is currently on trial in six separate cases, potentially facing decades in prison, and has been barred from running for public office again. She has pleaded not guilty to human trafficking charges.",
      "Yet many still treasure the memory of their embattled ex-mayor.",
      "One of those currently standing for Bamban councillor is Miah Mejia's father, Fortunato, a garrulous 69-year-old, who also ran in 2022 as a member of Alice's party, although he lost. He even featured in one of her publicity videos at the time.",
      "He says that the people of Bamban had taken a chance by electing Guo, but that she had good connections to Chinese investors and had delivered on all her promises to the townspeople.",
      "He is also indifferent to the Senate's evidence that Guo was not a Filipino.",
      "\"That's what they've been showing, but we still don't believe it because we don't care whether she's Filipino or not,\" he says. \"What's important is whether or not she helps us.\"",
      "Mr Mejia is adamant that the Alice Guo he knew would not have been involved in human trafficking.",
      "\"Never, ever would she do something like that,\" he says, flatly. \"I know she has a heart. She fears the Lord.\"",

      "Amina will never forget the moment her childhood changed. She was just 12 years old when she was told she could no longer go to school like boys.",
      "The new school year began on Saturday in Afghanistan but for the fourth consecutive year, girls over 12 were barred from attending classes.",
      "\"All my dreams were shattered,\" she says, her voice fragile and filled with emotion.",
      "Amina, now 15, has always wanted to become a doctor. As a little girl, she suffered from a heart defect and underwent surgery. The surgeon who saved her life was a woman \u2013 an image that stayed with her and inspired her to take her studies seriously.",
      "But in 2021, when the Taliban retook power in Afghanistan, Amina's dream was abruptly put on hold.",
      "\"When my dad told me the schools were closed, I was really sad. It was a very bad feeling,\" she says quietly. \"I wanted to get an education so that I could become a doctor.\"",
      "The restrictions on education for teenage girls, imposed by the Taliban, has affected more than one million girls, according to Unicef, the UN's children's agency.",
      "Now, madrassas \u2013 religious centres focused on Islamic teachings \u2013 have become the only way for many women and teenage girls to access education. However, those whose families can afford private tuition may still have access to subjects including maths, science and languages.",
      "While the madrassas are seen by some as a way to offer young women access to some of the education they would have had in mainstream schools, others say they are no substitute and there are concerns of brainwashing.",
      "I meet Amina in the dimly-lit basement of Al-Hadith madrassa in Kabul, a newly established private religious educational centre for around 280 female students of various ages.",
      "The basement is cold, with cardboard walls and a sharp chill in the air. After chatting for about 10 minutes, our toes are already going numb.",
      "Al-Hadith madrassa was founded a year ago by Amina's brother, Hamid, who felt compelled to act after seeing the toll that the education ban had taken on her.",
      "\"When girls were denied education, my sister's dream of becoming a heart surgeon was crushed, significantly affecting her wellbeing\", says Hamid, who is in his early thirties.",
      "\"Having the chance to go back to school, as well as learning midwifery and first aid, made her feel much better about her future,\" he adds.",
      "Afghanistan remains the only country where women and girls are banned from secondary and higher education.",
      "The Taliban government originally suggested the prohibition would be temporary, pending the fulfilment of certain conditions, such as an \"Islamic\" curriculum. However, there has been no progress towards reopening schools for older girls in the years since.",
      "In January 2025, a report by the Afghanistan Centre for Human Rights suggested that madrassas are being used to further the Taliban's ideological goals.",
      "The report alleges that \"extremist content\" has been integrated into their curriculum.",
      "It says that textbooks advocated by the Taliban promote its political and military activities, and prohibited the mixing of men and women, as well as endorsing the enforced wearing of the hijab.",
      "The Afghan Centre for Human Rights calls the ban on older girls attending school a \"systematic and targeted violation\" of their right to quality education.",
      "Before the Taliban return, the number of registered madrassas is believed to have been around 5,000. They focus on religious education, which includes Quranic, Hadith, Sharia law, and Arabic language studies.",
      "But since the restrictions on girls' education were introduced some have expanded the teaching of subjects including chemistry, physics, mathematics, and geography, and languages like Dari, Pashto, and English.",
      "Though a few madrassas tried to introduce midwifery and first aid training, the Taliban banned medical training for women in December last year.",
      "Hamid said he was dedicated to providing an education which blends both religious and other academic subjects for secondary school-age girls.",
      "\"Socialising with others girls again made my sister much happier,\" he told me with a smile, clearly proud of his sister's resilience.",
      "We visit another independently-run madrassa in Kabul.",
      "The Shaikh Abdul Qadr Jilani madrassa educates more than 1,800 girls and women from the ages of five to 45. Classes are organised by student ability rather than age. We were able to visit under strict supervision.",
      "Like Al-Hadath madrassa, it is freezing cold. The three-storey building has no heating, and some classrooms were missing doors and windows.",
      "In one large room, two Quran classes and a sewing class are taking place simultaneously, as a group of girls wearing hijabs and black face masks sit cross-legged on the carpet.",
      "The only heat source in the school is a small electric radiator in the second-floor office of the director, Mohammad Ibrahim Barakzai.",
      "Mr Barakzai tells me that academic subjects are taught alongside religious ones.",
      "But when I ask for evidence of that, staff search for a while before bringing out a few tattered maths and science textbooks.",
      "Meanwhile, the classrooms are well stocked with religious texts.",
      "This madrassa is divided into two sections: formal and informal.",
      "The formal section covers subjects like languages, history, science, and Islamic studies. The informal section covers Quranic studies, Hadith, Islamic law, and practical skills like tailoring.",
      "Notably, graduates from the informal section outnumber those from the formal section by 10 to one.",
      "Hadiya, who is 20 years old, recently graduated from the madrassa after studying a broad range of subjects including maths, physics, chemistry, and geography.",
      "She speaks passionately about chemistry and physics. \"I love science. It's all about matter and how these concepts relate to the world around me,\" she says.",
      "Hadiya now teaches the Quran at the madrassa, as she tells me there was not enough demand for her favourite subjects.",
      "Safia, also 20, teaches the Pashto language at Al-Hadith madrassa. She passionately believes that girls in religious centres should enhance what she described as their personal development.",
      "She focuses on Fiqh, the Islamic legal framework essential for daily Muslim practices.",
      "\"Fiqh is not included in mainstream schools or universities. As a Muslim woman, studying Fiqh is vital for women's betterment,\" she says.",
      "\"Understanding concepts such as ghusl \u2013 ablution \u2013 the distinctions in prostration between genders, and the prerequisites for prayer are crucial.\"",
      "However, she adds that madrassas \"cannot serve as a substitute for mainstream schools and universities\".",
      "\"Educational institutions, including mainstream schools and universities, are absolutely essential for our society. The closure of these establishments would lead to a gradual decline in knowledge within Afghanistan,\" she warns.",
      "Tawqa, 13, is a quiet, reserved student who also studies at the Shaikh Abdul Qadr Jilani madrassa. From a devout family, she attends classes with her older sister.",
      "\"Religious subjects are my favourite,\" she says. \"I like learning about what kind of hijab a woman should wear, how she should treat her family, how to treat her brother and husband well and never be rude to them.\"",
      "\"I want to become a religious missionary and share my faith with people around the world.\"",
      "The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Afghanistan, Richard Bennett, has raised serious concerns about the Taliban's restrictive \"madrassa-style\" education system.",

      "The Taliban Ministry of Education claims that around three million students in Afghanistan are enrolled in these religious educational centres.",
      "It has promised to reopen girls' schools under certain conditions, but this has yet to materialise.",

      "'Oxygen, oxygen, can you get me oxygen?'",
      "Soutik Biswas, BBC News",
      "It was the summer of 2021.",
      "I woke up to the frantic voice of a school teacher. Her 46-year-old husband had been battling Covid in a Delhi hospital, where oxygen was as scarce as hope.",
      "Here we go again, I thought, dread creeping in. India was trapped in the deadly grip of a lethal second wave of infections, with Delhi at its heart. And it was just another day in a city where breathing itself had become a privilege.",
      "We scrambled for help, making calls, sending SOS messages, hoping someone might have a lead.",
      "Her voice shook as she told us her husband's oxygen levels had dipped to 58. It should have been 92 or higher. He was slipping, but she clung to the small comfort that it had climbed to 62. He was still conscious, still speaking. For now.",
      "But how long could this last? I wondered. How many more lives would be lost because the basics - oxygen, beds, medicine - were beyond reach? This wasn't supposed to happen in 2021. Not here.",
      "The woman called back. The hospital didn't even have an oxygen flow meter, she said. She had to find one herself.",
      "We reached out again. Phones buzzed, tweets flew into the void, hoping someone would see us. Finally, a device was located - a small victory in a sea of despair. The oxygen would flow. For now.",
      "The numbers didn't lie, though.",
      "A report from the same hospital told of a 40-year-old man who died waiting for a bed. He found a stretcher, at least, the report helpfully added. That was where we were now: grateful for a place to lay the dead.",
      "In the face of this, oxygen was a commodity. So were medicines, in short supply and hoarded by those who could pay. People were dying because they couldn't breathe, and the city choked on its own apathy.",

My mother, like millions of other people, didn't really understand what Covid was - the disease that had suddenly disrupted their lives.",

      "A mother in northern Nigeria is visibly upset as she clutches her two-year-old child, who has burns and discoloured skin on his face and legs.",
      "The 32-year-old used skin-whitening products on all six of her children, under pressure from her family, with results that she now deeply regrets.",
      "Fatima, whose name has been changed to protect her family's identity, says one of her daughters covers her face whenever she goes out in order to hide her burns.",
      "Another was left with darker skin than before - with a pale circle around her eyes, while a third has whitish scars on her lips and knees.",
      "Her toddler still has weeping wounds - his skin is taking a long time to heal.",
      "\"My sister gave birth to light-skinned children but my children are darker skinned. I noticed that my mother favours my sister's children over mine due to their skin tone and it hurt my feelings a lot,\" Fatima says.",
      "She says she used creams she bought at her local supermarket in the city of Kano, without a doctor's prescription.",
      "At first it seemed to work. The grandmother warmed towards Fatima's children, who were aged between two and 16 at the time.",
      "But then the burns and scars appeared.",
      "Skin-whitening or lightening, also known as bleaching in Nigeria, is used in different parts of the world for cosmetic reasons, though these often have deep cultural roots.",
      "Women in Nigeria use skin-whitening products more than in any other African country - 77% use them regularly, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO).",
      "In Congo-Brazzaville the figure is 66%, in Senegal 50% and in Ghana 39%.",
      "The creams may contain corticosteroids or hydroquinone, which can be harmful if used in high quantities, and in many countries are only obtainable with a doctor's prescription.",
      "Other ingredients sometimes used are the poisonous metal, mercury, and kojic acid - a by-product from the manufacture of the Japanese alcoholic drink, sake.",
      "Dermatitis, acne and skin discolouration are possible consequences, but also inflammatory disorders, mercury poisoning and kidney damage.",
      "The skin may become thinner, with the result that wounds take longer to heal, and are more likely to become infected, the WHO says.",
      "The situation is so bad that Nigeria's National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (Nafdac) declared a state of emergency in 2023.",
      "It is also becoming more common for women to bleach their children, like Fatima did.",
      "\"A lot of people link light skin to beauty or wealth. Women tend to shield, as they call it, their children from that discrimination by bleaching them from childbirth,\" Zainab Bashir Yau, the owner of a dermatology clinic in the capital, Abuja, tells the BBC.",
      "She estimates that 80% of the women she has met have bleached their children, or plan to do so.",
      "Some were bleached themselves as babies, she says, so are just continuing the practice.",
      "One of the most common ways to tell whether someone is using skin-whitening products in Nigeria is by the darkness of their knuckles. Other parts of people's hands or feet get lighter, but knuckles tend to remain dark.",
      "However, smokers and drug users also sometimes have dark patches on their hands, due to the smoke.",
      "So users of skin-lightening products are sometimes mistakenly assumed to belong to this group.",
      "Fatima says that is what happened to her daughters, aged 16 and 14.",
      "\"They faced discrimination from society - they all point fingers at them and call them drug addicts. This has affected them a lot,\" she says.",
      "They have both lost potential fianc\u00e9s because men do not want to be associated with women who might be thought to take drugs.",
      "I visited a popular market in Kano, where people who call themselves \"mixologists\" create skin-whitening creams from scratch.",
      "The market has a whole row of shops where thousands of these creams are sold.",
      "Some pre-mixed varieties are arranged on shelves, but customers can also select raw ingredients and ask for the cream to be mixed in front of them.",
      "I noticed that many bleaching creams, with labels saying they were for babies, contained regulated substances.",
      "Other sellers admitted using regulated ingredients such as kojic acid, hydroquinone and a powerful antioxidant, glutathione, which may cause rashes and other side-effects.",
      "I also witnessed teenage girls buying bleaching creams for themselves and in bulk so that they could sell them to their peers.",
      "One woman, who had discoloured hands, insisted that a seller add a lightening agent to a cream that was being mixed for her children, even though it was a regulated substance for adults and illegal to use on children.",
      "\"Even though my hands are discoloured, I am here to buy creams for my kids so they can be light-skinned. I believe my hands are this way just because I used the wrong one. Nothing will happen to my children,\" she said.",
      "One seller said most of his customers were buying creams to make their babies \"glow\", or to look \"radiant and shiny\".",
      "Most seemed to be unaware of the approved dosages.",
      "One salesman said he used \"a lot of kojic\" - well over the prescribed limit - if someone wanted light skin and a smaller quantity if they wanted a subtler change.",
      "The approved dosage of kojic acid in creams in Nigeria is 1%, according to Nafdac.",
      "I even saw salesmen giving women injections.",
      "Dr Leonard Omokpariola, a director at Nafdac, says attempts are being made to educate people about the risks.",
      "He also says markets are being raided, and there are efforts to seize skin-lightening ingredients at Nigeria's borders as they are brought into the country.",
      "But he says it was sometimes hard for law-enforcement officials to identify these substances.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1ez63ndvo",
    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:05:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",
      "Lastly, Prof Gangjee says GIs help to advertise the region and \"opens up other aspects of history and geography\", citing France's successful wine tourism industry.",
      "Examples of successful and longstanding GIs are Scotch whisky, champagne, and Parma ham.",
      "Another Caribbean country similarly embroiled in a dispute over GI and rum is Barbados. Currently the island doesn't have a scheme.",
      "Barbados has five distilleries and four agreed on the wording of a proposed Barbados rum GI. The sole objector was Wird, which owns brands such as Cockspur.",
      "Similarly to the situation in Jamaica, it objects to the proposed rules against ageing overseas.",
      "The failure by Barbados to obtain a GI has frustrated the other producers, including Richard Seale, owner of the island's Foursquare distillery. \"We need to have intrinsic industries that are rooted here, tied here, that cannot be separated from here,\" he says.",
      "Back in Jamaica, the SPA wants the country's rum to apply for the EU's Protected Geographical Indication classification, but this cannot happen until the proceedings at the JIPO have concluded.",
      "Mr Gentles hopes that a compromise can be reached, even if it means that both sides are not totally happy. \"It is my firm believe that one day we will put this behind us,\" he says.",
      "And while the SPA hopes that a stronger GI will boost acclaim and business, it is also about pride in a product intimately linked to Jamaica's history.",
      "In the days following the October ruling Jamaican newspaper, The Gleaner, endorsed the JIPO decision, saying there were many examples of firms \"with no association to Jamaica attempting to appropriate the mystique of the island's brand\".",
      "It concluded: \"When foreign entities become owners of uniquely Jamaican products, there should be a commitment to robustly maintain the integrity of the brand.\"",

    "summary": "India and China are natural competitors but developments in strained ties can help with easing diplomatic tensions.",
    "story": [
      "In a recent interview, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke positively about India's relationship with long-time rival China. He said normalcy had returned to the disputed India-China border and called for stronger ties.",
      "These are striking comments, because tensions have been high since a nasty border clash in the northern Ladakh region in 2020 - the deadliest since a 1962 war.",
      "Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning expressed appreciation for Modi's words and declared that \"the two countries should be partners that contribute to each other's success\".",
      "Modi's pitch for closer partnership isn't actually as big of a leap as it may seem, given recent improvements in bilateral ties. But the relationship remains strained, and much will need to fall into place - bilaterally and more broadly geopolitically - for it to enjoy a true rapprochement.",
      "India-China ties have many bright spots.",
      "Bilateral trade is consistently robust; even after the Ladakh clash, China has been India's top trade partner. They co-operate multilaterally, from Brics, the alliance of major developing countries, to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. They share interests in advancing non-Western economic models, countering Islamist terrorism and rejecting what they deem US moral crusading.",
      "Even after the Ladakh clash sunk ties to their lowest level in decades, the two militaries continued to hold high-level dialogues, which resulted in a deal in October to resume border patrols. Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping at a Brics summit in Russia that month and they pledged further co-operation. In January, the two sides agreed to resume direct flights.",
      "Still, the relationship remains troubled.",
      "Each side has close security ties with the other's main competitor: India with the US and China with Pakistan.",
      "China opposes Indian policies in the disputed Kashmir region. Beijing frustrates India's great power ambitions by blocking its membership in influential groupings like the Nuclear Suppliers Group and permanent membership on the UN Security Council.",
      "China has a large naval presence, and its only overseas military base, in India's broader maritime backyard.",

      "Bangladesh wooed by China as ties with India fray",
      "What led to Modi and Xi meeting and thaw in ties",
      "Meanwhile, India is deepening ties with Taiwan, which China views as a renegade province. It hosts the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader. Beijing regards him as a dangerous separatist.",
      "India is negotiating sales of supersonic missiles to Southeast Asian states that could be used to deter Chinese provocations in the South China Sea. China views several global forums to which India belongs, such as the Indo-Pacific Quad and the Middle East Europe Economic Corridor, as attempts to counter it.",
      "There are several signposts to watch to get a better sense of the relationship's future trajectory.",
      "One is border talks. Fifty thousand squares miles of the 2,100-mile (3,380km)-long frontier - an area equal to the size of Greece - remain disputed.",
      "The situation on the border is the biggest bellwether of the relationship. The Ladakh clash shattered trust; last year's patrolling deal helped restore it. If the two sides can produce more confidence-building measures, this would bode well for relations.",
      "Future high-level engagement is also important. If Modi and Xi, both of whom place a premium on personal diplomacy, meet this year, this would bolster recent momentum in bilateral ties. They'll have opportunities on the sidelines of leaders summits for Brics in July, G20 in November and the Shanghai Co-operation Group (SCO) sometime later this year.",
      "Another key signpost is Chinese investment, which would bring critical capital to key Indian industries from manufacturing to renewables and help ease India's $85bn (\u00a365.7bn) trade deficit with China.",
      "An increase in such investments would give India a timely economic boost and China more access to the world's fastest-growing major economy. Stronger commercial co-operation would provide more incentives to keep broader tensions down.",
      "Regional and global developments are also worth watching.",
      "Four of India's neighbours - Bangladesh, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka - recently had new leaders take office who are more pro-China than their predecessors. But so far, they've sought to balance ties with Beijing and Delhi, not align with China.",
      "If this continues, Delhi's concerns about Beijing's influence in India's neighbourhood could lessen a bit. Additionally, if China were to pull back from its growing partnership with India's close friend Russia - a more likely outcome if there's an end to the war in Ukraine, which has deepened Moscow's dependence on Beijing - this could help India-China ties.",
      "The Trump factor looms large, too.",
      "US President Donald Trump, despite slapping tariffs on China, has telegraphed a desire to ease tensions with Beijing.",
      "If he does, and Delhi fears Washington may not be as committed to helping India counter China, then India would want to ensure its own ties with China are in a better place.",

      "Additionally, if Trump's impending reciprocal tariff policy hits India hard - and given the 10% average tariff differentials between the US and India, it certainly could - India will have another incentive to strengthen commercial cooperation with Beijing.",
      "India and China are Asia's two largest countries, and both view themselves as proud civilisation states.",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",
      "Depardieu, who denies all the charges against him, faces five years in prison and a fine equivalent to about $80,000 if he is convicted.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 15:11:11 -0400",
    "summary": "The stars of a new Broadway production of Shakespeare's tragic tale about friendship and betrayal explain why they say they've worked their whole careers for this moment.",
    "story": [
      "With stars like Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, maybe it's no wonder \"Othello\" just became the highest-grossing Broadway play ever, pulling in $2.8 million in a single week.",
      "Washington said, \"It's the most excited I've been this century. Seriously. I haven't been this excited about anything I've done as I am about this.\"",
      "That's saying something coming from Washington. Known for roles in films like \"Glory\" and \"Training Day\" (both of which won him Oscars), he's been called the greatest actor of the 21st century. But be careful before you call him a \"Hollywood actor.\"",
      "\"What's the definition of a Hollywood actor?\" he said. \"Myself, I'm from Mt. Vernon, so I'm a 'Mt. Vernon actor.' I don't know what 'Hollywood' means.\"",
      "\"Somebody who's famous on film? A film actor, great success on film?\"",
      "\"I'm a stage actor who does film; it's not the other way around,\" Washington said. \"I did stage first. I learned how to act on stage, not on film. Movies are a filmmaker's medium. You shoot it, and then you're gone and they cut together and add music and do all of that. Theater is an actor's medium. The curtain goes up, nobody can help you.\"",
      "\"Othello\" is the Tony-winner's sixth Broadway show. He plays the title character, Othello, the military commander stirred into a murderous rage after his ensign, Iago, convinces him his wife, Desdemona, has been unfaithful.",
      "Jake Gyllenhaal plays the deceitful Iago, who seeks revenge on his longtime comrade and commander because he was passed over for a promotion.",
      "Shakespeare wrote \"Othello\" around 1604. But this production sets the play in \"the near future,\" adding modern themes like service members suffering from PTSD.",
      "Washington said, \"People, you know, they ordinarily think, 'Oh yeah, it's about jealousy. And he betrays him.' No, it's about two soldiers who trust each other with their lives.\"",
      "\"Well, then\u2026\" Gyllenhaal laughed.",
      "\"Yeah, what are you so pissed off about? What did I do to you?\" Washington laughed.",
      "\"What you know, you know!\" Gyllenhaal replied. \"But I mean, that what is shared is theirs, you know? And what is shared beyond something that they would share with others. That's what makes their bond so strong.\"",
      "At 44 years old, Gyllenhaal is widely celebrated for the emotional range and intensity he brings to roles, in films such as \"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Zodiac\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" And like Washington, he is a theater veteran, with \"Othello\" marking his fourth appearance on Broadway. But this is his first time performing Shakespeare (almost). \"You know what I realized? I did do 'Much Ado About Nothing' in high school,\" he said. \"And I realized that this morning.\"",
      "\"You forgot?\" an astonished Washington laughed.",
      "\"Probably the audience and I would probably like to forget!\"",
      "We visited Gyllenhaal before a performance this past week at the Barrymore Theatre. Standing on stage, the actor said, \"It's my favorite place to be.\"",
      "He explained his character feeds off the audience: \"[Iago] does have a lot of moments [where] he has interactions with the audience, they kind of become his partner in it, and every night it is different. And that's what I love so much about it.\"",
      "Washington, now 70, is no stranger to Shakespeare. On stage he's played Richard III and Julius Caesar, and he has starred in movie versions of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and an adaptation of \"Macbeth.\" \u00a0He first played Othello as a student at Fordham University in New York City.",
      "Asked how he relates to the play and its language differently from when he was 22, Washington replied, \"I know a lot less now. I thought I knew everything then! I didn't really like the part, 'cause I wasn't wise enough to understand it. Now I understand it's really about a bond, you know, that these characters have. He loves not wisely, but too well.\"",
      "\"Othello\" has been staged on Broadway more than 20 times. For most of those performances, Othello was played by a white actor in blackface. That changed in 1943, when Paul Robeson gave a legendary performance in the role. The last actor to play him on Broadway was James Earl Jones, in 1982.",
      "\"James Earl Jones was my northern star when I was in college,\" said Washington. \"He was who I wanted to be. I didn't get to see his Othello, but I know it wasn't as good as my 22-year-old interpretation! But you know, it's my turn.\"",
      "And what a turn it's been. The show is already a box office hit. But record-breaking sales have driven prices sky-high; prime seats go for nearly $1,000, drawing some criticism.",
      "But audiences are showing up, and by the sound of it are enjoying themselves \u2013 as are the stars.",
      "Gyllenhaal said, \"You get to a point where you're like, 'Oh, I've worked my whole career for this, for this moment.'\"",
      "\"That's what it feels like for me, too,\" said Washington. \"I worked my whole career for this moment. This is a 48-year journey for me. It's fascinating to have been too young for the part, and some may say now too old. But 48 years of experience, so 48 years of pain and pleasure and life has informed my approach to playing the role.\"",
      "Gyllenhaal added, \"I feel tremendous gratitude. And he makes me feel it when I walk in that rehearsal room every day.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Boxer George Foreman (Jan. 10, 1949-March 21, 2025) rose up from poverty in a tough Houston neighborhood to become an Olympic gold medalist at 19, and heavyweight champion of the world twice. An uncommon man with the common touch, he also conquered success outside the ring as an advertising pitchman and star of infomercials.",
      "In 1973, at age 24, Foreman defeated Joe Frazier to become world champion. The following year, he defended his heavyweight title against Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, in one of the most touted boxing matches of all time, \"The Rumble in the Jungle.\" \"I beat him up for the first three rounds, four rounds. I think I even beat him up the sixth round, too,\" Foreman told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2005. \"Then all of a sudden I hit him in the seventh round and he whispered in my ear, `That all you got, George?' Oh, that was all I had. You've heard of the rope-a-dope? Well, here's the dope!\" Ali, then the underdog, won in the eighth round by a knockout; Foreman lost the title.",
      "At the time, he was devastated. \"I was young, only 25 years old. I didn't know what to do. I thought my life was over, because when you lose the championship it's not like you lost the title, you lose yourself, because it's like you're not a man anymore.\"",
      "Three years later, after another loss, Foreman had a religious experience that changed his life. He quit boxing and became an evangelist, preaching first on street corners, then in his own church. He opened the George Foreman Youth and Community Center, a safe place for kids to hang out. \"For 10 years, I didn't even make a fist,\" he said. \"I didn't box, I didn't try to box, I was done with it. I was a preacher, a happy, fat preacher.\"",
      "But money problems drove him back to the ring. So, at 37, Foreman began his comeback. He was ridiculed at first \u2014 too old, too fat, too slow, they said \u2014 but he was also too strong, and in 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out the undefeated Michael Moorer. At age 45, Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion ever.",
      "That same year, Foreman agreed to help market a kitchen grill that few were buying, in exchange for a piece of the company. In the first 15 years, Foreman said they sold 100 million of the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machines and its variations.",
      "\"When you go through the airport some time and people stop and say 'George, we love the grill!' that's greater than them telling me, 'George, you did a good job becoming the heavyweight champ of the world!'\" Foreman said.",
      "And he continued selling, not just grilling machines but also mufflers, chips, hot dogs, video games, home warranties, and a George Foreman clothing line.",
      "\"I'm driven,\" he said in 2005. \"I like the life I'm living, but I'm driven because there's so much more to obtain. I'm one of those guys who's going to have to fall out of the saddle. There's always one more star to reach for and I'm trying to.\"",
      "Married five times, Foreman had 12 children. And yes, he did name all five of his sons George. \"You got Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Kenny Norton, Ron Lyle, you let those people hit you on the head and see how many names you're going to remember \u2014 it would be confusing,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I kept it simple. I never forget a name!\"",
      "It also inspired a children's book he wrote, titled, \"Let George Do It!\""

    "summary": "As Conan O'Brien was honored with the Mark Twain Prize at the Kennedy Center, many comics targeted President Trump from the stage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O'Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O'Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0dissolved the Kennedy Center's board of directors and named himself chairman. The new board includes\u00a0political allies like White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, longtime senior Trump aide Dan Scavino, second lady Usha Vance and Fox News host Laura Ingraham.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 as well as Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \"worried about what the future might bring.\"",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\"Twain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\" O'Brien said. \"Twain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\"",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young's \"Rockin in the Free World.\"",
      "Barbs aimed at Trump's Kennedy Center changes",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O'Brien.",
      "\"I think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\" comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \"It's in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\"",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \"the Roy Cohn Pavilion\" after one of Trump's mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Mr. Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted\u00a0on his Truth Social social media platform that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Conan O'Brien's comedy honored",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has rarely been particularly political.",
      "The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times.",
      "In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O'Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \"Late Night\" despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons,\" appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \"SNL\" skits.",
      "He went on to host \"Late Night\" for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show,\" but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \"The Tonight Show\" back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows.",
      "He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \"Conan O'Brien Must Go,\" drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \"Hamilton\" and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \"All You Fascists Bound to Lose.\"",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",

      "In his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press), former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter recounts the glory days of magazine publishing, and of his stewardship of the trend-setting title for two-and-a-half decades.",
      "Among the colorful highlights Carter writes about from his career at the venerable Cond\u00e9 Nast property is the subterfuge required to protect Vanity Fair's 2015 scoop of Caitlyn Jenner's transition.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Graydon Carter on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" March 23!",
      "\"When the Going Was Good\" by Graydon Carter",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We were always on the lookout for covers that would fly off the newsstands and, in years to come, go viral on the internet. Sometimes the quest took us down unexpected byways. If the unmasking of Deep Throat was the biggest journalistic scoop of my time at Vanity Fair, the biggest scoop with regard to the overall culture was our cover exclusive about Caitlyn Jenner. I remembered Jenner as an Olympic decathlete who as Bruce Jenner had appeared on Wheaties boxes\u2014once among the highest accolades an athlete could aspire to.\u00a0 Jenner was tall and still good-looking\u2014later, with a bit of help from colorists and surgeons. There had been a minor and desultory film career early on, and by the time of transition, Jenner was a stepfather getting ordered about by sundry Kardashians on their reality television show. Jenner had become a slightly tragic figure. But word began to seep out that there was going to be some dramatic news.",
      "One day I called Jane Sarkin into my office and said, \"What about Bruce Jenner?\" There were stories floating about that Jenner was going through reassignment surgery. I said, \"At some point Jenner's going to make an announcement. Why not in Vanity Fair? Why don't you see if we can get it?\" Our initial approach was turned down flat. Then Jenner switched to a public relations person Jane was friends with. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Jane had some news. Jenner was game to do it with us, she said.",
      "To get the cover and the inside pictures and the story, we went into deep-secrecy mode. As we had done with Deep Throat, we set up a special room at the office and covered the windows with kraft paper. Nothing suspicious about that! We had one key for the room, and a computer to handle traffic on a server separate from the one that handled the rest of the magazine. Only eight people in the office knew about the project. I assigned Annie Leibovitz to do the pictures and Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of Friday Night Lights, to do the story. I thought Buzz would be ideal. He could talk sports, and given that he had dabbled with a bit of cross-dressing, he could converse in the language of women's finery as well.\u00a0 Buzz made a number of trips west as Bruce began the process of transition. The plan was that Bruce would have surgery and then recuperate in isolation at his home in Malibu. Our agreement was that no one else was allowed to visit him during this period. Only Buzz. As the reporting progressed, we had issues to contend with, including finding women's clothes for a six-foot, two-inch former athlete and then smuggling the most famous photographer in the world into a house that was surrounded by paparazzi. Word had gotten out about Jenner, and there were even news helicopters circling overhead. We put security guards around the perimeter. And then we put the entire staff for the shoot in two large vans with darkened windows. Jane and Buzz were in one of them, as was Buzz's editor, Dana Brown. Later, Jane described walking in with Annie's team. \"The house looked out at a beautiful vista of Malibu. Very modest house. But a beautiful pool. You walk up the steps, and as I come up, this person is coming towards me in a silk robe with marabou feathers, and kitten heels with marabou feathers. Her legs are glistening with satin oil. The hair is down, and the hands are huge. She says to me, 'Hi, I'm Caitlyn.'\"",
      "Once we had the story and the shoot, it was time to pick the cover and figure out what to say on it. We toyed with any number of options. Finally, I just wrote the line \"Call Me Caitlyn.\" I figured that, by the time the issue hit the \u00a0newsstands, her name would be everywhere, and we wouldn't have to say much more than that. We were still in relatively primitive digital times, but we decided to make it the first cover we ever released online. No waiting around for the printing and binding and delivery trucks\u2014all constant sources of leaks. We prepared a brief description and a short video that had been filmed during the shoot. At noon on the appointed day, we released our story to the world. A dozen or so of us sat at a long borrowed conference table, watching the traffic on a big TV monitor. It started slowly and then, as the minutes clicked by, the graph arm just began to climb until it was completely vertical. I have no idea whether you can \"break\" the internet or not, but if it is possible, we surely came close.",

    "summary": "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, and cofounder of Spy Magazine, Graydon Carter recounts a career as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture in his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good.\"",
    "story": [
      "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, Graydon Carter is a family man, father of five grown children, better known for his signature white hair and urbane elegance, never without a handkerchief \u2013 Herm\u00e8s, he has 30 of them (\"This is my greatest luxury,\" he says) \u2013   chronicler of the privileged set of which he is a member, though not born to it.",
      "Growing up middle class, in Ottawa, he credits a mix of Canadian affability and inner strength for his enduring career at the top of the glittering world of magazines. \"Canadians are not weak,\" he said. \"We may look affable on the outside, but if you can survive playing hockey on an open rink in 30\u00b0 weather, you develop a spine.\"",
      "He tells the story of watching a super liner flitting by: \"And I could see in the light, the sort of the amber light of the window, a very attractive couple, and they were sort of dressed up having, I guess, cocktails or dinner. And I realized I wanted to be on that side of the window rather than this side I was standing on.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before that, would you have described yourself as having driving ambitions?\"",
      "\"No. I had absolutely no ambition whatsoever,\" he replied.",
      "He left college before graduating, but with a passion for magazines, and in 1978, set his sights on New York. It was summer in the city. He was not dressed for success. \"I had a Canadian tweed coat on, and it was about as thick as this chair. And I've never felt heat like this in my entire life. And I was drenched in sweat. Water was squirting out of me! So, I had the interview. But he said, 'Why don't you just sit in front of the air conditioner for a while?' So I sat there for a half an hour \u2026 trying to cool down.\"",
      "He left with a job that launched a career in the golden age of magazines, as he writes in his memoir: \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).",
      "And the timing was golden, too. In 1985, New York City was ripe for satire. \"With the invention of the investment banker, everything changed in New York,\" Carter said. \"People were showing off their money in a big way.\"",
      "He was a cofounder of Spy magazine, cheeky and fearless. Among his subjects: A real estate mogul named Donald Trump. \"I had met him a couple of years before,\" Carter said. \"I'd been assigned to do a story on him. I hung around with him for three weeks, and I wrote the story, and I did point out that he was sort of a sharpy from Queens and he was trying to make it. But I pointed out in the story that his hands appeared to be too small for his body. Well, he hated that.",
      "\"And so, at Spy we came up with funny epithets for people, and in Trump's case we called him a 'short-fingered vulgarian' every time we mentioned his name. And he hated that!\"",
      "And yes, Carter has dual citizenship \u2013 American and Canadian. I asked, \"How does that feel at this point in time?\"",
      "\"Especially in the last month or so, I feel very strongly Canadian, and very proud, and very happy that Mark Carney is the prime minister,\" Carter replied.",
      "The New York Observer was a weekly Manhattan newspaper memorable for the color of paper it was printed on, when Carter saw possibilities, leaving Spy in 1991. \"I thought, 'I can make this a thing.'\"",
      "And in a year, the Observer could be seen in the offices of major editors all over Europe (because Carter had sent them). But a visiting American publisher took note.\u00a0 \"And he comes back thinking, 'This is a huge international hit!'\" laughed Carter.",
      "S.I. Newhouse, head of the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, made Graydon Carter editor of Vanity Fair, where the going was very good indeed. \"I flew the Concord more than 60 times,\" Carter said. \"When you went to another city you had a car and driver. You had a car and driver in New York. It was very heady. But at the same time, it was all predicated on you making a successful magazine.\"",
      "Through the magazine, and his own outsized persona, Carter was often described as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture \u2014 someone making who's who, and saying what's what. He was responsible for bringing Monica Lewinsky back for a reset \u2026 revealing the identity of \"Deep Throat\" \u2026 squiring Diana, Princess of Wales in London \u2026 the worldwide exclusive worldwide introductions of Tom Cruise and his family, and of Caitlyn Jenner.",
      "But Jennifer Aniston was the all-time best-selling cover. \"You look back now, you think, 'What was all the fuss?'\" he said. \"But she had just broken up with Brad Pitt, and this is her talking about him, and crying.\"",
      "A successful magazine is something greater than sum of subscription and newsstand sales. For 31 years, Vanity Fair has been synonymous with Oscar party. Hollywood's party of the year was Graydon Carter's magic. \"It became not how to get people in, but how to keep people out,\" he said.",
      "So, what is it about parties that he is so good at? \"We had no VIP sections,\" he explained. \"Once you got in, everybody's the same. And with a party, it's about the right curation of people.\"",
      "\"Curation is very important to everything you've done,\" I said.",
      "\"If it's interesting to me, I think it might be interesting to others,\" he replied.",
      "Graydon Carter resigned from Vanity Fair in 2017 and retired to the south of France. It didn't take.",
      "His idea of retirement was to start something brand new. \"I wanted to produce something that'd be like a dispatch,\" he said.",
      "Air Mail is an email newsletter. It began six years ago, and is said to have half a million subscribers in 219 countries. Filled with thoughtful features and travel and shopping recommendations (all carefully curated, of course), Carter, at 76, is still finding ways to bring in readers.",
      "The impresario says he has \"stumbled\" a lot along the way. Asked to define \"stumble,\" Carter replied, \"Life is a bone yard of minor mistakes and fumbles.\"",
      "\"I've always felt that introductions would be far more interesting if you skipped the highlights \u2026 it's the lowlights where everything happens,\" I said.",
      "\"100%,\" said Carter. \"Successes are really boring. Failures are much more fascinating.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:33:32 -0400",
    "summary": "More than 2,400 works by the Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, from oil paintings and prints to sculptural mashups, are featured at The Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., which also hosts immersive exhibitions celebrating the Surrealist.",
    "story": [
      "When Mike Wallace interviewed Salvador Dal\u00ed in 1958, the painter seemed to believe that he might live forever. Asked what he believed would happen to him when he died, the Surrealist replied, \"Myself not believe in my death.\"",
      "\"You will not die?\"",
      "\"No, no. Believe in general in death, but in the death of Dal\u00ed? Absolutely no, not.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed did die, in 1989. But in a way, he was right. The artist lives on at the Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "The collection chronicles his career through more than 2,400 of his works, from oil paintings to sculptural mashups to fine jewelry. Inside the Dal\u00ed Dome, a \"Dal\u00ed Alive 360\" show fully immerses visitors in his art.",
      "\"Its spirit is based in Dal\u00ed's,\" said Hank Hine, the executive director of the museum. \"That is, Dal\u00ed was always trying to do things in new ways. The amazing thing about Dal\u00ed is that his impact is still felt today, not only in art, but in culture generally.\"",
      "Today, Salvador Dal\u00ed may be a household name, but his name first belonged to his parents' firstborn son. \"His parents named him after his dead brother,\" said Hine. \"That saddled him with a burden of identity that lasted all his life, and can explain a lot of his art \u2013 for instance, his double images, where you see one thing, and you see another. So, this Salvador Dal\u00ed was always wondering, 'Am I myself or am I the other?'\"",
      "Many of Dal\u00ed's works combine the real and the surreal \u2013 a juxtaposition he could pull off thanks to his training as a precise classical painter. \"He can paint like an old master; however, he wasn't content to stay there,\" said program director Kim Macuare.",
      "She said Dal\u00ed found inspiration by diving deep into the subconscious: \"He was very interested in the writings of the Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. And so, when he cuts the drawers into the Venus, what's he's imagining is, 'What would happen if we could go up and open the drawers and look inside someone to see what really makes them tick?'\"",
      "As far as ticking goes, Dal\u00ed's famous painting of melting watches, \"The Persistence of Memory,\" is actually at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But his follow-up is here, hanging in a museum in a state Dal\u00ed never even visited.",
      "The artist had no connection with St. Petersburg, Florida. But what he did have were two very big fans. A wealthy Ohio couple, Eleanor and Reynolds Morse, bought a Dal\u00ed painting to celebrate their first anniversary, a purchase that kicked off a lifetime of collecting and friendship. They acquired everything from Dal\u00ed's early Cubist paintings to his later, larger religious-themed canvases.",
      "Hine said, \"They loved Dal\u00ed so much that they bought only Dal\u00ed for four decades, and were able to put together what is the preeminent collection of Dal\u00ed in the world.\"",
      "When the Morse family decided to donate their collection in the late 1970s, they were insistent that it all go to one location, but no museum stepped up. After the Wall Street Journal wrote an article (\"U.S. Art World Dillydallies Over Dal\u00eds\"), the people of St. Petersburg, Florida, said, \"Well, heck, we'll take it.\" The city made an agreement to find a building for the collection \u2013 a marine warehouse that, in 1982, opened as the Dal\u00ed Museum.",
      "In 2011, the collection moved to its current location, where the Morses' son Brad now comes to see the paintings that once covered his childhood home. \"There was not a square foot or inch even of wall space that wasn't holding a Dal\u00ed painting,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Dal\u00ed's 1956 oil painting \"Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life-Fast Moving)\" hung above Brad Morse's bed.",
      "Now, more than 300,000 visitors a year come to see the fascinating ways in which Dal\u00ed saw the world.",
      "Macuare said, \"Dal\u00ed had a really great quote, and I think it's indicative of how he saw himself and how he saw the world, and that was, 'I don't do drugs. I am drugs.' He thought that seeing as he did would absolutely change your perspective.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed was perceived as an eccentric. Especially in his later life, he was known just as much for his wild persona as he was for his art. But in death his work has gained greater critical appreciation.",
      "\"I think the height of his fame is not over,\" said Hine. \"Dal\u00ed's star is still rising in the world, largely because of what he suggested in his art about the ability to see the world in a different way, something that we really need in this world today.\"",

    "summary": "A lawyer for the two songwriters suing Mariah Carey said they will \"make a decision shortly on whether to appeal.\"",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Mariah Carey did not steal her perennial megahit \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" from other songwriters.",
      "Judge M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Almadani granted Carey's request for summary judgment on Wednesday, giving her and co-writer and co-defendant Walter Afanasieff a victory without going to trial.",
      "In 2023, songwriters Andy Stone of Louisiana \u2014 who goes by the stage name Vince Vance \u2014 and Troy Powers of Tennessee filed the $20 million lawsuit alleging that Carey's 1994 song, which has since become a holiday standard and annual streaming sensation, infringed the copyright of their country 1989 song with the same title.",
      "Their lawyer Gerard P. Fox said he's \"disappointed\" in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "Fox said it is his experience that judges at this level \"nearly always now dismiss a music copyright case and that one must appeal to reverse and get the case to the jury. My client will make a decision shortly on whether to appeal. We filed based on the opinions of two esteemed musicologists who teach at great colleges.\"",
      "Stone and Powers' suit said their \"'All I Want For Christmas Is You' contains a unique linguistic structure where a person, disillusioned with expensive gifts and seasonal comforts, wants to be with their loved one, and accordingly writes a letter to Santa Claus.\"",
      "They said there was an \"overwhelming likelihood\" Carey and Afanasieff had heard their song \u2014 which at one point reached No. 31 on Billboard's Hot Country chart \u2014 and infringed their copyright by taking significant elements from it. Stone had claimed that the song received \"extensive airplay\" during the 1993 Christmas season.",
      "After hearing from two experts for each side, Ram\u00edrez Almadani agreed with those from the defense, who said the writers employed common Christmas cliches that existed prior to both songs and that Carey's song used them differently. She said the plaintiffs had not met the burden of showing that the songs are substantially similar.",
      "Ram\u00edrez Almadani also ordered sanctions against the plaintiffs and their lawyers, saying their suit and subsequent filings were frivolous and that the plaintiffs' attorneys \"made no reasonable effort to ensure that the factual contentions asserted have evidentiary support.\"",
      "She said they must pay at least part of the defendants' attorney fees.",
      "Defense attorneys and publicists for Carey did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Carey's Christmas colossus has become an even bigger hit in recent years than it was in the 1990s. It has reached No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart the past six years in a row. The list measures the most popular songs each week \u2014 not just the holiday-themed \u2014 by airplay, sales and streaming. The song has broken streaming records and has been played over 2 billion times on Spotify.",
      "Carey and Afanasieff have had their own public disagreement \u2014 though not one that's gone to court \u2014 over who wrote how much of the song. But the case made them at least temporary allies.",
      "Carey previously made headlines when she tried to exclusively trademark the nickname \"Queen of Christmas.\" She filed a petition for the trademark in 2021. The U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board rejected the petition, as well as petitions to exclusively trademark \"Princess Christmas\" and \"QOC.\"",

    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

      "West Virginia has outlawed foods that contain\u00a0some artificial dyes\u00a0or other additives, in one of the most comprehensive statewide bans of its kind. The move cites potentially harmful health effects and comes amid a broader push from scientists and government leaders to clamp down on synthetics in the nation's food supply.",
      "On Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed into law a bill that was passed earlier by legislators to eliminate seven artificial dyes \u2014 Red Dye No. 3, Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6, Blue Dye No. 1, Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3 \u2014\u00a0 from food products and drugs sold in the state. The preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben will also be banned.",
      "The dyes will not be allowed in meals served as part of school nutrition programs starting on Aug. 1 this year, while the dyes and the two preservatives will not be permitted in drugs and food sold in the state starting on Jan. 1, 2028, according to the governor's office.",

Kennedy Jr., who has said he is prioritizing the removal of artificial dyes from food and drinks sold around the United States. \"By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we're taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.\"",
      "The latest ban in West Virginia follows a pair of laws passed in California in recent years to remove some additives from foods sold statewide and synthetic dyes from school meals. Dozens of other U.S. states have introduced legislation to ban or more strictly regulate certain food additives, including artificial dyes, since the beginning of the year, according to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on food safety.",
      "Thirty-six color additives are approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in food and drinks in the U.S., including nine artificial dyes.",
      "Rising concerns from advocacy groups and scientists about possible health consequences of synthetic food components, particularly for children, prompted the FDA to undertake a new effort in December to review previously approved additives, although the agency's deputy commissioner for human foods warned at the time that budget restrictions might prevent a timely turnaround. In January, the FDA announced its decision to revoke the authorization for one dye, Red 3, to be added to foods, after evidence showed a link between the dye and cancer in laboratory animals.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary RFK Jr., with help from DOGE, is planning a restructuring with sweeping cuts expected at multiple agencies.",
    "story": [
      "Officials at agencies throughout the Department of Health and Human Services say they are bracing for steep layoffs, as Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his aides are nearing their final decisions on a sweeping restructuring of the department.",
      "Decisions by Kennedy and his team on the changes to the department's makeup and organization are expected within a week or two, multiple senior health officials have been told. One official said aides have begun drafting a reorganization announcement.",
      "The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In addition to the formal head of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency team, Amy Gleason, several other members of DOGE are HHS employees. Some have been intimately involved with the plans, including former insurance executive Brad Smith, who was a top Medicare and Medicaid official during the first Trump administration.",
      "The expected cuts at the department under the reorganization and \"reduction-in-force\" plans ordered by the White House come after many workers have already been fired or let go throughout the nation's health agencies through other moves, like earlier attempts to purge thousands of probationary workers, end fellowship programs and terminate contractor agreements.",
      "Here is the latest we know about the reorganization at several agencies within HHS, based on conversations with more than a dozen health officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality",
      "Workforce cuts laid out by the HHS and DOGE officials for some senior leaders have been unprecedented. In one agency within HHS, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, DOGE officials told leaders on March 11 to expect up to 90% of their staff to be cut.",
      "The agency has around 300 employees, many tasked with collecting and analyzing some of the federal government's most widely cited metrics on health care, including decades-old datasets tracking hospitalizations and emergency room visits nationwide that economists and health policy researchers rely on.",
      "AHRQ also works on a number of programs funded by Congress to address patient safety and health care mishaps, like a program aimed at combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.",
      "\"The current staff is about 45 highly skilled economists and statisticians. DOGE wants that cut to six total staff. The six people who would be willing to stay under those conditions would not exactly be the best,\" one health official told CBS News of cuts to one of the agency's teams overseeing a large federal database on medical spending.",
      "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
      "At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some managers have been told to expect cuts handed down from the department that could result in up to 30% of the Atlanta-based agency's staff being let go.",
      "Close to 12,820 people were employed by the CDC at the end of the last fiscal year, federal records show, up from 10,487 during the final year of the first Trump administration.",
      "\"A 30% cut would be devastating. We are already understaffed in a number of key areas and the staff that are just barely holding it together have been in various stages of burnout for five years,\" one CDC official said.",
      "Some of those cuts might be achieved through employees who are leaving voluntarily. Managers at the agency were told around 400 workers had sought early retirement and around 600 applied for a buyout, two officials said, under offers made across HHS this month. It is unclear how many workers applied for both.",
      "Others could be achieved by rearranging the agency's functions. One proposal being weighed by officials would move the CDC's HIV prevention work to elsewhere in the department.",
      "Food and Drug Administration",
      "Unlike other health agencies, some groups of workers at the Food and Drug Administration were told they were ineligible to take up the HHS buyout offer.",
      "That includes reviewers of new drug applications, whose salaries are funded primarily by fees paid for by drugmakers when seeking approval, not taxpayers.",
      "Others at the agency have been told to prepare for layoffs. FDA managers have said to employees internally that they were out of the loop on the scale and targets of the cuts.",
      "DOGE officials have made multiple visits to the agency's Maryland headquarters, one official said. Another said that DOGE officials had been asking questions around the FDA's labs this week.",
      "Multiple FDA employees said they expected some of the cuts to be achieved through what they called the growing brain drain at the agency, which has been grappling with a challenging return-to-office transition that is unlikely to ease soon. Hundreds of retirement applications are being processed at the agency, one employee said.",
      "Far more staff work for the FDA than its headquarters is equipped to house, the employees said, leaving them scrambling for spots in overflowing parking lots and offices and running out of toilet paper in crowded bathrooms.",
      "National Institutes of Health",
      "From the workforce at the National Institutes of Health, officials are expecting cuts back down to levels similar to what was seen at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "More than 21,000 people were employed by the medical science research agency at the end of the 2024 fiscal year, up from 17,705 at the end of the 2019 fiscal year.",
      "Like with other agencies, it's possible some of the expected cuts could be made up for by voluntary departures of scientists and other workers. One person said they had heard in meetings that some 1,400 had sought either the buyout, early retirement or both.",
      "One person said up to 3,800 employees could be cut from the agency's payroll, if not more, depending on how many staff can be counted from the departures.",
      "Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services",
      "Cutbacks at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services could be smaller, some suspect, since the agency was already facing limits to hiring under the Biden administration.",
      "The agency's chief operating officer said only late last year that it could resume hiring after a turnaround in its finances, InsideHealthPolicy reported in November.",
      "There were 6,557 employees at the Baltimore-based agency in 2024, up only slightly from the workforce of 6,074 in 2019.",
      "One CMS official said they had heard internally that the early retirements and buyouts taken up by employees in some parts of the agency may have been enough to spare much of the agency's remaining staff.",
      "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration",
      "Multiple workers within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration say they have heard nothing from agency leadership about potential cuts.",
      "Some are hopeful that a letter from House Democrats to Kennedy denouncing reports that half of staff from the agency could be cut might stave off steep layoffs.",
      "The agency's workforce, which numbered 916 workers at the end of the last fiscal year, had fallen to a low of 521 employees at the end of the first Trump administration.",
      "The firings of probationary workers earlier this year by DOGE already resulted in more than 10% of the staff at the agency being cut, including employees working on projects related to the 988 hotline for people facing mental health crises.",

With his earnings, Safarik, who has Down syndrome, recently bought a treadmill to stay active when the weather's bad and helped cover the cost of braces for his teeth.",
      "That's unusual, financially speaking, and it's thanks in part to a little-known savings account called an ABLE account, which lets people\u00a0people with disabilities\u00a0save money beyond the $2,000 asset limit that's linked to benefits like Supplemental Security Income and\u00a0Medicaid. Without the account, Safarik could have risked losing government assistance if he had more than $2,000 in assets saved at one time in a given month.",
      "\"With this ABLE account, we don't have to worry as much,\" said Deb Safarik, 71, Paul's mother, with whom he lives. \"It's nice that he can work and save, and not have that be held against him.\"",

      "Named for the 2014 law that created them, the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, ABLE accounts have been available since 2016 to individuals identified by a doctor as having a disability before the age of 26. Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000.\"",
      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000. They're administered by state treasurers, and the vast majority can be set up online via their websites. Some ABLE plans accept paper applications as well.",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account \u2014 including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers \u2014 up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account.",
      "There are also tax advantages. Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for \"qualified disability expenses,\" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further.",
      "Awareness is the biggest challenge",
      "Elliot said raising awareness of the accounts is the biggest challenge for the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), for which he's also the secretary treasurer.",
      "\"Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'\" he said. \"We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",
      "Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of people\u00a0surveyed for a 2023 report by the organization\u00a0did not know these accounts existed.",
      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts).\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How do I know if I qualify for an ABLE account?",
      "Two online resources \u2014\u00a0ABLE Today\u00a0and the\u00a0ABLE National Resource Center\u00a0\u2014 can guide you through questions to determine if you or a friend or family member qualifies.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked.",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

    "summary": "President Trump's nominee to oversee the Social Security Administration faced lawmakers' questions about his plans for the retirement program.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, faced questions about customer service, erroneous payments and concerns about potential interests in privatizing the agency during a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.",
      "Some Senators also tried to nail down Bisignano's stance on efforts by the Elon Musk-helmed\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut costs at the agency by firing workers and closing offices. They also asked him point blank if he'd block DOGE workers from accessing Americans' personally identifiable information.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner. The statement also alleges that Bisignano discussed hiring DOGE employees with SSA personnel.",
      "\"While Mr. Bisignano was the unconfirmed nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, he frequently spoke with senior SSA executives and was personally briefed on key SSA operations, personnel and management decisions,\" the letter from the former SSA employee claimed.",
      "Under questioning by Wyden, Bisignano said during the hearing that he had not, between the time he was nominated in December and Tuesday, March 25, been involved in discussions with DOGE.",
      "The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration (SSA), Frank Bisignano, vowed to crack down on fraud and to protect Americans' personal data in a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday. He also dismissed suggestions that he supports privatizing a federal agency that provides retirement, disability and other benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "Like other government agencies, the SSA has been targeted for major job cuts by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), a reduction in force that former agency officials and other experts warn could greatly hinder the delivery of services to Social Security recipients.",
      "In February, the SSA\u00a0announced\u00a0it would slash 7,000 of its 57,000 workers. Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be\u00a0closer to 10,000 workers.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Even before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0the nomination of Bisignano, CEO of financial technology company Fiserv, calling him a business leader \"with a tremendous track record of transforming large corporations.\" In a social media post, Mr. Trump highlighted Bisignano's \"long career leading financial services institutions through great transformation.\"",
      "Bisignano has served as Fiserv's chief executive since July 2020, and the company has seen strong growth during his tenure. Fiserv's stock price, which was around $100 when Bisignano took the helm, has more than doubled since then. The company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Previously, Bisignano led Fiserv's 2019 merger with First Data Corp., where he\u00a0had been\u00a0chairman and CEO since 2013. He is credited in his bio with turning the payment processor into a \"technology innovator.\"",
      "Prior to leading First Data, Bisignano had a career on Wall Street as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What are potential concerns about Bisignano leading SSA?",
      "In a\u00a0March 23 letter\u00a0to Bisignano, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden \u2014 both members of the Senate panel that will consider his nomination \u2014 expressed concern about the\u00a0ongoing cost-cutting efforts at the agency.",
      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",
      "\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv \u2014 which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' \u2014 could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"",
      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",

      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA. Still, we are concerned about whether he's truly ready to handle the complexities of such an important public service,\" The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonprofit that advocates for benefits recipients, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Will he fully understand the struggles of many Social Security recipients or connect with their challenges? That remains to be seen,\" TSCL Executive Director Shannon Benton said. \"The key issue is finding the right balance between introducing new ideas and protecting Social Security as an essential public program.\"",
      "After Bisignano was nominated in December, the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy organization founded by the AFL-CIO, also raised questions about his lack of experience dealing with social services for seniors and disabled people.",
      "\"Nothing in Mr. Bisignano's career suggests that he understands the unique needs of older and disabled Americans. His record in the private sector doesn't instill confidence that he will protect beneficiaries from plans to dismantle and replace the SSA workforce with AI chatbots,\" Richard Fiesta, executive director at the Alliance, said in a statement at the time.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:34:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "story": [
      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",

      "The head of the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, resigned Monday after nearly five years in the position, leaving as President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have floated the idea of privatizing mail service.",
      "DeJoy had said last month he planned to step down but hadn't set a date. He leaves an agency with an uncertain future. Mr. Trump has said he is considering putting USPS under the control of the Commerce Department in an attempt to stop losses at the $78 billion-a-year agency, which has struggled at times to balance the books with the decline of first-class mail.",
      "Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take on the role until the Postal Service Board of Governors names a permanent replacement for DeJoy, who became postmaster general in the summer of 2020 during Mr. Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business and was the first person to hold the position in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.",
      "DeJoy's tenure was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.",
      "\"I believe strongly that the organization is well positioned and capable of carrying forward and fully implementing the many strategies and initiatives that comprise our transformation and modernization, and I have been working closely with the Deputy Postmaster General to prepare for this transition,\"\u00a0DeJoy said in a statement.",
      "He added that \"much work remains that is necessary to sustain our positive trajectory.\"",

      "\"The future of the Postal Service is on the line, and choosing someone with innovative ideas and appreciation for our Constitutionally mandated service is essential,\" Renfroe said.",
      "Earlier this month, DeJoy said he planned to cut 10,000 workers and billions of dollars from the USPS budget and he'd do that working with DOGE, according to a letter sent to members of Congress.",
      "USPS workers, including mail carriers, have gathered over the past week to protest the cuts and the plan they say will dismantle the service.",
      "Critics of the plan fear negative effects of the cuts will be felt across the country. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly, of Virginia, has said in response that turning over the service to DOGE would result in it being undermined and privatized.",
      "DeJoy had introduced in 2021 a 10-year overhaul he has orchestrated\u00a0\u2014 including higher postal rates, slower standard delivery and fewer post offices \u2014 to stem the Postal Service's financial hemorrhaging.

The therapeutics unit works to develop treatments and conducts research into cancer, immune diseases and other conditions.",
      "Data privacy concerns",
      "23andMe's struggles have raised concerns about the privacy of its customers' genetic data, which is used to trace people's ancestry, among other purposes. In filing for bankruptcy protection, the company said there will be no changes to how it manages and protects people's data.",
      "23andMe users must explicitly affirm that the company may share their personal data, although people's data could be included as part of a sale of the company. Some states have passed privacy laws that would require a person's consent before their genetic data is transferred from one entity to another.",
      "In its bankruptcy announcement, 23andMe said any buyer of its assets would have to observe applicable privacy laws for customer data. The company has also previously said that any customer data it shares with other parties is anonymous and can't be traced to individual users.",
      "23andMe also allows customers to delete their accounts. To do that, users must log in to their account and submit a request. The company will send an email confirming the request to delete the data, which the user must then verify.",
      "23andMe's stock, which once traded for more than $300 a share, fell to 79 cents before the start of trade Monday. In January, 23andMe reported a third-quarter net loss of $26.8 million on revenue of $60.3 million, an improvement over its loss of $259.7 million on revenue of $44.7 million in the year-ago period.",
      "The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. 23andMe said that, if granted approval in bankruptcy court, the company would solicit bids from potential acquirers over a 45-day period and potentially conduct an auction.",
      "One possible buyer is Wojcicki herself. The executive, who recently submitted an acquisition offer that 23andMe rejected earlier this month, said in a social media post Monday that she may again bid for 23andMe.",
      "\"I have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder,\" she wrote, adding that continues to believe in the company's brand and business.",
      "\"We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today. There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's executive order on Thursday starting the process of dismantling the Department of Education could throw federal student loan programs into disarray and lead to frustration for millions of borrowers, according to experts.",
      "The Education Department's remit is broad. The agency manages student loans for more than 40 million Americans; oversees $18 billion in Title I funding for elementary and secondary education in low-income areas; issues Pell Grants to help low- and middle-income students pay for college; and administers the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which lets students apply for loans, grants and other college aid.",
      "\"It takes resources to manage that asset, including trained staff to make sure borrowers have good information and colleges can administer loan programs properly,\" said Peter Granville, a higher education finance expert and fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \"It takes technical expertise that only Education Department officials have.\"",
      "Ahead of the Thursday signing ceremony for Mr. Trump's order, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the Education Department \"will be much smaller than it is today.\" She said at the time that the agency would, for now, retain oversight of student loans and Pell grants.",
      "Mr. Trump, in remarks from the Oval Office on Friday, said the Small Business Administration (SBA) would assume oversight of student loans.",
      "\"I have decided the the SBA, the Small Business Administration ... will handle all of the student loan portfolio. We have a portfolio that's very large, lots of loans,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Trump administration officials had previously said such programs would eventually be transferred to another federal agency, such as the Treasury Department, Commerce Department or SBA.",
      "\"Closing the department does not mean cutting off funds from those who depend on them \u2014 we will continue to support K-12 students, students with special needs, college student borrowers and others who rely on essential programs,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement after Mr. Trump signed the order. \"We're going to follow the law and eliminate the bureaucracy responsibly by working through Congress to ensure a lawful and orderly transition.\"",

      "\"Recipe for chaos\"",
      "Despite the Trump administration's expectations for a smooth wind down of the Education Department, experts warn that the administrative challenges in transferring oversight of student loans from one part of government to another are significant. They also note that prior to Friday, the White House had not released a plan for overseeing student loans as the Education Department shrinks, or specified which department would inherit its duties.",
      "\"It doesn't pass the sniff test that you'd summarily move a complex, large student debt portfolio from the Department of Education, where it's already lived, and just plop it over to the Treasury,\" Jessica Thompson, senior vice president at The Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit group focused on education policy, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We are concerned that there is not a serious, detailed thoughtful plan for reform around what to do with the student loan portfolio.\"",
      "Granville concurred with that assessment. Gutting the Education Department before articulating a plan to reassign student loan oversight \"is not a recipe for efficiency or innovation,\" he said. \"It's a recipe for chaos and frustration for millions of people who rely on the student loan program.\"",
      "The Trump Administration has already slashed the Education Department's staff in half, dismissing employees tasked with managing $1.6 trillion in student loan debt.",
      "\"The department was already understaffed, and with the breadth and depth of the firings last week, we have big questions about the ability to provide service to 40-plus millions borrowers,\" Thompson said.",
      "She points to the long wait times Americans with student loans face in reaching agency staff by phone to get their questions answered. \"We were already in a situation where we needed improvements in customer service, so there is no conceivable way you could gut the institutional expertise that occurred last week and not have repercussions,\" Thompson said.",
      "That could lead to confusion for current and future student borrowers seeking information about loan payments and other servicing issues, duties now handled by the Education Department. Thompson also worries that a sudden vacuum in such information could lead to a spike in loan defaults.",
      "\"Now, they can't call and get advice or have questions about how much their loan payments will be and can they afford them, answered,\" she said.",

With his earnings, Safarik, who has Down syndrome, recently bought a treadmill to stay active when the weather's bad and helped cover the cost of braces for his teeth.",
      "That's unusual, financially speaking, and it's thanks in part to a little-known savings account called an ABLE account, which lets people\u00a0people with disabilities\u00a0save money beyond the $2,000 asset limit that's linked to benefits like Supplemental Security Income and\u00a0Medicaid. Without the account, Safarik could have risked losing government assistance if he had more than $2,000 in assets saved at one time in a given month.",

      "Named for the 2014 law that created them, the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, ABLE accounts have been available since 2016 to individuals identified by a doctor as having a disability before the age of 26. Next year, they'll become available to those identified before the age of 46, which will increase access to an additional 6 million people, including 1 million veterans, according to Indiana State Treasurer Daniel Elliott, who administers the accounts in his state. An estimated 8 million people nationwide already qualify.",
      "\"The fact that it used to be that individuals could only save up to $2,000 or they could lose benefits \u2014 that was really restricting a lot of families,\" Elliot said. \"People were forced into a position where they couldn't save for their futures. Now we're seeing average account balances of (ABLE accounts) between $11,000 and $12,000.\"",
      "Generally, ABLE accounts may reach totals of $100,000 without affecting Supplemental Security Income. Lifetime balance limits for the various state ABLE accounts can range from around $300,000 to over $500,000. They're administered by state treasurers, and the vast majority can be set up online via their websites. Some ABLE plans accept paper applications as well.",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account",
      "Anyone can contribute to an ABLE account \u2014 including the account owner, friends, family, organizations, nonprofits, and employers \u2014 up to $19,000 per year in 2025. If the account owner is able to work and not already contributing to a workplace retirement plan, they can contribute an additional amount equal to their yearly gross income. For 2025, that amount is up to an additional $15,560 to $18,810, depending on the state administering the account.",
      "There are also tax advantages. Investment earnings from ABLE accounts remain untaxed as long as money taken from the account is used for \"qualified disability expenses,\" such as medical treatment, education, tutoring and job training. Account holders may choose from a number of investment options for the funds in their accounts or hold and save the money without investing it further.",
      "Awareness is the biggest challenge",
      "Elliot said raising awareness of the accounts is the biggest challenge for the National Association of State Treasurers (NAST), for which he's also the secretary treasurer.",
      "\"Many people are used to the idea that, 'If I have a disability or my child has one, it could endanger their benefits to save money,'\" he said. \"We as a state and as a country need to start reaching out to people and saying, 'Look, you actually can save money now. You could save towards the purchase of a home.' The hardest thing right now is getting that message out. We need more people to be aware things have changed.\"",
      "According to NAST's data, just 186,641 ABLE accounts existed at the end of 2024, despite an estimated 8 million people qualifying. When the age limit is raised, the accounts will also become available to people whose disabilities may have been the result of an accident in adulthood or developed later in life, such as after a COVID infection.",
      "Andrew Warren, senior associate for policy and research at the Financial Health Network, who studies the financial circumstances of Americans with disabilities, said that the vast majority of people\u00a0surveyed for a 2023 report by the organization\u00a0did not know these accounts existed.",
      "\"Less than 1% of eligible individuals have these accounts,\" Warren said. \"Our research show that one of the major barriers to becoming financially healthy for this vulnerable group is asset limits. But there's an information disconnect between caseworkers and direct services providers on the ground and (administrators of ABLE accounts).\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "How do I know if I qualify for an ABLE account?",
      "Two online resources \u2014\u00a0ABLE Today\u00a0and the\u00a0ABLE National Resource Center\u00a0\u2014 can guide you through questions to determine if you or a friend or family member qualifies.",

The initial contract to proceed with production on a version for the Air Force version is worth an estimated $20 billion.",

    "story": [
      "For President Trump, the barrage of tariffs the U.S. is set\u00a0to unleash on the country's largest trading partners on April 2 amounts to \"Liberation Day,\" as he described the trade measures Thursday on social media. To the Federal Reserve, as Chair Jerome Powell relayed on Wednesday, tariffs are a broadside on economic growth.",
      "Where does that leave investors? Scratching their heads, judging by today's trading. Stocks wobbled early, rebounded and then lost momentum in the afternoon. The S&P 500 fell 12 points, or 0.2%, to close at 5,663, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended largely flat and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.3%.",
      "The dip followed the stock market's modest bounce yesterday after the Fed announced it was standing pat on interest rates, as Wall Street had expected. Indeed, investors may not have learned much from the central bank and Powell's remarks given that economists have already begun forecasting weaker growth and higher inflation as the U.S. moves to deploy tariffs against Canada, China, Europe, Mexico and other countries.",
      "Powell's uncertainty principle",
      "Another thing investors didn't learn from the Fed: The world is a much more uncertain place today than it was before Mr. Trump was re-elected in November. Financial markets have slumped this year as the White House laid out its plans for tariffs, with the S&P 500 falling briefly into correction territory, or 10% below its previous peak. The index is now down 8.4% since reaching its all-time high on Feb. 19.",
      "Still, if there were any lingering doubts that the nation's economic outlook is murky, Powell seemed determined to squash them flat. The Fed chair cited uncertainty five times in his prepared remarks and another dozen times in the following press conference.",
      "That uncertainty refers to the questions regarding how the Trump administration's economic agenda on trade, immigration, fiscal policy and government regulation could affect the economy.",
      "For people thinking of taking out a loan, of course, what is certain is that for now the Fed prefers to assess the impact of these policies before cutting its benchmark interest rate.",
      "That caution, while understandable given the questions hanging over the economy, could itself pose risks \u2014 namely, that the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's rate-setting panel, might wait too long before easing back on the stick.",
      "\"[T]he Fed's understandably cautious stance also opens the door for the Committee to be late to the party in the event the economy starts to lose more momentum, which is the higher risk in our opinion,\" TD Cowen analysts said Thursday in note to investors.",
      "There is ample precedent for the Fed mistiming its policy shifts, as it did during the pandemic when an earlier move to tighten rates might have helped head off rising inflation.",
      "To be sure, despite the haze surrounding the economy, Powell remains clear on one thing that should prove reassuring to investors: The risks of a U.S. recession remain low. And although Fed policymakers expect inflation to rise this year to 2.7%, they also think it will recede to 2.2% in 2026 and 2% in 2027.",
      "Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, thinks stocks could climb in the near term as investors focus on word from the Fed that it could still lower rates twice this year. Over the longer term, the question hovering over markets will be how the economy responds to the shock therapy administered by Mr. Trump, and whether the Fed has the medicine to address it.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked the White House's Department of Government Efficiency from accessing systems at the Social Security Administration containing the sensitive information of millions of Americans, delivering another setback to President Trump's efforts to overhaul the federal government.",
      "U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander wrote in a 137-page decision that a group of unions challenging DOGE's access to systems of records at the SSA was likely to succeed on its claims that the efforts violated the Privacy Act and a federal law that governs the agency rulemaking process.",
      "She granted a request for a temporary restraining order that was sought by the labor unions, which filed a lawsuit in February that challenged the legality of the SSA's decision to allow DOGE to get its hands on sensitive, personal and confidential information pertaining to millions of Americans.",
      "\"The defense does not appear to share a privacy concern for the millions of Americans whose SSA records were made available to the DOGE affiliates, without their consent, and which contain sensitive, confidential, and personally identifiable information,\" wrote Hollander, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.",
      "The judge's order blocks officials at the SSA from granting DOGE access to systems containing Americans' personal information. It also requires Elon Musk, DOGE and its team members at the agency to delete all non-anonymized personal information that they obtained from the SSA, and prevents them from accessing any agency computer or software code.",
      "Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, cheered the decision as a win for American workers and retirees across the country.",
      "\"The court saw that Elon Musk and his unqualified lackeys present a grave danger to Social Security and have illegally accessed the data of millions of Americans,\" Saunders said in a statement. \"This decision will not only force them to delete any data they have currently saved, but it will also block them from further sharing, accessing or disclosing our Social Security information.\"",
      "The Justice Department has said that 10 members of the DOGE team are working at the SSA, and seven of them have had access to personal information housed in its data systems.",
      "In her opinion, Hollander said that the Trump administration failed to provide the court with a reasonable explanation for why the DOGE team needs access to the data maintained in the SSA's systems to root out fraud and abuse.",
      "\"Defendants disregarded protocols for proper hiring, onboarding, training, and access limitations, and, in a rushed fashion, provided access to a massive amount of sensitive, confidential data to members of the DOGE Team, without any articulated explanation for the need to do so,\" she wrote.",
      "The judge, who sits on the district court in Baltimore, knocked the Justice Department for withholding the names of the DOGE team members in an effort to protect their privacy, but allowing access to millions of Americans' personal information.",
      "The Trump administration, she said, \"have not shown the same level of care with the far more sensitive, confidential data of millions of Americans who entrusted their government with their personal and private information. The trust appears to have been violated, without any articulated need.\"",
      "\"The American public may well applaud and support the Trump administration's mission to root out fraud, waste, and bloat from federal agencies, including SSA, to the extent it exists. But, by what means and methods?\" Hollander said. \"The DOGE Team is essentially engaged in a fishing expedition at SSA, in search of a fraud epidemic, based on little more than suspicion.\"",
      "She accused the Trump administration of giving DOGE \"unbridled access\" to millions of Americans' private data, including their Social Security numbers, medical records, drivers' license numbers, bank and credit card information, tax information, income and work history and their home and work addresses.",
      "\"This intrusion into the personal affairs of millions of Americans \u2014 absent an adequate explanation for the need to do so \u2014 is not in the public interest,\" she said. \"To be sure, rooting out possible fraud, waste, and mismanagement in the SSA is in the public interest. But, that does not mean that the government can flout the law to do so. The president's advisors and employees are not exempt from the statutes Congress enacted to protect American citizens from overbroad and unnecessary access to their [personal information].\"",
      "Mr. Trump established DOGE on his first day back in the White House and has said that he tasked Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, with heading the initiative. The White House has said, though, that Amy Gleason, who worked at DOGE's predecessor entity, is formally the administrator of DOGE. The task force's employees have been dispatched to more than a dozen federal agencies as part of the president's plan to shrink the size of the government.",
      "But DOGE's actions, and specifically access to sensitive government databases, has raised concerns about whether they are complying with a federal law that aims to protect Americans' private information. Lawsuits have been brought seeking to restrict DOGE's access at least five other agencies, as well as claiming that Musk's actions are unconstitutional.",
      "Just earlier this week, another federal judge in Maryland found that Musk and DOGE likely violated the Constitution's Appointments Clause and the separation of powers when they unilaterally acted to shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development.",

The central bank forecasts inflation to edge up to 2.7%, up from from its current level of 2.5%.",

But President Trump's aggressive trade policies, which have triggered concerns about economic growth, have also amplified uncertainty for financial markets.",
      "\"What holds the FOMC back from continuing to push interest rates lower at this moment is uncertainty about the Trump administration's economic policies,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote Wednesday in a research note ahead of the Fed's decision.",

      "\"We continue to expect the S&P 500 to reach 6,600 by the end of the year supported by Fed easing, healthy economic and profit growth, as well as AI spending and adoption,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email on Wednesday. \"Investors should consider buying the dip in quality AI stocks, and utilize structured strategies to manage downside risks in their equity exposure.\"",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at Oxford Economics, told investors in a report ahead of the Fed meeting that \"markets may have recently become overly pessimistic.\" Although he doesn't expect a recession, he forecasts slower economic growth and described the economy as \"vulnerable.\"",
      "The impact of tariffs and the health of the economy will, of course, help shape the Fed's decision on interest rates, and for policymakers the task amounts to threading the needle. Easing borrowing costs sooner rather than later would shore up growth, but also boost inflation \u2014 anathema to consumers worn down by nearly three years of high prices. By contrast, waiting too long to cut rates could cause the economy to stall.",
      "Investors now think there's a good chance the Fed will lower the federal funds rate three times this year, or a total of three-quarters of a percentage point, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.",

      "Tesla, whose pioneering electric vehicles were once a symbol of forward-thinking sustainability, increasingly finds itself the target of public furor.",
      "Attacks on property carrying the logo of Elon Musk's electric-car company are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas. While no injuries have been reported, Tesla showrooms, vehicle lots, charging stations and privately owned cars have been targeted. In Canada, Tesla was removed from an international auto show over safety concerns.",
      "There has been a clear uptick in Tesla attacks since President Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that is slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it's impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern.",
      "In Mr. Trump's first term, his properties in New York City, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role.",
      "\"Tesla is an easy target,\" said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. \"They're rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.\"",
      "Musk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles.",
      "String of attacks",
      "The attacks are keeping law enforcement busy. Prosecutors in Colorado charged a suspect last month in connection with a string of attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \"Nazi cars\" spray-painted on a building. Only weeks, the same Loveland, Colorado, dealership was targeted in another attack involving an incendiary device.",
      "And federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet.",
      "\"The statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,\" the agent wrote.",
      "A number of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high.",
      "An Oregon man is facing charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted.",
      "Four Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street.",
      "In Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \"resist\" was also painted in red across the building's front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails \u2014 crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid \u2014 and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles.",
      "\"Was this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think \u2014 the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\" Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \"None of those factors are lost on us.\"",
      "Meanwhile, some Tesla owners in conservative-leaning states are also facing acts of vandalism, including one Texas man whose Tesla was recently keyed while parked at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.",
      "\"I just bought it because it was an electric car,\" Dallas resident Jeff Nguyen told CBS News Texas. \"This one is pretty fun to drive. It has really just nothing to do with politics or anything like that.\"",
      "Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn't have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range.",
      "More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Mr. Trump's 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor.",
      "Musk continues to run Tesla \u2014 as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX \u2014 while also serving as Mr. Trump's adviser.",
      "Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump's election but has since shed all those gains and this year has tumbled 44%, prompting expressions of concern from Wall Street analysts. Measures of Tesla's brand popularity also show the automaker taking a hit, while the company's sales fell in 2024 for the first since since 2015.",
      "President Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric vehicle showroom. The president promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles.",
      "Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz's podcast, saying \"at least some of it is organized and paid for\" by \"left-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.\"",
      "\"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" Musk wrote Tuesday on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"",
      "The progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize \"Musk Or Us\" protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and \"it explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.\"",
      "Some Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle's new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \"I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy\" or \"I just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\"",
      "Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla's most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period.",
      "\"We're coming after you\"",
      "The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump's administration and a key donor to committees promoting Mr. Trump's political interests. Mr. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \"domestic terror,\" and he has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \"going to go through hell.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said she'd opened an investigation \"to see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\"",
      "\"If you're going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we're coming after you,\" Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she called the attacks \"domestic terrorism\" and vowed to \"continue investigations that impose severe consequences.\"",
      "Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point.",
      "\"It's not the type of act that I would prioritize,\" Clarke said. \"Not right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.\"",
      "Theresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them.",
      "\"Hate on Elon and Trump all you want \u2014 that's fine and dandy, it's your choice,\" she said. \"It doesn't justify ruining somebody's property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There's other ways to get your voice heard that's more effective.\"",
      "Someone recently slapped a \"no Elon\" sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn't intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said.",
      "\"I love my car. It's the safest car,\" Ramsdell said. \"I'm not going to let somebody else judge me for the car I drive.\"",

      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin begins.",
      "The bulletin warned of Russian professional hacking groups employing phishing scams to gain access to encrypted conversations, bypassing the end-to-end encryption the application uses.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and Whatsapp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",

The group chat, Ratcliffe said, was a \"mechanism for communicating between senior level officials but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications.\"",

      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked.",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",

    "summary": "The Senate Finance Committee voted to advance the nomination of Mehmet Oz to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Finance Committee voted on Tuesday to advance the nomination of Dr. Mehmet Oz, the former heart surgeon and television host, to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "The panel voted 14 to 13 along party lines to advance Oz's nomination, which now heads to the full Senate.",
      "Oz appeared before the committee\u00a0earlier this month. If confirmed, the 64-year-old would oversee the nearly $1.5 trillion the federal government spends on Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 health insurance programs that make up a large amount of the budget and have often been wielded as political cudgels.",
      "Oz has widespread name recognition as the host of \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" and previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University. After the show stopped taping in 2022, Oz ran for the open Senate seat in Pennsylvania, where he was defeated by now-Sen. John Fetterman.",
      "The former television host has touted meetings with key Republican senators on his path to confirmation, some of whom praised him during his confirmation hearing earlier this month. The committee's chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, voiced his support for Oz ahead of the vote Tuesday, saying he has \"years of experience as an acclaimed physician and public health advocate.\" Crapo added that the background makes Oz \"uniquely qualified\" for the role, while urging the panel to advance the nomination.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats criticized Oz during the hearing, alleging that he had dodged taxes. The criticism added to earlier critiques among Democrats of his views toward abortion and concerns about conflicts of interests. Oz has pledged to resign from positions he holds at companies, including a drugmaker and supplement company, while divesting from healthcare companies as part of his ethics agreement.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the committee, argued ahead of the vote Tuesday that given the chance to \"assure the American people that he would not be a a rubber stamp for Republican plans to gut Medicaid and hike Affordable Care Act premiums\" during Oz's confirmation hearing, \"at every turn he failed the test.\" Wyden encouraged his colleagues to oppose the nomination, claiming that Oz has shown no ability or interest in \"pushing back on the dangerous Trump healthcare agenda.\"",
      "The vote comes as the Finance Committee voted narrowly to advance Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination as Health and Human Services secretary in February. Kennedy would serve as Oz's supervisor if he's confirmed.",
      "With the advancement out of committee, Oz's confirmation would move to the Senate floor, where Republicans can afford to lose three votes to confirm him without support from across the aisle, with Vice President J.D. Vance serving as a tie-breaker.",

    "summary": "As top Trump cabinet members sent texts in a Signal group chat, CBS News analysis shows one of them, Steve Witkoff, was in Russia.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own report for The Atlantic.",
      "The National Security Council told CBS News on Monday that the group chat \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, or whether he had the device with him in Russia, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report on Tuesday, saying on X that no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday for a pre-planned hearing on worldwide security threats. Ratcliffe acknowledged on Tuesday that he was part of the chat.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin. The White House did not immediately reply to CBS News' questions about the meeting or whether Witkoff had his device at the Kremlin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however, and the Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's nominee to oversee the Social Security Administration faced lawmakers' questions about his plans for the retirement program.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, faced questions about customer service, erroneous payments and concerns about potential interests in privatizing the agency during a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday.",
      "Some Senators also tried to nail down Bisignano's stance on efforts by the Elon Musk-helmed\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut costs at the agency by firing workers and closing offices. They also asked him point blank if he'd block DOGE workers from accessing Americans' personally identifiable information.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner. The statement also alleges that Bisignano discussed hiring DOGE employees with SSA personnel.",
      "\"While Mr. Bisignano was the unconfirmed nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, he frequently spoke with senior SSA executives and was personally briefed on key SSA operations, personnel and management decisions,\" the letter from the former SSA employee claimed.",
      "Under questioning by Wyden, Bisignano said during the hearing that he had not, between the time he was nominated in December and Tuesday, March 25, been involved in discussions with DOGE.",
      "The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

    "story": [
      "Masih Alinejad, a journalist and prominent critic of the Iranian regime, was in the garden of her Brooklyn home when she locked eyes with the hitman hired to assassinate her. It was late July, and she had gone into her garden to pick vegetables.",
      "\"He was gigantic,\" she later testified in federal district court in Manhattan at the trial of the men who plotted to kill her. \"He was in the sunflowers staring into my eyes.\"",
      "Though she eyed him with some suspicion, she also thought he might be taking pictures of her garden of \"beautiful sunflowers.\"",
      "\"Every curse that I hear, I plant a flower,\" she explained, referring to threats she's endured for criticizing the Islamic Republic. \"That's why I have a massive garden. A lot of cursing and threats.\"",
      "The man in her garden, Khalid Mehdiyev, had been directed to kill Alinejad by fellow members of a Russian mob organization known as Thieves-in-Law, Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov, prosecutors said. In his car was an AK-47 style assault rifle and 66 rounds of ammunition. Prosecutors said that Iran's government had offered Amirov and Omarov a $500,000 bounty.",
      "On July 28, 2022, this murder-for-hire scheme involving Russian mobsters and the Iranian regime targeting a defiant dissident was foiled in Brooklyn. Alinejad, who has wild curls and often wears a white flower in her hair, is also an activist and leader of the movement to free Iran's women from the compulsory hijab.",
      "This was only one of the Iranian regime's several attempts to assassinate or kidnap Alinejad. One alleged assassination planner targeted not just Alinejad, but also President Trump during his 2024 campaign last fall. Farhad Shakeri is accused of being an \"asset\" of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) who was tasked with devising a plan to kill Mr. Trump and recruiting two men to \"silence and kill, on U.S. soil, an American journalist,\" according to the indictment.",
      "While it was not the first attempt on her life, Amirov and Omarov were the first attempted assassins to go to trial in New York last week in a criminal case that provided a rare look into Iran's assassination attempts on U.S. soil. Prosecutors said high-ranking members of the IRGC were instructing Amirov and Omarov in the scheme. FBI agents detailed their analysis of devices and internet search histories tying Iranian intelligence officers to the plot. Through photographs, videos and messages, they illustrated the global network behind the attempted murder, with Medhiyev reporting his surveillance progress to Omarov and Amirov as he updated them from Brooklyn.",
      "\"We blocked it from both sides, it will be a show once she steps out of the house,\" messaged Medhiyev to Omarov, who then forwarded it to Amirov. \"God willing,\" he replied. In another plan, Medhiyev went to ask Alinejad for flowers from her garden, but she did not come to the door. Her Ring camera surveillance at one point showed him pacing back and forth on her porch before trying to open the door. Medhiyev was later stopped by police, who found the rifle and bullets in the backseat of his car.",
      "Last week, a federal jury found Omarov and Amirov guilty on all charges, including murder-for-hire and attempted murder in aid of racketeering. They face over 50 years in prison.",
      "\"I am being bombarded with emotion,\" Alinejad told CBS News over the phone shortly after the verdict, sounding tearful. \"I just need to cry now, I need to laugh, I need to dance. I just got the news now.\"",
      "\"The real masterminds of this crime are still in power in Iran,\" she said. \"I am waiting for the day when Ali Khamenei and his terrorist Revolutionary Guards face justice, I want them to be punished.\"",
      "Despite the attempts on her life, Alinejad said she will not be silenced in her fight against the Islamic Republic.",
      "\"She has a mission,\" her husband Kambiz Foroohar told CBS News. \"And that mission is that the Islamic Republic is like ISIS. It's an evil regime. She feels like she's compelled to challenge it. Compulsory hijab is just one way of challenging the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "\"Next: Masih Alinejad\"",
      "In Iran, Alinejad struggled to keep her wild curls hidden under a hijab.",
      "\"I have a lot of hair. It was not easy,\" she testified in court.",
      "She was a political journalist there for over a decade but admitted she was always crossing the \"red lines\" of what Iran's government would allow people to write about. In 2009, she fled Iran.",
      "\"I'm a journalist, so I couldn't just keep quiet,\" she said. \"I had no option but to leave Iran.\"",
      "Once in the United States, she took off her hijab. She posted a photo of herself jumping in the air on social media, reveling in the feeling of the wind in her hair. In Iran, she \"felt like a hostage.\"",
      "That was the beginning of her campaign against the compulsory hijab, which evolved into the White Wednesday movement. Every Wednesday, women in Iran would film videos of themselves walking unveiled, a peaceful protest against compulsion.",
      "\"Social media is like my weapon,\" Alinejad testified. \"My social media expos\u00e9.\"",
      "The Iranian regime reacted by calling her and unveiled women \"prostitutes,\" she said. They arrested hundreds of women.",
      "Iran's Revolutionary Court has threatened women with up to 10 years in prison for sharing protest videos with her. \"It's become a crime,\" she said, her voice cracking.",
      "The government has also accused Alinejad of being a foreign agent. \"Oh, all of them,\" she testified listing intelligence agencies: \"Agent of the CIA, agent of Mossad, Agent of MI6, agent of President Trump.\"",
      "In court, Alinejad broke down when the prosecution displayed a cartoon published in Iran's state-controlled newspaper depicting two dissidents hanging in the air and an image of Alinejad looking up at them fearfully. Both men, who held citizenship in Europe (one also had a U.S. green card) were kidnapped and executed by the Iranian regime. She testified in court that the caption read: \"Next: Masih Alinejad.\"",
      "\"Did you understand that to be about you?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied tearfully.",
      "By proxy, Alinejad's family in Iran has also become a target. In 2018, Iranian government officials tried to coerce relatives to lure her to Turkey, where they planned to capture her, offering a payment in exchange. The relatives did not accept.",
      "In 2019, her brother was arrested on charges of associating with her. He was sentenced to eight years in prison but released after two years.",
      "\"They can't reach her. They can reach her family.\" said Foroohar. \"So that's always a big concern. But the family is also brave. They're enduring it.\"",
      "In July 2021, four Iranian intelligence officials were charged with a kidnapping conspiracy \u2013 for developing plans to kidnap Alinejad and bring her back to Iran. They allegedly explored slipping her out of the U.S. by travel routes from Alinejad's home to the waterfront in Brooklyn, a maritime evacuation route involving speed boats, and maritime travel from New York to Venezuela, according to the indictment. The conspirators live in Iran, where they remain at large.",
      "The assassination attempts",
      "It is \"chilling\" how close Mehdiyev came to carrying out the plan to kill his wife, said Faroohar.",
      "Medhiyev testified at trial about seeing Alinejad on the porch as he walked by her home, but his gun was in the car. By the time he went back for it, she had left.",
      "\"I was there to try to kill the journalist,\" he admitted.",
      "Medhiyev was a key witness for the prosecution, but the defense tried to undermine his credibility, dubbing him the \"pizza delivery hitman\" after Medhiyev admitted on the stand that he had once planned a kidnapping while working at a pizza shop.",
      "\"As you're coordinating an international kidnapping you're also working at a pizza shop?\" asked Omarov's defense attorney, Elena Fast. \"That's correct,\" he replied.",
      "On the day of his arrest, Mehdiyev had approached the door of Alinejad's home. At the time she was on a Zoom call with Venezuelan dissident Leopoldo Lopez and Russian chess player Garry Kasparov. She heard someone on the porch but did not go downstairs.",
      "\"She said, 'I don't know who that is but this call is more important,'\" Lopez recounted over Whatsapp.",
      "\"It was the Zoom call that saved her life,\" he said.",
      "Earlier, Medhiyev had sent Omarov a video of him opening a suitcase in the back of his car with an AK-47 style rifle inside. A caption read, \"we are ready.\" Amirov replied, \"keep the car clean.\"",
      "Police arrested Mehdiyev nearby that day after he ran a stop sign. In the back of his car, they discovered the AK-47 style assault rifle and 66 rounds of ammunition.",
      "Foroohar received a call at work from the FBI asking to \"whisk me away to a safe location.\" He and Alinejad were later told that a man with an AK-47 had been arrested outside their home.",
      "\"It's quite stressful. It's quite scary,\" admitted Foroohar, when asked what it felt like to live under threat. \"At the same time if you think about it too much, you are just paralyzed. So you compartmentalize.\"",
      "\"It's not easy. Sometimes you look over your shoulder,\" he added. \"Sometimes you just learn how to trust.\"",
      "Alinejad and her husband have lived in so many safe houses that they lost track. She has only been back to their Brooklyn home once to make sure the neighbors are watering her garden.",
      "In 2024, it was under surveillance again.",
      "On Nov. 7, Shakeri \u2014 the man assigned to assassinate both Mr. Trump and Alinejad \u2014\u00a0along with Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt were indicted for their alleged involvement in a second murder-for-hire plot on Alinejad's life. Rivera and Loadholt are accused of surveilling her Brooklyn home for months, with the intent to locate and kill her. The Justice Department charged Shakeri with directing \"a network of criminal associates to further Iran's assassination plots against its targets.\"",
      "\"It was very shocking and surprising,\" said Foroohar. \"We thought the whole thing was over and done with. And we don't know when the next one is. We had a conversation with members of the Biden administration, and they said, you better get used to this because Iran is very determined to get rid of Masih, and they're not going to give up.\""

    "summary": "President Trump's nominee to head the Social Security Administration told lawmakers in a Senate hearing he hasn't considered privatizing it.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration (SSA), Frank Bisignano, vowed to crack down on fraud and to protect Americans' personal data in a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday. He also dismissed suggestions that he supports privatizing a federal agency that provides retirement, disability and other benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "Like other government agencies, the SSA has been targeted for major job cuts by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), a reduction in force that former agency officials and other experts warn could greatly hinder the delivery of services to Social Security recipients.",
      "In February, the SSA\u00a0announced\u00a0it would slash 7,000 of its 57,000 workers. Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be\u00a0closer to 10,000 workers.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Even before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0the nomination of Bisignano, CEO of financial technology company Fiserv, calling him a business leader \"with a tremendous track record of transforming large corporations.\" In a social media post, Mr. Trump highlighted Bisignano's \"long career leading financial services institutions through great transformation.\"",
      "Bisignano has served as Fiserv's chief executive since July 2020, and the company has seen strong growth during his tenure. Fiserv's stock price, which was around $100 when Bisignano took the helm, has more than doubled since then. The company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Previously, Bisignano led Fiserv's 2019 merger with First Data Corp., where he\u00a0had been\u00a0chairman and CEO since 2013. He is credited in his bio with turning the payment processor into a \"technology innovator.\"",
      "Prior to leading First Data, Bisignano had a career on Wall Street as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What are potential concerns about Bisignano leading SSA?",
      "In a\u00a0March 23 letter\u00a0to Bisignano, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden \u2014 both members of the Senate panel that will consider his nomination \u2014 expressed concern about the\u00a0ongoing cost-cutting efforts at the agency.",
      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",
      "\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv \u2014 which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' \u2014 could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"",
      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "When Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA. Still, we are concerned about whether he's truly ready to handle the complexities of such an important public service,\" The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonprofit that advocates for benefits recipients, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Will he fully understand the struggles of many Social Security recipients or connect with their challenges? That remains to be seen,\" TSCL Executive Director Shannon Benton said. \"The key issue is finding the right balance between introducing new ideas and protecting Social Security as an essential public program.\"",
      "After Bisignano was nominated in December, the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy organization founded by the AFL-CIO, also raised questions about his lack of experience dealing with social services for seniors and disabled people.",
      "\"Nothing in Mr. Bisignano's career suggests that he understands the unique needs of older and disabled Americans. His record in the private sector doesn't instill confidence that he will protect beneficiaries from plans to dismantle and replace the SSA workforce with AI chatbots,\" Richard Fiesta, executive director at the Alliance, said in a statement at the time.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration has quietly paused the processing of green card applications filed by certain individuals, including approved refugees, as part of a broader effort to more aggressively vet immigrants, multiple sources familiar with the move told CBS News.",
      "U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, recently directed officials to suspend processing of requests for legal permanent residency submitted by immigrants granted refugee or asylum status, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss an action that has not been publicly reported.",
      "The move will, for the time being, place in legal limbo immigrants who were granted refuge in the U.S. because they proved they could be persecuted in their home countries.",
      "Refugees are granted entry into the U.S. after an overseas and exhaustive process of security checks, medical screenings and interviews that typically takes years to complete. Asylees are foreigners in the U.S. who are granted protection by immigration judges or asylum officers. Both populations have to prove they could face persecution because of certain characteristics, such as their political views, race or religion.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted both congressionally enacted programs, suspending the refugee process and closing the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border through executive orders that are currently facing federal court challenges.",
      "In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed CBS News' reporting, saying the green card processing pause is needed to comply with two executive actions issued by President Trump, including one that questioned immigration vetting procedures under the Biden administration.",
      "\"USCIS is placing a temporary pause on finalizing certain Adjustment of Status applications pending the completion of additional screening and vetting to identify potential fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, in alignment\" with Mr. Trump's executive actions, DHS said in the statement. \"Adjustment of status\" is the official name of the green card process.",
      "In one of the presidential proclamations cited by officials, Mr. Trump instructed federal agencies to \"vet and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who intend to be admitted, enter, or are already inside the United States.\"",
      "The other executive order cited by officials paved the way for the State Department to designate Mexican cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "The pause on some green card applications is the latest action taken by the Trump administration to restrict, tighten and, in some cases, suspend legal immigration procedures on the basis of concerns about national security and fraud.",
      "Last month, the administration, citing vetting and fraud concerns, paused all immigration applications filed by immigrants from Latin America and Ukraine who arrived in the U.S. under two Biden-era programs that relied on an authority known as humanitarian parole. The government did not announce that move publicly, but CBS News disclosed it on Feb. 19.",
      "The administration said last week it would give over half a million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who came to the U.S. under one of the programs 30 days to self-deport or face arrest and deportation. Trump officials have claimed the migrants were \"loosely vetted\" by the Biden administration and noted the program was plagued by fraud concerns.",
      "Trump administration officials have also announced plans to more heavily scrutinize and review the social media accounts of immigrants applying for legal status, including U.S. citizenship, green cards and asylum. USCIS said the vetting of social media accounts is required for \"the enhanced identity verification, vetting and national security screening.\"",
      "The agency has long reviewed the social media information of immigrants applying for certain immigration benefits, but the new plan would require those applicants to submit their social media accounts, or handles, to the government for review.",

      "The agreements were announced in separate statements by the White House after U.S. officials held separate bilateral talks with Ukrainian and Russian delegations this week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it was his country's understanding that the Black Sea agreement was in effect immediately, and Russia's government also released a statement confirming that it had agreed to the terms.",
      "Zelenskyy noted that the White House statement did not specify any actions to be taken if Russia violates the terms of the agreement, and he said Ukraine would appeal directly to the Trump administration for more weapons and more sanctions against Russia in such a case.",
      "\"In accordance with the agreement between the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States, the Russian and American sides agreed to ensure the implementation of the 'Black Sea Initiative,' which includes ensuring the safety of navigation in the Black Sea, the non-use of force and the prevention of the use of commercial vessels for military purposes while organizing appropriate control measures through the inspection of such vessels,\" the Kremlin said in a statement published by the Russian state-run news agency TASS.",
      "It said that in return for the Black Sea deal, the U.S. would \"help restore access for Russian agricultural and fertilizer exports to the world market, reduce the cost of shipping insurance, and expand access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.\"",
      "The terms of the deal, as described by the Kremlin, appeared to be based largely on the previous Black Sea Grain Initiative, a limited ceasefire brokered by the United Nations and Turkey that Russia walked away from in 2023. Moscow claimed the U.S. and other Ukrainian partners weren't keeping up their end of the agreement in 2023, by blocking the export of some Russian agricultural products.",

      "Circuit Court Judge Patricia Millett said Nazis detained in the U.S. during World World II received better legal treatment than Venezuelan immigrants who were were deported to El Salvador this month under the same statute.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",

      "Judge Justin Walker, whom Mr. Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration's arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government's arguments that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.",

      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",
      "And when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.",
      "\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.",
      "The report's focus on engineering and money misses the importance of adopting policies that could improve how people use and pay for infrastructure, according to Clifford Winston, a microeconomist in the Brookings Institution's economic studies program.",
      "\"You fail to make the most efficient use of what you have,\" said Winston. For example, he noted that congestion pricing like that recently adopted by New York City\u00a0\u2014 charging people to drive in crowded areas \u2014 places the burden on frequent users and can pressure people to drive less, reducing the need for new bridges, tunnels and repairs.",
      "Roads remain in chronically poor shape, receiving a D-plus compared to a D in the last report, despite $591 billion in investments since 2021.",
      "Aviation also came in with a D-plus, Van Cleave notes.",
      "Two categories, rail and energy, received lower grades. Disasters like the derailment of a train carrying dangerous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023 lowered rail's previous B mark to a B-minus.",
      "The energy sector, stressed by surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, got a D-plus, down from C-minus.",
      "Invest now or pay more later",
      "Engineers say problems in many sectors have festered for so long that the nation must figure out how to address the shortcomings now or pay for them when systems fail.",
      "On Wednesday, a delegation of engineers will visit Washington to talk to lawmakers about the funding impacts and \"the importance of continuing that investment,\" said Olson, who said the needs are a bipartisan issue.",
      "\"When we talk about it in ways of how better infrastructure saves the American family money, how better infrastructure supports economic growth, we're really confident that ... there is strong support,\" he said."

      "In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.",
      "The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Mr. Trump's Middle East and Ukraine envoy\u00a0Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.",
      "\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president\u00a0said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.",
      "On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns \u2014 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2014 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2014 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"",
      "\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.",
      "\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:",
      "\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left \u2014 or, more to the point, who I was.\"",
      "At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Goldberg told CBS News: \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me \u2014 they like convenience. They're just like you and me \u2014 they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"",
      "CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday that sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a non-secure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "Congressional reaction",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"",
      "At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.",
      "\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"",

      "The U.S. and Russia were expected to release a joint statement early Tuesday morning after discussions in Saudi Arabia aimed at achieving a Black Sea maritime ceasefire deal, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News. The statement was expected to come out at 4 a.m. in Washington, D.C., which is 11 a.m. in Moscow, two of the sources said, but that time came and went without any word from American officials.",
      "While the details of the expected statement were not clear, reports shared with the Trump administration from the U.S. technical team in Riyadh seemed optimistic, the sources had said.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters more than an hour after the statement had been expected, however, that Russian officials were still analyzing the information relayed back to Moscow by the Russian negotiators in Saudi Arabia.",
      "\"The content of the technical negotiations will definitely not be 'published.' This should not be expected,\" he said, characterizing the talks as \"negotiations with a deep dive into details.\"",
      "\"The reports made in the capital [by Russia's negotiators to the government] are being analyzed, and only then will it be possible to talk about some understandings,\" Peskov told reporters, adding that the dialogue between Russian and American officials would continue.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quoted by Russia's state-run TASS news agency later Tuesday as saying Moscow would consider a new version of a previous Black Sea ceasefire deal with Ukraine, which was crafted to enable the safe shipment of grain products from Ukraine and Russia, but only with \"clear guarantees\" that he said could \"only be the result of an order from Washington\" to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "Russian negotiator Grigory Karasin, in Riyadh, was cited earlier by TASS as saying Moscow would continue the \"useful\" talks with the U.S., and would seek to involve the U.N. and other nations.",

      "\"The talks are over. All details will be announced later,\" the source told a small group of media, including AFP.",
      "The previous deal, called the Black Sea Grain Initiative, was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey. Russia exited that agreement in 2023, claiming the U.S. and Ukraine's other international partners had not allowed Moscow to export some agricultural products in violation of the terms. Lavrov's remarks on Tuesday appeared to confirm that a new version of that limited agreement was being discussed, at least between the Russian and U.S. officials in Saudi Arabia.",

      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Sunday on \"Face The Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that a ceasefire on \"aerial infrastructure\" went into effect immediately after Mr. Trump's call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "The details of the agreement reached during that phone call have never been confirmed, but Moscow has said it involved an agreement to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, which it almost immediately accused Ukraine of breaching.\u00a0Mr. Trump\u00a0said Putin agreed\u00a0during their call to immediately halt attacks \"on all energy and infrastructure\" in Ukraine, offering a different version of the deal from the Kremlin. Ukraine accused Russia within hours of breaching the agreement as described by Mr. Trump.",
      "Next on the agenda, Waltz said Sunday, was a maritime ceasefire to allow the movement of grain, fuel, and other goods.",
      "\"And then we'll talk the line of control, which is the actual front lines, and that gets into the details of verification mechanisms, peacekeeping, freezing the lines where they are. And then, of course, the broader and permanent peace,\" Waltz said.",

      "The head of the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, resigned Monday after nearly five years in the position, leaving as President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have floated the idea of privatizing mail service.",
      "DeJoy had said last month he planned to step down but hadn't set a date. He leaves an agency with an uncertain future. Mr. Trump has said he is considering putting USPS under the control of the Commerce Department in an attempt to stop losses at the $78 billion-a-year agency, which has struggled at times to balance the books with the decline of first-class mail.",
      "Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take on the role until the Postal Service Board of Governors names a permanent replacement for DeJoy, who became postmaster general in the summer of 2020 during Mr. Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business and was the first person to hold the position in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.",
      "DeJoy's tenure was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.",
      "\"I believe strongly that the organization is well positioned and capable of carrying forward and fully implementing the many strategies and initiatives that comprise our transformation and modernization, and I have been working closely with the Deputy Postmaster General to prepare for this transition,\"\u00a0DeJoy said in a statement.",
      "He added that \"much work remains that is necessary to sustain our positive trajectory.\"",

      "Critics of the plan fear negative effects of the cuts will be felt across the country. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly, of Virginia, has said in response that turning over the service to DOGE would result in it being undermined and privatized.",

      "Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle criticized the security breach, though Democrats took a harsher stance about how it should be addressed, with many demanding an immediate investigation.

In the chat, Hegseth detailed the plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen shortly before the strikes took place, and other top officials weighed in, according to Goldberg.",

    "summary": "A personal attorney to President Trump for years, Alina Habba is known for her pugnacious defense in the media and in courtrooms.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday announced that he is appointing longtime ally Alina Habba to be New Jersey's top federal prosecutor. She has been a personal attorney to Mr. Trump for years, known for her pugnacious defense of him against the media and in courtrooms.",
      "Mr. Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, his social media site. He said that Habba, a counselor to the president who has not previously worked as a prosecutor, \"will lead with the same diligence and conviction that has defined her career.\"",
      "Habba has been at Mr. Trump's side for four years, at first filing unique, combative lawsuits \u2014 such as a doomed 2021 effort seeking a court order halting an investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James. That investigation led to one of Habba's most high profile defenses of the president, then a civilian.",
      "\"I am honored to serve my home state of New Jersey as Interim U.S. Attorney and I am grateful to President Trump for entrusting me with this tremendous responsibility,\" Habba said to CBS News, before mentioning her previous clashes on Mr. Trump's behalf. \"Just like I did during my time as President Trump's personal attorney, I will continue to fight for truth and justice. We will end the weaponization of justice, once and for all.\"",
      "Habba was among a half dozen lawyers who argued for Mr. Trump and others during a three-month-long 2023 civil fraud trial that pitted Mr. Trump against James' office. The case landed Mr. Trump and other defendants from his company a nearly $500 million fraud liability, which they are appealing. The trial became a staging ground for an effort that would permeate his presidential campaign and first weeks in office: vilification of judges who cross Mr. Trump.",
      "Inside the courtroom, Habba, other lawyers and Mr. Trump himself seethed at what they claimed were unfair decisions by the judge. Outside, to gathered cameras, the perceived injustices became a rallying call for a nascent presidential campaign still months away from its first primary. Mr. Trump, Habba and others would rage against the magistrate.",
      "Habba's work during the trial also included perhaps the most important cross-examination of her career: a withering, hours-long questioning of Mr. Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen. Mr. Trump was on hand to watch the show, as was James, as well as defense attorneys and Manhattan prosecutors set to spar months later in Mr. Trump's 2024 criminal trial.",
      "In a series of tense and testy exchanges, Habba got the former attorney to admit to lying under oath on multiple occasions. A member of Mr. Trump's legal team later told CBS News they believed Habba's work in the civil fraud case had buoyed their cause in the criminal matter.",
      "Christopher Kise, a former solicitor general of Florida who led Mr. Trump's team during the fraud case, lauded Habba on Monday. Like Habba and others who have worked for Mr. Trump, Kise highlighted conservatives' claim that there was a \"weaponization\" of the courts against Mr. Trump during the four years between his terms in office.",
      "\"Alina will be a zealous and tireless advocate for justice in the District of New Jersey and help ensure the focus is on fighting crime and protecting families instead of the weaponized practices of the prior administration,\" Kise said. \"She has time and again proven her ability to take on major issues and to persevere under intense and challenging circumstances.\"",
      "While working for Mr. Trump, Habba weathered significant losses without losing her place in his inner circle. The fraud judgment came within weeks of an $83 million hit when a civil federal jury found Mr. Trump liable for defamation against the writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "Mr. Trump attended that trial as well. He and Habba chafed at yet another judge, insinuating inside the courtroom and declaring outside to reporters that they were being treated unfairly.",
      "By the spring of 2024, Mr. Trump's campaign was intrinsically tied to his time in court. The rhythm of his seven-week criminal trial in New York included daily visits to a gaggle of cameras, just outside the courtroom doors, where Mr. Trump and others sought to highlight what they saw as a \"rigged\" campaign against him.",
      "Habba wasn't a part of Mr. Trump's defense team, but she was a mainstay in the front row of the gallery. When the verdict was read, Habba and Mr. Trump's son Eric were the only people other than Secret Service in that row. All other staff and friends of the former and future president sat behind.",
      "After Mr. Trump became the first former or future president to be convicted of felonies \u2014 a verdict he is appealing \u2014 Habba started appearing on the campaign trail, becoming a near-constant presence advocating for Mr. Trump on television and on the stage.",
      "In December, Mr. Trump announced Habba as counselor to the president. She said Monday she would be leaving the White House to serve in New Jersey.",
      "The new job represents a homecoming for Habba, whose eponymous former law firm, Habba Madaio & Associates LLP, is based in Bedminster, New Jersey, just a few miles from one of the president's golf courses.",
      "It was at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster where the two first became acquainted. Mr. Trump went through scores of lawyers in the years since, but few have had Habba's staying power.",
      "Those years brought Habba from her firm of fewer than half a dozen attorneys to the White House. Now she returns to New Jersey where she'll lead an office of some 150 prosecutors.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 20:31:15 -0400",
    "summary": "A redistricting battle over Louisiana's congressional map has spanned years and been before the Supreme Court twice already.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday wrestled with whether to leave in place Louisiana's congressional map\u00a0that was used in the 2024 elections and includes two majority-Black districts.",
      "The dispute is the latest involving claims of racial gerrymandering and the drawing of political districts to land before the high court following the recrafting of voting boundaries after the decennial census. In this case, the plaintiffs, who identify themselves as non-African American Louisiana residents, say the state relied too heavily on race when drawing a second majority-Black district for the state's congressional map.",
      "It was unclear following arguments whether the high court was inclined to preserve Louisiana's map for use in future elections. New district lines are drawn after every Census.",
      "The justices have in recent years weakened the Voting Rights Act, starting with the landmark 2013 decision that gutted the law's preclearance requirement. Before that decision, certain states and localities \u2014 mostly Southern \u2014 with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices were required to submit changes in election law to the Justice Department for approval before they could be implemented. The court ruled that the formula used by the Voting Rights Act to determine what states and localities were subject to Section 5 was unconstitutional because it was based on electoral conditions in the 1960s and 1970s, rather than on contemporary circumstances, and thus imposed unequal burdens on some states without sufficient justifying evidence.",
      "But in a surprising decision in 2023, the high court declined an invitation to reshape Section 2 of the landmark voting law and invalidated Alabama's congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers after the 2020 Census.",
      "The latest case before the court involves Louisiana's congressional map, which was redrawn last year to add a second majority-Black district to comply with Section 2, but then was found to be a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race.",
      "\"What we're looking at is the decision on how you draw districts to comply with the VRA and at the same time, not violate the 14th Amendment's ban on drawing districts based on race, where race is used excessively,\" said Jeffrey Wice, a professor at New York Law School who is an expert in redistricting.",
      "The dispute, he said, \"is a conflict of different issues coming to us at a time when the court is highly politicized.\"",
      "The case, known as Louisiana v. Callais, has ping-ponged around the federal courts, including twice at the Supreme Court, since 2022, when a federal district court in Baton Rouge issued the first decision in this long-running dispute. The judge, Shelly Dick, found the original map of Louisiana's six congressional districts that was enacted by the legislature in February 2022 likely violated Section 2 because it diluted Black voting strength.",
      "That initial map from the GOP-led legislature had one majority-Black district. African-Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "The judge blocked the state from conducting congressional elections under those lines and ordered the state to put in place a remedial plan with two majority-Black House districts. A federal appeals court then upheld that injunction and set a deadline for Louisiana to draw the new voting lines.",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who took office in January 2024, called the legislature into special session to draw a new congressional map, with the understanding from state lawmakers that two of its six districts had to be majority-Black.",
      "The plan adopted reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to adhere to the district court's order and bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state officials said. But Louisiana state lawmakers said they had another goal: to protect certain Republican incumbents, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, they said.",
      "It did that at the expense of Garrett Graves, a Republican who represented District 6 and was at risk of losing his seat because of the redrawn lines. The new district has a Black voting age population of roughly 51%. It stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast, and connects predominantly Black populations from Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge.",
      "Shortly after the new redistricting plan was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged that the redrawn District 6 was a racial gerrymander in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided three-judge district court panel in Shreveport found that the legislature predominantly considered race when it crafted the new voting lines and blocked the state from using the map in any election. But Louisiana lawmakers, along with a group of Black voters and nonprofits who challenged the original map from 2022, asked the Supreme Court to intervene and allow the state to use the plan for the 2024 elections.",
      "The Supreme Court granted the state and Black voters' emergency relief, and the November House elections were held using the redrawn map. Graves opted not to seek reelection, and Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, won the race for District 6. The high court agreed to take up the case in November.",
      "\"The court has faced this issue several times before,\" Wice said. \"But here we have a uniquely different case because we're looking at Louisiana trying to do three things.\"",
      "The first is to comply with the courts, the second is to draw a second minority district that would allow Black voters to elect their preferred candidate, and the third is to satisfy political demands to keep certain members of Congress in office, he said.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Louisiana officials argue that the non-Black voters who challenged the new congressional map did not have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing, because they failed to show how they were harmed by the alleged violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "But as to the merits of the case, the state and voters said race was not the sole factor involved in how the map was redrawn. Instead, Louisiana lawmakers said they had two criteria: that District 6 be majority-Black and that the broader congressional map protect Republican incumbents.",
      "The state said the blame for its considerations of race when drawing the new map lies with the district court, since it said the remedial redistricting plan had to have two majority-Black districts to comply with the federal voting rights law.",
      "\"Having forced the state into adopting a second majority-Black district, the federal judiciary cannot wash its hands of the matter now and point at the legislature,\" Louisiana officials said. \"If a bank robber holds a gun to a teller's head, no one would say that the teller's emptying the cash drawer was self-motivated. Just so here.\"",
      "But during the arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned how the high court is supposed to reconcile the state's acknowledgement that it took race into consideration to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act with the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "\"How do we square that with the 14th Amendment's promise that race should play no role [in our laws]?\" he asked.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts also highlighted the shape of District 6, which he said runs from one corner of the state to another, \"picking up Black populations as it goes along.\"",
      "But several of the liberal justices appeared to support Louisiana's argument that it was motivated by politics when it drew the lines of District 6, and decided to draw its own map to protect incumbent lawmakers rather than continue with litigation and risk the district court implementing its own voting lines.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan said state lawmakers had good reason to create a second majority-minor district, given the lower court's order, and implemented a map that reflected its political considerations.",
      "\"If the state can't do that, the state has no breathing room\" when drawing voting boundaries, she said.",
      "In their filings, Louisiana officials asked the Supreme Court to provide a \"clear articulation\" of what voting map would survive review under the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, and how states can avoid \"endless litigation\" that follows every Census moving forward.",
      "They also suggested that the Supreme Court rule that racial gerrymandering claims shouldn't be decided by the courts at all and should instead be left to the political branches. The proposal, which Louisiana officials said \"would be the best outcome for everyone,\" reflects a concurring opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas last year in a redistricting case from South Carolina.",
      "\"Drawing political districts is a task for politicians, not federal judges,\" Thomas wrote. \"There are no judicially manageable standards for resolving claims about districting, and, regardless, the Constitution commits those issues exclusively to the political branches.\"",
      "No other justice joined Thomas' opinion, and his view was not raised during the arguments. But whether any other of the other justices, namely the members of its conservative wing, come out in agreement with Thomas in this case remains an open question.",
      "Sarah Brannon, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said during a call with reporters that if at least four other justices embrace Thomas' position, it would set a bad precedent going forward.",
      "\"It would make it very difficult for civil rights groups, minority voters, to bring claims in the future to raise concerns that state legislatures are using race in a way that is intended not to help Black voters have more opportunities to elect candidates of choice, or voters of color to have opportunities to elect candidates of choice, but to essentially manipulate race in such a way that would deprive voters,\" she said.",
      "On the other side, the group of 12 non-African-American voters argued that the state set a \"racial quota\" of two majority-Black districts out of the state's six House seats.",
      "District 6, they argued in Supreme Court filings, is a \"sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district based on racial stereotypes, racially 'balkanizing' a 250-mile swath of Louisiana, from the far Northwest near Texas, down to [East Baton Rouge] near the Mississippi River's mouth.\"",
      "They also rejected the state's suggestion that the drawing of district lines be solely left to the political branches.",
      "\"The state's 'odious' stereotyping of citizens based on race (even to the 'shame' of many legislators and to Republicans' political detriment) and its tenacious efforts to freeze the gerrymander for the 2024 election show why the political process is insufficient to protect citizens against invidious discrimination,\" the voters said.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 20:17:12 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced Susan Monarez is to be elevated from her role as acting CDC director, after nominee David Weldon was withdrawn earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has decided to pick Susan Monarez to be the new nominee to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making permanent the acting role she has served at the public health agency in recent months.",
      "Monarez would be named in place of Dr. David Weldon, a former Florida congressman whose nomination was withdrawn by the White House earlier this month over concerns that he didn't have the votes to clear the Senate confirmation process.",
      "\"As an incredible mother and dedicated public servant, Dr. Monarez understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future. Americans have lost confidence in the CDC due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement,\" the president\u00a0posted\u00a0on Truth Social, announcing the pick Monday afternoon.",
      "Monarez apparently beat out others who had been seen as contenders for the role, including former obstetrician-gynecologist and Texas congressman Michael Burgess. Weldon had also floated Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo for the role, calling for him to be at the top of Mr. Trump's list to replace him as the nominee.",
      "If confirmed, Monarez would be the first head of the CDC to be voted on by senators, under a change passed by Congress in 2022. Previous directors of the agency were able to take the reins soon after they were picked by the president, without undergoing the confirmation process.",
      "Monarez, who was previously deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, has been serving as the CDC's acting head since January.",
      "She has been viewed as an unconventional pick for the role because previous interim directors have come from within the CDC's career ranks.",
      "Past directors in recent history have also been medical doctors, while Monarez has a PhD. An acting director in the 1980s and 90s was also not a medical doctor, though he was a longtime career CDC official.",
      "According to one federal health official, White House officials have said they are trying to \"get it right\" with their new pick. Another federal official said that Monarez had gotten along well with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, since taking on the role.",
      "Monarez and her aides at the agency were in Washington, D.C., last week for meetings, one federal health official said.",
      "\"CDC needs reform. That's why I launched a Senate Republican CDC working group. I look forward to meeting Dr. Susan Monarez and learning more about her vision for the agency,\" Senator Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate's health committee, said in a statement.",
      "People familiar with Weldon's meetings on Capitol Hill said Republicans had been frustrated with a lack of detailed priorities or familiarity with the agency's workings, as well as an unwillingness to assusage concerns that he would be perceived as anti-vaccine.",
      "Nominees to lead the National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are expected to be confirmed soon, after hearings in recent weeks.",
      "Monarez is likely to face questions over the role she's played in controversial decisions at the agency in recent months, including undermining the independence of the CDC's flagship medical research publication, abruptly delaying a meeting of the outside vaccine advisers and plans to research whether vaccines cause autism \u2014 long after its scientists had debunked the claims.",
      "A range of health threats are now facing the CDC, including a rise in measles cases driven by a record outbreak among undervaccinated communities in Texas and neighboring states.",
      "Like other nominees, Monarez will face questions over whether she agrees with condemnation by health experts of Kennedy's responses to the outbreak, like remarks downplaying the virus and inflating the risks posed by the measles vaccine. Kennedy has also faced criticism over his comments about how to handle other viruses, like the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "Monarez has also been involved in decisions over steep cuts to the agency's workforce expected in the coming days, which some managers expect could result in losing up to 30% of the CDC's staff.",

    "summary": "\"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" a judge told a government lawyer Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An appeals court judge said Monday that Nazis were treated better under the Alien Enemies Act than Venezuelan migrants removed from the U.S. and flown to El Salvador earlier this month.",
      "\"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" Judge Patricia Millett said, admonishing the Justice Department during oral arguments.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" said Drew Ensign, the government's attorney",
      "Millett noted that during World War II, Nazis were put before hearing boards under Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and the Trump administration has conceded the alleged Tren de Aragua gang members deported to El Salvador and detained in a maximum security prison did not have the chance to appear in court.",
      "The judge said the question at hand wasn't the use of the act, but rather, the right of detainees to have due process and challenge their status as accused members of the gang.",
      "Millett, appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama, said migrants may continue to be detained under the Alien Enemies Act, but they may not be deported until there is a decision on a preliminary injunction to stop the removals.",
      "\"No president has ever used this statute this way,\" Millett said. The Alien Enemies Act has only been invoked three other times \u2014 during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. It has never been used when the U.S. was not at war. She raised concerns about the act's implementation by government employees who may have removed people to El Salvador who were not Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Judge Justin Walker asked Ensign whether individual hearings were required before deportations, as D.C. District Chief Judge James Boasberg had written in his order Monday.",
      "Ensign responded, \"I agree with part of that.\" Walker, a Trump nominee, pressed him on how that would work.",
      "\"There are some individualized Habeas hearings being heard in Texas,\" Walker said. He asked, \"If they can bring a habeas petition and say they're not a member of [Tren de Aragua] \u2026 how would they bring that habeas claim?\"",
      "Millett, too, asked Ensign about the men who were deported to El Salvador as gang members: \"Were people on planes last weekend given the ability to file habeas?\"",
      "The government responded that yes, the five plaintiffs were able to appear in court. But the plaintiffs were not on the deportation flights that are at the center of the case, and they remain in custody in Texas.",
      "Ensign said he did not know how many migrants are being held in the U.S. under the AEA and said those who are currently held are being detained under Title 8 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Ensign argued habeas petitions to appeal detention could be filed on behalf of this class in Texas.",
      "\"When were they given notice that they were being detained as part of [Tren de Aragua]\" and how much notice was given before they were put on the plane, Millett asked.",
      "Ensign said the answers were not in the record. He told the appeals panel, \"We've agreed challenges to individual determinations can be brought.\"",
      "But Millett pressed him further, asking whether \"the government considers itself within its right to pack every member of this class on an airplane before there is a reasonable amount of time to file a habeas petition?\" Ensign did not respond immediately, but later said the statute does not require such notice \u2014 notice, that is, that they were being detained as Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorney Lee Gelernt of the ACLU claimed, \"There was no process,\" and migrants \"were designated [Tren de Aragua] without any advance notice and rushed onto planes.\" He said he would soon submit declarations reflecting this.",
      "The government also made the case before the appeals panel that it should be moved to another venue and that the president's decision to invoke the AEA was not reviewable.",
      "Ensign said the lower court's order blocking the Trump administration from deporting alleged Tren de Aragua gang members under the act represented an \"enormous intrusion\" into presidential power.",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg on Monday rejected the government's motion to rescind his order regarding the administration's use of the AEA for deportations. He found the plaintiffs were likely to win on the merits of the case because they're entitled to due process and individual hearings.",
      "He also expressed doubt that Mr. Trump's use of the act for these deportations is lawful, writing, \"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion.'\"",
      "Judge Walker appeared to take the government's side about the venue where the case was brought, pointing out that the complaint, which is being heard in Washington, D.C., could have been filed in Texas, where the five original plaintiffs are in custody.",
      "Gelernt conceded the point, but argued \"this has all been done in secret,\" and it would not have enabled hearings to be held on an individual basis for all those accused of being gang members. The government has not released the names of the 238 men deported on two flights to El Salvador who are now being held in a maximum security terrorism prison, although CBS News reported their names last week.",
      "\"Absent a class [temporary restraining order], we would have had far more people sitting in a Salvadoran prison,\" Gelernt said.",
      "\"I think that's a tough precedent for you,\" Walker told Gelernt, because no suit was being brought in Texas, where the defendants were being held.",
      "\"No class member is seeking release,\" Gelernt responded. \"The government is using the act to try and short-circuit immigration proceedings.\"",
      "\"We are absolutely not trying to get anybody out of detention,\" Gelernt added.",
      "\"Can you \u2014 standing here \u2014 give us an example of a district court injunction that enjoined a national security operation that survived appeal?\" Walker asked.",
      "\"The implications of not giving people a chance to contest it are extraordinary,\" Gelernt replied.",
      "\"Many \u2014 if not most \u2014 of the people removed had no connection to the gang,\" Gelernt said, asking that Judge Boasberg be allowed to continue his work.

    "story": [
      "The arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder and former Columbia University student involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024, has raised questions about the rights of permanent residents in the United States.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil, a lawful U.S. resident married to an American citizen, in New York on March 8. He is currently being held in Louisiana.",
      "Khalil is not facing criminal charges. The Trump administration initially argued it could deport him on foreign policy grounds and later accused him of immigration fraud.",
      "Here's what to know about the rights of green card holders:",
      "What is a green card?",
      "A green card, or a Permanent Resident Card, allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the United States. Individuals can be eligible for a green card through family, employment, refugee status and other reasons.",
      "Most green cards are valid for 10 years and then need to be renewed, similar to how U.S. citizens need to renew their passports, explained David Leopold, an immigration law expert and partner at UB Greensfelder.",
      "\"The card expires, but the residency doesn't expire,\" he said, adding if a card is \"not renewed, there could be ramifications because you have to maintain the registration, but the status itself never expires assuming the person complies with the law.\"",
      "How can a green card be revoked?",
      "There are a number of reasons why an individual could lose their green card and be deported.",
      "\"Any green card holder can be subject to deportation depending on the situation,\" Leopold said.",
      "Most cases occur because a green card holder commits a crime, including violent crimes, marriage fraud, controlled substance abuse and other offenses. If they are convicted, typically after they serve their sentence in the U.S., they would face removal proceedings that involve going before an immigration judge, Leopold said.",
      "A person can also lose their permanent resident status because of \"substantiated charges of immigration fraud in the immigration process,\" Elora Mukherjee, a Columbia Law School professor and director of the university's Immigrants' Rights Clinic, said.",
      "Mukherjee said people whose green cards are being revoked are typically given a notice to appear before an immigration judge.",
      "\"They have the opportunity to either contest why they should be allowed to keep their status or concede that their status can be taken away,\" she said. \"Lawful permanent residents can't be stripped of their status in the United States without any due process.\"",
      "The severity of the crime may affect the judge's decision. In cases of violent crimes, \"deportation becomes nearly automatic,\" Leopold said. In some cases, an individual may be able to ask a judge to cancel their deportation. The judge would have to decide whether the person's conviction is outweighed by other considerations, such as community ties, family ties or their work in the U.S., he explained, but added, \"that doesn't apply to every case.\"",
      "The procedure for how a green card holder's status could be revoked is set by the Immigration and Nationality Act, Mukherjee said.",
      "Under the act, green card holders do not need to be convicted of a crime to be deported, Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School, told The Associated Press. For example, if there are reasonable grounds to believe they engaged in, or are likely to engage in, terrorist activities, they could be deported, she said.",
      "Another reason a green card holder could lose their status is if they leave the United States for too long.",
      "\"Typically if they stay out of the United States for more than a year,\" their status will be challenged when they come back, Leopold said.",
      "Green card vs. citizenship",
      "A green card holder is not a citizen. To become a naturalized citizen, they would need to apply and meet various requirements.",
      "Do green card holders have the same rights as U.S. citizens?",
      "Everyone in the United States is protected by the U.S. Constitution. This includes green card holders, visa holders and undocumented immigrants.",
      "But, unlike citizens, green card holders are susceptible to being removed if they violate their status in the U.S., Leopold said.",
      "What is the Immigration and Nationality Act?",
      "The Immigration and Nationality Act is a set of immigration law provisions enacted in 1952.",
      "The act includes numerous grounds for deportation, including a provision that says a non-citizen \"whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Monday asked the Supreme Court to pause a lower court decision that required six agencies to reinstate more than 16,000 federal probationary workers who were terminated.",
      "The request for emergency relief from the Justice Department is the latest intervention the administration is seeking from the Supreme Court as it faces more than 100 lawsuits challenging President Trump's policies. Already pending before the justices is a request to narrow injunctions that blocked implementation of Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship. A decision on that request isn't expected until early next month.",
      "The latest bid from the Trump administration arose out of U.S. District Judge William Alsup's order earlier this month that required six agencies \u2014 the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury \u2014 to reinstate probationary workers who were fired last month.",
      "In the challenge brought by a group of labor unions and nonprofit groups, the judge said the terminations were likely unlawful because the Office of Personnel Management did not have the authority to direct the firings.",
      "But in the request to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote that the court's preliminary injunction let third parties \"hijack the employment relationship between the federal government and its workforce.\"",
      "\"And, like many other recent orders, the court's extraordinary reinstatement order violates the separation of powers, arrogating to a single district court the Executive Branch's powers of personnel management on the flimsiest of grounds and the hastiest of timelines,\" she wrote. \"That is no way to run a government.\"",
      "Alsup's order covers roughly 16,000 federal workers who were still in probationary status, or those generally in a one- or two-year trial period. A federal appeals court declined the Trump administration's request to halt the decision, leading the Justice Department to ask the Supreme Court for relief.",
      "\"This court should not allow a single district court to erase Congress's handiwork and seize control over reviewing federal personnel decisions \u2014 much less to do so by vastly exceeding the limits on the scope of its equitable authority and ordering reinstatements en masse,\" Harris wrote.",
      "The Trump administration argued that the district court's order forces the government to embark on a \"massive administrative undertaking\" to reinstate and onboard thousands of fired employees in just a few days.",
      "The firings of probationary workers came as part of Mr. Trump's broad initiative to shrink the size of the federal government, an effort that is being undertaken by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "More than 24,000 probationary workers were removed from their positions as part of the mass firings, the Justice Department revealed in a court filings submitted in a separate case challenging the terminations, which was brought in Maryland and involves 18 agencies.",
      "The judge overseeing that case also temporarily blocked the mass firings and ordered the affected federal workers at the agencies to be reinstated.",
      "As the legal challenges to Mr. Trump's second-term agenda make their way through the federal courts, the president and his Republican allies have launched attacks on district court judges who have issued temporary orders blocking enforcement of the policies while proceedings move forward.",
      "Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, a senior White House adviser, have repeatedly called for some of the judges to be impeached, though it's unlikely any effort to remove them would be successful. But the president and GOP lawmakers have also condemned the relief the judges are issuing, and particularly the fact that they apply nationwide.",
      "In Supreme Court filings in the case involving Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship executive order, Harris urged the justices to rein in the use of nationwide injunctions.",
      "\"Government-by-universal-injunction has persisted long enough, and has reached a fever pitch in recent weeks,\" she wrote. \"It is long past time to restore district courts to their 'proper \u2014 and properly limited \u2014 role \u2026 in a democratic society.'\"",
      "Harris reiterated that request Monday in the dispute over the mass firings of federal workers, urging the high court to \"end the interbranch power grab.\"",
      "\"Those orders have sown chaos as the Executive Branch scrambles to meet immediate compliance deadlines by sending huge sums of government money out the door, reinstating thousands of lawfully terminated workers, undoing steps to restructure Executive Branch agencies, and more,\" she wrote. \"The lower courts should not be allowed to transform themselves into all-purpose overseers of Executive Branch hiring, firing, contracting, and policymaking.\"",

      "O'Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0dissolved the Kennedy Center's board of directors and named himself chairman. The new board includes\u00a0political allies like White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, longtime senior Trump aide Dan Scavino, second lady Usha Vance and Fox News host Laura Ingraham.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 as well as Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \"worried about what the future might bring.\"",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\"Twain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\" O'Brien said. \"Twain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\"",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young's \"Rockin in the Free World.\"",

      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \"the Roy Cohn Pavilion\" after one of Trump's mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Mr. Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted\u00a0on his Truth Social social media platform that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Conan O'Brien's comedy honored",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has rarely been particularly political.",
      "The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times.",
      "In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O'Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \"Late Night\" despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons,\" appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \"SNL\" skits.",
      "He went on to host \"Late Night\" for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show,\" but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \"The Tonight Show\" back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows.",
      "He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \"Conan O'Brien Must Go,\" drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \"Hamilton\" and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \"All You Fascists Bound to Lose.\"",

      "As lawmakers left Washington following many weeks in session, a recess that Democrats initially hoped would be marked by a show of force against the Trump administration and Republican control of Washington was punctuated by handwringing over the party's direction \u2014 and questions about its leadership.",
      "Democrats remained mum as they left Washington in the aftermath of the tense funding fight. And at town halls from Colorado to California, Democrats sidestepped questions about Schumer's decision and his leadership of the upper chamber more broadly, previewing a messy return to Washington as the party contends with its divisions.",
      "Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, dodged a question about Schumer being replaced as leader last week, before pivoting to former President Joe Biden and urging that \"it's important for people to know, you know, when it's time to go.\"",
      "\"We're going to have conversations I'm sure in the foreseeable future about all the Democratic leadership,\" Bennet said at a town hall in Golden, Colorado.",
      "Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland became the first Democratic lawmaker to openly call for new Senate leadership at a town hall last week, saying that though he respects Schumer and his long tenure in Washington, \"it may be time for the Senate Democrats to pick new leadership as we move forward.\" Rep. Delia Ramirez followed suit at a town hall in Chicago last week. And progressive youth groups joined in on the criticism, urging Schumer in a letter obtained by CBS News to \"fight for us or step aside.\"",
      "Still, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who initially opted not to comment when asked whether he was confident in Schumer's leadership, weighed in with support for Schumer last week. And Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi echoed the confidence in Schumer's leadership, though she delivered a stinging rebuke.",
      "\"I myself don't give away anything for nothing,\" Pelosi said. \"And I think that's what happened the other day.\"",
      "Schumer had initially signaled that his caucus would fight back against a partisan measure to keep the government funded after the House passed the measure in a narrow vote that came as a surprise to some. But a day later, Schumer reluctantly pledged to advance the continuing resolution, delivering one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the measure to passage.",
      "The New York Democrat has stood by his decision, while arguing that he remains the \"best leader for the Senate.\" He told \"CBS Mornings\" last week that as bad as the founding bill was, \"a shutdown is 10 times worse.\" On Sunday, he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he's not stepping down.",
      "The backlash against Schumer has come as Democrats contend with the party's direction and approach more broadly after the 2024 elections delivered bruising defeats up and down the ballot.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, shifted the blame away from Schumer, saying on CNN last week that although \"no one is in the caucus\" is more critical of the minority leader than he is, \"it's not Schumer\u2026 it's the Democratic party.\"",
      "Later in the week, Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez held a rally in Las Vegas. In an interview with CBS News at the rally, the Vermont independent said the \"Democratic party has not been the kind of party we need to represent the working class of this country in so many ways.\"",
      "\"There is no reason why we have massive income and wealth inequality, why we're the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people,\" Sanders added.",
      "Across a number of town halls last week, constituents turned the focus from possible threats to Medicaid under GOP control of Washington to criticism of the Democratic Party itself.",
      "During a town hall held by Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego in Arizona last week, one constituent questioned the party's overall messaging strategy, suggesting they should get \"dirtier\" with their approach against Republicans.",
      "\"They fight dirtier and we are not willing to get in the mud with them,\" the constituent said. \"Maybe it's time we start getting a little bit dirtier with our messaging.\"",

      "Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro suspended flights on March 8, after the U.S. Treasury Department announced the withdrawal of Chevron's license to export Venezuelan oil.",
      "\"We have agreed with the U.S. government to resume the repatriation of Venezuelan migrants with an initial flight tomorrow, Sunday,\" said Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, president of Venezuela's Assembly and Maduro's chief negotiator with the U.S.",
      "Venezuela accepted the deal to guarantee the \"the return of our compatriots to their nation with the safeguard of their Human Rights,\" Rodr\u00edguez said.",
      "In his statement, Rodr\u00edguez referred to the deportation by President Trump's government of several hundred Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador.",
      "\"Migrating is not a crime and we will not rest until we achieve the return of all those who require it and until we rescue our brothers kidnapped in El Salvador,\" Rodr\u00edguez said.",
      "U.S. officials confirmed Sunday night the first flight had arrived in Venezuela, saying it carried 199 people, including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The officials did not specify how many were alleged Tren de Aragua members or how their affiliations were determined.",
      "Maduro ratified the measure during a public event later in the day. \"We are resuming flights to rescue and release migrants from U.S. prisons,\" Maduro said.",
      "The Venezuelan leader also said that he held the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, responsible for the well-being of the Venezuelans deported to that country.",
      "\"You guarantee their health and, sooner rather than later, you have to hand them over and release them, because they are kidnapped,\" Maduro said.",
      "Mr. Trump alleged the deportees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. He labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on March 15 when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any non-citizen during wartime. A federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations, but flights were in the air when the ruling came down.",
      "Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. Department of State designated a foreign terrorist organization, originated in a prison in the South American country. Members accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade.",
      "The Trump administration has not provided evidence that the deportees are members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crime in the U.S.",
      "CBS News obtained a list of the names of the 238 Venezuelan men who were deported to El Salvador last weekend aboard those three flights. U.S. officials have said 137 of them were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.",
      "Documents obtained by CBS News showed that at least one of the men deported, a 26-year-old barber from Venezuela, has no criminal record in the U.S., and Venezuelan officials said he has no record there either.",
      "Maduro's government has mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. Those deportations have sharply picked up since Trump took office on Jan. 20.",
      "In recent weeks, some 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",
      "The Trump administration said that the Venezuelans sent to Guantanamo are members of Tren de Aragua, but offered little evidence to back this up.",

      "And now scientists are getting a little closer to understanding how it behaves. The big question is whether this dark energy is a constant force, an idea first introduced by Albert Einstein in his theory of relativity, or whether the force is weakening, a surprising wrinkle tentatively proposed last year.",
      "Results presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society Wednesday bolster the case that the force is weakening, though scientists are not yet certain and they still haven't worked out what this means for the rest of their understanding of the universe.",
      "The updated findings come from an international research collaboration that is creating a three-dimensional map to see how galaxies have spread and clustered over 11 billion years of the universe's history. Carefully tracking how galaxies move helps scientists learn about the forces that are moving them around.",

      "The National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees in February 2025 warning them of vulnerabilities in using the encrypted messaging application Signal, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "News of the NSA bulletin comes amid the continued fallout from an explosive article published Monday in The Atlantic. The publication's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, detailed how Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth inadvertently disclosed war plans to him in an encrypted Signal chat group two hours before the U.S. military launched attacks against Houthi militia in Yemen. Goldberg wrote that Hegseth's messages included \"precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\"",
      "The NSA is an arm of the Defense Department and specializes in signals intelligence \u2014 which is derived from electronic transmissions \u2014 and cybersecurity. The agency is responsible for monitoring, collecting and processing information and data for U.S. national security interests.",
      "The unclassified but for-official-use-only documents provided to CBS News by a senior U.S. intelligence official are entitled \"Signal Vulnerability\" and were sent out the month before Goldberg was accidentally added to the group chat allegedly by national security adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin begins.",
      "The bulletin warned of Russian professional hacking groups employing phishing scams to gain access to encrypted conversations, bypassing the end-to-end encryption the application uses.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and Whatsapp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",

      "On Tuesday, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, both of whom were reportedly in the Signal group chat, testified before a Senate panel.",
      "\"There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat,\" Gabbard told lawmakers. But the NSA bulletin advises that even information that is not categorized as classified should not be shared on Signal, advising users not to share \"unclassified, nonpublic\" information on the messaging platform.",
      "Ratcliffe said Signal \"is a permissible use\" application that has been approved by the White House for use by senior officials. The group chat, Ratcliffe said, was a \"mechanism for communicating between senior level officials but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications.\"",
      "Both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were asked by Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico whether the Signal conversation included information on \"weapons packages, targets or timing.\" Ratcliffe replied, \"Not that I'm aware of,\" and Gabbard said, \"Same answer and defer to the Department of Defense on that question.\" Both said they had no knowledge of the chat including operational details of the strike in Yemen.",

      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors.

      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked.",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",

      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",

      "The National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees in February 2025 warning them of vulnerabilities in using the encrypted messaging application Signal, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "News of the NSA bulletin comes amid the continued fallout from an explosive article published Monday in The Atlantic. The publication's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, detailed how Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth inadvertently disclosed war plans to him in an encrypted Signal chat group two hours before the U.S. military launched attacks against Houthi militia in Yemen. Goldberg wrote that Hegseth's messages included \"precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\"",
      "The NSA is an arm of the Defense Department and specializes in signals intelligence \u2014 which is derived from electronic transmissions \u2014 and cybersecurity. The agency is responsible for monitoring, collecting and processing information and data for U.S. national security interests.",
      "The unclassified but for-official-use-only documents provided to CBS News by a senior U.S. intelligence official are entitled \"Signal Vulnerability\" and were sent out the month before Goldberg was accidentally added to the group chat allegedly by national security adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin begins.",
      "The bulletin warned of Russian professional hacking groups employing phishing scams to gain access to encrypted conversations, bypassing the end-to-end encryption the application uses.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and Whatsapp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",
      "CBS News contacted the NSA for comment but did not receive a reply prior to publication.",
      "On Tuesday, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, both of whom were reportedly in the Signal group chat, testified before a Senate panel.",
      "\"There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat,\" Gabbard told lawmakers. But the NSA bulletin advises that even information that is not categorized as classified should not be shared on Signal, advising users not to share \"unclassified, nonpublic\" information on the messaging platform.",
      "Ratcliffe said Signal \"is a permissible use\" application that has been approved by the White House for use by senior officials. The group chat, Ratcliffe said, was a \"mechanism for communicating between senior level officials but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications.\"",
      "Both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were asked by Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico whether the Signal conversation included information on \"weapons packages, targets or timing.\" Ratcliffe replied, \"Not that I'm aware of,\" and Gabbard said, \"Same answer and defer to the Department of Defense on that question.\" Both said they had no knowledge of the chat including operational details of the strike in Yemen.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate Finance Committee voted on Tuesday to advance the nomination of Dr. Mehmet Oz, the former heart surgeon and television host, to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Trump.",
      "The panel voted 14 to 13 along party lines to advance Oz's nomination, which now heads to the full Senate.",
      "Oz appeared before the committee\u00a0earlier this month. If confirmed, the 64-year-old would oversee the nearly $1.5 trillion the federal government spends on Medicare and Medicaid \u2014 health insurance programs that make up a large amount of the budget and have often been wielded as political cudgels.",
      "Oz has widespread name recognition as the host of \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" and previously worked as a professor of cardiac surgery at Columbia University. After the show stopped taping in 2022, Oz ran for the open Senate seat in Pennsylvania, where he was defeated by now-Sen. John Fetterman.",
      "The former television host has touted meetings with key Republican senators on his path to confirmation, some of whom praised him during his confirmation hearing earlier this month. The committee's chairman, Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, voiced his support for Oz ahead of the vote Tuesday, saying he has \"years of experience as an acclaimed physician and public health advocate.\" Crapo added that the background makes Oz \"uniquely qualified\" for the role, while urging the panel to advance the nomination.",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats criticized Oz during the hearing, alleging that he had dodged taxes. The criticism added to earlier critiques among Democrats of his views toward abortion and concerns about conflicts of interests. Oz has pledged to resign from positions he holds at companies, including a drugmaker and supplement company, while divesting from healthcare companies as part of his ethics agreement.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the committee, argued ahead of the vote Tuesday that given the chance to \"assure the American people that he would not be a a rubber stamp for Republican plans to gut Medicaid and hike Affordable Care Act premiums\" during Oz's confirmation hearing, \"at every turn he failed the test.\" Wyden encouraged his colleagues to oppose the nomination, claiming that Oz has shown no ability or interest in \"pushing back on the dangerous Trump healthcare agenda.\"",
      "The vote comes as the Finance Committee voted narrowly to advance Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s nomination as Health and Human Services secretary in February. Kennedy would serve as Oz's supervisor if he's confirmed.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own report for The Atlantic.",
      "The National Security Council told CBS News on Monday that the group chat \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, or whether he had the device with him in Russia, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report on Tuesday, saying on X that no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday for a pre-planned hearing on worldwide security threats. Ratcliffe acknowledged on Tuesday that he was part of the chat.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin. The White House did not immediately reply to CBS News' questions about the meeting or whether Witkoff had his device at the Kremlin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however, and the Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

    "summary": "Masih Alinejad, a prominent critic of the regime, is a leader of the movement to free Iranian women from the compulsory hijab and has drawn the ire of Iran's Supreme Leader.",
    "story": [
      "Masih Alinejad, a journalist and prominent critic of the Iranian regime, was in the garden of her Brooklyn home when she locked eyes with the hitman hired to assassinate her. It was late July, and she had gone into her garden to pick vegetables.",
      "\"He was gigantic,\" she later testified in federal district court in Manhattan at the trial of the men who plotted to kill her. \"He was in the sunflowers staring into my eyes.\"",
      "Though she eyed him with some suspicion, she also thought he might be taking pictures of her garden of \"beautiful sunflowers.\"",
      "\"Every curse that I hear, I plant a flower,\" she explained, referring to threats she's endured for criticizing the Islamic Republic. \"That's why I have a massive garden. A lot of cursing and threats.\"",
      "The man in her garden, Khalid Mehdiyev, had been directed to kill Alinejad by fellow members of a Russian mob organization known as Thieves-in-Law, Rafat Amirov and Polad Omarov, prosecutors said. In his car was an AK-47 style assault rifle and 66 rounds of ammunition. Prosecutors said that Iran's government had offered Amirov and Omarov a $500,000 bounty.",
      "On July 28, 2022, this murder-for-hire scheme involving Russian mobsters and the Iranian regime targeting a defiant dissident was foiled in Brooklyn. Alinejad, who has wild curls and often wears a white flower in her hair, is also an activist and leader of the movement to free Iran's women from the compulsory hijab.",
      "This was only one of the Iranian regime's several attempts to assassinate or kidnap Alinejad. One alleged assassination planner targeted not just Alinejad, but also President Trump during his 2024 campaign last fall. Farhad Shakeri is accused of being an \"asset\" of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) who was tasked with devising a plan to kill Mr. Trump and recruiting two men to \"silence and kill, on U.S. soil, an American journalist,\" according to the indictment.",
      "While it was not the first attempt on her life, Amirov and Omarov were the first attempted assassins to go to trial in New York last week in a criminal case that provided a rare look into Iran's assassination attempts on U.S. soil. Prosecutors said high-ranking members of the IRGC were instructing Amirov and Omarov in the scheme. FBI agents detailed their analysis of devices and internet search histories tying Iranian intelligence officers to the plot. Through photographs, videos and messages, they illustrated the global network behind the attempted murder, with Medhiyev reporting his surveillance progress to Omarov and Amirov as he updated them from Brooklyn.",
      "\"We blocked it from both sides, it will be a show once she steps out of the house,\" messaged Medhiyev to Omarov, who then forwarded it to Amirov. \"God willing,\" he replied. In another plan, Medhiyev went to ask Alinejad for flowers from her garden, but she did not come to the door. Her Ring camera surveillance at one point showed him pacing back and forth on her porch before trying to open the door. Medhiyev was later stopped by police, who found the rifle and bullets in the backseat of his car.",
      "Last week, a federal jury found Omarov and Amirov guilty on all charges, including murder-for-hire and attempted murder in aid of racketeering. They face over 50 years in prison.",
      "\"I am being bombarded with emotion,\" Alinejad told CBS News over the phone shortly after the verdict, sounding tearful. \"I just need to cry now, I need to laugh, I need to dance. I just got the news now.\"",
      "\"The real masterminds of this crime are still in power in Iran,\" she said. \"I am waiting for the day when Ali Khamenei and his terrorist Revolutionary Guards face justice, I want them to be punished.\"",
      "Despite the attempts on her life, Alinejad said she will not be silenced in her fight against the Islamic Republic.",
      "\"She has a mission,\" her husband Kambiz Foroohar told CBS News. \"And that mission is that the Islamic Republic is like ISIS. It's an evil regime. She feels like she's compelled to challenge it. Compulsory hijab is just one way of challenging the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "\"Next: Masih Alinejad\"",
      "In Iran, Alinejad struggled to keep her wild curls hidden under a hijab.",
      "\"I have a lot of hair. It was not easy,\" she testified in court.",
      "She was a political journalist there for over a decade but admitted she was always crossing the \"red lines\" of what Iran's government would allow people to write about. In 2009, she fled Iran.",
      "\"I'm a journalist, so I couldn't just keep quiet,\" she said. \"I had no option but to leave Iran.\"",
      "Once in the United States, she took off her hijab. She posted a photo of herself jumping in the air on social media, reveling in the feeling of the wind in her hair. In Iran, she \"felt like a hostage.\"",
      "That was the beginning of her campaign against the compulsory hijab, which evolved into the White Wednesday movement. Every Wednesday, women in Iran would film videos of themselves walking unveiled, a peaceful protest against compulsion.",
      "\"Social media is like my weapon,\" Alinejad testified. \"My social media expos\u00e9.\"",
      "The Iranian regime reacted by calling her and unveiled women \"prostitutes,\" she said. They arrested hundreds of women.",
      "Iran's Revolutionary Court has threatened women with up to 10 years in prison for sharing protest videos with her. \"It's become a crime,\" she said, her voice cracking.",
      "The government has also accused Alinejad of being a foreign agent. \"Oh, all of them,\" she testified listing intelligence agencies: \"Agent of the CIA, agent of Mossad, Agent of MI6, agent of President Trump.\"",
      "In court, Alinejad broke down when the prosecution displayed a cartoon published in Iran's state-controlled newspaper depicting two dissidents hanging in the air and an image of Alinejad looking up at them fearfully. Both men, who held citizenship in Europe (one also had a U.S. green card) were kidnapped and executed by the Iranian regime. She testified in court that the caption read: \"Next: Masih Alinejad.\"",
      "\"Did you understand that to be about you?\" the prosecutor asked.",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied tearfully.",
      "By proxy, Alinejad's family in Iran has also become a target. In 2018, Iranian government officials tried to coerce relatives to lure her to Turkey, where they planned to capture her, offering a payment in exchange. The relatives did not accept.",
      "In 2019, her brother was arrested on charges of associating with her. He was sentenced to eight years in prison but released after two years.",
      "\"They can't reach her. They can reach her family.\" said Foroohar. \"So that's always a big concern. But the family is also brave. They're enduring it.\"",
      "In July 2021, four Iranian intelligence officials were charged with a kidnapping conspiracy \u2013 for developing plans to kidnap Alinejad and bring her back to Iran. They allegedly explored slipping her out of the U.S. by travel routes from Alinejad's home to the waterfront in Brooklyn, a maritime evacuation route involving speed boats, and maritime travel from New York to Venezuela, according to the indictment. The conspirators live in Iran, where they remain at large.",
      "The assassination attempts",
      "It is \"chilling\" how close Mehdiyev came to carrying out the plan to kill his wife, said Faroohar.",
      "Medhiyev testified at trial about seeing Alinejad on the porch as he walked by her home, but his gun was in the car. By the time he went back for it, she had left.",
      "\"I was there to try to kill the journalist,\" he admitted.",
      "Medhiyev was a key witness for the prosecution, but the defense tried to undermine his credibility, dubbing him the \"pizza delivery hitman\" after Medhiyev admitted on the stand that he had once planned a kidnapping while working at a pizza shop.",
      "\"As you're coordinating an international kidnapping you're also working at a pizza shop?\" asked Omarov's defense attorney, Elena Fast. \"That's correct,\" he replied.",
      "On the day of his arrest, Mehdiyev had approached the door of Alinejad's home. At the time she was on a Zoom call with Venezuelan dissident Leopoldo Lopez and Russian chess player Garry Kasparov. She heard someone on the porch but did not go downstairs.",
      "\"She said, 'I don't know who that is but this call is more important,'\" Lopez recounted over Whatsapp.",
      "\"It was the Zoom call that saved her life,\" he said.",
      "Earlier, Medhiyev had sent Omarov a video of him opening a suitcase in the back of his car with an AK-47 style rifle inside. A caption read, \"we are ready.\" Amirov replied, \"keep the car clean.\"",
      "Police arrested Mehdiyev nearby that day after he ran a stop sign. In the back of his car, they discovered the AK-47 style assault rifle and 66 rounds of ammunition.",
      "Foroohar received a call at work from the FBI asking to \"whisk me away to a safe location.\" He and Alinejad were later told that a man with an AK-47 had been arrested outside their home.",
      "\"It's quite stressful. It's quite scary,\" admitted Foroohar, when asked what it felt like to live under threat. \"At the same time if you think about it too much, you are just paralyzed. So you compartmentalize.\"",
      "\"It's not easy. Sometimes you look over your shoulder,\" he added. \"Sometimes you just learn how to trust.\"",
      "Alinejad and her husband have lived in so many safe houses that they lost track. She has only been back to their Brooklyn home once to make sure the neighbors are watering her garden.",
      "In 2024, it was under surveillance again.",
      "On Nov. 7, Shakeri \u2014 the man assigned to assassinate both Mr. Trump and Alinejad \u2014\u00a0along with Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt were indicted for their alleged involvement in a second murder-for-hire plot on Alinejad's life. Rivera and Loadholt are accused of surveilling her Brooklyn home for months, with the intent to locate and kill her. The Justice Department charged Shakeri with directing \"a network of criminal associates to further Iran's assassination plots against its targets.\"",
      "\"It was very shocking and surprising,\" said Foroohar. \"We thought the whole thing was over and done with. And we don't know when the next one is. We had a conversation with members of the Biden administration, and they said, you better get used to this because Iran is very determined to get rid of Masih, and they're not going to give up.\""

    "story": [
      "President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration (SSA), Frank Bisignano, vowed to crack down on fraud and to protect Americans' personal data in a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday. He also dismissed suggestions that he supports privatizing a federal agency that provides retirement, disability and other benefits to more than 70 million Americans.",
      "Like other government agencies, the SSA has been targeted for major job cuts by Elon Musk's\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency\u00a0(DOGE), a reduction in force that former agency officials and other experts warn could greatly hinder the delivery of services to Social Security recipients.",
      "In February, the SSA\u00a0announced\u00a0it would slash 7,000 of its 57,000 workers. Former SSA Commissioner Martin O'Malley, who led the agency under the Biden administration from December 2023 to November 2024, expects the actual number to be\u00a0closer to 10,000 workers.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Even before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0the nomination of Bisignano, CEO of financial technology company Fiserv, calling him a business leader \"with a tremendous track record of transforming large corporations.\" In a social media post, Mr. Trump highlighted Bisignano's \"long career leading financial services institutions through great transformation.\"",
      "Bisignano has served as Fiserv's chief executive since July 2020, and the company has seen strong growth during his tenure. Fiserv's stock price, which was around $100 when Bisignano took the helm, has more than doubled since then. The company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Previously, Bisignano led Fiserv's 2019 merger with First Data Corp., where he\u00a0had been\u00a0chairman and CEO since 2013. He is credited in his bio with turning the payment processor into a \"technology innovator.\"",
      "Prior to leading First Data, Bisignano had a career on Wall Street as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What are potential concerns about Bisignano leading SSA?",
      "In a\u00a0March 23 letter\u00a0to Bisignano, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden \u2014 both members of the Senate panel that will consider his nomination \u2014 expressed concern about the\u00a0ongoing cost-cutting efforts at the agency.",
      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",
      "\"Already, financial services firms are salivating at the possibility of profiting off of Americans' hard-earned retirement benefits,\" the lawmakers said in their letter. \"Even your own payment firm, Fiserv \u2014 which 'enables money movement for thousands of financial institutions and millions of people' \u2014 could theoretically benefit form a privatization of Social Security.\"",
      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen.

      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA. Still, we are concerned about whether he's truly ready to handle the complexities of such an important public service,\" The Senior Citizens League (TSCL), a nonprofit that advocates for benefits recipients, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Will he fully understand the struggles of many Social Security recipients or connect with their challenges? That remains to be seen,\" TSCL Executive Director Shannon Benton said. \"The key issue is finding the right balance between introducing new ideas and protecting Social Security as an essential public program.\"",
      "After Bisignano was nominated in December, the Alliance for Retired Americans, an advocacy organization founded by the AFL-CIO, also raised questions about his lack of experience dealing with social services for seniors and disabled people.",
      "\"Nothing in Mr. Bisignano's career suggests that he understands the unique needs of older and disabled Americans.

Asylees are foreigners in the U.S. who are granted protection by immigration judges or asylum officers. Both populations have to prove they could face persecution because of certain characteristics, such as their political views, race or religion.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted both congressionally enacted programs, suspending the refugee process and closing the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border through executive orders that are currently facing federal court challenges.",
      "In a statement, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed CBS News' reporting, saying the green card processing pause is needed to comply with two executive actions issued by President Trump, including one that questioned immigration vetting procedures under the Biden administration.",
      "\"USCIS is placing a temporary pause on finalizing certain Adjustment of Status applications pending the completion of additional screening and vetting to identify potential fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, in alignment\" with Mr. Trump's executive actions, DHS said in the statement. \"Adjustment of status\" is the official name of the green card process.",
      "In one of the presidential proclamations cited by officials, Mr. Trump instructed federal agencies to \"vet and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who intend to be admitted, enter, or are already inside the United States.\"",
      "The other executive order cited by officials paved the way for the State Department to designate Mexican cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations.",

      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

      "Typically, peak bloom occurs between the last week of March and the first week of April, according to the park service, which notes that forecasting the peak is impossible to do more than 10 days ahead of time. The average peak bloom date falls on April 3, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, which similarly advises that the exact timing varies from year to year because warmer temperatures can encourage an earlier bloom.",
      "Peak bloom is expected to happen sooner than the average date in 2025, with the park service estimating it will occur at some point between this Friday, March 28, and next Monday, March 31. The Yoshino trees usually bloom over the course of multiple days.",

      "The Trump administration invoked a state secrets privilege Monday and refused to give a federal judge any additional information about the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador under war authorities.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is weighing whether the government defied his order to turn around planes carrying migrants after he blocked deportations of people alleged to be gang members without due process. It's a case that has become a flashpoint in the rising tension between the administration and the federal courts.",
      "Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has asked for details about when the planes landed and who was on board, information that the Trump administration asserts would harm \"diplomatic and national security concerns.\"",

      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Millett is one of three appellate judges who will decide whether to lift a March 15 order temporarily prohibiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. They didn't rule from the bench Monday.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, who also sits on the appeals court, appeared open to the administration's argument that the migrants should be challenging their detention in Texas rather than the nation's capital. The third judge on the panel didn't ask any questions.",
      "The administration has transferred hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II.",
      "Also on Monday, attorneys representing the Venezuelan government filed a legal action in El Salvador to free 238 Venezuelans who are being held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison after the U.S. deported them.",
      "President Trump's administration appealed after Boasberg blocked those deportations and ordered planeloads of Venezuelan immigrants to return to the U.S. That did not happen.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge. Trump issued a proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.",

      "Judge Justin Walker, whom Mr. Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration's arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government's arguments that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.",
      "\"You could have filed the exact same complaint you filed here in Texas district court,\" Walker told American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt.",

      "\"This has all been done in secret,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She didn't ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.",
      "Boasberg, an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members.

Dozens of other U.S. states have introduced legislation to ban or more strictly regulate certain food additives, including artificial dyes, since the beginning of the year, according to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on food safety.",
      "Thirty-six color additives are approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in food and drinks in the U.S., including nine artificial dyes.",
      "Rising concerns from advocacy groups and scientists about possible health consequences of synthetic food components, particularly for children, prompted the FDA to undertake a new effort in December to review previously approved additives, although the agency's deputy commissioner for human foods warned at the time that budget restrictions might prevent a timely turnaround. In January, the FDA announced its decision to revoke the authorization for one dye, Red 3, to be added to foods, after evidence showed a link between the dye and cancer in laboratory animals.",

    "story": [
      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",
      "And when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.",
      "\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.",
      "The report's focus on engineering and money misses the importance of adopting policies that could improve how people use and pay for infrastructure, according to Clifford Winston, a microeconomist in the Brookings Institution's economic studies program.",
      "\"You fail to make the most efficient use of what you have,\" said Winston. For example, he noted that congestion pricing like that recently adopted by New York City\u00a0\u2014 charging people to drive in crowded areas \u2014 places the burden on frequent users and can pressure people to drive less, reducing the need for new bridges, tunnels and repairs.",
      "Roads remain in chronically poor shape, receiving a D-plus compared to a D in the last report, despite $591 billion in investments since 2021.",
      "Aviation also came in with a D-plus, Van Cleave notes.",
      "Two categories, rail and energy, received lower grades. Disasters like the derailment of a train carrying dangerous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023 lowered rail's previous B mark to a B-minus.",
      "The energy sector, stressed by surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, got a D-plus, down from C-minus.",
      "Invest now or pay more later",
      "Engineers say problems in many sectors have festered for so long that the nation must figure out how to address the shortcomings now or pay for them when systems fail.",
      "On Wednesday, a delegation of engineers will visit Washington to talk to lawmakers about the funding impacts and \"the importance of continuing that investment,\" said Olson, who said the needs are a bipartisan issue.",
      "\"When we talk about it in ways of how better infrastructure saves the American family money, how better infrastructure supports economic growth, we're really confident that ... there is strong support,\" he said."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Top Trump officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance allegedly discussed the details of a highly sensitive operation to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen in a group chat that inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Goldberg wrote on Monday.",
      "As a Cabinet meeting unfolded at the White House on Monday afternoon, Goldberg published a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month by an account sharing the name of White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Later, Goldberg said an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about \"weapons packages, targets, and timing\" of the attack shortly before it took place.",
      "The National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be \"authentic\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said.\u00a0 \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "When asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.",
      "\"I don't know anything about it,\" the president responded. \"I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\"",
      "In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz \"has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Then, on Tuesday morning, Leavitt insisted in a statement on X\u00a0that no \"classified\" material or \"war plans\" were discussed in the chat. The White House has not released the full text of the conversation.",
      "The Atlantic story",
      "In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.",
      "The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Mr. Trump's Middle East and Ukraine envoy\u00a0Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.",
      "\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president\u00a0said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.",
      "On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns \u2014 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2014 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2014 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"",
      "\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.",
      "\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:",
      "\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left \u2014 or, more to the point, who I was.\"",
      "At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Goldberg told CBS News: \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me \u2014 they like convenience. They're just like you and me \u2014 they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"",
      "CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday that sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a non-secure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "Congressional reaction",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"",
      "At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.",
      "\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",

      "The head of the beleaguered U.S. Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, resigned Monday after nearly five years in the position, leaving as President Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have floated the idea of privatizing mail service.",
      "DeJoy had said last month he planned to step down but hadn't set a date. He leaves an agency with an uncertain future. Mr. Trump has said he is considering putting USPS under the control of the Commerce Department in an attempt to stop losses at the $78 billion-a-year agency, which has struggled at times to balance the books with the decline of first-class mail.",
      "Deputy Postmaster General Doug Tulino will take on the role until the Postal Service Board of Governors names a permanent replacement for DeJoy, who became postmaster general in the summer of 2020 during Mr. Trump's first term. He was a Republican donor who owned a logistics business and was the first person to hold the position in nearly two decades who was not a career postal employee.",
      "DeJoy's tenure was marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, surges in mail-in election ballots and efforts to stem losses through cost and service cuts.",
      "\"I believe strongly that the organization is well positioned and capable of carrying forward and fully implementing the many strategies and initiatives that comprise our transformation and modernization, and I have been working closely with the Deputy Postmaster General to prepare for this transition,\"\u00a0DeJoy said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A number of lawmakers expressed outrage Monday after the editor of The Atlantic reported that he was accidentally included in a group chat\u00a0involving top Trump administration officials about the United States' highly sensitive war plans in Yemen.",
      "Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle criticized the security breach, though Democrats took a harsher stance about how it should be addressed, with many demanding an immediate investigation. It is likely to become a topic of questioning as leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday to testify about global security threats facing the country.",
      "Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the breach represents \"one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense\" he has ever seen.",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous. I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately,\" Reed's statement said.",
      "Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chair of the Armed Services Committee, said, \"It's definitely a concern, and it appears that mistakes were made.\"",
      "\"There are likely to be classified briefings about this soon,\" Wicker said, adding that his committee will \"absolutely\" look into it.",
      "In a\u00a0piece\u00a0published Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, The Atlantic's editor in chief, recounted how he says he was inadvertently added to a group chat that included national security adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and others on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month. In the chat, Hegseth detailed the plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen shortly before the strikes took place, and other top officials weighed in, according to Goldberg.",
      "The Atlantic said it did not publish all of the messages because some of the details were too sensitive.",
      "The National Security Council acknowledged in a statement to CBS News that the group chat Goldberg reported \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said. \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "Hegseth said Monday evening that \"nobody was texting war plans,\" and he slammed Goldberg as \"a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist\" who \"peddles hoaxes.\"",
      "Asked about the report, President Trump said, \"I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. It's going out of business. It's not much of a magazine.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, \"President Trump continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on the Senate floor, \"This debacle requires a full investigation into how this happened, damage it created, and how we can avoid it in the future. If our nation's military secrets are being peddled around over unsecure text chains, we need to know that at once. We need to put a stop to it immediately.\"",
      "He added, \"When Pete Hegseth came before the Senate as a nominee, Democrats warned that something like this might happen. These people are clearly not up for the job. We warned confirming them was dangerous, that they'd behave recklessly. Unfortunately, we were right.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, who serves on the Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations Committee, slammed the incident as \"a dangerous level of incompetence\" and \"an inexcusable failure.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, called it \"a shocking breach\" and urged a \"prompt and thorough investigation\" into the matter.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News that there should \"absolutely\" be a congressional investigation \"so that we can understand what happened, why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of national security breach from ever happening again.\"",
      "\"This is reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous,\" the New York Democrat said. \"Who are some of these people that Donald Trump has put into the most sensitive national security positions in America? We were promised that Donald Trump was going to hire the very best. It's all phony.\"",
      "House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith called the incident \"deeply troubling.\" \"You're discussing war plans over the signal app. I mean, that's just unimaginable. There are secure lines of communication to do this, and anybody with just a rudimentary understanding of how national security works knows this. but apparently, Secretary Hegseth and Mike Waltz and the gang don't know,\" he said.",
      "House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes raised concern that the phones could have been vulnerable to hacking. \"Let's assume that the people on the Signal chat were probably the top targets for some of our global enemies. It is by the grace of God that one of those enemies didn't alert the Houthis in advance so that they could reconfigure their anti aircraft assets, and had they done that, we would be looking at dead pilots right now. That's how serious what this administration did is.\"",
      "Rep. Betty McCollum, a Democrat from Minnesota, raised the question of whether the officials violated the Espionage Act.",
      "Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Mike Lawler of New York criticized the use of an encrypted messaging app to discuss the war plans.",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",
      "\"Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels \u2014 and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,\" Lawler wrote. \"Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, offered a defense of the conduct and said the reporting showed \"top level officials doing their job, doing it well, and executing on a plan with precision.\"",
      "\"That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters.",

    "summary": "A personal attorney to President Trump for years, Alina Habba is known for her pugnacious defense in the media and in courtrooms.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday announced that he is appointing longtime ally Alina Habba to be New Jersey's top federal prosecutor. She has been a personal attorney to Mr. Trump for years, known for her pugnacious defense of him against the media and in courtrooms.",
      "Mr. Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, his social media site. He said that Habba, a counselor to the president who has not previously worked as a prosecutor, \"will lead with the same diligence and conviction that has defined her career.\"",
      "Habba has been at Mr. Trump's side for four years, at first filing unique, combative lawsuits \u2014 such as a doomed 2021 effort seeking a court order halting an investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James. That investigation led to one of Habba's most high profile defenses of the president, then a civilian.",
      "\"I am honored to serve my home state of New Jersey as Interim U.S. Attorney and I am grateful to President Trump for entrusting me with this tremendous responsibility,\" Habba said to CBS News, before mentioning her previous clashes on Mr. Trump's behalf. \"Just like I did during my time as President Trump's personal attorney, I will continue to fight for truth and justice. We will end the weaponization of justice, once and for all.\"",
      "Habba was among a half dozen lawyers who argued for Mr. Trump and others during a three-month-long 2023 civil fraud trial that pitted Mr. Trump against James' office. The case landed Mr. Trump and other defendants from his company a nearly $500 million fraud liability, which they are appealing. The trial became a staging ground for an effort that would permeate his presidential campaign and first weeks in office: vilification of judges who cross Mr. Trump.",
      "Inside the courtroom, Habba, other lawyers and Mr. Trump himself seethed at what they claimed were unfair decisions by the judge. Outside, to gathered cameras, the perceived injustices became a rallying call for a nascent presidential campaign still months away from its first primary. Mr. Trump, Habba and others would rage against the magistrate.",
      "Habba's work during the trial also included perhaps the most important cross-examination of her career: a withering, hours-long questioning of Mr. Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen. Mr. Trump was on hand to watch the show, as was James, as well as defense attorneys and Manhattan prosecutors set to spar months later in Mr. Trump's 2024 criminal trial.",
      "In a series of tense and testy exchanges, Habba got the former attorney to admit to lying under oath on multiple occasions. A member of Mr. Trump's legal team later told CBS News they believed Habba's work in the civil fraud case had buoyed their cause in the criminal matter.",
      "Christopher Kise, a former solicitor general of Florida who led Mr. Trump's team during the fraud case, lauded Habba on Monday. Like Habba and others who have worked for Mr. Trump, Kise highlighted conservatives' claim that there was a \"weaponization\" of the courts against Mr. Trump during the four years between his terms in office.",
      "\"Alina will be a zealous and tireless advocate for justice in the District of New Jersey and help ensure the focus is on fighting crime and protecting families instead of the weaponized practices of the prior administration,\" Kise said. \"She has time and again proven her ability to take on major issues and to persevere under intense and challenging circumstances.\"",
      "While working for Mr. Trump, Habba weathered significant losses without losing her place in his inner circle. The fraud judgment came within weeks of an $83 million hit when a civil federal jury found Mr. Trump liable for defamation against the writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "Mr. Trump attended that trial as well. He and Habba chafed at yet another judge, insinuating inside the courtroom and declaring outside to reporters that they were being treated unfairly.",
      "By the spring of 2024, Mr. Trump's campaign was intrinsically tied to his time in court. The rhythm of his seven-week criminal trial in New York included daily visits to a gaggle of cameras, just outside the courtroom doors, where Mr. Trump and others sought to highlight what they saw as a \"rigged\" campaign against him.",
      "Habba wasn't a part of Mr. Trump's defense team, but she was a mainstay in the front row of the gallery. When the verdict was read, Habba and Mr. Trump's son Eric were the only people other than Secret Service in that row. All other staff and friends of the former and future president sat behind.",
      "After Mr. Trump became the first former or future president to be convicted of felonies \u2014 a verdict he is appealing \u2014 Habba started appearing on the campaign trail, becoming a near-constant presence advocating for Mr. Trump on television and on the stage.",
      "In December, Mr. Trump announced Habba as counselor to the president. She said Monday she would be leaving the White House to serve in New Jersey.",
      "The new job represents a homecoming for Habba, whose eponymous former law firm, Habba Madaio & Associates LLP, is based in Bedminster, New Jersey, just a few miles from one of the president's golf courses.",
      "It was at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster where the two first became acquainted. Mr. Trump went through scores of lawyers in the years since, but few have had Habba's staying power.",
      "Those years brought Habba from her firm of fewer than half a dozen attorneys to the White House. Now she returns to New Jersey where she'll lead an office of some 150 prosecutors.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 20:31:15 -0400",
    "summary": "A redistricting battle over Louisiana's congressional map has spanned years and been before the Supreme Court twice already.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday wrestled with whether to leave in place Louisiana's congressional map\u00a0that was used in the 2024 elections and includes two majority-Black districts.",
      "The dispute is the latest involving claims of racial gerrymandering and the drawing of political districts to land before the high court following the recrafting of voting boundaries after the decennial census. In this case, the plaintiffs, who identify themselves as non-African American Louisiana residents, say the state relied too heavily on race when drawing a second majority-Black district for the state's congressional map.",
      "It was unclear following arguments whether the high court was inclined to preserve Louisiana's map for use in future elections. New district lines are drawn after every Census.",
      "The justices have in recent years weakened the Voting Rights Act, starting with the landmark 2013 decision that gutted the law's preclearance requirement. Before that decision, certain states and localities \u2014 mostly Southern \u2014 with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices were required to submit changes in election law to the Justice Department for approval before they could be implemented. The court ruled that the formula used by the Voting Rights Act to determine what states and localities were subject to Section 5 was unconstitutional because it was based on electoral conditions in the 1960s and 1970s, rather than on contemporary circumstances, and thus imposed unequal burdens on some states without sufficient justifying evidence.",
      "But in a surprising decision in 2023, the high court declined an invitation to reshape Section 2 of the landmark voting law and invalidated Alabama's congressional map drawn by Republican lawmakers after the 2020 Census.",
      "The latest case before the court involves Louisiana's congressional map, which was redrawn last year to add a second majority-Black district to comply with Section 2, but then was found to be a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race.",
      "\"What we're looking at is the decision on how you draw districts to comply with the VRA and at the same time, not violate the 14th Amendment's ban on drawing districts based on race, where race is used excessively,\" said Jeffrey Wice, a professor at New York Law School who is an expert in redistricting.",
      "The dispute, he said, \"is a conflict of different issues coming to us at a time when the court is highly politicized.\"",
      "The case, known as Louisiana v. Callais, has ping-ponged around the federal courts, including twice at the Supreme Court, since 2022, when a federal district court in Baton Rouge issued the first decision in this long-running dispute. The judge, Shelly Dick, found the original map of Louisiana's six congressional districts that was enacted by the legislature in February 2022 likely violated Section 2 because it diluted Black voting strength.",
      "That initial map from the GOP-led legislature had one majority-Black district. African-Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "The judge blocked the state from conducting congressional elections under those lines and ordered the state to put in place a remedial plan with two majority-Black House districts. A federal appeals court then upheld that injunction and set a deadline for Louisiana to draw the new voting lines.",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who took office in January 2024, called the legislature into special session to draw a new congressional map, with the understanding from state lawmakers that two of its six districts had to be majority-Black.",
      "The plan adopted reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to adhere to the district court's order and bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state officials said. But Louisiana state lawmakers said they had another goal: to protect certain Republican incumbents, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow, the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee, they said.",
      "It did that at the expense of Garrett Graves, a Republican who represented District 6 and was at risk of losing his seat because of the redrawn lines. The new district has a Black voting age population of roughly 51%. It stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge, in the southeast, and connects predominantly Black populations from Shreveport, Alexandria, Lafayette and Baton Rouge.",
      "Shortly after the new redistricting plan was adopted, a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged that the redrawn District 6 was a racial gerrymander in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided three-judge district court panel in Shreveport found that the legislature predominantly considered race when it crafted the new voting lines and blocked the state from using the map in any election. But Louisiana lawmakers, along with a group of Black voters and nonprofits who challenged the original map from 2022, asked the Supreme Court to intervene and allow the state to use the plan for the 2024 elections.",
      "The Supreme Court granted the state and Black voters' emergency relief, and the November House elections were held using the redrawn map. Graves opted not to seek reelection, and Rep. Cleo Fields, a Democrat who is Black, won the race for District 6. The high court agreed to take up the case in November.",
      "\"The court has faced this issue several times before,\" Wice said. \"But here we have a uniquely different case because we're looking at Louisiana trying to do three things.\"",
      "The first is to comply with the courts, the second is to draw a second minority district that would allow Black voters to elect their preferred candidate, and the third is to satisfy political demands to keep certain members of Congress in office, he said.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Louisiana officials argue that the non-Black voters who challenged the new congressional map did not have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing, because they failed to show how they were harmed by the alleged violation of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "But as to the merits of the case, the state and voters said race was not the sole factor involved in how the map was redrawn. Instead, Louisiana lawmakers said they had two criteria: that District 6 be majority-Black and that the broader congressional map protect Republican incumbents.",
      "The state said the blame for its considerations of race when drawing the new map lies with the district court, since it said the remedial redistricting plan had to have two majority-Black districts to comply with the federal voting rights law.",
      "\"Having forced the state into adopting a second majority-Black district, the federal judiciary cannot wash its hands of the matter now and point at the legislature,\" Louisiana officials said. \"If a bank robber holds a gun to a teller's head, no one would say that the teller's emptying the cash drawer was self-motivated. Just so here.\"",
      "But during the arguments, Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned how the high court is supposed to reconcile the state's acknowledgement that it took race into consideration to ensure compliance with the Voting Rights Act with the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "\"How do we square that with the 14th Amendment's promise that race should play no role [in our laws]?\" he asked.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts also highlighted the shape of District 6, which he said runs from one corner of the state to another, \"picking up Black populations as it goes along.\"",
      "But several of the liberal justices appeared to support Louisiana's argument that it was motivated by politics when it drew the lines of District 6, and decided to draw its own map to protect incumbent lawmakers rather than continue with litigation and risk the district court implementing its own voting lines.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan said state lawmakers had good reason to create a second majority-minor district, given the lower court's order, and implemented a map that reflected its political considerations.",
      "\"If the state can't do that, the state has no breathing room\" when drawing voting boundaries, she said.",
      "In their filings, Louisiana officials asked the Supreme Court to provide a \"clear articulation\" of what voting map would survive review under the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act, and how states can avoid \"endless litigation\" that follows every Census moving forward.",
      "They also suggested that the Supreme Court rule that racial gerrymandering claims shouldn't be decided by the courts at all and should instead be left to the political branches. The proposal, which Louisiana officials said \"would be the best outcome for everyone,\" reflects a concurring opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas last year in a redistricting case from South Carolina.",
      "\"Drawing political districts is a task for politicians, not federal judges,\" Thomas wrote. \"There are no judicially manageable standards for resolving claims about districting, and, regardless, the Constitution commits those issues exclusively to the political branches.\"",
      "No other justice joined Thomas' opinion, and his view was not raised during the arguments. But whether any other of the other justices, namely the members of its conservative wing, come out in agreement with Thomas in this case remains an open question.",
      "Sarah Brannon, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said during a call with reporters that if at least four other justices embrace Thomas' position, it would set a bad precedent going forward.",
      "\"It would make it very difficult for civil rights groups, minority voters, to bring claims in the future to raise concerns that state legislatures are using race in a way that is intended not to help Black voters have more opportunities to elect candidates of choice, or voters of color to have opportunities to elect candidates of choice, but to essentially manipulate race in such a way that would deprive voters,\" she said.",
      "On the other side, the group of 12 non-African-American voters argued that the state set a \"racial quota\" of two majority-Black districts out of the state's six House seats.",
      "District 6, they argued in Supreme Court filings, is a \"sinuous and jagged second majority-Black district based on racial stereotypes, racially 'balkanizing' a 250-mile swath of Louisiana, from the far Northwest near Texas, down to [East Baton Rouge] near the Mississippi River's mouth.\"",
      "They also rejected the state's suggestion that the drawing of district lines be solely left to the political branches.",
      "\"The state's 'odious' stereotyping of citizens based on race (even to the 'shame' of many legislators and to Republicans' political detriment) and its tenacious efforts to freeze the gerrymander for the 2024 election show why the political process is insufficient to protect citizens against invidious discrimination,\" the voters said.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June.",

    "story": [
      "23andMe, a formerly high-flying genetic testing company, announced Sunday that it was declaring bankruptcy and that it would seek a buyer.",
      "The company also said CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki is resigning immediately and will be replaced by Chief Financial and Accounting Officer Joe Selsavage as interim chief executive.",
      "23andMe moved in November to slash 40% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan, a step that came roughly two months after its entire board resigned.",
      "\"We expect the court-supervised process will advance our efforts to address the operational and financial challenges we face, including further cost reductions and the resolution of legal and leasehold liabilities,\" 23andMe Chair Mark Jensen said in a statement. \"We believe in the value of our people and our assets and hope that this process allows our mission of helping people access, understand and benefit from the human genome to live on for the benefit of customers and patients.\"",
      "23andMe offers two basic kinds of services \u2014 consumer and therapeutics. The former provides people with information on their ancestry and genetic health profile, including the risk of passing on certain conditions to their children, according to S&P Capital IQ. The therapeutics unit works to develop treatments and conducts research into cancer, immune diseases and other conditions.",
      "Data privacy concerns",
      "23andMe's struggles have raised concerns about the privacy of its customers' genetic data, which is used to trace people's ancestry, among other purposes. In filing for bankruptcy protection, the company said there will be no changes to how it manages and protects people's data.",
      "23andMe users must explicitly affirm that the company may share their personal data, although people's data could be included as part of a sale of the company. Some states have passed privacy laws that would require a person's consent before their genetic data is transferred from one entity to another.",
      "In its bankruptcy announcement, 23andMe said any buyer of its assets would have to observe applicable privacy laws for customer data. The company has also previously said that any customer data it shares with other parties is anonymous and can't be traced to individual users.",
      "23andMe also allows customers to delete their accounts. To do that, users must log in to their account and submit a request. The company will send an email confirming the request to delete the data, which the user must then verify.",
      "23andMe's stock, which once traded for more than $300 a share, fell to 79 cents before the start of trade Monday. In January, 23andMe reported a third-quarter net loss of $26.8 million on revenue of $60.3 million, an improvement over its loss of $259.7 million on revenue of $44.7 million in the year-ago period.",
      "The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. 23andMe said that, if granted approval in bankruptcy court, the company would solicit bids from potential acquirers over a 45-day period and potentially conduct an auction.",
      "One possible buyer is Wojcicki herself. The executive, who recently submitted an acquisition offer that 23andMe rejected earlier this month, said in a social media post Monday that she may again bid for 23andMe.",
      "\"I have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder,\" she wrote, adding that continues to believe in the company's brand and business.",
      "\"We have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today. There is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 20:17:12 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced Susan Monarez is to be elevated from her role as acting CDC director, after nominee David Weldon was withdrawn earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has decided to pick Susan Monarez to be the new nominee to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making permanent the acting role she has served at the public health agency in recent months.",
      "Monarez would be named in place of Dr. David Weldon, a former Florida congressman whose nomination was withdrawn by the White House earlier this month over concerns that he didn't have the votes to clear the Senate confirmation process.",
      "\"As an incredible mother and dedicated public servant, Dr. Monarez understands the importance of protecting our children, our communities, and our future. Americans have lost confidence in the CDC due to political bias and disastrous mismanagement,\" the president\u00a0posted\u00a0on Truth Social, announcing the pick Monday afternoon.",
      "Monarez apparently beat out others who had been seen as contenders for the role, including former obstetrician-gynecologist and Texas congressman Michael Burgess. Weldon had also floated Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo for the role, calling for him to be at the top of Mr. Trump's list to replace him as the nominee.",
      "If confirmed, Monarez would be the first head of the CDC to be voted on by senators, under a change passed by Congress in 2022. Previous directors of the agency were able to take the reins soon after they were picked by the president, without undergoing the confirmation process.",
      "Monarez, who was previously deputy director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, has been serving as the CDC's acting head since January.",
      "She has been viewed as an unconventional pick for the role because previous interim directors have come from within the CDC's career ranks.",
      "Past directors in recent history have also been medical doctors, while Monarez has a PhD. An acting director in the 1980s and 90s was also not a medical doctor, though he was a longtime career CDC official.",
      "According to one federal health official, White House officials have said they are trying to \"get it right\" with their new pick. Another federal official said that Monarez had gotten along well with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr, since taking on the role.",
      "Monarez and her aides at the agency were in Washington, D.C., last week for meetings, one federal health official said.",
      "\"CDC needs reform. That's why I launched a Senate Republican CDC working group. I look forward to meeting Dr. Susan Monarez and learning more about her vision for the agency,\" Senator Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate's health committee, said in a statement.",
      "People familiar with Weldon's meetings on Capitol Hill said Republicans had been frustrated with a lack of detailed priorities or familiarity with the agency's workings, as well as an unwillingness to assusage concerns that he would be perceived as anti-vaccine.",
      "Nominees to lead the National Institutes of Health, Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are expected to be confirmed soon, after hearings in recent weeks.",
      "Monarez is likely to face questions over the role she's played in controversial decisions at the agency in recent months, including undermining the independence of the CDC's flagship medical research publication, abruptly delaying a meeting of the outside vaccine advisers and plans to research whether vaccines cause autism \u2014 long after its scientists had debunked the claims.",
      "A range of health threats are now facing the CDC, including a rise in measles cases driven by a record outbreak among undervaccinated communities in Texas and neighboring states.",
      "Like other nominees, Monarez will face questions over whether she agrees with condemnation by health experts of Kennedy's responses to the outbreak, like remarks downplaying the virus and inflating the risks posed by the measles vaccine. Kennedy has also faced criticism over his comments about how to handle other viruses, like the growing bird flu outbreak.",
      "Monarez has also been involved in decisions over steep cuts to the agency's workforce expected in the coming days, which some managers expect could result in losing up to 30% of the CDC's staff.",

      "Washington \u2014 Democrats grilled the leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies Tuesday over a security breach in which top Trump officials inadvertently included a journalist in a group chat about the United States' highly sensitive plans to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee to testify about global threats facing the U.S. However the annual hearing, which typically focuses on threats posed by China, Russia, Iran, largely concentrated on the lapse.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse also appeared, but received few questions.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, addressed the controversy at the top of the hearing, calling it \"mind-boggling\" that none of the intelligence officials in the chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal thought to check who else was included.",
      "\"Are these government devices? Were they personal devices? Have the devices been collected to make sure there's no malware?\" Warner said in his opening remarks. \"There's plenty of declassified information that shows that our adversaries, China and Russia, are trying to break into encryption systems like Signal.\"",
      "Warner's declaration that Gabbard and Ratcliff that the use of the group chat was part of a \"pattern of an amazing cavalier attitude towards classified information is reckless, sloppy and stunning\" set the tone for Democrats in the hearing.",
      "Group chat controversy",
      "On Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal about the war plans, although Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth later denied any war plans were discussed. Accounts appearing to be Gabbard and Ratcliffe both participated in the message thread, according to Goldberg.",
      "In the group chat, which was started by President Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz, Ratcliffe allegedly shared information \"that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The National Security Council said Monday in a statement to CBS News that the message thread \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "\"If it's not classified, share the texts now\": Democrats grill on group chat",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe both denied that classified information was shared in the group chat in a feisty exchange with Warner. Confronted by Warner, Gabbard initially declined to say whether she was part of the chat.",
      "\"Because it's all classified?\" Warner said.",
      "\"Because this is currently under review,\" Gabbard responded.",
      "\"If it's not classified, share the texts now,\" Warner said.",
      "Ratcliffe confirmed to Warner that he was a participant in the message thread, but pushed back on whether the decision to use Signal to communicate was a security lapse. Ratcliffe said Signal was on his CIA computer when he was confirmed as director earlier this year.",
      "\"As it is for most CIA officers,\" he said, adding that the agency considers the commercial app \"permissible\" for work use.",
      "Ratcliffe confirmed to Warner that he was a participant in the message thread, but pushed back on whether the decision to use Signal to communicate was a security lapse. Ratcliffe said Signal was on his CIA computer when he was confirmed as director earlier this year. \"As it is for most CIA officers,\" he said, adding that the agency considers the commercial app \"permissible\" for work use.",
      "\"It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes, provided, senator, that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels,\" Ratcliffe said. \"My communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"",
      "Ratcliffe later told Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, that the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency recommended that \"high-level officials who would be targeted by foreign adversaries\" use \"end-to-end encrypted apps whenever possible.\"",
      "The spy chiefs also denied that the conversation included information on weapons packages, targets or timing of the strikes, as Goldberg reported.",
      "\"Not that I'm aware of,\" Ratcliffe said, with Gabbard adding \"same answer.\"",
      "But Gabbard later told Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, that \"there was discussion around targets in general,\" which Ratcliffe said was consistent with his recollection. When asked whether there was any mention of a weapon or weapons system, Gabbard said she did not recall \"specific weapons systems being named.\" Ratcliffe also said, \"I don't recall.\" Both gave similar responses when asked about timing or any mention of military units.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia noted that, according to the messages shared by Goldberg, the timing of the strikes were debated by Vice President JD Vance and Hegseth.",
      "\"They were discussing the timing of sending U.S. air crews into enemy airspace, where they faced an air defense threat, correct?\" Ossoff asked, repeating the question when Ratcliffe didn't directly answer. \"They're talking about the timing of U.S. airstrikes, correct?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "\"And therefore the timing of U.S. air crews into hostile airspace, correct?\" Ossoff said.",
      "\"Yes,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "During questioning from Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, both Ratcliffe and Gabbard also denied participating in any Signal group chats in which classified information was shared.",
      "Gabbard told Wyden she had \"no objection\" to cooperating with an audit to confirm such, while Ratcliffe said he would comply with any follow up that the National Security Council deemed appropriate.",
      "Another heated moment came during the back and forth between Sen. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, and Ratcliffe. Bennet asked whether the CIA director knew that Mr. Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow when the group chat, which Witkoff was part of, according to Goldberg, was ongoing. Ratcliffe said he was unaware that Witkoff was in Russia. Flight data show that\u00a0Witkoff was in Russia\u00a0during part of the conversation, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "\"It's an embarrassment,\" Bennet said. \"You need to do better.\"",

      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own report for The Atlantic.",
      "The National Security Council told CBS News on Monday that the group chat \"appears to be authentic.\"",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, or whether he had the device with him in Russia, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report on Tuesday, saying on X that no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday for a pre-planned hearing on worldwide security threats. Ratcliffe acknowledged on Tuesday that he was part of the chat.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin. The White House did not immediately reply to CBS News' questions about the meeting or whether Witkoff had his device at the Kremlin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however, and the Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",
      "While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said \"the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.\"",

    "story": [
      "Russia and Ukraine have agreed to \"ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea,\" the Trump administration said Tuesday, claiming a limited advance in efforts to broker a peace deal between the two countries.",
      "The agreements were announced in separate statements by the White House after U.S. officials held separate bilateral talks with Ukrainian and Russian delegations this week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said it was his country's understanding that the Black Sea agreement was in effect immediately, and Russia's government also released a statement confirming that it had agreed to the terms.",
      "Zelenskyy noted that the White House statement did not specify any actions to be taken if Russia violates the terms of the agreement, and he said Ukraine would appeal directly to the Trump administration for more weapons and more sanctions against Russia in such a case.",
      "\"In accordance with the agreement between the presidents of the Russian Federation and the United States, the Russian and American sides agreed to ensure the implementation of the 'Black Sea Initiative,' which includes ensuring the safety of navigation in the Black Sea, the non-use of force and the prevention of the use of commercial vessels for military purposes while organizing appropriate control measures through the inspection of such vessels,\" the Kremlin said in a statement published by the Russian state-run news agency TASS.",
      "It said that in return for the Black Sea deal, the U.S. would \"help restore access for Russian agricultural and fertilizer exports to the world market, reduce the cost of shipping insurance, and expand access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.\"",
      "The terms of the deal, as described by the Kremlin, appeared to be based largely on the previous Black Sea Grain Initiative, a limited ceasefire brokered by the United Nations and Turkey that Russia walked away from in 2023. Moscow claimed the U.S. and other Ukrainian partners weren't keeping up their end of the agreement in 2023, by blocking the export of some Russian agricultural products.",
      "The White House statements on Tuesday also said the U.S. agreed with Russia and Ukraine to \"develop measures for implementing\" agreements between President Trump and the two countries' leaders \"to ban strikes against energy facilities of Russia and Ukraine.\"",
      "On Sunday, national security adviser Mike Waltz said on \"Face The Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that a ceasefire on \"aerial infrastructure\" went into effect immediately after Mr. Trump had a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week. The details of the agreement reached during that call haven't been confirmed, but Moscow has said it involved an agreement to halt attacks on energy infrastructure, which it almost immediately accused Ukraine of breaching.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0said Putin agreed\u00a0during their call to immediately halt attacks \"on all energy and infrastructure\" in Ukraine, offering a different version of the deal from the Kremlin. Hours after the deal was announced, Ukraine\u00a0accused Russia\u00a0of breaching the agreement as described by Mr. Trump.",
      "Waltz had said on Sunday that a maritime ceasefire to allow the movement of grain, fuel, and other goods was next on the agenda.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Top Trump officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance allegedly discussed the details of a highly sensitive operation to bomb Houthi targets in Yemen in a group chat that inadvertently included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, Goldberg wrote on Monday.",
      "As a Cabinet meeting unfolded at the White House on Monday afternoon, Goldberg published a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal earlier this month by an account sharing the name of White House national security adviser Mike Waltz. Later, Goldberg said an account named \"Pete Hegseth\" laid out a plan for strikes in Yemen that included precise information about \"weapons packages, targets, and timing\" of the attack shortly before it took place.",
      "The National Security Council stated that the messages seem to be \"authentic\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "\"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" a National Security Council spokesman said.\u00a0 \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our service members or our national security.\"",
      "When asked about the Goldberg story at the White House on Monday afternoon, President Trump told reporters he had not heard about it.",
      "\"I don't know anything about it,\" the president responded. \"I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine. But I know nothing about it.\"",
      "In a later statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president \"continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team, including National Security Advisor Mike Waltz.\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Tuesday that Waltz \"has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters in Hawaii, Hegseth denied that he shared war plans with a journalist and did not answer a question about whether the information was classified.",
      "\"Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Then, on Tuesday morning, Leavitt insisted in a statement on X\u00a0that no \"classified\" material or \"war plans\" were discussed in the chat. The White House has not released the full text of the conversation.",
      "The Atlantic story",
      "In his piece, Goldberg said he received a connection request on Signal on March 11 from a user with the name \"Mike Waltz\" without explanation. On March 13, Goldberg said he was added to a group chat in Signal titled \"Houthi PC small group,\" which he took to be a reference to a \"principals committee,\" or group of high-ranking officials.",
      "The chat included a total of 18 people, including those who appeared to be Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, and Mr. Trump's Middle East and Ukraine envoy\u00a0Steve Witkoff, according to Goldberg.",
      "Goldberg wrote that he was initially skeptical of the authenticity of the group, saying he believed it could have been \"part of a disinformation campaign\" or an effort to embarrass journalists.",
      "\"I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "The Houthis are an Iranian-backed rebel group in Yemen that has attacked commercial ships and warships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden for more than a year, threatening maritime trade. The Houthis have used the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas to justify the attacks. The president\u00a0said last week that he considered Iran to be behind the attacks and warned that it would \"suffer the consequences\" of additional strikes.",
      "On March 14, the officials in the Signal chat debated the timing of an operation to target the group, according to Goldberg. The account with the name \"JD Vance\" expressed concern that taking action against the Houthis would primarily benefit Europe at a time when Mr. Trump has been pressuring European allies to do more to provide for their own security.",
      "\"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices,\" Vance wrote, according to Goldberg. \"I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"",
      "Goldberg wrote that Hegseth responded: \"VP: I understand your concerns \u2014 and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what \u2014 nobody knows who the Houthis are \u2014 which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"",
      "On Saturday, March 15, Hegseth posted an update and others responded in texts that Goldberg said he would not publish because \"the information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility.\"",
      "\"What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,\" Goldberg wrote.",
      "Goldberg said Hegseth told the group that the strikes against the Houthis would commence at 1:45 p.m. ET.",
      "\"So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen. Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he checked the Signal chat and found a string of congratulatory messages from Waltz and others:",
      "\"The Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, 'Michael Waltz,' that I had left,\" Goldberg continued. \"No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left \u2014 or, more to the point, who I was.\"",
      "At 2:29 p.m., Mr. Trump posted a message on Truth Social announcing the attack.",
      "\"Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective.\"",
      "Goldberg told CBS News: \"People have devices that are extraordinarily convenient, and government officials are just like you and me \u2014 they like convenience. They're just like you and me \u2014 they sometimes send texts to people they didn't mean to send texts to. The consequences here are a lot higher for that sort of thing than in regular civilian life.\"",
      "CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday that sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a non-secure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "Congressional reaction",
      "The story ricocheted through Washington on Monday, with Democratic lawmakers demanding an investigation into why highly sensitive information was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels. Goldberg also alleged that Waltz had set some of the messages in the group chat to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the episode, if true, \"represents one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"",
      "\"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's cabinet is stunning and dangerous,\" Reed said in a statement. \"I will be seeking answers from the Administration immediately.\"",
      "At the Capitol, House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the administration's handling of the incident and said he did not think Hegseth or Waltz should be disciplined.",
      "\"The administration is addressing what happened, apparently, an inadvertent phone number made it onto that thread. They're going to track that down and make sure that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican said. He said the conversation showed \"top-level officials doing their job, doing it well and executing on a plan with precision. That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, who has at times been critical of the administration's foreign policy, said that \"we've all sent a text to a wrong person, but the bigger problem is they are not using secure phones to discuss war plans.\"",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",

      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",

      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News that there should \"absolutely\" be a congressional investigation \"so that we can understand what happened, why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of national security breach from ever happening again.\"",
      "\"This is reckless, irresponsible, and dangerous,\" the New York Democrat said. \"Who are some of these people that Donald Trump has put into the most sensitive national security positions in America? We were promised that Donald Trump was going to hire the very best. It's all phony.\"",
      "House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith called the incident \"deeply troubling.\" \"You're discussing war plans over the signal app. I mean, that's just unimaginable. There are secure lines of communication to do this, and anybody with just a rudimentary understanding of how national security works knows this. but apparently, Secretary Hegseth and Mike Waltz and the gang don't know,\" he said.",
      "House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Jim Himes raised concern that the phones could have been vulnerable to hacking. \"Let's assume that the people on the Signal chat were probably the top targets for some of our global enemies. It is by the grace of God that one of those enemies didn't alert the Houthis in advance so that they could reconfigure their anti aircraft assets, and had they done that, we would be looking at dead pilots right now. That's how serious what this administration did is.\"",
      "Rep. Betty McCollum, a Democrat from Minnesota, raised the question of whether the officials violated the Espionage Act.",
      "Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Mike Lawler of New York criticized the use of an encrypted messaging app to discuss the war plans.",
      "\"This can get our troops killed. Secure phones are mandatory for these kinds of communications. Russia and China are definitely monitoring their unclassified phones hoping they share info like this,\" Bacon said.",
      "\"Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels \u2014 and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,\" Lawler wrote. \"Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, offered a defense of the conduct and said the reporting showed \"top level officials doing their job, doing it well, and executing on a plan with precision.\"",
      "\"That mission was a success. No one was jeopardized because of it. We're grateful for that, but they will certainly, I'm sure, make sure that that doesn't happen again,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters.",
      "Johnson added that he didn't think Waltz, who apparently started the group chat and included the journalist, according to Goldberg's report, should be disciplined.",

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 13:05:42 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says the U.S. needs control of Greenland and the Panama Canal \"for national security.\" Here's why both places are so important.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump repeated vows to secure U.S. control of Greenland and the Panama Canal in his speech to a joint a session of Congress on March 4.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security and even international security,\" the president said during his address. \"I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.\"",
      "Greenland's prime minister responded, saying \"We are not for sale and cannot simply be taken.\"",
      "Now, second lady\u00a0Usha Vance\u00a0is expected to visit Greenland this week, according to the White House, and national security adviser Mike Waltz will visit in a separate trip.\u00a0Donald Trump Jr. visited in January\u00a0before the president took office.",
      "On the Panama Canal, Mr. Trump said, \"To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it,\" referring to a deal to give an American company control of key ports.",
      "Panama's president denounced Mr. Trump's remarks and said \"The Canal is Panamanian\" in a social media post.",
      "Below is a look at where the two places are and what Mr. Trump has said about wanting the U.S. to control them.",
      "Where is Greenland and why does President Trump want it?",
      "Greenland is located to the northeast of Canada and is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. The largest island in the world, but home to only around 60,000 people, it is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark, with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world,\" he said in early January. \"You look at \u2014 you don't even need binoculars \u2014 you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Mr. Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" he said before taking office again on Jan. 20.",
      "Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed claims that China controls the canal.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "But in February, Panama decided not to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing after a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Ahead of Mr. Trump's address to Congress, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports at either end of the canal announced an agreement to sell shares of its units to an investment group led by American company BlackRock.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in his speech. \"The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it,\" he said.",
      "In his response, Mulino said, \"President Trump is lying.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" he wrote on social media. \"The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!\"",
      "China has denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.",
      "The history of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal\u00a0was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.",
      "It was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.",
      "In the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the permanent neutrality of the canal. The U.S. committed to relinquishing control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",

      "\"It should be said clearly that our integrity and democracy must be respected without foreign interference,\" AFP quoted Egede as saying, adding that it \"cannot be seen as just a private visit.\"",

    "summary": "South Korea's Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, but didn't rule on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
    "story": [
      "South Korea's Constitutional Court on Monday overturned the impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, reinstating the nation's No. 2 official as acting leader, while not yet ruling on the separate impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
      "Many observers said Monday's ruling doesn't signal much on the upcoming verdict on Yoon, as Han wasn't a key figure in Yoon's martial law imposition. But it could still embolden Yoon's staunch supporters and ramp up their political offensive on the opposition.",
      "Han became acting president after Yoon, a conservative, was impeached by the liberal opposition-controlled National Assembly over his Dec. 3 imposition of martial law that triggered a massive political crisis. But Han was impeached by the assembly as well in late December following political strife with opposition lawmakers.",
      "The unprecedented, successive impeachments that suspended the country's top two officials intensified a domestic division and deepened worries about the country's diplomatic and economic activities. The deputy prime minister and finance minister, Choi Sang-mok, had since serving as acting president.",
      "On Monday, seven of the court's eight justices overturned or dismissed Han's impeachment. They ruled the accusations against him weren't against the law or weren't serious enough to remove him from office or his impeachment motion didn't even met a required quorum when it passed thorough the assembly. One justice upheld Han's impeachment.",
      "Dismissing Han would have needed the support of at least six court justices.",
      "Following his reinstatement, Han told reporters he would focus on the \"most urgent matters,\" including a fast-changing global trade environment, in an apparent reference to the Trump administration's aggressive trade policies. He also called for a national unity, saying \"there's no left or right \u2014 what matters is the advancement of our nation.\"",
      "The court has yet to rule on Yoon's impeachment. If the court upholds Yoon's impeachment, South Korea must hold a election for a new president. If it rules for him, Yoon will be restored to office and regain his presidential powers.",
      "Yoon was impeached about two weeks earlier than Han. Observers earlier predicted the Constitutional Court would rule on Yoon's case in mid-March but it hasn't done so.",
      "Yoon has been separately arrested and charged with rebellion in connection with his martial law decree. If convicted of that charge, he would face the death penalty or a life sentence. On March 8, Yoon was released from prison, after a Seoul district court allowed him to stand his criminal trial without being detained.",
      "Massive rival rallies backing Yoon or denouncing Yoon have divided the streets of Seoul and other major cities in South Korea. Earlier surveys showed that a majority of South Koreans were critical of Yoon's martial law enactment, but those supporting or sympathizing with Yoon have later gained strength.",
      "At the center of squabbling over Yoon is why he sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the assembly after declaring martial law. Yoon says he aims to maintain order, but senior military and police officers sent there have said that Yoon ordered them to drag out lawmakers to prevent a floor vote to overturn his decree. Enough lawmakers eventually managed to enter an assembly hall and voted it down unanimously.",
      "Han, a career diplomat who was appointed by Yoon, had attempted to reassure diplomatic partners and stabilize markets, when he served as acting president. A major trigger for the opposition's push for his impeachment was Han's refusal to fill three vacancies on the nine-member Constitutional Court bench.",
      "Restoring the court's full membership was sensitive because a ruling upholding Yoon's impeachment requires support from at least six justices.",
      "Han's successor, Choi Sang-mok, appointed two new justices but left the ninth seat vacant.",
      "Both Han and Choi cited needing bipartisan consent to add justices to the court, but their critics suspected they were siding with Yoon's People Power Party, which wanted to increase Yoon's chances of returning to power. On Friday, the main liberal opposition Democratic Party and other small opposition parties submitted an impeachment motion on Choi.",

      "Maduro ratified the measure during a public event later in the day. \"We are resuming flights to rescue and release migrants from U.S. prisons,\" Maduro said.",

      "\"You guarantee their health and, sooner rather than later, you have to hand them over and release them, because they are kidnapped,\" Maduro said.",
      "Mr. Trump alleged the deportees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang. He labeled the Tren de Aragua an invading force on March 15 when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a little-used authority from 1798 that allows the president to deport any non-citizen during wartime. A federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations, but flights were in the air when the ruling came down.",
      "Tren de Aragua, which the U.S. Department of State designated a foreign terrorist organization, originated in a prison in the South American country. Members accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade.",
      "The Trump administration has not provided evidence that the deportees are members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crime in the U.S.",
      "CBS News obtained a list of the names of the 238 Venezuelan men who were deported to El Salvador last weekend aboard those three flights. U.S. officials have said 137 of them were treated as \"enemy aliens\" and removed from the country under the 18th century law. The other 101 were deported under regular immigration procedures, the officials have said.",
      "Documents obtained by CBS News showed that at least one of the men deported, a 26-year-old barber from Venezuela, has no criminal record in the U.S., and Venezuelan officials said he has no record there either.",
      "Maduro's government has mostly refused the entry of immigrants deported from the U.S. Those deportations have sharply picked up since Trump took office on Jan. 20.",
      "In recent weeks, some 350 people were deported to Venezuela, including some 180 who spent up to 16 days at the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",

      "Overnight into Sunday, Israeli strikes across the southern Gaza Strip killed at least 26 Palestinians, including a Hamas political leader and several women and children.",
      "Residents said tanks had advanced into an area of the southern city of Rafah as the military ordered it evacuated.",
      "Palestinian men, women and children could be seen walking along a dirt road and carrying their belongings in their arms, a recurring scene in a war that has forced most of Gaza's population to flee from the territory.",
      "\"It's displacement under fire,\" said Mustafa Gaber, a local journalist who left Tel al-Sultan with his family. In a video call, he said hundreds of people were fleeing as tank and drone fire echoed nearby. \"There are wounded people among us. The situation is very difficult,\" he said.",
      "The Israeli Defense Forces said the operation in Tel al-Sultan targeted \"terror infrastructure sites\" and sought to \"eliminate terrorists in the area, in order to reinforce control and expand the security zone in southern Gaza.\"",

      "The Hamas-led Gaza's Health Ministry said a total of 50,021 Palestinians have been killed in the war and more than 113,000 have been wounded. The latest toll announced Sunday includes 673 people killed since Israel's surprise bombardment on Tuesday as well as 233 bodies that were recently identified, the ministry said.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it instructed the army to respond forcefully against dozens of targets in Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah is based. Israel's army said six rockets were fired toward Metula, a town along the border with Lebanon. Three crossed into Israel and were intercepted.",
      "The army said it \"cannot confirm the identity of the organization that fired the rockets.\" It said it struck Hezbollah command centers and dozens of rocket launchers.",

It was the first attack on the city since the ceasefire took effect Nov. 27. And a strike on Hawsh al-Sayed Ali village along the border with Syria wounded five people, according to the NNA.",

      "Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into an all-out war in September as Israel carried out massive waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis.",
      "Under the ceasefire reached in November, Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January. The deadline was then extended to Feb. 18 by agreement between Lebanon and Israel.",
      "But since then, Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon, across from communities in northern Israel, and has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah. Lebanon has appealed to the U.N. to pressure Israel to fully withdraw from the country.",
      "The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said it was alarmed at the possible escalation of violence and urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made, saying further escalation could have serious consequences for the region.",
      "The strikes on Lebanon come a day after Israel said it would carry out operations in Gaza \"with increasing intensity\" until Hamas frees the 59 hostages it holds \u2014 24 of whom are believed alive.",
      "The attack by Hamas-led militants in 2023 killed some 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were militants but says more than half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.",

      "The airport also said in a statement that \"We have hundreds of additional colleagues on hand in our terminals and we have added flights to today's schedule to facilitate an extra 10,000 passengers traveling through the airport.\"",
      "On Friday, a fire at an electrical substation cut power to the airport for most of the day. The outage affected more than 1,300 flights to and from Heathrow and disrupted travel for more than 200,000 passengers. The outage also cut power to over 16,000 homes in the area.",
      "The ripple effect of the transportation hub shutting down for over 16 hours was immediate. About 1 million Americans travel through Heathrow each month.",
      "\"The pilot came on and said some of us may have noticed that the plane was turning around, not to be alarmed, but London Heathrow was closed due to a fire,\" said Justin McLane, who flew from Boston.",
      "Meanwhile, pressure mounted on airlines and Heathrow to take care of passengers.",
      "\"Contingencies of certain sizes we cannot guard ourselves against 100%, and this is one of them,\" said Thomas Woldbye, Heathrow's chief executive. \"This has been a major incident. I mean, short of anybody getting hurt, this is as big as it gets for our airport and we are actually coming back quite fast.\"",

      "\"We were like 'Oh my God, I cannot believe this is happening,'\" Esquete said. \"Everybody agreed that we had to go there.\"",
      "In just a day, the vessel was able to arrive at the area. They lowered a submersible robot more than 1,000 meters underwater so that it could explore the area and livestream the region to the scientists.",
      "Almost immediately, the researchers started seeing things that humans had never laid eyes on before.",
      "\"The first thing we saw was a huge sponge with a crab on it,\" Esquete said. \"That's already quite amazing, because one question that we had is 'Will there be any life at all?'\"",
      "Sponges grow very slowly \u2014 sometimes less than two centimeters a year. To get this big, the scientists say, the ecosystem has been thriving for a long time \u2014 possibly even centuries.",
      "The remotely operated vehicle explored the seafloor for eight days, the institute said. It also discovered large corals and more sponges, which were supporting species including icefish, giant sea spiders and octopi.",

      "Since January, scientists have confirmed the existence of at least six new species, Virmani said, but there are \"many more yet to be analyzed.\"",
      "Because Schmidt Ocean Institute makes all of its research, data and livestreams open access, the information is available for other scientists to explore and analyze.",

      "Dunzello said her flight was diverted to Canada, and she expected it to refuel and return to New York.",

It started late Thursday night, and by about 8 a.m. local time, the brigade said it was \"under control, but we will remain on scene throughout the day.\"",
      "The power outage affected \"a large number of homes and local businesses, and we are working closely with our partners to minimise disruption,\" Assistant Commissioner Pat Goulbourne said in a\u00a0statement, adding that firefighters had led 29 people to safety from nearby properties, and around 150 people were evacuated.",

      "\"The negative effects of an expanded trade war scenario will reach U.S. hotel room demand in 2025,\" Tourism Economics said in the report. \"Domestic travel will be negatively affected by slower income growth and higher prices while international travel to the U.S. will be hit by a trifecta of slower economies, a stronger dollar and antipathy toward the U.S.\""

    "published": "Fri, 21 Mar 2025 09:35:41 -0400",
    "summary": "Under pressure from Trump and with Russia menacing, Germany's incoming leader plans to revamp the country's defense posture. Can he deliver?",
    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0In a landmark shift, Germany is set to embark on its most ambitious defense spending initiative since World War II. Lawmakers have embraced plans unveiled by\u00a0Friedrich Merz, soon to take the reins as Germany's new chancellor, for an enormous boost to the country's military budget, signaling a dramatic transformation in its post-World War II defense posture.",
      "On Friday, the Bundesrat, the upper house of Germany's parliament, approved a 1 trillion euro spending package that effectively lifts a decades-old \"debt brake\" measure in the nation's laws that has capped military spending at less than 1% of national GDP. The legislation includes provisions for a 500 billion euro investment in infrastructure over a 12 year period, aimed at shoring up both the country's flagging economy.",
      "The package exempts from the national debt rules all spending on defense and security, including assistance to Ukraine, over 1% of GDP. The package of reforms, passed earlier in the week by the lower house of parliament, garnered the requisite two-thirds majority of votes in both parliamentary chambers to advance, and is now virtually guaranteed to become law. The plans mark a turning point after years of underinvestment and hesitation in German defense policy, and a fundamental reimagining of the country's role in European and global security.",
      "Merz's proposal envisions major arms deals, including to obtain new fighter jets, and expanded military aid for Ukraine.",
      "At the heart of the incoming leader's strategy is a commitment to spend \"whatever it takes\" on defense. Merz, who will most likely be inaugurated at the beginning of April and then tasked immediately with forming a new coalition government with other parties, has brokered a deal with two likely coalition members to raise hundreds of billions of euros in new defense spending with a focus on two key areas:",
      "First is the plan to create the 500 billion euro special fund for infrastructure projects and to change the strict \"debt brake\" rules to allow defense spending above 1% of GDP. Merz has argued it's essential, \"considering the dangers to our liberty and peace on the continent.\"",
      "The other key aspect of Merz's spending plan is an additional 3 billion euros worth of military aid for Ukraine. The commitment would build on Germany's existing support, which has included deliveries of IRIS-T air defense systems, Patriot missiles, Gepard anti-aircraft guns, Leopard tanks, and Marder infantry fighting vehicles.",
      "Can Merz make good on his defense spending plans?",
      "There are questions about Germany's ability to follow through on Merz's ambitious proposals, especially given its history of consistently falling short of NATO's 2% GDP defense spending target. Germany actually met that 2% goal in 2024 for the first time since the 1990s, perhaps heralding a shift in its approach to defense policy.",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "EU unveils $840 billion defense investment \"ReArm Europe\" plan",
      "Economic pressure, both domestic and global, could prove a significant obstacle to the spending plan's implementation. Germany's economy has struggled to recover since the coronavirus pandemic, and there are concerns about the impact of such massive spending increases on the country's fiscal stability.",
      "Christian Lindner, the nation's former finance minister, harshly criticized Merz's plan to boost defense spending and loosen the \"debt brake,\" warning that Germany could soon have \"a trillion euros in higher debt, without having been economically strengthened by it.\"",
      "But for Germany's relationship with the United States, a defense spending revolution \u2014 and even a clear commitment to one \u2014 could represent a turning point. Washington has long pressured Germany, and its other NATO allies, to take on a greater share of the fiscal and military burden of supporting the transatlantic defense alliance.",
      "President Trump has recently called for NATO members to spend at least 5% of their GDPs on defense, a significantly higher proportion than even the U.S. spends. He's also indicated that the U.S. could disregard the Article 5 collective defense clause in NATO's founding treaty, refusing to help defend allies that fail to meet his spending targets. His rhetoric has fueled the urgency behind Germany's military expansion plans.",
      "The planned increase in German defense spending could bolster NATO's deterrence capacity, particularly in Eastern Europe, where Russia's aggression has put member nations on edge.",
      "Germany has already committed to providing 35,000 troops and more than 200 ships and aircraft to help implement NATO's new force model, and additional funding could see those contributions enhanced.",
      "The success of Merz's initiative will be closely watched by Germany's allies. Failure to deliver on the ambitious plans could strain relations with the U.S. and other NATO partners as Western Europe tries to show a united front in the face of the threat from Russia.",

      "Coventry's manifesto offered mostly continuity from Bach with little new detail, while her rivals had specifics to benefit Olympic athletes, which she was as recently as 2016 in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Coventry in her manifesto wrote she would \"continue to prioritize [athletes'] mental health, physical recovery, and amplify their holistic well-being to help them thrive throughout their athletic careers and beyond.\"",
      "Coe's World Athletics broke an Olympic taboo by paying $50,000 to track and field gold medalists in Paris last year. Samaranch promised to relax strict IOC commercial rules and give athletes control of footage of their Olympic performances.",
      "Samaranch tried to follow his father, also Juan Antonio Samaranch, who was the IOC's seventh president from 1980 to 2001.",
      "Coe aimed to add to a remarkable career of Olympic triumphs: A two-time Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 meters, he led a bidding team for the 2012 London Olympics, then worked for the next seven years to head the organizing team of those widely praised Games. He got just eight votes.",
      "It has been a stellar week for Bach, who greeted Coventry and shared warm smiles after her acceptance speech.",
      "Bach was feted on Wednesday in an emotional start to the IOC annual meeting, getting lavish praise and the title of honorary president for life. He repeated his wish to offer advice to the next president.",
      "His hands-on executive-style presidency will deliver over a financially secure IOC, on track to earn more than $8 billion in revenue through the 2028 LA Olympics, and with a slate of future hosts through 2034: in Italy, the United States, France, Australia and finally the U.S. again, when the Winter Games return to Salt Lake City.",
      "A signature Bach policy also has been gender parity, with equal quotas of men and women athletes at the 2024 Paris Olympics and giving a better balance of female members of the IOC and the executive board he chairs, which now has seven women among its 15 members, including Coventry.",
      "Her win on Thursday will only add to Bach's legacy for promoting women.",
      "Coventry won back-to-back titles in 200-meters backstroke at the 2004 Athens Olympics and Beijing four years later. She joined the IOC in 2013, almost one year after a disputed athlete election at the London Olympics. Her place among the four athletes elected was eventually awarded after Court of Arbitration for Sport rulings against two opponents.",
      "The next president can oversee the IOC making a statement choice for its host for the 2036 Summer Games.",
      "\"There is one and one only,\" Samaranch said on Wednesday when asked about challenges ahead. \"We must concentrate (on) successful and relevant Olympic Games. The rest comes with success in the Games.\"",
      "The voters in the exclusive invited club of IOC members include royal family members, former lawmakers and diplomats, business leaders, sports officials and Olympic athletes. Even an Oscar-winning actress, Michelle Yeoh.",

      "Minimizing risk",
      "To reduce cancer risk, Osborn recommends that men measure their waistlines to ensure they're in a healthy range. People can also track their visceral fat score on a medical-grade anthropometry scale, he said.",
      "\"Understand that belly fat isn\u2019t just cosmetic \u2014 it\u2019s carcinogenic.\"",

      "The demand came after Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard vowed during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that there was \"no classified material\" shared in a Signal text chat that an editor from The Atlantic said he had access to. The U.S. operation against the Houthis in Yemen was reportedly discussed in the chat\u00a0between senior Cabinet officials.",

If the secretary of energy has class of sensitive classified information about our national laboratories, that's his.

Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts; this kind of password reuse was a factor in the recent\u00a023andMe data breach.

Consider signing up for an identity theft protection service that monitors personal information, such as your Social Security number, phone number and email, alerting you if this data is found on the dark web. Some identity theft services also include up to $1 million in identity theft insurance to cover losses and legal fees and a dedicated fraud resolution team with a U.S.-based case manager to help you recover any stolen assets or identity.\u00a0See my expert recommendations here: Best identity theft protection services for 2025 here.",

    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson says Apple&apos;s Passwords app had a three-month phishing flaw from iOS 18 to 18.2 patch.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Do you remember Apple\u2019s\u00a0\"Privacy. That's iPhone\" marketing campaigns? If you\u2019re not aware, the company likes to portray its products as being synonymous with privacy. However, the recent wave of security vulnerabilities affecting iPhones and Macs suggest Apple\u2019s products may not be as secure as advertised.",
      "A recent security blunder only reinforces this point. Security researchers discovered that Apple\u2019s built-in password manager app, Passwords, was vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months after launch. This meant an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as you, like at an airport or coffee shop, could redirect your browser to a lookalike phishing site to steal your login credentials.",

      "A person holding an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0Mysk, noticed that Apple's Passwords app, introduced with iOS 18 in September 2024, had a significant security flaw that left users vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months.",
      "The app used unencrypted HTTP connections instead of the more secure HTTPS to fetch logos and icons displayed alongside stored passwords. This allowed attackers on the same network, such as public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport, to intercept these requests and potentially redirect users to phishing sites designed to steal login credentials.",
      "The issue remained unresolved from iOS 18\u2019s launch in September 2024 until Apple fixed it in December 2024, leaving users exposed for nearly three months. If someone opened the Passwords app and tapped a link, like \"Change Password,\" while connected to an insecure network, an attacker could intercept the request and redirect them to a fraudulent site mimicking a legitimate one, such as a fake Yelp login page. Since the app did not enforce HTTPS, users might not notice the switch, putting their sensitive information at risk.",

      "Apple addressed the problem after security researchers from Mysk reported it in September 2024. The iOS 18.2 update, released in December, patched the vulnerability by enforcing HTTPS for all network communications within the Passwords app, making it much harder for attackers to intercept or redirect traffic.",
      "If you\u2019re using an iPhone or iPad with the Passwords app, ensure your device is updated to iOS 18.2 or later. This ensures you\u2019re protected from this vulnerability. If you haven\u2019t updated yet and used the app on public Wi-Fi between September and December 2024, consider changing passwords for any accounts you accessed during that period, just to be safe.",

      "Apple's recent security blunder with the Passwords app highlights the importance of taking steps to protect your digital identity. Here are some ways you can stay safe from hackers targeting your passwords.",
      "1) Use a reliable password manager:\u00a0Apple apps are generally more secure than third-party options, but the Passwords app clearly wasn\u2019t. The fact that the security vulnerability existed for three months before Apple fixed it proves that Apple needs to put more emphasis on keeping customer data secure. I\u2019d suggest opting for a reliable password manager instead of relying on Apple\u2019s offering. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): It\u2019s good to have a password manager, but you know what\u2019s even better? 2FA.\u00a0Adding an extra layer of security with 2FA can prevent hackers from accessing your accounts, even if they steal your password. Use authentication apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or hardware security keys instead of SMS-based codes, which are vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "3) Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities and use a VPN:\u00a0Hackers can exploit unsecured public networks to intercept your login credentials. If you must access sensitive accounts on\u00a0public Wi-Fi, use a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and prevent attackers from snooping on your data. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Beware of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0You can have all the protection in the world but a phishing email or SMS can still cause havoc. Hackers often use fake login pages to trick you into entering your credentials. Always verify URLs before entering login details, avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Keep your devices updated: Regularly\u00a0update your devices and software to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6) Regularly monitor all your accounts:\u00a0Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and report any unusual transactions or login attempts to Apple.",
      "APPLE RELEASES EMERGENCY SECURITY UPDATE FOR SERIOUS VULNERABILITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Three months is a long time for a security flaw in a password manager to go unpatched, especially from a company that presents itself as a leader in privacy and security. This incident highlights a troubling reality. Apple\u2019s security measures are not infallible, and even built-in system apps can expose users to serious risks. While the fix eventually arrived, it should not have taken this long for such a fundamental issue to be addressed. If Apple wants to maintain its privacy-first image, it needs to do better by ensuring more rigorous security testing before launch.",

The IRS has been sending out COVID-19 stimulus payments worth up to $1,400 to around 1 million tax filers who missed them. Initially, these payments were self-claimed, but now the IRS is automatically issuing them to ensure eligible taxpayers get what they\u2019re owed.",

If you were eligible but didn\u2019t receive the funds, you can still claim them by filing a tax return by April 15, 2025. Payments will be deposited directly using the banking information listed on the taxpayer's 2023 return or sent as a paper check.",
      "However, TIGTA is warning that scammers are targeting taxpayers with fraudulent text messages, as reported by\u00a0TaxAct. These fake texts claim that recipients will receive an Economic Impact Payment from the IRS and often ask for sensitive personal information, like bank account details or your Social Security number. Scammers use this information to steal your identity or financial data.",

      "2. Always verify the authenticity of unsolicited communications:\u00a0If you receive an unexpected email, text or phone call claiming to be from a government agency, it's essential to confirm its authenticity. Scammers often create a sense of urgency to trick you into taking immediate action. To verify, always use official contact details from government websites. Avoid clicking any links in the message and reach out to the agency directly to confirm whether the communication is legitimate.",
      "3. Reach out directly if you're unsure:\u00a0When you\u2019re unsure about the legitimacy of a message or request, contact the government agency directly using verified contact details. Never respond to the message or click on any links within it. By calling or visiting the agency\u2019s official website, you can ensure you\u2019re communicating with authorized representatives and avoid scammers impersonating government officials.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords to protect your accounts:\u00a0One of the best ways to protect your sensitive information from scammers is by using strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts. Avoid using easily guessable passwords like \"password123\" or \"qwerty.\" Instead, create complex passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters.",

Whether you\u2019ve received a suspicious message or believe your information has been compromised, reporting it helps prevent further harm. The IRS and other agencies have dedicated channels for reporting fraud, so take action as soon as you can to protect yourself and others from these schemes.",
      "7. Invest in personal data removal services: Use a personal data removal service to remove your personal information from data broker and people-finder sites, which scammers often use to find phone numbers and email addresses. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "8. Use direct deposit for refunds: This is the safest way to receive your tax refund, reducing the risk of mail theft, forgery or fraudulent check cashing.",
      "9. Be wary of spoofed websites: Type the address of your actual tax prep site rather than clicking on a link from an email or advertisement. Investigate the domain before entering any confidential information.",
      "10. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0An identity theft protection service provides personal and financial monitoring and will try to help you if your identity is ever compromised. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

If you receive a text message from the IRS asking you to provide personal information, it\u2019s a red flag; it\u2019s not from them. Be especially cautious of any links included in the message.

      "\"It\u2019s one of the reasons we don\u2019t operate Facebook, Instagram or our other services in China,\" Zuckerberg said. \"I wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world and I thought we might help create a more open society. I worked hard to make this happen. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in.

      "A major trigger for the opposition\u2019s push to impeach Han was his refusal to fill three vacant seats at the Constitutional Court's nine-member bench.

      "The \"Eagles of Antioch,\" is a volunteer organization made up of around 500 volunteers, operating within three primarily Christian neighborhoods in Damascus. They watch over Christian areas from dusk to dawn, patrolling the streets and protecting Christian shrines from attack.",
      "Danial Georgios, a construction engineer living in Damascus, spoke exclusively to Fox News Digital about the group's work in Damascus neighborhoods. Georgios, 30, and his Eagles of Antioch want to fill in the security gap until tensions ease.",

      "The group derives its name from the ancient city of Antioch, reflecting their deep-rooted connection to the Antiochian Patriarchate. Members hail from three main Christian denominations: Antiochian Greek Orthodox, Antiochian Melkite Catholics and Antiochian Syriac Orthodox.",
      "Members of the group patrol their communities, protecting Christian holy sites, including shrines, symbols and churches. If a site is damaged or vandalized, the group will repair it themselves, hoping to avoid an escalation into sectarian conflict between the Christian community and their Sunni neighbors.",
      "They advocate for a system based on strong municipalities, or extreme local governance, enabling Christians across Syria to manage their own affairs and celebrate their religious festivals without fear of persecution. Since emerging, the group has successfully protected liquor stores, churches, shrines and residences from theft and vandalism, according to the Eagles of Antioch.",
      "Georgios and his peers were spurred to action in December after a Christmas tree was lit on fire in Al-Sqailbiyyah, just outside Hama. Radical jihadists, according to Georgios, were responsible for the vandalism. Following the incident, He and his fellow Christians organized a mass peaceful protest inside Damascus, chanting for equal rights for all Syrians.",

      "Yet, King's organization isn't as hopeful. \"Since HTS toppled the Assad regime in December 2024, the environment has been precarious at best.

      "King's organization noted that the new interim Syrian constitution states, \"The religion of the President of the Republic is Islam,\" Article III declares, and \"Islamic jurisprudence is the principal source of legislation.\" The group says that \"this language is slightly starker than Syria\u2019s previous constitution, which cited Islamic law as simply one source among others.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Facing pressure from his right flank to take on judges who have ruled against President Donald Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Tuesday floated the possibility of Congress eliminating some federal courts.",
      "It\u2019s the latest attack from Republicans on the federal judiciary, as courts have blocked a series of actions taken by the Trump administration. In addition to funding threats, Trump and his conservative allies have called for the impeachment of certain federal judges who have ruled against him, most notably U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who attempted to halt Trump from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants.",
      "\u201cWe do have the authority over the federal courts, as you know. We can eliminate an entire district court. We have power of funding over the courts and all these other things,\u201d Johnson told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cBut desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act.\u201d",
      "Johnson, a former constitutional attorney, later clarified that he was making a point about Congress\u2019 \u201cbroad authority\u201d over the \u201ccreation, maintenance and the governance\u201d of the courts. Article III of the Constitution established the Supreme Court but gave Congress the power to \u201cordain and establish\u201d lower federal courts.",
      "Congress has eliminated courts in the past. In 1913, for example, Congress abolished the Commerce Court and its judges were redistributed to the federal appeals court, according to Congress.gov. And in 1982, Congress passed legislation abolishing the Article III Court of Claims and U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and established the Article I Court of Federal Claims and the Article III U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.",
      "House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who plans to hold a hearing focused on Boasberg and district judges next week, said he\u2019s speaking with GOP appropriators about what he called \u201clegislative remedies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe got money, spending, the appropriations process to help try to address some of this,\u201d Jordan said, without adding further details.",
      "Attempts to defund courts will be a major flashpoint in bipartisan funding negotiations for the next fiscal year. But Republicans are a long way from making good on these threats.",
      "First, they would need to convince powerful senior appropriators to strip funding for certain courts in their funding bill, in this case the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill that funds the lower courts.",
      "But the appropriations subcommittee that oversees that funding bill is chaired by Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, a former prosecutor, self-described pragmatist and one of the more moderate members of the House GOP conference.",
      "On top of that, House Republicans would need near-unanimous agreement to pass a funding bill that defunded some courts on the floor, which would be a difficult feat given their narrow majority.",
      "The Senate also would almost certainly reject any funding bill or package that defunded the courts. To pass it, Senate Republicans would need at least seven Democrats to join them to defeat a filibuster. And some Republicans might vote against such a proposal.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said eliminating a district court would create \"massive, massive backlogs\"",
      "\"My view is, I'd like to get more Republican judges on the bench,\" Hawley said. \"If we take away seats, we can't do that.\"",
      "House and Senate appropriators will be working to pass 12 funding bills before the next government shutdown deadline, at the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.",
      "Despite Tuesday's remarks, Johnson appears to be focused on a middle path to push back on federal rulings against Trump as some GOP hard-liners push for impeachment votes against some judges.",
      "In addition to the House Judiciary Committee's upcoming hearing, Johnson said the House will vote next week on a bill from Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., that would bar district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions.",
      "\u201cThe judges, especially we\u2019re talking about district court judges, are overstepping their boundaries,\u201d Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., a Johnson ally, told NBC News. \u201cAbsolutely, I appreciate\u201d the Issa bill, he added, \u201cand I may go for more, but right now, that\u2019s where I stand.\u201d"

      "Bisignano promised to \u201clead the agency in the manner that this Senate Finance Committee wants me to do\u201d and said he has no thought about slashing benefits. He made clear he reports to Trump amid questions about Musk.",
      "Republicans, meanwhile, largely avoided the issue of DOGE and its actions on Social Security, which have prompted concerns from a few House GOP lawmakers in swing districts, too.",
      "\u201cThe president of the United States has said very clearly that we are not going to cut Social Security benefits,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the chairman of the committee. \u201cAnd no matter what folks \u2014 whether it\u2019s the media or whether it is those who want to attack the administration \u2014 want to say, the reality is that it is scare tactics.\u201d",
      "Other Democrats accused Trump of lying.",

      "Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., leaned on his private sector experience to emphasize the importance of customer service, telling Bisignano it is weak at Social Security. He said he has sought to call the line and experienced unacceptably long wait times while forcing customers to listen to \u201cD-grade elevator music.\u201d",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asked Bisignano whether he will make sure the staffing at the Social Security Administration is sufficient to ensure beneficiaries can effectively use the services.",

      "\u201cMy father, a 46-year Department of Treasury employee, worked in Customs Enforcement, boarding ships early in the morning, and sometimes when I come home for days, he took pride in his job, and he was awarded the Albert Gallatin award,\u201d the nominee told the committee. \u201cI view federal workers from that vantage point.\u201d"

      "In the lawsuit, filed last year in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Rodney \u201cLil Rod\u201d Jones accused Combs of making unwanted sexual contact and forcing him to hire sex workers and participate in sex acts with them. In an amended complaint, Jones accused Combs of being part of a racketeering and conspiracy enterprise involving sex trafficking.",
      "Jones said in the lawsuit that Combs drugged and threatened him when he lived and traveled with the music mogul from September 2022 to November 2023.",
      "The lengthy suit contained graphic details and photographs and alleged Jones was not properly paid for his work as a producer on Combs\u2019 Grammy-nominated\u00a0\u201cThe Love Album: Off the Grid.\u201d",
      "Combs has denied the allegations and last year filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, saying it was overrun with \u201clegally meaningless allegations,\u201d \u201clurid theatrics\u201d and \u201cblatant falsehoods.\u201d",
      "\u201cRunning to nearly 100 pages, it includes countless tall tales, shameless celebrity namedrops, and irrelevant images,\u201d he said in the motion.",
      "In a 31-page opinion, on Monday U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken dismissed the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act allegation against Combs, his company Combs Global and his former chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, who was named as a defendant in Jones\u2019 suit.",
      "Oetken said Jones had not proven an \u201cinjury to business or property\u201d caused by a violation of the RICO Act, which describes such enterprise as one in which people or groups work to violate the act intended to target organized crime.",
      "\u201cIn sum, whether or not Jones has adequately alleged the existence of a RICO enterprise, he has not tied the activities of that enterprise to Defendants\u2019 breach of contract or any other \u2018business or property\u2019 harm incurred by Jones,\u201d Oetken wrote.",
      "Oetken also dismissed allegations involving infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract. But he ruled that allegations of sex trafficking against Combs and Khorram could proceed.",
      "Oetken declined to dismiss sexual assault and liability claims, and he admonished Jones\u2019 lawyer, Tyrone Blackburn, for his \u201cunsettling\u201d conduct in response to Combs\u2019 motion to dismiss.",
      "\u201cBlackburn\u2019s filings are replete with inaccurate statements of law, conclusory accusations, and inappropriate ad hominem attacks on opposing counsel,\u201d the judge said in his order.",
      "\u201cWhile the Court will not hold Blackburn\u2019s antics against Jones at this point, it warns Blackburn that further misconduct may lead to sanctions or to referral for discipline,\u201d Oetken said in the order.",
      "Blackburn told NBC News in response: \u201cA win is a win. We look forward to discovery.\u201d",
      "Khorram, who has been named in a couple of other sexual assault and misconduct lawsuits filed against Combs, denied any wrongdoing in a statement last week to Rolling Stone magazine.",
      "\u201cFor months, horrific accusations have been made about me in various lawsuits regarding my former boss,\u201d Khorram said in the statement. \u201cThese false allegations of my involvement are causing irreparable and incalculable damage to my reputation and the emotional well-being of myself and my family. I have never condoned or aided and abetted the sexual assault of anyone. Nor have I ever drugged anyone.\u201d",
      "Khorram did not return phone calls and emails from NBC News seeking comment.",
      "Combs, 55, is detained in Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center awaiting trial. He has pleaded not guilty and has denied any wrongdoing in the dozens of civil lawsuits men and women filed against him. His trial is scheduled to begin in May.",
      "Representatives for Combs did not immediately return a request for comment."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Facing pressure from his right flank to take on judges who have ruled against President Donald Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Tuesday floated the possibility of Congress eliminating some federal courts.",
      "It\u2019s the latest attack from Republicans on the federal judiciary, as courts have blocked a series of actions taken by the Trump administration. In addition to funding threats, Trump and his conservative allies have called for the impeachment of certain federal judges who have ruled against him, most notably U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who attempted to halt Trump from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants.",
      "\u201cWe do have the authority over the federal courts, as you know. We can eliminate an entire district court. We have power of funding over the courts and all these other things,\u201d Johnson told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cBut desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act.\u201d",
      "Johnson, a former constitutional attorney, later clarified that he was making a point about Congress\u2019 \u201cbroad authority\u201d over the \u201ccreation, maintenance and the governance\u201d of the courts. Article III of the Constitution established the Supreme Court but gave Congress the power to \u201cordain and establish\u201d lower federal courts.",
      "Congress has eliminated courts in the past. In 1913, for example, Congress abolished the Commerce Court and its judges were redistributed to the federal appeals court, according to Congress.gov. And in 1982, Congress passed legislation abolishing the Article III Court of Claims and U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, and established the Article I Court of Federal Claims and the Article III U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.",
      "House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who plans to hold a hearing focused on Boasberg and district judges next week, said he\u2019s speaking with GOP appropriators about what he called \u201clegislative remedies.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe got money, spending, the appropriations process to help try to address some of this,\u201d Jordan said, without adding further details.",
      "Attempts to defund courts will be a major flashpoint in bipartisan funding negotiations for the next fiscal year. But Republicans are a long way from making good on these threats.",
      "First, they would need to convince powerful senior appropriators to strip funding for certain courts in their funding bill, in this case the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill that funds the lower courts.",
      "But the appropriations subcommittee that oversees that funding bill is chaired by Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, a former prosecutor, self-described pragmatist and one of the more moderate members of the House GOP conference.",
      "On top of that, House Republicans would need near-unanimous agreement to pass a funding bill that defunded some courts on the floor, which would be a difficult feat given their narrow majority.",
      "The Senate also would almost certainly reject any funding bill or package that defunded the courts. To pass it, Senate Republicans would need at least seven Democrats to join them to defeat a filibuster. And some Republicans might vote against such a proposal.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said eliminating a district court would create \"massive, massive backlogs\"",
      "\"My view is, I'd like to get more Republican judges on the bench,\" Hawley said. \"If we take away seats, we can't do that.\"",
      "House and Senate appropriators will be working to pass 12 funding bills before the next government shutdown deadline, at the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.",
      "Despite Tuesday's remarks, Johnson appears to be focused on a middle path to push back on federal rulings against Trump as some GOP hard-liners push for impeachment votes against some judges.",
      "In addition to the House Judiciary Committee's upcoming hearing, Johnson said the House will vote next week on a bill from Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., that would bar district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions.",
      "\u201cThe judges, especially we\u2019re talking about district court judges, are overstepping their boundaries,\u201d Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., a Johnson ally, told NBC News. \u201cAbsolutely, I appreciate\u201d the Issa bill, he added, \u201cand I may go for more, but right now, that\u2019s where I stand.\u201d"

      "One of TV\u2019s most prolific producers, Shonda Rhimes, is back at the White House, but this time without \u201cScandal\u201d and Olivia Pope. That doesn\u2019t mean the drama has stopped. It\u2019s just wrapped in a lot of wit and humor.",
      "There\u2019s been a murder at the White House and eccentric detective Cordelia Cupp is on the job to figure out whodunit in the eight-episode Netflix series \u201cThe Residence,\u201d starring three-time Emmy winner Uzo Aduba.",
      "Cordelia Cupp arrives at the White House tasked with solving whether chief usher A.B. Wynter (an impactful Giancarlo Esposito who stepped in for the late Andre Braugher) killed himself or was murdered during a state dinner. The investigation reveals the intricate inner workings of the White House from its head chef to its janitors.",
      "Aduba told NBC News that she appreciated her character\u2019s sharp mind.",
      "\u201cI love her precision,\u201d she said during the 2025 SCAD TV Festival in Atlanta. \u201cI love how she doesn\u2019t miss a beat. She\u2019s really exacting with her words. I think she\u2019s just smart. She sees every detail in the room and is able to put together all the necessary pieces to solve the case.\u201d",
      "Cupp incorporates another passion into her detective work: \u201cShe\u2019s a bird-watcher,\u201d Aduba said. \u201cShe brings all of herself, including bird-watching, to her cases,\u201d she added. Throughout the series, the ace detective is rarely caught without her binoculars and is prone to bird-watching as she interrogates.",
      "The cast of actors\u00a0includes \u201cThis Is Us\u201d star Susan Kelechi Watson as Jasmine, who had dreamed of replacing A.B. Wynter. \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Jane Curtain plays the president\u2019s mother-in-law, while Bronson Pinchot, from the \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d franchise, is Chef Didier Gothard. Randall Park, from \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d plays skeptical FBI agent Edwin Park working alongside Cupp to solve the mystery.",
      "\u201cThe Wire\u201d alumni Edwina Findley and Isiah Whitlock, Jr., play boozy White House butler/server and Metropolitan Police Department chief respectively.\u00a0 Comedian and former Minnesota Sen. Al Franken plays a senator leading an investigation into security failings at the White House. Even pop star Kylie Minogue is in the mix.",
      "Aduba said Cupp\u2019s ability to sift through more than 150 murder suspects and a string of confusing clues comes naturally to her character.",
      "\u201cShe has absolute confidence in herself and her abilities, and will not allow anyone\u2019s idea of who she is or what she can do be the dominating factor in defining who she is,\u201d she said.",
      "Being the best at what she does, however, is not what motivates Cordelia Cupp.",
      "\u201cI think Cordelia is definitely driven by the truth,\u201d Aduba said in a Zoom interview. \u201cShe wants to get the answer. She wants to get to the root. So she\u2019ll do whatever needs to be done to chase that down. And she loves, once she has done that, having everything explained in some way. That helps to make the world make sense.\u201d",
      "Aduba said taking on the lead for \u201cThe Residence\u201d was a fulfilling job, especially under Rhimes\u2019 \u201cwarm and supportive\u201d Shondaland banner.",
      "\u201cYou can feel that from Shonda herself,\u201d Aduba said. \u201cShe does the good work, also.\u201d She added that Rhimes buoys everybody up. \u201cI know it is not by accident that they have found that success, because they operate with discipline and their modus operandi is one of excellence that continually sets the bar for the industry.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Private credit has exploded in popularity among investors, with the market soaring from $1 trillion in 2020 to $1.5 trillion at the beginning of 2024, according to alternative data provider\u00a0Preqin. The firm expects this figure to reach $2.6 trillion by 2029.",
      "But private credit investing comes with a serious catch. The returns from direct lending are taxed as ordinary income, which has a top federal tax rate of 40.8%, rather than long-term capital gains, for which rates top 23.8%.",
      "This can cost investors millions in returns. For instance, a $5 million investment in private credit could incur $4.3 million in tax drag over 10 years and $61 million over 30 years, according to Bernstein Private Wealth Management.",
      "There are several ways for investors to mitigate their tax liability. The most straightforward is investing through a Roth IRA, but these tax-advantaged accounts are\u00a0off-limits to high earners.",
      "Instead, high-net-worth investors are increasingly turning to insurance to save on taxes. Instead of investing directly in a private credit fund, they take out insurance policies that invest the premiums in a diversified portfolio of funds.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re getting taxed on the insurance product, rather than being taxed on the underlying private credit investment,\u201d said Yasho Lahiri, funds lawyer and partner at Kramer Levin.",
      "These insurance dedicated funds (IDFs) have multiplied rapidly, according to Lahiri. (The exact number is unclear as many of these funds are unregistered.)",
      "IDFs have to be diversified to meet\u00a0IRS requirements, which can mean weaker returns than picking one top-performing funds, according to Robert Dietz, national director of tax at Bernstein. However, these funds have other benefits, such as offering better liquidity than private credit funds typically do.",
      "There are two primary options for investing in an IDF. The cheapest route is taking out a private placement variable annuity (PPVA) contract with an insurance carrier. Dietz told CNBC that these\u00a0annuity policies\u00a0can make sense for clients with investible assets in the range of $5 million to $10 million.",
      "However, the income taxes\u00a0associated with that holding\u00a0are only deferred until the policy owner takes a withdrawal or surrenders the contract.",
      "\u201cAt some point someone\u2019s going to have to get hit with that deferred income tax liability,\u201d Dietz said. \u201cThat might be the individual who is purchasing the annuity if they decide to take a distribution out in the future, or it could be their beneficiaries when their beneficiaries inherit the annuity.\u201d",
      "The most tax-efficient option is taking out a\u00a0private placement life insurance\u00a0(PPLI) policy. Structured correctly, the policy owner\u2019s death benefit is untaxed when it is paid to beneficiaries.",
      "Some clients are turned off by the multimillion-dollar upfront premium\u00a0and cumbersome underwriting of PPLI policies, but it can be worth it. Dietz said the vehicles\u00a0can be a good fit for clients with at least $10 million in investible assets.",
      "\u201cIf my policy is not structured carefully, my insurance costs can get very expensive, and that can start to eat away at the benefit I\u2019m getting from that cash value accumulating in the policy,\u201d he said.",
      "Since PPLI and PPVAs are unregistered financial products, you must be an\u00a0accredited investor\u00a0or qualified purchaser to access them. Accredited investors must earn at least $200,000 annually or have a net worth of more than $1 million, not including a personal residence. For qualified purchasers, the investible asset minimum jumps to $5 million. However, these thresholds have not kept up with inflation or stock market growth, making IDFs more accessible, according to Lahiri.",
      "A powerful tax avoidance tool, PPLI can be used without IDFs and utilized to pass down a wide array of assets, including entire businesses, tax-free. It has caught the attention of Congress, with an\u00a0investigation\u00a0by the Senate Committee on Finance describing the PPLI industry as \u201cat least a $40 billion tax shelter used exclusively by only a few thousand wealthy Americans.\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., then chair of the committee, drafted a\u00a0proposal\u00a0in December to curb the tax advantages of PPLI, however that bill is unlikely to pass with a Republican-controlled Congress.",
      "The talk of potential legislation only briefly put clients off PPLI last year, according to Dietz. Client demand for private credit and tax-efficient ways to get a piece of the action is only increasing.",
      "\u201cFamily offices and ultra-high-net-worth clients are looking for ways to maximize after-tax returns, and the low-hanging fruit \u2014 the long-only equity portfolios and tax-loss harvesting \u2014 has already been implemented,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely having more conversations with clients around this.\u201d",

      "The TODAY contributor writes about the heartbreak of going through a public divorce from the actor and former California governor in her new book of poems, \"I Am Maria.\"",
      "Shriver, 69, wrote in her new book's introduction about a moment after she learned Schwarzenegger had been involved in a sexual relationship with their housekeeper that produced a son, Joseph Baena, now 27.",
      "\"As I sat on the hotel room floor in the dark, terrified and alone with tears streaming down my face, I thought to myself: Maria, this doesn't have to be the end of the you. It can't be the end of you. Make it a new beginning of you,\" she wrote.",
      "Shriver discussed that moment with close friend Oprah Winfrey on the March 25 episode of the \u201cOprah\u201d podcast, saying, \"It\u2019s still an emotional thing for me, but I wanted to pick myself up. I wanted to be more open. I wanted to come out from behind whatever padded door I was living behind.",
      "\"I wanted to know how that had happened to me. I wanted to know who I could be moving forward,\" she continued. \"I wanted to show my daughters and my boys that I could hold myself up with my shoulders back, that I could heal.\"",
      "Shriver told Winfrey she really didn't \"know how to heal\" at the time, but was determined to do so both for her kids and for herself.",
      "\"I had just started going to therapy at the end of my marriage so I had not been someone who had been in therapy,\" she explained. \"I had not been someone who was on the healing path of life. And I went all in.\"",
      "Shriver, who put her broadcast journalism career on the back burner while Schwarzenegger was in office, recalled that until the couple's painful breakup, she was \"playing all the roles\" in life.",
      "\"I was being a daughter. I was being a journalist. I was being a mother,\" she said, adding, \"It's a lot. Everybody I talk to who's trying to raise kids, take care of parents, work themselves, be a good wife \u2014 you're not really thinking about a lot of other things.\"",
      "Winfrey recalled that in 2011, on the day the story about Schwarzenegger's affair went public in the media, Shriver, who had known about his betrayal for a while by that point, was scheduled to appear at a live taping for the last episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\"",
      "\"I have never seen a friend like you,\" said Winfrey. \"Because on the night that you knew that was going to be going public, you came and you showed up for me ... and I don't know how you did that. You weren't even in your right mind.\"",
      "Shriver responded, \"I wanted to be there for you because you had been there for me,\" adding that \"showing up\" for the people she loves is important to her.",
      "Shriver and Schwarzenegger tied the knot in 1986 after several years of dating. Shriver filed for\u00a0divorce in 2011 and the divorce was\u00a0finalized in 2021.",
      "The former couple share kids Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt, 35,\u00a0Christina Schwarzenegger, 33,\u00a0Patrick Schwarzenegger, 31, and\u00a0Christopher Schwarzenegger, 27.",
      "During a May 2023 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the former governor called his divorce from Shriver \u201cmy failure.\u201d",
      "The action star noted it was a coincidence that he played a divorced CIA operative who was unfaithful to his wife in his new Netflix series \u201cFubar.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut in (my real-life marriage to Shriver), it was my f---up. It was my failure,\u201d Schwarzenegger said. \u201cAlso, in the show, he\u2019s deep down still in love with his wife.\u201d",
      "Schwarzenegger, who's been dating physical therapist Heather Milligan for more than a decade, added that he still loves Shriver. \"She and I are really good friends and very close, and we are very proud of the way we raised our kids,\" he said."

      "Ben Affleck has opened up about his divorce from Jennifer Lopez for the first time.",
      "Affleck spoke about the divorce in an interview with GQ published on March 25, when he was talking about how he presents himself to the public.",
      "\"My life is actually pretty drama-free,\" Affleck said. \"And so even if I have the same events that people have \u2014 I\u2019m sure in your mind you\u2019re thinking, Oh, well, you just got divorced. That\u2019s not drama-free.",
      "\"And I understand that instinct, but all of this is pretty adult, and for all the sensational stuff that gets written, if somebody sat down and talked to me about it, and I said, 'Well, this is really the experience,' their eyes would glaze over with boredom,\" he continued.",
      "The interviewer said he was thinking about Lopez's documentary \"The Greatest Love Story Never Told,\" in which the premise was about the idea that Lopez and Affleck are private people but have public dimensions, and that Lopez was going to put more of herself and Affleck out there in the documentary.",
      "Affleck's response to the assertion was captured on camera, which the interviewer noted.",
      "\"Part of it was, 'Okay, if I\u2019m going to participate in this, I want to try to do it in an honest way and in a way that\u2019s interesting.' Because I thought it was an interesting examination,\" Affleck told GQ.",
      "\"Like I mentioned to you before, there are a lot of people who I think have handled celebrity more adeptly and more adroitly than I have, Jennifer among them,\" he continued. \"My temperament is to be a little bit more reserved and private than hers.\"",
      "Affleck said that he and his ex-wife didn't always have the same attitude toward fame.",
      "\"And so I thought, Oh, this is interesting because how do you reconcile that? Because exactly what you said is true. I love and support this person. I believe in them. They\u2019re great. I want people to see that,\" he said.",
      "Affleck referenced a line he said in the documentary: \"You don\u2019t marry a ship captain and then say, 'Well, I don\u2019t like going out in the water.'\"",
      "\"You\u2019ve got to own what you knew going into any relationship,\" he said. \"And I think it\u2019s important to say that wasn\u2019t the cause of some major fracture. It\u2019s not like you can watch that documentary and go, 'Oh, now I understand the issues that these two had.'\"",
      "Affleck and the interviewer met again a few days later, and Affleck brought up his comments about Lopez again when asked how he felt about the previous conversation.",
      "\"Well, on the one hand there\u2019s the first feeling, which is like, well, I hope I was clear about, when you asked me about Jen and the documentary and I talked about that and my sort of personal life a little bit, which I don\u2019t mind doing as long as my actual feelings and intentions and beliefs are communicated, which I hope I was clear that really this is somebody I have a lot of respect for,\" he said.",
      "\"And I get wanting to divine or explore the kind of differences in perspective that we have in terms of how a person feels comfortable approaching the line between public and private life,\" he continued. \"But I really hope that whatever you use doesn\u2019t suggest that I have any negativity or judgment or anything regarding that. I have nothing but respect.\"",
      "Affleck said there can be a tendency to look at a breakup and want to identify \"root causes.\"",
      "\"But honestly, like I said, the truth is much more quotidian than probably people would believe or would be interesting,\" he said.",
      "The interviewer asked to clarify that there wasn't one major thing that led to their breakup, which Affleck confirmed.",
      "\"Yeah, there\u2019s no scandal, no soap opera, no intrigue,\" he said. \"The truth is, when you talk to somebody, 'Hey, what happened?' Well, there is no: 'This is what happened.' It\u2019s just a story about people trying to figure out their lives and relationships in ways that we all sort of normally do.",
      "\"And as you get older, this is true for me, I assume it\u2019s true for most people, there is no 'So-and-so did this' or 'This was the big event.' It\u2019s really, it sounds more like a couple\u2019s therapy session, which \u2014 you would tune out of someone else\u2019s couple\u2019s therapy after a while,\" he added. \"For one thing, you start going, 'Okay, clearly this person has got\u00a0these\u00a0issues. Clearly they have\u00a0these\u00a0issues.' And the reason I don\u2019t want to share that is just sort of embarrassing. It feels vulnerable.\"",
      "Lopez, 55, filed for divorce from Affleck, 52, in August 2024, two years after they married. Lopez cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split, according to court documents obtained by TODAY.com.",

      "It\u2019s been 20 years since \u201cThe Office\u201d premiered, with the pilot airing March 24, 2005. It ran for nine seasons before signing off in 2013, with the love story between Jim and Pam one of the show\u2019s central plotlines over the years.",
      "In the episode with the teapot, Jim gives it to Pam, filling it with mementoes of inside jokes between them, as well as a note he wrote for her. The Secret Santa goes sideways, though, when Steve Carell's Michael Scott turns it into a Yankee Swap, enabling others to steal presents. Pam eventually gets the teapot back, but Jim removes the note. Pam would later find out about the note and read it during an episode of \u201cThe Office\u2019s\u201d ninth and final season.",

      "\u201cIn that episode in season nine, I believe (\u2018The Office\u2019 writer and producer) Greg (Daniels) suggested to John that he write a personal message from himself to me just saying what our time together on \u2018The Office\u2019 meant to him,\u201d Fischer said while choking up during a 2020 episode of her podcast, \u201cOffice Ladies,\u201d that she hosts with co-star Angela Kinsey. \u201cWe were wrapping up the series, and we were all so emotional at that time.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd so, that was his goodbye,\u201d she added.",
      "While Krasinski may have wound up with the teapot, Fischer didn\u2019t leave the show empty-handed. She said she still has her Dundie Awards trophies, among other things.",
      "\u201cI have both (Dundies), for Longest Engagement and Whitest Sneakers. I kept a bunch of stuff,\u201d she told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI kept one of Pam\u2019s sweaters and one of her shirts. I kept her watch, her purse, and I kept the necklace that she wore for Jim and Pam\u2019s wedding.\u201d",
      "Fischer calls the items she kept \u201clittle treasures,\u201d noting she also has the yogurt lid that doubled as a medal during the impromptu Olympics the office held, as well as some more minor items.",
      "\u201cI kept this pen that was on her desk. It doesn\u2019t even work, but I kept it,\u201d she said before mentioning another item fans may not remember.",
      "\u201cThis cup was Pam\u2019s cup on the show, and in the ninth season, it fell off the desk and broke. But the crew knew that I had wanted to take it, and so they glued it back together for me. I can\u2019t use it, but I have it,\u201d she said.",
      "Krasinski also got a big haul, thanks to Shea.",
      "\u201c(Phil sent) things he thought I\u2019d like to have, and it was a veritable treasure chest with my bag from the show, my name plate from my desk, even the copy of \u2018The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert\u2019 comic book,\u2019\u201d Krasinski added.",
      "\u201cThe Office\u201d continues to live on today, even among the cast.",
      "\u201cWe have an \u2018Office\u2019 text thread. We get emails from Greg Daniels, and it\u2019s a really special community of people, and we will be bonded for life,\u201d Fischer said.",

      "For now, Tom's schedule is pretty packed with her work on \"B&B.\" Although writing, directing and starring in an episode was no small feat for the actor, she\u2019s excited to tackle the challenge again one day.",
      "\u201cI certainly would welcome doing it again.\u00a0But in the meantime, I am directing and still writing and still acting on the show. So I am doing all three, just not at once,\u201d she says."

      "Negotiators had agreed both countries would \u201censure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea,\u201d the White House said in two separate statements.",
      "Both statements also said that Russia and Ukraine would stop striking each other's energy facilities.",
      "The announcement came after American officials met separately with Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh.",

      "In the second statement, the White House said the U.S. and Ukraine had agreed that America \u201cremains committed to helping achieve the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees, and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe will need clear guarantees. And given the sad experience of agreements with just Kyiv, the guarantees can only be the result of an order from Washington to Zelenskyy and his team to do one thing and not the other,\u201d he added.",

      "While the challenge is yet to be accepted, it\u2019s an\u00a0idea with deep\u00a0 roots in the Soviet era, when hockey became a proxy arena in which to address geopolitical tensions. Most notably for Americans, the 1980 \u201cMiracle on Ice\u201d saw a largely amateur American team defeat the mighty Soviet \u201cRed Machine.\u201d",
      "But rather than seeking \u201cwar by other means\u201d \u2014 as the sport is often known \u2014 Russia\u2019s hockey fanatic leader likely wants to use the rink as a way to end his country\u2019s pariah status, both in terms of politics and sports, experts say.",
      "\u201cPutin\u2019s overarching goal is to break out of diplomatic isolation,\u201d said Gary Smith, a former Canadian diplomat posted to Moscow who understands hockey diplomacy better than most.",
      "As a young career diplomat in Moscow in 1972, Smith was central to brokering the epic \u201cSummit Series\u201d that helped build relations between the Soviet Union and Canada.",
      "\u201cThis is a clever move by Putin,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cSports and hockey in particular are very important to him,\u201d added Smith, who recounted his tale in the book \"Ice War Diplomat: Hockey meets Cold War Politics at the 1972 Summit Series.\"",
      "These overtures are part of a rapid warming between Moscow and Washington during Trump\u2019s\u00a0second term.",
      "Until now, Russia has endured outcast status in the West following Putin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The United States led Western countries in festooning even more sanctions on the Kremlin. Multinational companies and their consumers levied boycotts and protests. And sporting organizations \u2014 including hockey \u2014 banned athletes from Russia and its ally Belarus.",
      "In the past few months, however, Trump has held several calls with his Russian counterpart, offering valuable concessions in his attempt to end the war. Russia watchers believe that the Kremlin sees in Trump a unique opportunity to repeal sanctions against it while achieving a favorable outcome in ceasefire negotiations.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the Kremlin said that during their most recent call Trump \u201csupported\u201d Putin\u2019s idea to organize hockey games between Russian and American players in the NHL and Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, or KHL. As in the Summit Series of 1972, these matches should be played in both countries, the Kremlin said.",
      "Asked about this Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said hockey was mentioned during the call, but brushed off the idea: \u201cWe\u2019re more interested in securing a peace deal than scheduling hockey games right now.\u201d",
      "Throughout history, however, sports and diplomacy have been far from mutually exclusive: see also the \u201cpingpong\u201d diplomacy that paved the way for President Richard Nixon\u2019s visit to Beijing in 1972.",
      "\u201cI think the hockey talk is smart strategy by Putin,\u201d said Lawrence Martin, author of \u201cThe Red Machine: the Soviet Quest to Dominate Canada\u2019s Game.\u201d \u201cSport lowers the political temperature. It helps normalize relations between adversaries.\u201d",
      "Putin likely hopes these matches will help \u201callay America\u2019s traditional hostility to Russia and add another strand to the alliance that he and Trump are creating by generating a sense of camaraderie and partnership between their populations,\u201d said Roy MacSkimming, author of the book \u201cCold War: The Amazing Canada-Soviet Hockey Series of 1972.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI think Putin is once again trying to use his influence or hold over Trump, whichever it is, to cozy up to Americans by proposing these hockey games.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, both on the prospect of Russo-American hockey games and criticisms that Trump has been overly warm to Putin, National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes told NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump is the only American president strong enough to look both friends and adversaries in the eyes and make deals that put America First.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Putin\u2019s suggestion serves as \u201ca useful reminder that what the Kremlin wants is not only \u2014 perhaps even mainly \u2014 a resolution of the war in Ukraine but a wider normalization of relations with the USA,\u201d said Mark Galeotti, a Putin expert who heads the British consultancy Mayak Intelligence.",
      "It\u2019s not just sanctions and business interests. Putin dearly wants to end Russia\u2019s exile from major sporting competitions \u2014 first imposed in 2019 over allegations of state-sponsored doping, and then in 2022 in reaction to his invasion of Ukraine.",
      "One governing body that banned Russian athletes was the International Ice Hockey Federation, or IIHF, which covers the Olympics and World Championships.",
      "\u201cWe have just become aware of the conversation between President Trump and President Putin,\u201d the NHL said in a statement sent to The Associated Press. \u201cObviously, we were not a party to those discussions, and it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d",

      "\u201cAny North American player who competes against a banned team runs the risk of personal ineligibility,\u201d he said, raising skepticism about whether the games will actually ever play out.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s top intelligence officials claimed on Tuesday that they did not share any classified materials in a group text about U.S. military plans that inadvertently included a journalist.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe both downplayed the mishap during a contentious Senate Intelligence Committee hearing a day after The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he had been added to a text thread about U.S. military plans to strike Houthi militias in Yemen.",
      "The incident has raised questions about the Trump administration\u2019s handling of classified information as well as its use of Signal and other electronic communications.",
      "In testimony, Ratcliffe acknowledged he was on the text chain but said it was \u201clawful.\u201d He said the Signal app was loaded on his work computer at the CIA when he started the job and claimed it was permitted as a communication tool for work purposes.",
      "He did not address whether it was appropriate to share detailed military plans on Signal.",
      "Gabbard, asked by Democrats whether the timing and location of planned military strikes were shared on the chat, replied: \u201cI can attest to the fact that there were not classified or intelligence equities that were included in that chat group at any time.\u201d",
      "Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the magazine and a veteran national security journalist, reported that the thread on the encrypted messaging application Signal appeared to include Ratcliffe and Gabbard as well as Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.",
      "The military plan discussed in the group chat \u201cincluded precise information about weapons packages, targets and timing,\u201d Goldberg wrote. He said he would refrain from reporting specific information shared in the Signal chat that could potentially damage national security.",
      "In an exchange with Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Gabbard said she did not remember discussion of specific weapons, targets or timing.",
      "The intelligence officials both testified Tuesday that Hegseth was the \u201coriginal classifying authority\u201d on the Signal chat. Goldberg reported that one message from a Signal account labeled \u201cPete Hegseth\u201d contained \u201coperational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.\u201d",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard, responding to a question from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said they would cooperate with an \u201caudit\u201d looking into whether they had used Signal or another messaging platform to discuss classified information.",
      "In a statement Monday, the National Security Council said it was \u201creviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.\u201d",
      "Gabbard would not answer questions regarding whether she was using her personal phone or her government-issued phone, citing the fact that the Signal issue was \u201cunder review.\u201d",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel, one of the other witnesses at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, said he had been briefed on the incident on Monday night and did not say whether he planned to open an investigation.",
      "The hearing frequently grew heated. Democrats asked aggressive questions and accused the witnesses of jeopardizing national security.",
      "Wyden said he believes Hegseth and Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz, should resign. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking Democrat on the intelligence committee, said it was \u201cmind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line and nobody even bothered to check\u201d whether a journalist or another unauthorized person was in the chat.",
      "In an opening statement, Warner blasted the Trump administration for what he characterized as a \u201ccavalier attitude towards classified information,\u201d describing it as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201csloppy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Signal fiasco is not a one-off,\u201d Warner added. \u201cIt is, unfortunately, a pattern we\u2019re seeing too often repeated.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe unwillingness of the individuals on this panel who were on the chat to even apologize for acknowledging what a colossal screw-up this is speaks volumes,\u201d Warner added.",
      "Warner cited an earlier incident in January when the CIA, complying with a presidential executive order, sent an unclassified email to the Office of Personnel Management with the first names and initialized last names of recently hired employees at the spy agency.",
      "Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., grilled Ratcliffe on whether Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow when the group chat conversation transpired.",
      "\u201cThis sloppiness, this incompetence, this disrespect for our intelligence agencies and the personnel who work for him is entirely unacceptable. It\u2019s an embarrassment,\u201d Bennet said. He added: \u201cYou need to do better. You need to do better.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., the chairman of the intelligence committee, did not directly address the Signal text chain in his prepared opening remarks. Republican senators largely focused their questions on other issues, including drug cartels and China.",
      "Trump, speaking to NBC News by phone earlier Tuesday, stood by Waltz. Goldberg reported that he was added to the Signal chat after receiving a request from a user identified as Waltz.",
      "\u201cMichael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he\u2019s a good man,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Speaking from the White House in a lengthy back-and-forth with reporters on Tuesday, Trump downplayed the events and said the chat contained \u201cno classified information, as I understand it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey were using an app, as I understand it, that a lot of people in government use, a lot of people in the media use,\u201d he said.",
      "Waltz, who was in the room for a meeting of ambassadors, defended himself amid repeated questions about when Trump learned of the chat and how. Waltz said they planned to look into how Goldberg got added to the chat and whether Signal is secure enough to use for high-level discussions.",
      "\"We are we have our technical experts looking at it,\" he said. \"We have our legal teams looking at it. And of course, we\u2019re going to keep everything as secure as possible.\"",
      "Trump said he didn\u2019t want Waltz to be \"hurt\" by the breach and saw no need for him to apologize, even as the president said aides would \"probably\" not use Signal any longer.",
      "\"If it was up to me, everybody would be sitting in a room together,\" Trump said. \"The room would have solid lead walls and a lead ceiling and a lead floor. But you know, life doesn\u2019t always let you do that.\""

      "Jaime Ortega, who says he represents 30 of the imprisoned Venezuelans, said they filed the habeas corpus petition with the Supreme Court\u2019s Constitutional Chamber. He said that by extension they requested that it be applied to all Venezuelans detained in El Salvador.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s promises of a hasty end to the war in Ukraine were given a hard reality check Tuesday, with Russian officials saying that the latest round of ceasefire talks with the United States ended without a written agreement and the Kremlin continuing to bomb Ukraine.",
      "The media had been briefed to expect a statement following discussions in Saudi Arabia, but no such written conclusion was released. In an interview with Russian state television, the first deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s defense committee, Vladimir Chizhov, blamed the position taken by Ukraine.",

      "As the families of the dead released a statement Monday seeking answers one month since their bodies were discovered in their hotel room, the country's top police official said the resort has temporarily ceased operation.",
      "\"It was agreed a second round of testing be done at the hotel,\" Police Commissioner Chester Williams said last week at an impromptu news conference captured on video by television station 7 News Belize.",

      "Ukraine has increasingly attempted to defend itself by returning fire, and the Russian Minister of Defense said Kremlin forces had intercepted and destroyed 28 drones sent into Russia on Sunday and overnight into Monday.",

      "\u201cNo matter what we talk about with our partners, we need to push Putin to give a real order to stop the strikes: whoever brought this war must take it away.\u201d",
      "There is also an apparent discrepancy in terms of what the three parties say is on the table. The White House has said that \u201cenergy and infrastructure\u201d would be covered by the agreement, while the Kremlin phrases this as \u201cenergy infrastructure.\u201d Zelenskyy has since said he would also like railways and ports to be protected.",
      "On March 11, Putin said he would accept a partial 30-day ceasefire covering energy infrastructure but included demands that would be so punishing for Kyiv as to be tantamount to surrender.",
      "Ukraine is also concerned that an agreement for unrestricted trade with the European Union, of which it is not a member, is set to end June 5.",
      "While Ukrainian finance minister Serhiy Marchenko told the Financial Times that the deal's expiration would damage Ukraine's economy, some E.U. member states have recently opposed the agreement \u2014\u00a0made after Russia's invasion in February 2022 \u2014\u00a0as hurting their own economies."
