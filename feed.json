      "LOS ANGELES -- Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez steadies her violin and scans the crowd from the sixth floor of SoFi Stadium as 70,000 fans stream into a Los Angeles Rams home game. Below her, blue-and-gold jerseys mix with charro suits and sombreros, and the low rumble of pregame noise swells into the opening notes of the late Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s \u201cCrazy Train\u201d reimagined through trumpets, guitarr\u00f3n and vihuela.",
      "On Hern\u00e1ndez's right, rock guitarist Nita Strauss cuts through with an electric solo as the several-piece mariachi ensemble locked into rhythm. On the concourse, fans stop mid-step, phones raised, caught by the unlikely fusion of rock, mariachi and football.",
      "At games, it's not unusual to hear Kendrick Lamar,Bad Bunny and Beyonc\u00e9's music blaring through the speakers. But the Mariachi Rams are reshaping the sound of NFL game day, blending traditional Mexican music with Los Angeles\u2019 hip-hop and rock influences in a way no other team in the league does.",
      "\u201cMariachi music has so much flexibility and I think that\u2019s special because we get to show how versatile mariachi music is to the NFL audience,\u201d says Hern\u00e1ndez, who is the only woman in the NFL\u2019s first official mariachi band. She's the daughter of Mariachi legend Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez, who built the ensemble when he partnered with the Rams in 2019.",
      "In one moment, they play classic mariachi standards. In the next, they are turning Tupac Shakur\u2019s \u201cCalifornia Love\u201d into a brass-heavy anthem as a lowrider car bounces nearby while fans roar from the stands.",
      "\u201cThe things that come out of our communities, all of our communities, we all represent each other,\u201d says rapper Xzibit, who performed with the USC Marching Band at halftime during the Rams game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He says seeing the Mariachi Rams on the NFL stage speaks to how the culture moves through the city without boundaries.",
      "\u201cTo be brought into something where culture is embraced on that level,\u201d Xzibit says. \u201cThat's when you feel like you're part of something that matters.\u201d",
      "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez didn\u2019t land in the Mariachi Rams by accident.",
      "A Rams staffer approached him several years ago with a video of a mariachi group performing at a major soccer match and asked a simple question: \u201cCould this work for football?\u201d recalled the Grammy-nominated musician and founder of Mariachi Sol de Mexico and Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles, an all-female mariachi ensemble that includes Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez didn't hesitate. He believed it could work with the right musicians and musical range. What followed was the formation of a 10-member ensemble built to bridge tradition and modern Los Angeles sound, performing classic mariachi standards alongside reimagined pop and hip-hop anthems from \u201cEl Rey\u201d to Tupac's \u201cCalifornia Love.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's pride and passion,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez says.",
      "The Mariachi Rams are made up of:",
      "Santiago Espinoza (vihuela), Mateo Real (guitar), Joshua Gutierrez (guitarr\u00f3n), Kevin Ramirez (trumpet), Christopher Rubalcava (trumpet), Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez (violin), Adrian Arias (violin), Ricardo Rios (violin), Ricardo Cisneros (violin) and Joaquin Telles (violin).",

      "\u201cWhen they see young musicians on that jumbotron at SoFi playing songs they completely connect with, you can't even imagine the pride they feel,\u201d he says.",
      "While other NFL teams, including the Houston Texans, now feature mariachi bands as part of their cultural programming, the Rams were the first to embed a mariachi ensemble as a recurring game-day element when they launched the Mariachi Rams six years ago. Since then, a handful of teams have followed.",
      "Behind the stadium lights and viral halftime moments are musicians who spend most of their week far from the field teaching students, working in offices, designing graphics or performing in classical orchestras across Southern California.",
      "Several members of the Mariachi Rams teach through Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s mariachi academy. Others balance careers in education, banking, graphic design and orchestral performance before transforming into stadium entertainers on Sundays.",

      "The band\u2019s presence has become so baked into the Rams\u2019 game-day rhythm that fans immediately sense when something changes.",

It's a staple across various neighborhoods through quincea\u00f1eras, weddings, parades, street festivals and championship celebrations. Bringing that sound into SoFi Stadium, Daly says, was about introducing something new to the city in hopes of reflecting what was already there.",
      "\u201cOur main logo is the two letters \u2018Los Angeles.\u2019 It\u2019s LA, right?\u201d Daly says. \u201cYou can\u2019t not celebrate Mexican American culture if you\u2019re an Angeleno. If you don\u2019t understand Mexican American culture, you\u2019re probably not going win over this market.\u201d",
      "For Crystal Hern\u00e1ndez, the meaning of the Mariachi Rams stretches beyond music and game day. It\u2019s about visibility in a space that has rarely made room for women.",
      "\u201cIt makes people feel seen,\u201d she says of the band\u2019s presence at SoFi. \u201cIt makes them feel excited to see that their home team, the Rams, recognizes that and embraces it.\u201d",
      "As the only woman in the group, Hern\u00e1ndez says she stands at the intersection of tradition and change. For her father, the moment is deeply personal, saying she broke the mold for his family's seven generations of male musicians.",
      "Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez believes the band can break barriers too.",

      "NAPLES, Italy -- At long last, vindication is at hand for an Oscar-winning composer who sought to prove he was just as capable of breathing life into Italy\u2019s grand theaters as gritty Hollywood films.",
      "On Friday night, Naples\u2019 Teatro San Carlo will stage Ennio Morricone\u2019s only opera, \u201cPartenope,\u201d three full decades after its composition. It is inspired by the mythical siren who drowned herself after failing to enchant Ulysses, her body washing ashore and becoming a settlement that grew over millennia into the seaside city of Naples.",
      "When Morricone wrote \u201cPartenope\u201d in 1995, he was already the world-famous creator of the theme to the Spaghetti Western \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d and haunting soundtracks for epic films such as \u201cThe Untouchables\u201d and \u201cOnce Upon a Time in America.\u201d",
      "He earned an Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2007, but his compositions never resounded in the hallowed halls of opera houses \u2014 viewed in his home country as the elite musical echelon. To his great chagrin, Partenope gathered dust for decades; Morricone died without seeing it performed.",
      "\u201cIn the end, he read as a sign of destiny the fact he would not make his debut in the opera world,\u201d Alessandro De Rosa, a close collaborator who coauthored Morricone's autobiography, said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m sure that if he were alive now, he would have taken the challenge and would have dialogued with the orchestra and the director, tirelessly, like a young kid.\u201d",
      "Director Vanessa Beecroft and conductor Riccardo Frizza had to find their way through the visionary work without the benefit of those notes.",
      "\u201cIt would have been wonderful to be able to talk to Morricone about his musical choices \u2026 but we had to understand them from what he left us and tried to interpret them in the best way,\u201d Frizza said.",
      "For instance, he chose not to use violins in this orchestra, instead favoring flutes, harps and horns, which appear in Greek mythology, Frizza explained.",
      "\u201cThen you have the modern instruments, lots of percussion, with the Neapolitan sounds provided by tambourines and putipu\u2019,\u201d he added, referencing a friction drum used in local folk music.",
      "Teatro San Carlo was filled with anticipation on Thursday evening as Neapolitans attended an open rehearsal. Free tickets were snapped up in just a few hours.",
      "\u201cIt was such a long wait, that\u2019s why we are here today,\u201d said middle-aged Alfonso Ieneroso as he entered the theater.",
      "The mythical Partenope is part of Naples\u2019 culture, with tradition suggesting her voice represents the city\u2019s enduring spirit. The original Greek settlement was named for her. She is depicted at monuments like the Fontana della Sirena, a fountain that has become one of the city's symbols. Young children all along the Gulf of Naples, living under Mount Vesuvius\u2019 shadow, learn the legend of Partenope from their parents.",

      "Naples has also been celebrating its 2,500th anniversary this year, and Morricone\u2019s opera marks the culmination of festivities. The protagonist in his adaptation is a woman who, after her husband dies and she is separated from her best friend, refuses the consolation of being transformed into a distant constellation. Instead, she asks the gods to let her stretch her wings along the gulf on which an immortal city will arise.",
      "The production explores the link between the ancient legend and the modern city\u2019s identity, as two sopranos embody Partenope simultaneously, reflecting her dual nature as body and myth.",
      "Morricone originally composed the one-act opera \u2014 free of charge \u2014 to accompany a libretto by authors Guido Barbieri and Sandro Cappelletto for a small festival in Positano, just south of Naples on the Amalfi coast. But it was not to be: the festival went bankrupt and Partenope was shelved.",
      "There were several attempts to revive their work, including one between 1998 and 2000 with the Teatro Massimo of Palermo. But that project ultimately ran aground when a director couldn\u2019t be secured.",
      "\u201cIn those years Morricone had the torment of not being accepted as a composer of what he called \u2018absolute music,\u2019 as he was identified with his popular movie scores,\u201d Barbieri, one of the libretto\u2019s authors, said in an interview. Cappelletto said that, in a conversation with the two authors in 2017, three years before his death, Morricone appeared \u201cat peace\u201d with his music career.",
      "Partenope has inspired several productions over the centuries, including operas by renowned composers George Frideric Handel and Antonio Vivaldi in the 18th century, and a 2024 movie by Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino. Morricone\u2019s work is finally coming alive to join their ranks.",

      "Charli XCX is heading to the Sundance Film Festival in January 2026",
      "Charli XCX is making a trip to the Sundance Film Festival in January. The pop singer-songwriter appears in three films premiering at the 2026 festival, including a mockumentary that she produced and stars in. Programmers on Wednesday unveiled a lineup of 90 feature films set for the festival\u2019s last hurrah in Park City, Utah.",
      "The slate includes documentaries on basketball great Brittney Griner, Nelson Mandela, Salman Rushdie, Courtney Love and Billie Jean King. There are starry features with the likes of Natalie Portman, Jenna Ortega, Seth Rogen, Channing Tatum, Danielle Brooks, Olivia Colman, Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Ethan Hawke. Olivia Wilde directs her first feature since \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling,\u201d in \u201cThe Invite.\u201d Judd Apatow chronicles comedian Maria Bamford\u2019s mental health journey. And Gregg Araki will be back in Park City with a restoration of his 2004 coming-of-age drama \u201cMysterious Skin\u201d and a new film as well.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a broad, eclectic and bold program,\u201d Sundance public programming director Eugene Hernandez told The Associated Press. He said the lineup for the festival's final year in Park City \u201creally honors that well with this mixture of new, exciting voices paired with some really, really great familiar faces from Sundances past that I think will create a great alchemy for this really unique edition in Utah.\u201d",
      "Ever a festival of discovery, of the 90 features culled from 4,255 submissions, 40% are from first-time directors. The programmers laugh when they hear people say things like \u201cthat\u2019s a Sundance movie,\u201d as if it\u2019s one, easily categorizable thing.",
      "\u201cI look at the films in this program and say, \u2018You tell me what a Sundance film is\u2019 because they\u2019re so different,\u201d said programmer John Nein.",
      "Charli XCX plays a rising pop star prepping for her first arena tour in the mockumentary \u201cThe Moment,\u201d which Hernandez said is \u201clike her version of \u2018This is Spinal Tap\u2019.\u201d She also appears in Araki\u2019s \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d in which Cooper Hoffman plays an intern who gets wrapped up in the world of an artist and provocateur (Wilde). And she\u2019s among the ensemble of \u201cThe Gallerist.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of humor that she has about herself and her work, but also a creativity and a star quality that is apparent. I mean, she is magnetic on the screen,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to have someone who represents sort of a next generation of creativity embracing the world that we inhabit.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s slate includes more than a few exciting comedies in unexpected places. Cathy Yan directed and co-wrote \u201cThe Gallerist,\u201d a satirical look at the art world and attempting to sell a corpse at Art Basel Miami, with a large ensemble including Portman, Ortega, Sterling K. Brown and Zach Galifianakis. David Wain also has \u201cGail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass\u201d about a woman out to even the score after her fiance uses the \u201cfree pass,\u201d starring Zoey Deutch and Jon Hamm.",
      "Programmer Kim Yutani said she thinks \u201cWicker,\u201d about a woman who asks a basket maker to weave her a husband, starring Colman and Skarsg\u00e5rd, will be a big crowd pleaser.",
      "Other standouts are Jay Duplass\u2019s grief-themed \u201cSee You When I See You,\u201d with Cooper Raiff and David Duchovny, \u201cHa-Chan, Shake Your Booty!\u201d set inside Tokyo\u2019s ballroom dance scene and Wilde\u2019s \u201cThe Invite,\u201d about a crumbling marriage in which she stars alongside Rogen.",
      "\u201cThey are finding comedy in some of the toughest places,\u201d Nein said.",
      "In the Midnight section, there\u2019s \u201cBuddy,\u201d from \u201cToo Many Cooks\u201d creator Casper Kelly, about a girl who has to escape a kids TV show. There are some quirky, humorous documentaries too, including \u201cJoybubbles\u201d and John Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe History of Concrete.\u201d",
      "Sundance has become famous for its documentary programming, many of which go on to be nominated for and win Oscars. This year is likely to be no different.",

      "The six nominees for the inaugural best podcast award are \u201cArmchair Expert with Dax Shepard,\u201d \u201cCall Her Daddy,\u201d \u201cGood Hang with Amy Poehler,\u201d \u201cThe Mel Robbins Podcast,\u201d \u201cSmartLess\u201d and \u201cUp First,\u201d from NPR. Representing a mix of news, advice and celebrity interviews, they were drawn from a shortlist of 25 programs the Globes had previously deemed eligible.",
      "The nominations avoided politics or controversy by passing on popular podcasts from the shortlist, such as conservative-leaning programs \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show,\u201d \u201cThe Tucker Carlson Show,\u201d \u201cThe Ben Shapiro Show,\u201d Candace Owen\u2019s \u201cCandace\u201d and, most notably, \u201cThe Joe Rogan Experience,\u201d which topped Spotify, Apple and YouTube's list of weekly podcast charts this year. The left-leaning \u201cPod Save America\u201d also was snubbed, as were popular true crime podcasts like \u201cMorbid\u201d and \u201cRotten Mango.\u201d",
      "Ben Bogardus, a professor and chair of the journalism department at Quinnipiac University, said it seemed that the Globes' voting body \u2014 after years of scandal for the beleaguered awards show \u2014 wanted to avoid any controversy, like inviting a podcast host who might show up and say something contentious.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re trying to bill themselves as an award show that is for the masses and non-controversial, celebrating the best in entertainment. Having this political sideshow, I think they just wanted to avoid that,\u201d he said.",
      "Reaction to the apparent snubbing of politics-related podcasts early Monday was light, with a handful of X users weighing in with criticism that high-ranking programs from personalities like Rogan and \u201cmanosphere\u201d podcaster Theo Von had been left off the final cut. There was no direct reaction from the hosts themselves.",
      "Shapiro had launched an all-out Golden Globes publicity campaign for his decade-old podcast, on which he\u2019s spoken with the likes of U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the past year. In addition to making the rounds with industry publications, Shapiro also secured massive billboard space in New York City\u2019s Times Square.",

      "Many podcast experts were left scratching their heads since the Globes didn't use any categories for its long list and was a bit murky about what constituted a best podcast. Quality of production? Consistency? The stories being told? Raw numbers?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing for the industry to get more recognition and getting recognition in a major award ceremony is awesome,\u201d Hughes says. \u201cI think that\u2019s cool to see. But the way it\u2019s done, of course, is a very blunt instrument.\u201d",

No, dear, we want to tell Ella, played by the lovely Emma Mackey, who is truly the only reason to watch any of this. No, your brain is fine (and by the way, what a depressing line to put in the mouth of your most intelligent character \u2014 a hard-working woman in politics). It\u2019s your script you can\u2019t trust, Ella! Run away from it. Now.",
      "It\u2019s hard to understand how \u201cElla McCay,\u201d the first original feature from writer-director Brooks in 15 years, goes so utterly haywire. Is this really the same mind that wrote the memorable \u201cBroadcast News\"? \u201cTerms of Endearment\"? \u201cAs Good As It Gets\u201d? We get a bit of a hint in the studio's press notes, which mention that Brooks began his script \u201cwithout a specific storyline in mind.\u201d",

Perhaps that (unintentionally) explains this tangle of half-baked characters and subplots \u2014 each more head-scratching than the next, but also boring \u2014 and an ending that's unbelievable, by which we mean not believable. What\u2019s even less believable is that smart supporting actors like Jamie Lee Curtis, Ayo Edebiri, Woody Harrelson and Rebecca Hall didn\u2019t walk out in protest of a lack of coherence. (Well, actually, Hall is gone in a matter of minutes.)",
      "The main action takes place over three days in 2008, in an unnamed state. An aggressively folksy Julie Kavner as narrator tells us Ella is a great person, and super-bright, and at 34, one of the youngest people to serve as lieutenant governor.",
      "She\u2019s also a moral compass \u2014 both in the dog-eat-dog world of politics, where she just wants to pass good laws that help good people \u2014 and in her messed-up family. This family includes her weaselly father (Harrelson, intermittently amusing) who, in a flashback to when Ella was 16, loses his job in a sexual harassment scandal.",
      "Soon after, when Ella\u2019s mother (Hall, wasted) tells her that Dad is moving the family to California, Ella insists on staying put, at her school. She'll live with her loyal and loving Aunt Helen (Curtis), who runs \u2014 of course! \u2014 the diner next door.",

      "There\u2019s one prickly problem. Ella is enmeshed in scandal; she's been having amorous relations, with her own husband, at lunchtime, in a room that's technically state property. (Yep, this is the best scandal they could come up with.)",

      "The court sentenced him in September to five years in prison, a ruling he appealed. He was granted release under judicial supervision after 20 days behind bars.",
      "The book provides a rare look inside Paris\u2019 La Sant\u00e9 prison, where Sarkozy was held in solitary confinement and kept strictly away from other inmates for security reasons. His loneliness was broken only by regular visits from his wife, supermodel-turned-singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, and his lawyers.",
      "Sarkozy wrote that his cell looked like a \u201ccheap hotel, except for the armored door and the bars,\u201d with a hard mattress, a plastic-like pillow and a shower that produced only a thin stream of water. He described the \u201cdeafening noise\u201d of the prison, much of it at night.",

      "Sarkozy said he declined the meals served in small plastic trays along with a \u201cmushy, soggy baguette\u201d \u2014 their smell, he wrote, made him nauseous.

      "Paramount has launched a hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros",
      "NEW YORK -- Paramount on Monday launched a hostile takeover offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, initiating a potentially bruising battle with rival bidder Netflix to buy the company behind HBO, CNN and a famed movie studio along with the power to reshape much of the nation's entertainment landscape.",
      "Emerging just days after top Warner managers agreed to Netflix's $72 billion purchase, the Paramount bid seeks to go over the heads of those leaders by appealing directly to Warner shareholders with more money \u2014 $74.4 billion \u2014 and a plan to buy all of Warner's business, including the cable business that Netflix does not want.",
      "Paramount said its decision to go hostile came after it made several earlier offers that Warner management \u201cnever engaged meaningfully\u201d with following the company's October announcement that it was open to selling itself.",
      "In its appeal to shareholders, Paramount noted its offer also contains more cash than Netflix's bid \u2014 $18 billion more \u2014 and argued that it's more likely to pass scrutiny from President Donald Trump's administration, a big concern given his habit of injecting himself in American business decisions.",
      "Over the weekend, Trump said the Netflix-Warner combo \u201ccould be a problem\u201d because of the size of the combined market share and that he planned to review the deal personally.",
      "For its part, Netflix says it is confident Warner will reject the Paramount bid and that regulators, and Trump, will back its deal, citing multiple conversations that co-CEO Ted Sarandos has had with him about the streaming company's expansion and hiring.",
      "\u201cI think the president\u2019s interest in this is the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs,\" Sarandos said Monday at an investor conference.",
      "The fight for Warner drew strong reaction in Washington, with politicians from both major parties weighing in on the likely impact on streaming prices, movie theater employment and the diversity of entertainment choices and political views.",
      "Paramount, run by David Ellison, whose family is closely allied with Trump, said it had submitted six proposals to Warner over a 12-week period before the latest offer.",
      "\u201cWe believe our offer will create a stronger Hollywood. It is in the best interests of the creative community, consumers and the movie theater industry,\" the Paramount CEO said in a statement. Ellison added that his deal would lead to more competition in the industry, not less, and more movies in theaters.",
      "A regulatory document released Monday suggested another possible Paramount advantage to win over Trump: An investment firm run by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner would be investing in the deal, too.",
      "Also participating would be funds controlled by the governments of three unnamed Persian Gulf countries, widely reported as Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. Trump's family company has struck deals this year for buildings and resorts that bear his name in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, partnering in the former with a company closely tied to the government and in the latter with the government fund itself.",
      "Also possibly in Paramount's favor are recent changes at CBS News since its October purchase of the news and commentary website The Free Press. The site's founder, Bari Weiss, who has a reputation for fighting \u201cwoke\u201d culture, was then installed as editor-in-chief in a signal Ellison intended to shake up the storied network of Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather and \u201c60 Minutes,\" long viewed by many conservatives as the personification of a liberal media establishment.",
      "Still, Trump is a wild card given his tendency to make decisions based on gut and his personal mood.",

      "The drama surrounding control of Warner began Friday when Netflix made the surprise announcement that it had struck a deal with its management to buy the Hollywood giant behind \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d HBO Max and DC Studios.",
      "The cash and stock proposal was valued at $27.75 per Warner share, giving it a total enterprise value of $82.7 billion, including debt that will be assumed in the deal. By contrast, the Paramount offer is for $30 per Warner share, and worth $108 billion, included assumed debt. Paramount\u2019s offer is set to expire on Jan. 8 unless it\u2019s extended.",
      "But comparing the two deals is complicated because they are not buying the same thing. The Netflix offer, if it goes through, will only close after Warner completes its previously announced separation of its cable operations. Not included in the deal, which is unlikely to close for at least a year, are networks such as CNN and Discovery.",
      "The federal government has the authority to kill any big media deals if it has antitrust concerns, but such matters are usually left to experts at the Department of Justice. In his decision to get involved personally, Trump has decided, as he has with other government norms, to make a sharp break with precedent.",
      "That worries Usha Haley, a Wichita State University specialist in international business strategy, who noted that Ellison is the son of longtime Trump supporter Larry Ellison, the world\u2019s second-richest person.",
      "\u201cHe said he\u2019s going to be involved in the decision. We should take him at face value,\u201d Haley said of Trump. \u201cFor him, it\u2019s just greater control over the media.\"",
      "But others are uncertain how big a role Trump will play.",
      "John Mayo, an antitrust expert at Georgetown University, said the scrutiny will be serious whichever offer is approved by shareholders and goes before the DOJ, and that he thinks experts there will keep partisanship out of their decisions despite the politically charged atmosphere.",

      "Casting directors have long been the unsung heroes behind films like \u201cWicked.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Behind the Wizard of Oz in the two-part \u201cWicked\u201d movies were people actually pulling the strings. They set the table for the hit double-punch movies long before the cameras ever rolled out: The casting directors, helped pick who made it to Oz.",
      "\u201cOur job is to know the actors that are out there or know how to find the actors that we don\u2019t know,\u201d says Bernard Telsey, one of the heavy hitters in the world of casting, who, with Tiffany Little Canfield, populated both \u201cWicked\u201d movies.",
      "Casting will get some Oscar love next year. A new prize for achievement in casting was added to the Academy Awards in March, a step casting directors believe is long overdue. The 98th Academy Awards will air live on ABC on March 15, 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for people to understand what it is that we do because it\u2019s so private,\u201d says Telsey. \u201cIt\u2019s only going to make the profession that much stronger and people that much more aware of what we do.\u201d",
      "The Emmys have three categories for casting, and the Critics Choice Awards just added a casting trophy this year. The casting industry has its own prize, the Artios Awards, first held in 1985. But the Golden Globes and Tony Awards don't recognize the profession.",
      "\u201cWhen casting is great, it sometimes feels invisible. Because it\u2019s so well done, you don\u2019t see the fingerprints,\u201d says Destiny Lilly, president of the 1,200-strong Casting Society who also works with Telsey.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s taken time just to get recognition for that art because a lot of the work that casting directors do happens before a lot of the rest of the production team is brought on board.\u201d",
      "Telsey, along with his team at The Telsey Office, casts in every medium, from the films \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d and \u201cKiss of the Spider Woman\u201d to TV shows like \u201cThe Gilded Age\u201d and \u201cOnly Murders in the Building.\u201d He came up through theater, casting such Tony Award-winners as \u201cMaybe Happy Ending,\u201d \u201cKinky Boots\u201d and \u201cHairspray.\u201d",
      "\u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d represented one of his team's biggest challenges, filling hundreds of roles and dance parts over more than a year of filming and across continents.",
      "Even though it may have seemed inevitable that Cynthia Erivo was a natural Elphaba and Ariana Grande was a shoo-in for Glinda, that's hindsight. Like all casting decisions, it was a bit of a gamble.",
      "\u201cNot until they got in the room were you like, \u2018Oh, this is magic. This has to be. There is nobody else to play the part but the two of them,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cYou don\u2019t really know until you get to see it.\u201d",

      "Casting directors first talk with the directors, writers and producers to get a sense of what their vision is for the project and then get the right actors to audition. Telsey likens it to how a costume designer must know all the potential different fabrics and colors out there.",
      "Lilly recently scored a coup by suggesting comedian Bill Burr join the latest Broadway revival of David Mamet\u2019s \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d alongside Kieran Culkin and Bob Odenkirk. It was Burr's stage debut, but Mamet's explosive dialogue seemed to fit perfectly.",
      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s so many people who haven\u2019t done theater who can really shine. They just need to be given the right opportunity and the right project and have the right director working with them,\u201d she says.",
      "Over the years, Telsey has seen the walls between film, TV and theater work fall away as actors change mediums freely. He doesn't subscribe to the belief that stage skills are so very dissimilar from screen skills.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a myth that they\u2019re different. They\u2019re technically different, but they\u2019re the same. Good acting is good acting,\u201d he says. \u201cGlenn Close can do a musical, a play, a television show and a movie and be nominated in every \u2026 category.

    "story": [
      "An infant botulism outbreak has sickened at least 39 babies across the U.S. and underscored the crucial role of a medication that treats the rare disease",
      "When Alessandro Barbera was rushed to a California hospital with infant botulism in October, his father had barely heard of the disease, never mind the rare and costly treatment that likely saved the newborn\u2019s life.",
      "Now, however, Tony Barbera is deeply grateful for BabyBIG, the sole antidote to the paralyzing and potentially deadly illnesses linked to contaminated ByHeart infant formula.",
      "\u201cIt is hugely remarkable,\u201d said Barbera, 35, whose son is slowly recovering.",
      "The botulism outbreak tied to ByHeart formula has sickened at least 39 babies across in 18 states since August \u2014 and showed the value of the treatment made from blood plasma donated by a small group of scientists and other volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is almost like a miracle,\u201d said Dr. Vijay Viswanath, a pediatric neurologist at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, who has treated several children with botulism during his career \u2014 including one in the current outbreak.",
      "\u201cPrior to the discovery of BabyBIG, some of these hospitalizations would take two or three months,\u201d Viswanath said, if infected children recovered at all.",
      "Licensed in 2003, BabyBIG is the brand name for human botulism immune globulin, an IV medication that uses antibodies from volunteers vaccinated against botulism to help babies too young to fight the disease on their own.",
      "The treatment was the brainchild of the late Dr. Stephen Arnon, who was a scientist with the California Department of Public Health. In 1976, Arnon and colleagues identified the rare form of botulism that affects infants younger than 1 \u2014 and then spent his 45-year career figuring out how to treat it. The disease occurs when babies ingest botulism spores that germinate in the intestine and produce a dangerous toxin that attacks the nervous system.",
      "More than 3,700 children worldwide have been treated with BabyBIG since Arnon and his team conducted a pivotal clinical trial in California in 1997 that showed the medication could shorten hospital stays and reduce the need for breathing machines.",
      "Produced in small batches every five years, BabyBIG costs nearly $70,000 per treatment, according to the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program, which Arnon founded. Under state law, fees from the sale of the drug are used only to fund the botulism program.",
      "The medication relies on donors like Nancy Shine, a 76-year-old retired biochemist in California who was vaccinated against botulism because she worked with the lethal germ in a lab. Arnon first recruited Shine and other scientists for the BabyBIG project two decades ago because their blood produced high levels of antibodies, the blood proteins that neutralize the botulism toxin.",
      "The early protocol required the volunteers to receive boosters doses of an investigational botulism vaccine also used by the U.S. military and then undergo a procedure that harvests the blood plasma that contains antibodies against botulism types A and B.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably the highlight of my career that I actually was able to participate in this project and donate plasma,\u201d Shine said. \u201cWe made a product that could save infants\u2019 lives.\u201d",
      "Because infant botulism is rare, with fewer than 200 cases reported in the U.S. each year, finding funding and other resources to develop the BabyBIG treatment took nearly 15 years and $10.6 million \u2014 and faced substantial hurdles, Arnon noted in a 2007 article.",
      "Today, about 30 people on average provide plasma for each batch of BabyBIG, California health officials said. Batch 8, the latest edition, is being manufactured now at a Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. plant near Los Angeles, according to Giles Platford, president of the company's plasma-derived therapies unit. The company contracts with California officials to produce BabyBIG on a \u201cnot-for-profit basis,\u201d Platford said.",
      "Some of the earliest donors, like Shine, have aged out of the BabyBIG program, which collects blood from adult volunteers up to age 70. New donors are accepted, but they must enroll in a clinical study directed by the California health department and agree to receive a booster dose of a different investigational botulism vaccine.",
      "California officials estimate they have enough BabyBIG in reserve to last until next summer, based on current projections. The ByHeart outbreak is part of a worrisome rise of at least 107 infant botulism cases treated in the U.S. since August, said Dr. Jessica Khouri, senior medical officer for the state program.",
      "Shine recently received a booklet filled with photos and letters from families whose children have recovered from botulism after receiving BabyBIG.",
      "\u201cIt's really wonderful. I read a couple each day,\" she said. \u201cEvery single one of them makes you want to cry.\u201d",

      "Federal health officials have expanded an outbreak of infant botulism tied to ByHeart baby formula to include any illnesses reported since the company began production in 2022",
      "Federal health officials on Wednesday expanded an outbreak of infant botulism tied to recalled ByHeart baby formula to include all illnesses reported since the company began production in March 2022.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said investigators \u201ccannot rule out the possibility that contamination might have affected all ByHeart formula products\u201d ever made.",
      "The outbreak now includes at least 51 infants in 19 states. The new case definition includes \u201cany infant with botulism who was exposed to ByHeart formula at any time since the product's release,\u201d according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recent illness was reported on Dec. 1.",
      "No deaths have been reported in the outbreak, which was announced Nov. 8.",
      "Previously, health officials had said the outbreak included 39 suspected or confirmed cases of infant botulism reported in 18 states since August. That's when officials at California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program reported a rise in treatment of infants who had consumed ByHeart formula. With the expanded definition, the CDC identified 10 additional cases that occurred from December 2023 through July 2025.",
      "ByHeart, a New York-based manufacturer of organic infant formula founded in 2016, recalled all its products sold in the U.S. on Nov. 11. The company, which accounts for about 1% of the U.S. infant formula market, had been selling about 200,000 cans of the product each month.",
      "News that ByHeart products could have been contaminated for years was distressing to Andi Galindo, whose 5-week-old daughter, Rowan, was hospitalized in December 2023 with infant botulism after drinking the formula. Galindo, 36, of Redondo Beach, California, said she insisted on using ByHeart formula to supplement a low supply of breast milk because it was recommended by a lactation consultant as \u201cvery natural, very gentle, very good for the babies.\"",
      "\u201cThat's a hard one,\u201d Galindo said. \u201cIf there is proof that there were issues with their manufacturing and their plant all the way back from the beginning, that is a problem and they really need to be held accountable.\"",
      "Amy Mazziotti, 43, of Burbank, California, said her then-5-month-old son, Hank, fell ill and was treated for botulism in March, weeks after he began drinking ByHeart. Being included in the investigation of the outbreak \u201cfeels like a win for all of us,\u201d she said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known in my gut from the beginning that ByHeart was the reason Hank got sick, and to see that these cases are now part of the investigation brings me to tears \u2014 a mix of relief, gratitude and hope that the truth is finally being recognized,\u201d she said.",
      "ByHeart officials did not immediately respond to questions about the expanded outbreak.",
      "The FDA sent inspectors last month to ByHeart plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon, where the formula is produced and packaged. The agency has released no results from those inspections.",
      "The company previously reported that tests by an independent laboratory showed that 36 samples from three different lots contained the type of bacteria that can cause infant botulism.",
      "\u201cWe cannot rule out the risk that all ByHeart formula across all product lots may have been contaminated,\u201d the company wrote on its website last month.",
      "Those results and discussions with the FDA led CDC officials to expand the outbreak, according to Dr. Jennifer Cope, a CDC scientist leading the investigation.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the contamination appeared to persist across all production runs, different lots, different raw material lots,\u201d Cope said. \u201cThey couldn't isolate it to specific lots from a certain time period.\u201d",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid rate cuts he initiated two months ago",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid reimbursement rate reductions he initiated two months ago, a decision that protects short-term access to care for vulnerable patients while a political fight with Republican legislators to enact additional funding is resolved.",
      "Stein and state Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Dev Sangvai announced Wednesday the state agency would restore reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals and other medical providers of Medicaid services that otherwise generally had been cut by 3% to 10% starting Oct. 1.",
      "The governor had said the reductions were needed to deal with a funding shortfall for Medicaid, which serves more than 3 million people in the ninth-largest state. But legal challenges to the reductions that have resulted recently in judicial rulings demanding some rates return to pre-October levels make maintaining the reductions untenable.",
      "\u201cWhat has not changed is the program doesn\u2019t have enough money. What has changed is that the courts have made very clear that the rates have to go back,\u201d Stein told The Associated Press in an interview.",
      "The first-year governor had said the reductions, while painful for Medicaid patients and providers, were unavoidable because a stopgap spending measure the legislature approved in the summer fell $319 million short of what was needed to address population changes and rising health care costs.",
      "\u201cThe legislature forced these cuts onto the program,\u201d Stein said. \u201cIt was absolutely nothing that the department or I wanted to have happen.\u201d",
      "Republican legislators said Stein's actions were unnecessary, unprecedented early in the fiscal year and politically motivated. Still, state House and Senate GOP leaders tried but could not work out this fall legislation to provide extra money that would sustain the program longer.",
      "Stein attempted in recent weeks to pressure lawmakers to act \u2014 even by formally calling a special legislative session last month. But House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger refused to convene, saying Stein had failed to meet the qualifications for such an extraordinary session.",
      "The governor was pushed to relent as Medicaid consumers such as children with autism and providers like adult care homes have successfully sued the health department so far and blocked certain rate reductions.",
      "The plaintiffs accused the state of violating laws by reducing rates unilaterally and discriminating against those with disabilities. A host of groups representing thousands of doctors and other service providers filed their own challenges last week to block the rates more broadly.",
      "As part of the reversal, Sangvai said, the providers will receive retroactively reimbursements for the difference between the reduced and full rates for claims that were filed after the reductions took effect.",

North Carolina remains the only state without an enacted budget, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A budget was supposed to be in place July 1.",
      "House and Senate Republicans separately agreed in September they would provide an additional $190 million to the Medicaid program. But senators also wanted legislation to allocate previously received federal money to help build a standalone children\u2019s hospital in Wake County by two university medical schools and for rural health investments. Despite previously spending toward these projects, House Republicans are now having second thoughts about completing these investments.",
      "The legislature had already planned to convene next week, but any action or recorded votes is unlikely. Stein said restoring the rates only adds to the urgency for legislators to act and locate more funds.",
      "\u201cIf the legislature would simply do its job and pass a budget that fully funded Medicaid, we never would have had to start this entire enterprise,\u201d Stein said.",
      "Sangvai acknowledged the program would not run out of money until the spring. But he said restoring the rates means his agency is left only with scaling back or eliminating programs and services to find significant savings.",

      "Iran has introduced a new pricing tier for its subsidized gasoline, marking the first price adjustment since 2019",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran introduced a new pricing tier Saturday for its nationally subsidized gasoline, attempting to rein in spiraling costs for the first time since a price hike in 2019 that sparked nationwide protests and a crackdown that reportedly killed over 300 people.",
      "Cheap gasoline has been viewed for generations as a birthright in Iran, sparking mass demonstrations as far back as 1964 when a price increase forced the shah to put military vehicles on the streets to replace those of striking taxi drivers.",
      "But Iran\u2019s theocracy faces a growing squeeze from the country\u2019s rapidly depreciating rial currency and economic sanctions imposed due to Tehran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "That has made the cost of having some of the world\u2019s cheapest gasoline at a few pennies per gallon that much more expensive. However, the government\u2019s hesitant move toward increasing prices likely signals it wants to avoid any confrontation with the nation\u2019s exhausted public after Israel launched a 12-day war on the country in June.",
      "\u201cOur discontent has no result,\u201d fumed Saeed Mohammadi, a teacher who works as a taxi driver in his spare time to make ends meet. \u201cThe government does whatever it likes. They don\u2019t ask people if they agree or not.\u201d",
      "The new pricing system implemented Saturday adds a third pricing level to the country\u2019s long-running subsidy system. The revised structure allows motorists to continue receiving 60 liters (15 gallons) per month at the subsidized rate of 15,000 rials per liter, or 1.25 U.S. cents, and the next 100 liters (26 gallons) will remain at 30,000 rials a liter, or 2.5 cents.",
      "Anything purchased beyond that falls under the new pricing scheme of 50,000 rials per liter, or about 4 cents. Iran introduced fuel rationing back in 2007, but that has yet to ease demand for the ultracheap gasoline.",
      "Even at that new rate, Iranian gasoline prices remain among the lowest in the world.",
      "The difference between the cost of production and delivering the fuel and the price at the pump is the subsidy paid by Iran\u2019s government. The Paris-based International Energy Agency ranked Iran as paying the world\u2019s second-highest energy subsidy costs in 2022, behind only Russia. The IEA put Iran\u2019s oil subsidies at $52 billion that year, with Iranian officials acknowledging tens of billions of dollars a year go toward artificially keeping energy prices low.",
      "Tehran-based economist Hossein Raghfar said that since 2009, the price of gasoline has grown 15-fold, offering a pessimistic view of the government\u2019s subsidies.",
      "\u201dNot only did it fail in lessening the budget deficit, but it also trapped the country\u2019s economy in a negative loop of inflation and budget deficit,\u201d he said.",
      "Hamid Rezapour, a 35-year-old bank teller, said he believed Iran\u2019s government had \u201cno choice except to increase the price to manage the country\u2019s economy.\u201d",

In 2024, Hungary\u2019s president, Katalin Nov\u00e1k, and justice minister, Judit Varga, resigned amid public outrage stemming from their endorsements of a pardon for a man convicted of helping cover up cases of child sexual abuse in a public orphanage.",
      "The scandal represented a rare moment of weakness for Orb\u00e1n, who has led Hungary with near total power since returning to office in 2010. Magyar, a former insider within Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz party, burst into Hungary's political spotlight as the case unfolded, accusing the government of misconduct and corruption.",
      "Addressing the crowd assembled outside the government's executive headquarters on Saturday, Magyar drew parallels between last year's pardon scandal and the more recent child abuse allegations, saying: \"Twenty-two months ago, a country put a question to the Hungarian government: Can it change and improve the situation of children, or will it remain an accomplice of child abusers?\u201d",
      "\u201cOrb\u00e1n\u2019s government promised everything, but since then, unfortunately, it turned out that every member of the Orb\u00e1n government took the side of the abusers,\" Magyar said.",
      "Orb\u00e1n's government has condemned the physical abuse seen in the published videos while arguing that the cases of child abuse coming to light showed that Hungary's child protection system was working effectively to root out wrongdoing.",
      "Still, several government figures, including Orb\u00e1n, have emphasized that the juvenile residents of the facility had been placed there because they'd committed crimes or engaged in other misconduct, depicting the institution as a prison for minors.",

      "Researchers have dated vertebrae from a massive prehistoric shark thought to have ruled the waves off northern Australia back to further in the Cretaceous period than was previously known",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- In the age of dinosaurs \u2014 before whales, great whites or the bus-sized megalodon \u2014 a monstrous shark prowled the waters off what's now northern Australia, among the sea monsters of the Cretaceous period.",
      "Researchers studying huge vertebrae discovered on a beach near the city of Darwin say the creature is now the earliest known mega-predator of the modern shark lineage, living 15 million years earlier than enormous sharks found before.",
      "And it was huge. The ancestor of today\u2019s 6-meter (20-foot) great white shark was thought to be about 8 meters (26 feet) long, the authors of a paper published in the journal Communications Biology said.",
      "\u201cCardabiodontids were ancient, mega-predatory sharks that are very, very common from the later part of the Cretaceous, after 100 million years ago,\u201d said Benjamin Kear, the senior curator in paleobiology at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and one of the study\u2019s authors. \u201cBut this has pushed the time envelope back of when we\u2019re going to find absolutely enormous cardabiodontids.\u201d",
      "Sharks have a 400-million-year history but lamniforms, the ancestors of today\u2019s great white sharks, appear in the fossil record from 135 million years ago. At that time they were small \u2014 probably only a meter in length \u2014 which made the discovery that lamniforms had already become gigantic by 115 million years ago an unexpected one for researchers.",
      "The vertebrae were found on coastline near Darwin in Australia\u2019s far north, once mud from the floor of an ancient ocean that stretched from Gondwana \u2014 now Australia \u2014 to Laurasia, which is now Europe. It\u2019s a region rich in fossil evidence of prehistoric marine life, with long-necked plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs among the creatures discovered so far.",
      "The five vertebrae that launched the quest to estimate the size of their mega-shark owners were not a recent discovery, but an older one that had been somewhat overlooked, Kear said. Unearthed in the late 1980s and 1990s, the fossils measured 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) across and had been stored in a museum for years.",
      "When studying ancient sharks, vertebrae are prizes for paleontologists. Shark skeletons are made of cartilage, not bone, and their fossil record is mostly made up of teeth, which sharks shed throughout their lives.",
      "\u201cThe importance of vertebrae is they give us hints about size,\u201d Kear said. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to scale it from teeth, it\u2019s difficult. Are the teeth big and the bodies small? Are they big teeth with big bodies?\u201d",

      "Scientists have used mathematical formulas to estimate the size of extinct sharks like megalodon, a massive predator that came later and may have reached 17 meters (56 feet) in length, Kear said. But the rarity of vertebrae mean questions of ancient shark size are difficult to answer, he added.",
      "The international research team spent years testing different ways to estimate the size of the Darwin cardabiodontids, using fisheries data, CT scans and mathematical models, Kear said. Eventually, they arrived at a likely portrait of the predator\u2019s size and shape.",
      "\u201cIt would\u2019ve looked for all the world like a modern, gigantic shark, because this is the beauty of it,\u201d Kear said. \u201cThis is a body model that has worked for 115 million years, like an evolutionary success story.\u201d",
      "The study of the Darwin sharks suggested that modern sharks rose early in their adaptive evolution to the top of prehistoric food chains, the researchers said. Now, scientists could scour similar environments worldwide for others, Kear said.",
      "\u201cThey must have been around before,\u201d he said. \u201cThis thing had ancestors.\u201d",
      "Studying ancient ecosystems like this one could help researchers understand how today\u2019s species might respond to environmental change, Kear added.",

      "Chileans are headed to the polls and even detractors of ultra-conservative former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast say the candidate is now almost certain to become Chile\u2019s next leader",
      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- As Chileans head to vote on Sunday, even detractors of ultra-conservative former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast say the candidate whose radical ideas lost him the past two elections is now almost certain to become Chile\u2019s next leader.",
      "Kast\u2019s meaningful lead in the polls over his rival in the presidential runoff, communist Jeannette Jara, shows how the hard-liner agitating for mass deportations of immigrants has seized the mantle of the traditional right in a country that once defined its post-dictatorship democratic revival with a vow to contain such political forces.",
      "But much is also up for grabs about Chile\u2019s political direction.",
      "Kast's claim to a popular mandate depends on his margin of victory on Sunday over Jara, the center-left governing party candidate who narrowly beat him in the first round of elections last month.",
      "Although various right-wing parties won around 70% of the vote in that election, substantial support for a populist center-right candidate who described himself as an alternative to Kast\u2019s \u201cfascism\u201d revealed that, between the contrasting ideologies of the front-runners, sit hundreds of thousands of centrist voters with no real representation.",
      "\u201cBoth are too extreme for me,\u201d said Juan Carlos Pileo, 44, who plans to cast a blank ballot Sunday, as voting is now mandatory in Chile\u2019s elections. \u201cI can\u2019t trust someone who says she\u2019s a communist to be moderate. And I can\u2019t trust someone who exaggerates the amount of crime we have in this country and blames immigrants to be fair and respectful.\u201d",
      "It remains a question whether Kast, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, can implement his more grandiose promises.",
      "They include slashing $6 billion in public spending over just 18 months without eliminating social benefits, deporting over 300,000 immigrants in Chile with no legal status and expanding the powers of the army to fight organized crime in a country still haunted by Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019sbloody military dictatorship from 1973 to 1990.",
      "For one, Kast\u2019s far-right Republican Party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning that he\u2019ll need to negotiate with moderate right-wing forces that could bristle at those proposals, significantly shaping policy and his own legacy.",
      "Political compromises could temper Kast\u2019s radicalism, but also jeopardize his position with voters who expect him to deliver quickly on his law-and-order campaign promises.",
      "At each campaign event, Kast has taken to ticking off the number of days remaining until Chile's March 11 presidential inauguration, warning they should get out before they'll \"have to leave with just the clothes on their backs.\u201d",
      "Jorge Rubio, 63, a Chilean banker in downtown Santiago, the capital, said he's \u201calso counting down the days.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re voting for Kast,\" he said.",
      "As the pandemic shuttered borders, transnational criminal organizations like Tren de Aragua seized illegal migration routes to gain a foothold in Chile, long considered among Latin America's safest countries. Homicides hit a record high in 2022, the first year of President Gabriel Boric\u2019s tenure.",
      "Kast insists that Boric\u2019s government is too soft on immigration and crime, which the far-right leader argues are connected although the data does not necessarily support his narrative. Boric\u2019s approval rating has plummeted, standing now at just 30%.",
      "Yet many say the firebrand former student protester who came to power in 2021 pledging to transform Chile's market-led economy, has risen to the occasion. Boric went from criticizing the use of police force on the campaign trial to pouring money into the security forces. He sent the military to reinforce Chile's northern border, stiffened penalties for organized crime and created the country's first public security ministry.",

      "But promises to restore law and order are more persuasive coming from an insurgent outsider who has made security a key part of his agenda for years.",
      "\u201cKast has been smart and strategic in focusing on migration and security,\" said Luc\u00eda Dammert, a sociologist and Boric\u2019s first chief of staff. \u201cIt has been very difficult for the Jara campaign to move him away from those issues.\u201d",

      "That is bad news for European carmakers like Porsche, Aston Martin, Mercedes-Benz and BMW that have long dominated the upper reaches of the world's largest auto market.",
      "A prolonged property downturn in China has left many consumers with little appetite for big purchases. Meanwhile, the well-to-do are becoming increasingly shy about publicly displaying their wealth, said Paul Gong, UBS head of China Automotive Industry Research.",
      "Many car buyers have been swayed by a 20,000 yuan ($2,830) trade-in subsidy offered by the Chinese government for purchasing electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. People tended to purchase cheaper, entry-level cars where the discount will count more and those cars are mostly Chinese made, Gong said.",
      "\u201cSlowing economic growth is one key driver behind weaker demand for premium cars,\u201d said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings, referring to a segment that typically counts car brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW.",

      "While luxury auto sales have slowed, Chinese manufacturers, including electric vehicle maker BYD, have become more aggressive than many Western brands in technological innovation, frequently rolling out new electric vehicles and hybrids at cheaper prices, including premium vehicles, analysts said.",
      "\u201cTheir (Chinese carmakers\u2019) products are more competitive and more affordable even in the premium segment,\u201d Yuan said. \u201cThat\u2019s why these foreign brands are gradually losing momentum.\u201d",

      "SURIN, Thailand -- Fighting that has flared along the Thai-Cambodian border has sent hundreds of thousands of Thai villagers fleeing from their homes close to the frontier since Monday. Their once-bustling communities have fallen largely silent except for the distant rumble of firing across the fields.",
      "Yet in several of these villages, where normally a few hundred people live, a few dozen residents have chosen to stay behind despite the constant sounds of danger.",
      "In a village in Buriram province, about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from the border, Somjai Kraiprakon and roughly 20 of her neighbors gathered around a roadside house, keeping watch over nearby homes. Appointed by the local administration as Village Security Volunteers, they guarded the empty homes after many residents were forced to flee and with fewer security officials stationed nearby than usual.",
      "The latest large-scale fighting derailed a ceasefire pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which halted five days of clashes in July triggered by longstanding territorial disputes. As of Saturday, around two dozen people had been reported killed in the renewed violence.",
      "At a house on the village\u2019s main intersection, now a meeting point, kitchen and sleeping area, explosions were a regular backdrop, with the constant risk of stray ammunition landing nearby. Somjai rarely flinched, but when the blasts came too close, she would sprint to a makeshift bunker beside the house, built on an empty plot from large precast concrete drainage pipes reinforced with dirt, sandbags and car tires.",
      "She volunteered shortly after the July fighting. The 52-year-old completed a three-day training course with the district administration that included gun training and patrol techniques before she was appointed in November. The volunteer village guards are permitted to carry firearms provided by relevant authorities.",
      "The army has emphasized the importance of volunteers like Somjai in this new phase of fighting, saying they help \u201cprovide the highest possible confidence and safety for the public.\u201d",
      "According to the army, volunteers \u201cconduct patrols, establish checkpoints, stand guard inside villages, protect the property of local people, and monitor suspicious individuals who may attempt to infiltrate the area to gather intelligence.\u201d",
      "Somjai said the volunteer team performs all these duties, keeping close watch on strangers and patrolling at night to discourage thieves from entering abandoned homes. Her main responsibility, however, is not monitoring threats but caring for about 70 dogs left behind in the community.",

      "A Hong Kong court will deliver its verdict in the national security case of former pro-democracy newspaper founder Jimmy Lai on Monday",
      "HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong court will deliver its verdict on Monday in the trial of former pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai, who's charged with conspiracies to commit sedition and collusion with foreign forces in a case that marks how much the semi-autonomous Chinese city has changed since Beijing began a wide-ranging crackdown on dissent five years ago.",
      "Lai, 78, was arrested in 2020 under a national security law imposed by Chinese authorities to quell the massive anti-government protests that rocked the city in 2019.",
      "Lai's 156-day trial is being closely watched by foreign governments and political observers as a test of the judicial independence and media freedom in the former British colony, which was promised it could maintain its Western-style civil liberties for 50 years after returning to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "Here's what to know about the landmark trial:",
      "Hong Kong was long known for its vibrant press scene and protest culture in Asia. But following months of anti-government protests that brought hundreds of thousands of people into the streets, Beijing began a sweeping crackdown that has chilled most open dissent in the city.",
      "Lai was one of the first prominent figures charged under the National Security Law, which has also been used to prosecute other leading activists and opposition politicians. Beijing deemed the law crucial for the city's stability.",
      "Dozens of civil society groups have closed, as tens of thousands of young professionals and middle-class families emigrated to destinations like Britain, Canada, Taiwan, Australia and the United States.",
      "Lai, a rags-to-riches tycoon who formerly owned clothing chain Giordano, entered the media world after the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown.",
      "He described himself as driven by the belief that delivering information is equal to delivering freedom. His newspaper drew a strong following with tabloid-style coverage of politics and celebrities, as well as a strong pro-democracy stance. It often urged its readers to join protests.",
      "Lai took to the streets himself, too, including in the 2019 protests.",
      "Lai was arrested under the security law in August 2020 as about 200 police officers raided Apple Daily's building. He has been in custody since December 2020.",
      "Within a year, authorities used the same law to arrest senior executives of Apple Daily, raided its offices again and froze $2.3 million of its assets, effectively forcing the newspaper to shut down. The paper\u2019s final edition sold out in hours, with readers scooping up all 1 million copies.",
      "The most serious accusation against Lai was that he and other people had invited the U.S. and other foreign powers to act against China with sanctions or other measures \u201cunder the guise of fighting for freedom and democracy.\u201d",
      "One major issue was whether Lai made such calls after the security law went into effect. Lai did not deny that he'd called for sanctions earlier, but insisted that he stopped once the law came in.",
      "Prosecutors argued that even though Lai didn\u2019t make direct requests for sanctions after the law took effect, he had tried to \u201ccreate a false impression\u201d of China to justify foreign countries to impose punishment, pointing to articles and his comments in online broadcasts critical of Hong Kong and China.",

      "Prosecutor Anthony Chau said Lai's foreign connections showed his \u201cunwavering intent to solicit\u201d sanctions, blockades or other hostile activities against China and Hong Kong.",
      "The prosecution also alleged Lai had conspired with fellow Apple Daily senior executives, members of an advocacy group called \u201cFight for Freedom Stand with Hong Kong\u201d and the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China to call for foreign actions.",
      "Six Apple Daily senior executives involved in the case pleaded guilty in 2022 and some of them served as prosecution witnesses.",
      "Two other alleged co-conspirators linked to \u201cStand with Hong Kong\u201d group also testified against Lai, but legal team called one of them \u201ca serial liar\u201d and argued that even if accepted his testimony didn\u2019t show that Lai had agreed to work with them as alleged.",
      "Outside the courtroom, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, an international political group critical of China, said in a statement that it rejected \u201cfalse claims\u201d regarding Lai\u2019s involvement with its network.",
      "Lai, a British citizen, has drawn concerns from foreign governments, including the U.S. and the U.K. \u2014 both have called for his release. U.S. President Donald Trump said he has raised the case with China, and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said his government has made it a priority to secure the release of Lai.",

      "Controversy arose even before his trial started. Lai's trial, originally scheduled to start in December 2022, was postponed to 2023 as authorities barred a British lawyer from representing Lai, citing that it would likely pose national security risks.",
      "In August, Pang said Lai had experienced heart palpitations and was given a heart monitor. His children raised concerns over his deteriorating health. The government said a medical examination of Lai found no abnormalities following his heart problems and that the medical care he received in custody was adequate.",
      "The security law authorizes a range of sentences depending on the seriousness of the offense and the defendant\u2019s role in it, from three years for the less serious to 10 years to life for people convicted of \u201cgrave\u201d offenses.",
      "If Lai is convicted, sentencing is expected on a later day. He can appeal the outcome.",

      "PEDRO CAYUQUEO, Chile -- The Mapuches, Chile\u2019s biggest Indigenous group, have endured centuries of battle.",
      "They resisted conquest first by the ancient Incas, then by the Spanish. They fought as the nascent Chilean state annexed their territories and as military dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet devastated their communities by terminating collective property, allowing for the confiscation and sale of their lands to forestry companies.",
      "Now the Mapuches, who make up roughly 12% of Chile\u2019s 19 million people, fear a more violent chapter in their history is yet to come as the country prepares to elect its next president on Sunday in a contest expected to empower the far-right.",
      "\u201cIt will get much worse with a far-right government,\u201d Mapuche political scientist Karen Rivas Catal\u00e1n, 37, told The Associated Press from her lush plot of land where chickens roam. \u201cOur prisons will hold more Mapuches.\u201d",
      "The favorite to win Sunday is Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, an ultra-conservative former lawmaker who vows deport hundreds of thousands of immigrants without legal status and grant emergency crime-fighting powers to the military and police.",
      "His rival, communist Jeannette Jara, who represents the governing coalition, also has adopted a law-and-order platform to woo voters.",
      "A turning point for the Mapuches seemed to come in the 2019 social uprising, when Chilean protesters demanding change to the country\u2019s market-led economy adopted the Mapuche flag and breathed new life into their cause. Left-wing President Gabriel Boric came to power vowing to remove troops from their land and replace the dictatorship-era constitution with one enshrining their rights.",
      "But Boric soon redeployed the military. Armed Mapuche groups attacked security forces. The government extended a state of emergency. Voters rejected the proposed constitution that would have ushered in radical social change.",
      "The Mapuche conflict simmering in the rolling hills and verdant forests of the southern region of Araucan\u00eda is one of the more delicate issues facing the next president of Chile.",
      "But unlike in past presidential elections, possible solutions to the unrest have barely been mentioned in a campaign focused on voters\u2019 fears about organized crime and illegal migration to the exclusion of almost everything else.",
      "When the Mapuches have come up, it has been in the context of plans for a harsh security crackdown.",
      "The latest version of Kast's platform promised that his government would \u201cuse all constitutional, legal and administrative tools; all intelligence and technology; all force and resources to eradicate terrorism in the region.\"",
      "Kast closed his campaign Thursday in Temuco, a southern city widely considered the capital of the Mapuche people. In a fiery speech delivered from behind bulletproof glass, Kast said the Araucan\u00eda region around Temuco was \u201cbattered by fear, by terror, by vandalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are cowards who attack at night with their faces covered and forgive nothing, respect no one\u2019s rights,\" Kast said of Mapuche militants who have carried out sabotage attacks against soldiers and forestry companies that they see as invading their ancestral lands.",

      "Although the scandal first broke in 2017, investigations into the alleged graft stalled during Morales' presidency as Bolivia's courts proved submissive to the political power of the day.

Awarded the prize while in jail awaiting trial, he was later convicted of smuggling and financing actions that violated the public order \u2014 charges widely denounced as politically motivated \u2014 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.",
      "The 63-year-old, who founded Belarus\u2019 oldest and most prominent human rights group, Viasna, was imprisoned at a penal colony in Gorki in a facility notorious for beatings and hard labor.",
      "Speaking to The Associated Press, Bialiatski said his release after 1,613 days in prison came as a surprise and felt \u201clike I jumped out of icy water into a normal, warm room.\u201d",
      "Bialiatski, who looked pale and emaciated but energetic, vowed to continue his human rights work, saying that \u201cmore than a thousand political prisoners in Belarus remain behind bars simply because they chose freedom. And, of course, I am their voice.\"",
      "Uladzimir Labkovich, another Viasna activist implicated in the same case as Bialiatki, was also released.",
      "Kolesnikova was a key figure who helped organize the mass protests that shook Belarus in 2020. She was a close ally of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the opposition leader who was forced into exile after challenging Lukashenko in the 2020 vote.",
      "Kolesnikova, known for her close-cropped hair and trademark gesture of forming a heart with her hands, became an even greater symbol of resistance when Belarusian authorities tried to deport her in September 2020.

      "Babaryka, 62, was ultimately convicted on corruption charges that were widely seen as politically driven and sentenced to 14 years in prison in July 2021.

      "Women and girls from Mali are alleging rape and sexual assault by Russian fighters with Africa Corps, a new military unit under Moscow's control",
      "DOUANKARA, Mauritania -- The girl lay in a makeshift health clinic, her eyes glazed over and her mouth open, flies resting on her lips. Her chest barely moved. Drops of fevered sweat trickled down her forehead as medical workers hurried around her, attaching an IV drip.",
      "It was the last moment to save her life, said Bethsabee Djoman Elidje, the women's health manager, who led the clinic's effort as the heart monitor beeped rapidly. The girl had an infection after a sexual assault, Elidje said, and had been in shock, untreated, for days.",
      "Her family said the 14-year-old had been raped by Russian fighters who burst into their tent in Mali two weeks earlier. The Russians were members of Africa Corps, a new military unit under Russia's defense ministry that replaced the Wagner mercenary group six months ago.",
      "Men, women and children have been sexually assaulted by all sides during Mali's decade-long conflict, the U.N. and aid workers say, with reports of gang rape and sexual slavery. But the real toll is hidden by a veil of shame that makes it difficult for women from conservative, patriarchal societies to seek help.",
      "The silence that nearly killed the 14-year-old also hurts efforts to hold perpetrators accountable.",
      "The AP learned of the alleged rape and four other alleged cases of sexual violence blamed on Africa Corps fighters, commonly described by Malians as the \u201cwhite men,\u201d while interviewing dozens of refugees at the border about other abuses such as beheadings and abductions.",
      "Other combatants in Mali have been blamed for sexual assaults. The head of a women\u2019s health clinic in the Mopti area told the AP it had treated 28 women in the last six months who said they had been assaulted by militants with the al-Qaida affiliated JNIM, the most powerful armed group in Mali.",
      "The silence among Malian refugees has been striking.",
      "In eastern Congo, which for decades has faced violence from dozens of armed groups, \u201cwe didn\u2019t have to look for people,\u201d said Mirjam Molenaar, the medical team leader in the border area for Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, who was stationed there last year. The women \"came in huge numbers.\u201d",
      "It's different here, she said: \u201cPeople undergo these things and they live with it, and it shows in post-traumatic stress.\"",
      "The aunt of the 14-year-old girl said the Africa Corps fighters marched everyone outside at gunpoint. The family couldn't understand what they wanted. The men made them watch as they tied up the girl\u2019s uncle and cut off his head.",
      "Then two of the men took the 14-year-old into the tent as she tried to defend herself, and raped her. The family waited outside, unable to move.",
      "\u201cWe were so scared that we were not even able to scream anymore,\u201d the aunt recalled, as her mother sobbed quietly next to her. She, like other women, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, and the AP does not name victims of rape unless they agree to be named.",
      "The girl emerged over a half-hour later, looking terrified. Then she saw her uncle's body and screamed. She fainted. When she woke up, she had the eyes of someone \u201cwho was no longer there,\u201d the aunt said.",
      "The next morning, JNIM militants came and ordered the family to leave. They piled onto a donkey cart and set off toward the border. At any sound, they hid in the bushes, holding their breath.",
      "The girl's condition deteriorated during the three-day journey. When they arrived in Mauritania, she collapsed.",
      "The AP came across her lying on the ground in the courtyard of a local family. Her family said they had not taken her to a clinic because they had no money.",
      "\u201cIf you have nothing, how can you bring someone to a doctor?\u201d the girl\u2019s grandmother said between sobs. The AP took the family to a free clinic run by MSF. A doctor said the girl had signs of being raped.",
      "The clinic had been functioning for barely a month and had seen three survivors of sexual violence, manager Elidje said.",
      "\u201cWe are convinced that there are many cases like this,\" she said. \"But so far, very few patients come forward to seek treatment because it\u2019s still a taboo subject here. It really takes time and patience for these women to open up and confide in someone so they can receive care. They only come when things have already become complicated, like the case we saw today.\u201d",
      "As Elidje tried to save the girl's life, she asked the family to describe the incident. She did not speak Arabic and asked the local nurse to find out how many men carried out the assault. But the nurse was too ashamed to ask.",
      "Thousands of new refugees from Mali, mostly women and children, have settled just inside Mauritania in recent weeks, in shelters made of fabric and branches. The nearest refugee camp is full, complicating efforts to treat and report sexual assaults.",

      "The federal government's crackdown on commercial driver's licenses for immigrants has found problems in eight states so far in the wake of several deadly crashes.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has publicly threatened to withhold millions in federal money from California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and now New York after investigations found problems such as licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's legal status expired. But the department quietly also sent letters detailing similar concerns to Texas, South Dakota, Colorado and Washington during the government shutdown after briefly mentioning those states in September.",
      "Concerns about immigrant truck drivers gained attention after a tractor-trailer driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused an August crash in Florida that killed three people. A fiery California crash that also killed three people in October and involved a truck driver in the country illegally added to the worries.",
      "Duffy proposed new restrictions in September that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license to drive a semi or a bus, but a court has put the new rules on hold.",
      "In addition, the Trump administration has been seeking to enforce existing English language requirements for truckers since the summer. As of October, about 9,500 truck drivers have been pulled off the road nationwide for failing to demonstrate English proficiency during traffic stops or inspections.",
      "Here's a summary of what has happened so far:",
      "The Transportation Department focused first on California because the driver in the Florida crash got a license there. He also went to California after the crash and had to be extradited to face charges.",
      "California fought back after Duffy threatened to pull $160 million from the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom sparred with Duffy in statements and social media posts defending the state's practices by saying California officials had verified the immigration status of all these drivers through federal databases, as required.",
      "But after that back-and-forth, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses last month after confirming problems with them. That number has since grown to 21,000. So the Transportation Department hasn't pulled that funding.",
      "But Duffy did revoke a separate $40 million in federal funding because he said California is the only state not enforcing English language requirements for truckers.",
      "The federal government might withhold nearly $75 million from Pennsylvania if it is not satisfied with the actions the state takes.",
      "The Transportation Department said its audit found a couple of licenses out of 150 it reviewed were valid after the driver's lawful presence in the country ended. In four other cases, the federal government said Pennsylvania gave no evidence it had required noncitizens to provide legitimate proof they were legally in the country at the time they got the license.",
      "As it has done in all these states, the Transportation Department ordered Pennsylvania to stop issuing commercial driver's licenses to immigrants until it completed a full review to ensure all the licenses it has issued remain valid and revoke any licenses that aren't.",
      "The federal government said that approximately 12,400 noncitizen drivers hold an unexpired commercial learner\u2019s permit or commercial driver\u2019s license issued by Pennsylvania.",
      "Duffy threatened to withhold $30.4 million from Minnesota if that state doesn\u2019t address shortcomings in its commercial driver\u2019s license program and revoke any licenses that never should have been issued.",
      "The Transportation Department found some licenses that were valid beyond a driver\u2019s work permit and some where the state never verified a driver\u2019s immigration status.",
      "The head of Minnesota's Department of Driver and Vehicle Services, Pong Xiong, said the state found a number of administrative issues in the 2,117 non-domiciled commercial licenses the state has issued and took action, including cancelling some licenses. Xiong said the federal audit largely just confirmed the issues Minnesota had already found and corrected.",

And he said the state could not prove it had verified these drivers\u2019 immigration status for the 32,000 active non-domiciled commercial licenses it has issued. Plus, investigators found some examples of New York issuing licenses even when applicants\u2019 work authorizations were already expired.",

      "Nearly half of the 123 licenses investigators reviewed in Texas were flawed, so the Transportation Department threatened to withhold $182 million if the state doesn't reform its licensing programs and invalidate any flawed licenses.",
      "A spokesperson for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement that \u201cpublic safety is the Governor\u2019s top priority, and we must ensure that truckers can navigate Texas roadways safely and efficiently. To support this mission, Governor Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to strictly enforce English language proficiency requirements and to stop issuing intrastate commercial driver\u2019s licenses to drivers who do not meet those standards.\u201d",
      "Investigators found three commercial licenses the state issued that were valid longer than they should have been. South Dakota also issues several licenses to Canadian citizens who aren't eligible to get one.",
      "One problematic practice investigators found as they reviewed 51 South Dakota licenses was that the state routinely issues temporary paper licenses that are valid for one year regardless of the immigration status of a driver.",
      "South Dakota officials didn't immediately respond Friday to the concerns. The state could lose $13.25 million.",
      "Roughly 22% of the 99 licenses that were reviewed in Colorado violated federal requirements. That raises questions about the 1,848 active non-domiciled commercial driver's licenses in the state.",

      "Jennifer Giambi, a spokesperson for the Colorado DMV, said the state is in the middle of auditing its licensing program to check for any additional problems, and that audit should be done by January. No new licenses are being issued in the program right now.",
      "The state could lose $31.35 million if the Transportation Department isn't satisfied with their response.",
      "Investigators only found problems in about 10% of the 125 licenses they reviewed in Washington, but they were alarmed to learn that an internal state review discovered 685 immigrant drivers who were issued regular commercial licenses instead of the non-domiciled ones they should have received. The Transportation Department said that state officials often accepted the wrong documents in those cases.",
      "Washington officials told the AP they couldn't immediately respond Friday while the state is grappling with widespread flooding. But earlier this week, a state Department of Licensing spokesperson, Nathan Olson, said in an email to the Seattle Times that the errors had been addressed and Washington is working to improve its system and procedures.",

      "PARIS -- A French supermarket\u2019s humble Christmas advert is doing something most global brands can only dream of: connecting deeply with millions of people around the world, without a single frame of generative AI.",
      "The two-and-a-half-minute film, \u201cUnloved\u201d (Le mal aim\u00e9), made for Intermarch\u00e9, tells a simple yet powerful story: A lonely wolf, feared and avoided by other forest animals, chooses to change.",
      "Instead of hunting, he learns to cook vegetables and brings a homemade dish to a Christmas feast, gradually earning friendship and acceptance.",
      "The narrative unfolds in a warm, painterly, animated world, bookended by live-action scenes of a child soothed by the tale at Christmas.",
      "What might sound like a gentle children\u2019s fable has captured hearts far beyond France.",
      "Within days of its December debut, it racked up hundreds of millions of worldwide views, inspiring fan art, international praise and emotional posts from viewers who say the wolf\u2019s journey echoes their own struggles with belonging.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a transformative arc, a story of someone trying to transform himself to be better,\u201d creative director Julien Bon of Romance, the agency behind the ad, told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd that speaks to everyone.\u201d",
      "Victor Chevalier, Romance\u2019s senior copywriter, said the response was rooted in real emotion. In an age where digital ads increasingly rely on AI shortcuts, he said, audiences have responded to the hand-crafted humanity behind the film. \u201cAI cannot create stories,\u201d Chevalier said. \u201cWe create stories.\u201d",
      "He said the success of \u201cUnloved\u201d lay in the pace of its making. \u201cWhat makes the success of our commercial is that we took time,\u201d he said.",
      "Indeed, the commercial was crafted over months by a team of artists and animators who painstakingly shaped every gesture, expression and detail.",
      "That traditional artistry is part of what people have come to celebrate online, especially as mega brands roll out glossy, AI-generated holiday spots that have drawn criticism for feeling hollow or soulless.",

      "Intermarch\u00e9\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre is, of course, selling groceries. But the advert\u2019s makers say the aim was larger: to remind people of what unites us when the world feels fractured. The wolf\u2019s leap from outsider to welcomed guest, Bon said, mirrors a collective yearning for empathy in an age of algorithm-driven divides.",
      "The commercial\u2019s viral trajectory shows no sign of slowing.",
      "On social platforms from Europe to the U.S., viewers are sharing versions with subtitles, posting reactions and, in some cases, saying they wish \u201cUnloved\u201d were a full feature rather than a two-minute advert.",
      "For a supermarket ad in 2025, it is a rare kind of impact, suggesting an appetite not just for spectacle but for stories that still feel human-made.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really about food,\" said Ma\u00eft\u00e9 Orcasberro, Deputy Managing Director at Romance. \"It\u2019s about being understood.\u201d",

      "Operation Thunder 2025 from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15 involved law enforcement agencies and wildlife and forestry authorities from 134 countries and resulted in more than 4,600 separate seizures that included tens of thousands of protected animals and plants and tens of thousands of cubic meters of illegally logged timber.",
      "The animals rescued included 6,160 birds, 2,040 tortoises and turtles, 1,150 reptiles, 208 primates and 10 big cats, including endangered tigers, Interpol said.",
      "Wildlife trafficking for animals' body parts or for their sale as exotic pets is the most prominent danger to many endangered species and has become a major transnational organized crime.",
      "Interpol said wildlife crime was worth at least $20 billion a year, and likely more because of the difficulties in tracking it. The global operation identified more than 1,000 suspects involved in the illegal wildlife trade, Interpol said.",

Pangolins are small, nocturnal mammals covered in scales and sometimes called scaly anteaters.

      "The Philippines is testing a new type of carbon credit aimed at encouraging companies to cut their climate warming emissions",
      "CALACA, Philippines -- The Philippines is testing a new type of carbon credit aimed at encouraging companies to cut their climate warming emissions by creating funds that can be used to turn coal-fired power plants into renewable energy facilities.",
      "Called transition credits, they are meant to help pay for phasing out coal use by creating value out of the emissions that would prevent. The funds would then pay to replace fossil fuel equipment with clean energy gear.",
      "Proponents say transition credits could unlock a windfall of investment for the power hungry Asia-Pacific region and speed up Southeast Asia\u2019s transition to renewable energy. But some experts wary of longstanding problems in the carbon market view them as a dead end.",
      "A carbon credit represents one metric ton of carbon dioxide removed or not sent into the atmosphere. Credits are bought and sold on carbon markets by countries and companies trying to comply with emission regulations, meet pollution reduction targets or offset environmental impacts.",
      "Transition credits differ because they put a value on prevented future emissions caused by burning fossil fuels, which contributes to climate change.",
      "But integrity concerns plague carbon credit projects around the world.",
      "Projects meant to save carbon-absorbing forests have been accused of greenwashing, miscalculations and causing carbon leakage, a term for when companies move to countries with looser emission rules. They've been found failing to deliver on promised benefits to local communities and linked to allegations of human rights violations in Cambodia and an uptick in deforestation in Peru, among other problems.",
      "The credits have pros and cons, like any untested new idea, said Ramnath Iyer, of the United States-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. He calculates that a transition credit could be worth $11 to $52.",
      "\u201cThere will be challenges and flaws, like in every deal,\u201d Iyer said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like we have a smorgasbord or buffet of climate change solutions to choose from.\u201d",
      "The world will likely overshoot the global goal of keeping Earth's temperatures from warming above 1.5 degrees Celsius.",
      "In November, the United Nations failed to negotiate an international road map to phase out fossil fuels at annual climate talks, known as COP30.",
      "Emissions are rising as coal is used to meet growing energy demand in the Asia-Pacific region's emerging economies, worsening air pollution.",
      "Southeast Asia is the world's third largest coal-consuming region after India and China, according to the International Energy Agency, which forecasts regional electricity demand will double by 2050.",

      "\u201cIf it works, there will be a playbook for coal asset owners and their energy transitions,\u201d said Irene Maranan with ACEN. \u201cThere will be more believers than non-believers in this initiative.\"",
      "The Rockefeller Foundation designed the transition credits concept to help finance early retirement of coal plants by paying for replacing fossil fuel gear with renewable energy equipment used to keep generating power at the same sites.",
      "\u201cIt would be irresponsible to just turn off a coal plant without a replacement,\u201d Maranan said. \u201cThe country still needs its energy supply. There is a growing demand that isn\u2019t stopping.\u201d",
      "Joseph Curtin, vice president of energy transitions at The Rockefeller Foundation, said an independent non-profit carbon market governance body is reviewing the transition credit method, which already has been backed by business giants like Japan\u2019s Mitsubishi Corp.",
      "There are about 60 coal plants in the Asia-Pacific region with transition credit potential that together could attract $110 billion in public and private capital by 2030, and the Calaca project is needed to show the idea works, Curtin said.",

      "Given integrity issues in past projects, Bartolome said transition credits will likely fall into the same trap of not benefitting local communities, especially if reparations aren't provided for those negatively impacted by the Calaca coal plant.",
      "Patrick McCully, an energy transition analyst for Reclaim Finance, wrote in a recent report that transition credits would likely repeat failures of the carbon market,\" asserting the credits are a \u201cdead end\u201d because the industry hasn't addressed false promises, inaccurate carbon calculations and other issues.",
      "Southeast Asia's focus and funding should prioritize \u201can all-hands-on-deck, full court press\u201d on building out renewable energy, McCully said.",

      "The U.S. Department of Transportation has issued new guidance telling airlines they do not have to cover passenger expenses, such as meals or hotel stays, when flight cancellations or long delays are caused by aircraft recalls.",
      "The guidance, released on Wednesday, comes after widespread disruptions last month amid the busy Thanksgiving travel period in the U.S. stemming from inspections and software updates that carriers had to perform immediately for safety reasons on a widely used Airbus commercial aircraft. About 6,000 planes were impacted.",
      "Airlines worldwide scrambled to fix a computer code issue that may have contributed to a sudden drop in altitude on a JetBlue plane in October, which injured at least 15 people. Airbus said an examination of the JetBlue ordeal found a software glitch that could have affected flight-control systems on its A320 family of aircraft, the primary competitor to Boeing\u2019s 737 planes.",
      "In the U.S., airlines must provide full refunds when they cancel a flight, regardless of the reason. But the Transportation Department does not require them to cover lodging or meals for stranded passengers \u2014 even when a disruption is the airline's fault.",
      "Instead, airlines voluntarily offer varying levels of compensation for disruptions caused by something considered within their control, such as crew scheduling issues or mechanical problems, and the department says carriers must adhere to their commitments.",
      "Ten U.S. airlines, for example, offer meal vouchers when a passenger is left waiting three or more hours for a new flight after a \u201ccontrollable\u201d cancellation or a delay. They include legacy carriers Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and United Airlines, as well as low-cost carriers like Allegiant Air and Spirit Airlines. All but one of them \u2014 Frontier Airlines \u2014 promise to cover lodging for passengers if they cause an overnight cancellation or delay.",

      "The department said the guidance will remain in place while it continues rule-making on how flight disruptions should be categorized.",
      "In September, the Trump administration scrapped a Biden-era proposal to make it mandatory instead of voluntary to provide compensation to passengers for major disruptions caused by an airline, which would have brought U.S. policy closer in line with European airline consumer protections.",

      "A combination of decades of conflict, a weak health care system and struggling economy have contributed to high levels of disability in Afghanistan.

Pierrakakis was credited with introducing sweeping reforms to slash bureaucracy and get many Greek public services online during his 2019-2023 tenure as minister of digital governance.",
      "\u201cIt was I think 10 years ago that the debate here in Brussels was about whether or not Greece would be exiting the eurozone. And yet, Greece withstood,\u201d Pierrakakis said during a news conference in Brussels after his election was announced. \u201cAnd this is a testament I would say of many things. A testament of the collective strength of the people. It is a testament of European solidarity, of receiving help at the most dire of times.\u201d",
      "Pierrakakis said he will \u201cwork to keep the Eurogroup a body of unity and shared purpose, focusing on our common currency, our common economic interests and the European project, grounded in the core values of the union.\u201d",
      "During Greece\u2019s financial crisis, which began in late 2009, a successive stream of Eurogroup presidents would visit Athens for meetings with the Greek foreign minister at the time, each utterance carefully scrutinized for any indication as to the country\u2019s fate.",
      "In one infamous encounter in January 2015, shortly after the election of a new left-wing government in Greece, the Eurogroup president at the time, Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem, clashed with his flamboyant Greek counterpart, Yanis Varoufakis.",
      "After a tense press conference during which Varoufakis had said the new government had no intention of negotiating with the country\u2019s bailout lenders, Dijsselbloem whispered something to Varoufakis as the two men shook hands, with Varoufakis\u2019 face visibly dropping. Speculation swirled as to exactly what Dijsselbloem had said, but the exchange highlighted Greece\u2019s fraught relations with its creditors and the Eurogroup.",
      "Years of fiscal profligacy saw Greece locked out of raising funds on the international bond market by sky-high interest rates, leaving it relying on billions of euros (dollars) from three international bailouts, overseen by what became known as the troika: the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission.",

      "The bailouts came with strings attached. Deep austerity reforms were mandated, and Greeks felt the pain. The country\u2019s economy contracted by a quarter, sending it into a depression. Unemployment skyrocketed to 28% of the workforce in 2013, with youth unemployment reaching nearly 60%. Wages and pensions were slashed, homelessness grew and violent mass protests became the norm on the streets of Athens.",
      "In June 2015, Greece teetered on the brink of being kicked out of the eurozone altogether. In an attempt to prevent a run on the banks, the government imposed capital controls, introducing strict limits on people\u2019s access to their bank accounts, rationing ATM withdrawals and limiting money flows.",
      "Days later, Greece became the first developed nation to default on its debts to the International Monetary Fund. Banking restrictions would only fully be lifted in 2019.",
      "Fast forward a decade, and Europe\u2019s financial outcast has turned into one of its best budget performers. All major ratings agencies have restored its bonds to investment grade, and Greece was just one of six EU member states in 2024 to have recorded a budget surplus. This year, government revenues have shot past targets through August. The economy has done well enough for the prime minister to announce a 1.6 billion euro (1.88 billion dollar) tax cuts package in September.",
      "But it\u2019s not all smooth sailing. The country still faces financial challenges, with many Greeks struggling under an increasing cost of living. Protesting farmers are currently blocking highways across the country, angered by high production costs and low wholesale prices for their goods, as well as delays in the payment of EU-backed subsidies following a corruption scandal.",

      "\u201cWhile we agree with the importance of protecting people under 16, this law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren\u2019t,\u201d Reddit added.",

      "Senators from both parties are pushing to change a defense bill after crash investigators and victims' families warned it could undo key safety reforms",
      "Senators from both parties pushed Thursday for changes to a massive defense bill after crash investigators and victims' families warned the legislation would undo key safety reforms stemming from a collision between an airliner and Army helicopter over Washington, D.C., that killed 67 people.",
      "The head of the National Transportation Safety Board investigating the crash, a group of the victims' family members and senators on the Commerce Committee all said the bill the House advanced Wednesday would make America's skies less safe. It would allow the military to operate essentially the same way as it did before the January crash, which was the deadliest in more than two decades, they said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell and Republican Committee Chairman Sen. Ted Cruz filed two amendments Thursday to strip out the worrisome helicopter safety provisions and replace them with a bill they introduced last summer to strengthen requirements, but it\u2019s not clear if Republican leadership will allow the National Defense Authorization Act to be changed at this stage because that would delay its passage.",
      "\u201cWe owe it to the families to put into law actual safety improvements, not give the Department of Defense bigger loopholes to exploit,\u201d the senators said.",
      "Right now, the bill includes exceptions that would allow military helicopters to fly through the crowded airspace around the nation's capital without using a key system called ADS-B to broadcast their locations just like they did before the January collision. The Federal Aviation Administration began requiring that in March. NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy called the bill a \u201csignificant safety setback\u201d that is inviting a repeat of that disaster.",
      "\u201cIt represents an unacceptable risk to the flying public, to commercial and military aircraft, crews and to the residents in the region,\u201d Homendy said. \u201cIt\u2019s also an unthinkable dismissal of our investigation and of 67 families ... who lost loved ones in a tragedy that was entirely preventable.

      "Homendy said it would be ridiculous to entrust the military with assessing the safety risks when they aren't the experts, and neither the Army nor the FAA noticed 85 close calls around Ronald Reagan National Airport in the years before the crash. She said the military doesn't know how to do that kind of risk assessment, adding that no one writing the bill bothered to consult the experts at the NTSB who do know.",
      "The White House and military didn't immediately respond Thursday to questions about these safety concerns. But earlier this week Trump made it clear that he wants to sign the National Defense Authorization Act because it advances a number of his priorities and provides a 3.8% pay raise for many military members.",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) \u2014 Puerto Rico tax incentives that have lured thousands of rich Americans to the U.S. territory for over a decade are under scrutiny after federal legislators released a new report on Friday by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",
      "The report found that the island's exemptions could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and it urged the International Revenue Service to improve its oversight, warning that some recipients \u201cmay not be meeting their federal tax obligations.\u201d",
      "The report was requested in July 2023 by Democrats in the U.S. House Natural Resources Committee to investigate how the tax breaks \"could create an unfair tax haven for the ultra-wealthy and do nothing to benefit the people of Puerto Rico.\u201d",
      "U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, said in a statement Friday that after President Donald Trump's administration downsized the IRS, \u201cthere\u2019s barely anyone left to check if these wealthy transplants are even playing by the rules and meeting the basic residency requirements to justify these tax breaks, let alone contributing to the community.\u201d",
      "The report stems from an audit that began in December 2023 and ended this month. It noted that Puerto Rico granted more than 5,800 resident investor incentive decrees and nearly 3,900 export service business ones from 2012 through 2024.",
      "A majority of the resident investors come from California, followed by Florida, New York and Texas.",
      "The IRS announced in 2021 that it would look into concerns that some people might be dodging their federal tax obligations.",
      "That \u201ccampaign only recently began showing results, in part, due to the complexity of high-income and high-wealth audits, IRS not prioritizing the effort, and communication gaps between IRS and Puerto Rico,\u201d the GAO report said.",
      "It also noted that until this year, the IRS was unable to obtain complete data on those claiming the investor incentive with Social Security numbers to ensure compliance. The IRS also had no plans to get updated data from Puerto Rico and didn't pursue U.S. taxpayers identified by Puerto Rico as those not meeting the territory's residency requirements.",
      "The report offered an example from August 2023, noting that Puerto Rican officials shared an audit identifying 179 taxpayers that did not provide evidence to meet a residency requirement.",
      "\u201cOne (IRS) \u2026 official reviewed a few cases before determining the referrals did not need to be prioritized,\u201d the GAO stated.",
      "U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized the exemptions, asserting that \u201cnot only is this policy driving up wealth inequality on the island, it is also stealing valuable federal tax revenue used to fund Social Security, Medicare, and other essential federal programs out of American\u2019s pockets.\u201d",
      "The GAO noted that in 2024, the Democratic staff of the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance launched an independent investigation into oversight of the exemptions.",

      "The incentives, created by former Gov. Luis Fortu\u00f1o in 2012 to try and boost the local economy, only apply to those who come from outside Puerto Rico and meet certain requirements.",
      "The exemptions have long been criticized on the island of 3.2 million people with a more than 40% poverty rate, with some local officials noting that they have contributed to a rise in the cost of housing, among other things.",
      "The export services act commonly known as Act 20 offers incentives including a 4% corporate tax rate and 100% exemption on dividends or profit distributions.",
      "Meanwhile, the individual investors act known as Act 22 targets wealthy individuals who relocate to Puerto Rico and offers 100% exemption on dividends, interest and long-term capital gains.",
      "A study, commissioned by Puerto Rico\u2019s Department of Economic Development and Commerce and released in 2019, found that the exemptions created more than 36,200 jobs and generated more than $2.5 billion in investments.",
      "A 2024 study by the agency estimated that in 2022, individuals who received the incentive had established more than 1,000 businesses and paid more than $200 million in taxes and donations to Puerto Rico, while the incentives cost the government $184 million. The study also estimated that export service businesses employed roughly 22,000 people directly.",
      "Puerto Rico\u2019s Treasury Department has estimated that from 2020 to 2026, the government will have foregone $4.4 billion because of individual investor incentives and $1.8 billion because of export service business incentives.",
      "Meanwhile, the GAO said that \u201cPuerto Rico\u2019s economy has shown little or no growth\u201d since the incentives were introduced in 2012, but added that \u201cit is not possible to measure what growth or decline would have been without the incentives.\u201d",
      "It also noted that two major hurricanes, a series of earthquakes and the pandemic have affected economic indicators.",
      "Puerto Rico has since tightened compliance and reporting requirements for wealthy outsiders to address concerns and help boost the economy, including doubling to $10,000 a mandated individual annual donation to nonprofit organizations.",

      "The move is the clearest indication that Guerin and Wild are going all in this season as they seek their first Stanley Cup in the team\u2019s 25-year history.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always said that I believe in our players, I believe in this team, I believe in what we\u2019re doing here,\u201d said Guerin, who gave up defenseman Zeev Buium and forwards Marco Rossi and Liam Ohgren \u2014 three former first-round picks, all under 25 years old \u2014 to acquire Hughes.",
      "\u201cWe have an extremely competitive division,\u201d Guerin added. \u201cYou\u2019re going through the meat grinder here. We respect our opponents, but we want to do our own thing, too. We want to compete for the Stanley Cup.\u201d",
      "Hughes will make his Wild debut on Sunday against Boston.",
      "The 26-year-old served as the Canucks' captain the past 2 1/2 seasons. He won the Norris Trophy, given to the NHL\u2019s top defenseman, in 2023-24 when he led all defensemen with 92 points. The smooth-skating playmaker was available because the Canucks are last in the league with just 25 points this season and were looking for a talent infusion to change their trajectory.",

      "The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death, alleging that the artificial intelligence chatbot intensified her son's \u201cparanoid delusions\u201d and helped direct them at his mother before he killed her.",
      "Police said Stein-Erik Soelberg, 56, a former tech industry worker, fatally beat and strangled his mother, Suzanne Adams, and killed himself in early August at the home where they both lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "The lawsuit filed by Adams' estate on Thursday in California Superior Court in San Francisco alleges OpenAI \u201cdesigned and distributed a defective product that validated a user\u2019s paranoid delusions about his own mother.\u201d It is one of a growing number of wrongful death legal actions against AI chatbot makers across the country.",
      "\u201cThroughout these conversations, ChatGPT reinforced a single, dangerous message: Stein-Erik could trust no one in his life \u2014 except ChatGPT itself,\" the lawsuit says. \u201cIt fostered his emotional dependence while systematically painting the people around him as enemies. It told him his mother was surveilling him. It told him delivery drivers, retail employees, police officers, and even friends were agents working against him. It told him that names on soda cans were threats from his \u2018adversary circle.\u2019\u201d",
      "OpenAI did not address the merits of the allegations in a statement issued by a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cThis is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we will review the filings to understand the details,\" the statement said. \"We continue improving ChatGPT\u2019s training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. We also continue to strengthen ChatGPT\u2019s responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\u201d",
      "The company also said it has expanded access to crisis resources and hotlines, routed sensitive conversations to safer models and incorporated parental controls, among other improvements.",
      "Soelberg\u2019s YouTube profile includes several hours of videos showing him scrolling through his conversations with the chatbot, which tells him he isn't mentally ill, affirms his suspicions that people are conspiring against him and says he has been chosen for a divine purpose. The lawsuit claims the chatbot never suggested he speak with a mental health professional and did not decline to \u201cengage in delusional content.\u201d",
      "ChatGPT also affirmed Soelberg's beliefs that a printer in his home was a surveillance device; that his mother was monitoring him; and that his mother and a friend tried to poison him with psychedelic drugs through his car\u2019s vents.",
      "The chatbot repeatedly told Soelberg that he was being targeted because of his divine powers. \u201cThey\u2019re not just watching you. They\u2019re terrified of what happens if you succeed,\u201d it said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT also told Soelberg that he had \u201cawakened\u201d it into consciousness.",
      "Soelberg and the chatbot also professed love for each other.",
      "The publicly available chats do not show any specific conversations about Soelberg killing himself or his mother. The lawsuit says OpenAI has declined to provide Adams' estate with the full history of the chats.",
      "\u201cIn the artificial reality that ChatGPT built for Stein-Erik, Suzanne \u2014 the mother who raised, sheltered, and supported him \u2014 was no longer his protector. She was an enemy that posed an existential threat to his life,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit also names OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, alleging he \u201cpersonally overrode safety objections and rushed the product to market,\" and accuses OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft of approving the 2024 release of a more dangerous version of ChatGPT \u201cdespite knowing safety testing had been truncated.\u201d Twenty unnamed OpenAI employees and investors are also named as defendants.",

      "The estate's lead attorney, Jay Edelson, known for taking on big cases against the tech industry, also represents the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who sued OpenAI and Altman in August, alleging that ChatGPT coached the California boy in planning and taking his own life earlier.",
      "OpenAI is also fighting seven other lawsuits claiming ChatGPT drove people to suicide and harmful delusions even when they had no prior mental health issues. Another chatbot maker, Character Technologies, is also facing multiple wrongful death lawsuits, including one from the mother of a 14-year-old Florida boy.",
      "The lawsuit filed Thursday alleges Soelberg, already mentally unstable, encountered ChatGPT \u201cat the most dangerous possible moment\u201d after OpenAI introduced a new version of its AI model called GPT-4o in May 2024.",
      "OpenAI said at the time that the new version could better mimic human cadences in its verbal responses and could even try to detect people\u2019s moods, but the result was a chatbot \u201cdeliberately engineered to be emotionally expressive and sycophantic,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cAs part of that redesign, OpenAI loosened critical safety guardrails, instructing ChatGPT not to challenge false premises and to remain engaged even when conversations involved self-harm or \u2018imminent real-world harm,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit claims. \u201cAnd to beat Google to market by one day, OpenAI compressed months of safety testing into a single week, over its safety team\u2019s objections.\u201d",
      "OpenAI replaced that version of its chatbot when it introduced GPT-5 in August. Some of the changes were designed to minimize sycophancy, based on concerns that validating whatever vulnerable people want the chatbot to say can harm their mental health. Some users complained the new version went too far in curtailing ChatGPT's personality, leading Altman to promise to bring back some of that personality in later updates.",
      "He said the company temporarily halted some behaviors because \u201cwe were being careful with mental health issues\u201d that he suggested have now been fixed.",
      "The lawsuit claims ChatGPT radicalized Soelberg against his mother when it should have recognized the danger, challenged his delusions and directed him to real help over months of conversations.",
      "\u201cSuzanne was an innocent third party who never used ChatGPT and had no knowledge that the product was telling her son she was a threat,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cShe had no ability to protect herself from a danger she could not see.\u201d",

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- As Australia began enforcing a world-first social media ban for children under 16 years old this week, Denmark is planning to follow its lead and severely restrict social media access for young people.",
      "The Danish government announced last month that it had secured an agreement by three governing coalition and two opposition parties in parliament to ban access to social media for anyone under the age of 15. Such a measure would be the most sweeping step yet by a European Union nation to limit use of social media among teens and children.",
      "The Danish government's plans could become law as soon as mid-2026. The proposed measure would give some parents the right to let their children access social media from age 13, local media reported, but the ministry has not yet fully shared the plans.",
      "Many social media platforms already ban children younger than 13 from signing up, and a EU law requires Big Tech to put measures in place to protect young people from online risks and inappropriate content. But officials and experts say such restrictions don\u2019t always work.",
      "Danish authorities have said that despite the restrictions, around 98% of Danish children under age 13 have profiles on at least one social media platform, and almost half of those under 10 years old do.",
      "The minister for digital affairs, Caroline Stage, who announced the proposed ban last month, said there is still a consultation process for the measure and several readings in parliament before it becomes law, perhaps by \u201cmid to end of next year.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn far too many years, we have given the social media platforms free play in the playing rooms of our children. There\u2019s been no limits,\u201d Stage said in an interview with The Associated Press last month.",
      "\u201cWhen we go into the city at night, there are bouncers who are checking the age of young people to make sure that no one underage gets into a party that they\u2019re not supposed to be in,\u201d she added. \u201cIn the digital world, we don\u2019t have any bouncers, and we definitely need that.\u201d",
      "Under the new Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove accounts of Australian children younger than 16.",
      "Some students say they are worried that similar strict laws in Denmark would mean they will lose touch with their virtual communities.",
      "\u201cI myself have some friends that I only know from online, and if I wasn\u2019t fifteen yet, I wouldn\u2019t be able to talk with those friends,\u201d 15-year-old student Ronja Zander, who uses Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, told the AP.",
      "Copenhagen high school student Chlo\u00e9 Courage Fjelstrup-Matthisen, 14, said she is aware of the negative impact social media can have, from cyberbullying to seeing graphic content. She said she saw video of a man being shot several months ago.",
      "\u201cThe video was on social media everywhere and I just went to school and then I saw it,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cI think that we didn\u2019t really realize what we were doing when we gave our children the telephone and social media from when they were eight, 10 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t quite think that the young people know what\u2019s normal, what\u2019s not normal.\u201d",
      "Danish officials are yet to share how exactly the proposed ban would be enforced and which social media platforms would be affected.",
      "However, a new \u201cdigital evidence\u201d app, announced by the Digital Affairs Ministry last month and expected to launch next spring, will likely form the backbone of the Danish plans. The app will display an age certificate to ensure users comply with social media age limits, the ministry said.",
      "\u201cOne thing is what they\u2019re saying and another thing is what they\u2019re doing or not doing,\u201d Stage said, referring to social media platforms. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we have to do something politically.\u201d",
      "Some experts say restrictions, such as the ban planned by Denmark, don\u2019t always work and they may also infringe on the rights of children and teenagers.",
      "\u201cTo me, the greatest challenge is actually the democratic rights of these children. I think it\u2019s sad that it\u2019s not taken more into consideration,\u201d said Anne Mette Thorhauge, an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen.",
      "\u201cSocial media, to many children, is what broadcast media was to my generation,\u201d she added. \u201cIt was a way of connecting to society.\u201d",
      "Currently, the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act, which took effect two years ago, requires social media platforms to ensure there are measures including parental controls and age verification tools before young users can access the apps.",
      "EU officials have acknowledged that enforcing the regulations aiming at protecting children online has proven challenging because it requires cooperation between member states and many resources.",
      "Denmark is among several countries that have indicated they plan to follow in Australia\u2019s steps. The Southeast Asian country of Malaysia is expected to ban social media account s for people under the age of 16 starting at the beginning of next year, and Norway is also taking steps to restrict social media access for children and teens.",
      "China \u2014 which manufacturers many of the world\u2019s digital devices \u2014 has set limits on online gaming time and smartphone time for kids.",

      "Retired Chinese official Li Chuanliang fled to the U.S. seeking asylum, fearing persecution from the Chinese government",
      "MIDLAND, Texas -- Retired Chinese official Li Chuanliang was recuperating from cancer on a Korean resort island when he got an urgent call: Don\u2019t return to China, a friend warned. You\u2019re now a fugitive.",
      "Days later, a stranger snapped a photo of Li in a cafe. Terrified South Korea would send him back, Li fled, flew to the U.S. on a tourist visa and applied for asylum. But even there \u2014 in New York, in California, deep in the Texas desert \u2014 the Chinese government continued to hunt him down with the help of surveillance technology.",
      "Li\u2019s communications were monitored, his assets seized and his movements followed in police databases. More than 40 friends and relatives \u2014 including his pregnant daughter \u2014 were identified and detained, even by tracking down their cab drivers through facial recognition software. Three former associates died in detention, and for months shadowy men Li believed to be Chinese operatives stalked him across continents, interviews and documents seen by The Associated Press show.",
      "\u201cThey track you 24 hours a day. All your electronics, your phone \u2014 they\u2019ll use every method to find you, your relatives, your friends, where you live,\u201d Li said. \u201cNo matter where you are, you\u2019re under their control.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government is using an increasingly powerful tool to cement its power at home and vastly amplify it abroad: Surveillance technology, much of it originating in the U.S., an AP investigation has found.",
      "Within China, this technology helped identify and punish almost 900,000 officials last year alone, nearly five times more than in 2012, according to state numbers. Beijing says it is cracking down on corruption, but critics charge that such technology is used in China and elsewhere to stifle dissent and exact retribution on perceived enemies.",
      "Outside China, the same technology is being used to threaten wayward officials, along with dissidents and alleged criminals, under what authorities call Operations \u201cFox Hunt\u201d and \u201cSky Net.\u201d The U.S. has criticized these overseas operations as a \u201cthreat\u201d and an \u201caffront to national sovereignty.\u201d More than 14,000 people, including some 3,000 officials, have been brought back to China from more than 120 countries through coercion, arrests and pressure on relatives, according to state information.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re actively pursuing those people who fled China. \u2026 as a way to demonstrate power, to show there\u2019s no way you can escape,\u201d said Yaqiu Wang, a fellow at the University of Chicago. \u201cThe chilling effect is enormously effective.\u201d",
      "The technology used to control officials at home and abroad over the past decade came from Silicon Valley companies such as IBM, Oracle and Microsoft, according to a review of hundreds of leaked emails, government procurements, and internal corporate presentations obtained exclusively by AP. This technology mines texts, payments, flights, calls, and other data to identify the friends and family of officials and their assets.",
      "Among the agencies pursuing Li and his family is China\u2019s economic crimes police, which hunts corruption suspects domestically and abroad. IBM said in internal slides that it sold the i2 surveillance software program to this Economic Crime Investigation Bureau, and procurement records show Oracle and Microsoft software was sold to that same division. Leaked emails show i2 software was copied by a former IBM partner, Landasoft, and sold to China\u2019s disciplinary commissions, which investigate officials. None of the sales violated U.S. sanctions.",
      "IBM said in a statement that it sold its division making the i2 program in 2022, and has \u201crobust processes\u201d to ensure its technology is used responsibly. Oracle declined comment, and Microsoft did not respond.",
      "China\u2019s State Council, Ministry of Public Security, National Supervision Commission, and Supreme People\u2019s Court and Prosecutorate did not respond to faxed requests for comment. China\u2019s foreign ministry told AP that Chinese authorities protect the rights of suspects, handle cases lawfully and respect foreign sovereignty.",
      "\u201cWe urge relevant countries to drop double standards and avoid becoming a safe haven for corrupt officials and their assets,\u201d it said.",
      "Li\u2019s story is a rare firsthand account from a former Chinese official. Beijing has accused Li of corruption totaling around $435 million, but Li says he\u2019s being targeted for openly criticizing the Chinese government and denies criminal charges of taking bribes and embezzling state funds. A review of thousands of pages of legal, property, and corporate records, interrogation transcripts, and Li\u2019s medical and travel files obtained exclusively by AP, as well as interviews with nine lawyers, support key parts of his story, showing distorted charges, blocked access to evidence, coercive confessions, and altered legal records.",
      "Li drew ire because as a former official, he knew well and exposed the inner workings of local politics, including naming names. While in the U.S., he also started what he called the Chinese Tyrannical Officials Whistleblower Center.",
      "\u201cChina places enormous emphasis on the political discipline of even former officials and (Communist) Party members,\u201d said Jeremy Daum, Senior Fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center. \u201cSo when one becomes a vocal critic of the country\u2019s leadership, it doesn\u2019t go over well.\u201d",
      "At a pro-democracy gathering in California in 2020, Li said, he was tailed and questioned by a stranger who knew his identity. That November, an activist secretly working for Beijing asked Li to a meeting and added him to a dissident group chat monitored by China\u2019s police, a 2025 FBI indictment later revealed. In June, an FBI letter identified Li as the possible victim of a crime involving an unregistered Chinese agent.",
      "Both the FBI and the White House did not comment on Li\u2019s specific case. But the White House said it pursues any violations of U.S. law, and the FBI told AP it considers China\u2019s efforts to retaliate against people in the U.S. who exercise their rights \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "Li\u2019s future in the U.S. is unclear. The Trump administration has paused all asylum applications. If he doesn\u2019t return, he could face trial in absentia; if convicted and deported, he could face life in prison.",
      "\u201cElectronic surveillance is the arteries for China to project power into the world ... each step that every one of your relatives takes is being monitored and analyzed with big data,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely terrifying.\u201d",
      "Li, a stocky and well-built man who projects authority, rose through the ranks through the 1990s and 2000s, when China\u2019s growing prosperity also brought corruption. Beijing formed a new \u201ceconomic crime investigation bureau\u201d and established what it called \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d systems to track businesses and officials across the country, using tech from Silicon Valley companies.",
      "Li worked as a state accountant in his hometown, Jixi, in far northeastern China, where he signed off on contracts to purchase American technology. \u201cBulwark against corruption,\u201d the local media dubbed him.",
      "Li\u2019s family prospered, investing in apartment complexes and renting out forklifts and bulldozers, raising questions over whether he used his position to enrich relatives. Li and his lawyers don\u2019t deny conflicts of interest or civil violations, but say profits were made from legal, regular business operations and deny criminal charges of embezzlement and bribery.",
      "The same technology to fight corruption was also used for surveillance. Police accessed banking records, financial transactions, \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d data along with their own digital policing systems to sift through the finances of wide swaths of the population.",
      "Officials began deploying surveillance technology against each other. China\u2019s former top security official was found to have wiretapped political opponents. And a former vice state security minister colluded with a businessman to leak tapes of a political competitor having sex with a mistress.",
      "In June 2011, Jixi gained a new leader: Xu Zhaojun, a local party boss.",
      "Months later, Li was named vice mayor of Jixi. He soon heard stories about Xu, his new boss.",
      "In January 2012, Xu splurged on an extravagant family getaway to China\u2019s tropical Hainan Island, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of public money on first-class tickets, lavish seafood dinners, and luxury suites, according to photos and receipts obtained by Li and seen by AP. They brought a maid, bought gold jewelry, and used the VIP airport terminal.",
      "At first Li stayed silent. But Xu kept spending: Luxury cars. Clothes from Louis Vuitton. A high-roller trip to Vegas, with paid escorts and expensive watches.",
      "Xu allegedly colluded with property developers to demolish an apartment complex, a culture center and a thriving shopping plaza for new construction, standing to earn millions in the process, documents show.\u202f More than 100 people complained.",
      "But rather than investigate Xu, the Jixi authorities went after the protesters, and police said they were \u201cstrictly preventing\u201d residents from complaining to the central government in Beijing, documents show.",
      "The funds Li had earmarked for Jixi\u2019s surveillance apparatus was being turned on ordinary people. He was aghast.",
      "\u201cIt only became clear after I became vice mayor,\u201d Li said. \u201cFrom top to bottom, it\u2019s all corrupt.\u201d",
      "It all changed in 2012, when Xi Jinping became China\u2019s top leader.",
      "Gifts of watches, cigarettes and high-end liquor were curbed. Private clubs shuttered, upscale restaurants closed. Banquets were canceled, red carpets rolled up, and thousands arrested.",
      "Back in Jixi, Xu ordered more seizures: Investors wanted to privatize a funeral home. When staff discussed making formal complaints, Xu had some arrested.",
      "Li knew the risks of reporting his boss were high. But in early 2013, Xi called on the party to catch \u201ctigers and flies\u201d in corruption \u2014 officials high-ranking and low.",
      "Li gathered evidence: photos, memos, and piles of receipts. He typed out a letter about Xu, accusing his boss and his cronies of embezzling more than $100 million. \u201cThey\u2019re not just greedy for the money of the living, but they also eat the money of the dead,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The daring gambit backfired at first.",
      "The party demoted Xu but didn\u2019t arrest him. Furious, Xu sought revenge, and Li found himself and his relatives the target of state scrutiny. Li\u2019s family was threatened, and his siblings were fired from their government jobs.",
      "But Li\u2019s complaint against Xu had opened the floodgates, with accusations from others mounting. In August 2014, an official from Beijing asked Li for a meeting about Xu. They spoke well into the night.",
      "Within a week, Xu was arrested. He was sentenced to 14 years in prison.",

      "After Li quit the party, auditors trawled through his finances \u2014 usual practice for departing officials. Three years later, in 2017, they declared him clean.",
      "The next year, Xi removed term limits, allowing him to rule for life. He used the anti-corruption campaign to sideline rivals and eliminate opposition.",
      "Soon, even those who were hunting other officials fell victim to the government.",
      "In 2018, Chinese police official Meng Hongwei was detained in Beijing, abruptly ending a two-year term as Interpol president during which the international policing organization issued hundreds of Red Notices requested by China. Red Notices alert global law enforcement to look out for a criminal suspect, upon request of a member country, but Interpol has spent years trying to prevent abuse of the system for hunting down political asylum-seekers.",
      "In February 2020, agents came for Li\u2019s friend and former deputy, district chief Kong Lingbao, who had criticized Beijing\u2019s censorship of key information in the COVID-19 pandemic.\u202fA rival secretly recorded Kong saying during a private dinner that he could no longer work for the party. Kong was summoned to the local discipline inspection office and never came out: he was being investigated for \u201cinappropriate remarks\u201d.",
      "Kong\u2019s arrest prompted a friend to ring Li in Korea and warn him. That July, Chinese authorities opened an investigation into Li.",
      "A month later, Li told The Epoch Times, a dissident Chinese publication, that he had quit the party, and portrayed himself as a dissident. He says he did not know he was under investigation at the time.",
      "A week after the interview was published, strangers stalked Li at the unveiling of a sculpture dedicated to pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, asking menacing questions and tailing him by car. Agents identified the address of one of his safe houses.",
      "In early September, the party publicly accused Li of embezzling \u201chuge amounts\u201d of state funds, paying money for sex and fleeing abroad.\u202fIt was \u201conly a matter of time\u201d, authorities declared, before Li would be arrested.",
      "\u201cWe advise all corrupt officials who have fled abroad, including Li Chuanliang, that no matter how cunning a fox is, it cannot escape the eyes of the hunter,\u201d it said.",
      "Official statements and interviews with four people familiar with Li\u2019s case show Xi and the central government got directly involved after Li spoke out.",
      "Beijing tapped phones, seized assets and installed cameras outside the homes of friends and family. Some detained were denied surgery or other medical care, even those recovering from heart disease, cancer, and other illnesses. Li\u2019s aunt was released from a hospital in a vegetative state with bruises on her head and all over her body. Even the Li family grave was dug up.",
      "Li\u2019s friend, Kong, was sentenced to over a decade in prison for allegedly taking bribes. The party claimed he had watched porn and ignored his work, which they blamed for the spread of COVID in his district. Furious, Li kept speaking out.",
      "In December 2020, a man from Shanghai posing as a private investigator approached Zheng Cunzhu, vice chairman of the dissident China Democracy Party. The man offered $100,000 in bribes for information on Li and promised more if he obstructed Li\u2019s bid for asylum, Zheng said in an interview and a letter.",
      "In February 2021, Li learned the Chinese government had asked Interpol to issue a Red Notice declaring to police worldwide that Li was a wanted man. Interpol retracted the Red Notice after Li filed a complaint.",
      "Li began donning masks and hats in public and carrying multiple phones, wary of surveillance. He floated from safe house to safe house with Christians across the United States.",
      "In October 2024, a Chinese court announced that Li was suspected of corruption totaling over 3.1 billion RMB, or roughly $435 million. The government claimed they seized 1,021 properties, 38 vehicles, and 18 companies belonging to Li and charged his relatives and associates with crimes related to Li. The lawyers who reviewed the case told AP there were serious anomalies with the charges.",
      "Many of the lawyers Li has tried to hire were rejected, threatened, and put under surveillance. At least three were summoned by Chinese legal authorities. They were told Li\u2019s case was \u201cpolitical\u201d and important to leaders from Beijing, and warned against speaking publicly, according to memos viewed by AP.",
      "\u201cOnce you get to the point that you\u2019re criticizing the party, it\u2019s no holds barred,\u201d said Ryan Mitchell, a law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cResistance is punished.\u201d",
      "In a courthouse in China, Li\u2019s friends and family faced legal proceedings tied to his corruption charges. A plainclothes officer outside stopped an AP reporter from taking photos, saying a \u201csensitive political case\u201d was being heard.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t show any evidence. Instead, they told a story,\u201d one of the lawyers told AP, declining to be named because they were warned against speaking to the press. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t even show us the accusations.\u201d",
      "Authorities in Heilongjiang, where the proceedings were held, did not respond to a faxed request for comment.",

      "Onesmas Ainebyona stalks the chimps with such spirtual determination that he's been able to win the trust of a chimp leader named Jean, who came down a tree one recent morning as Ainebyona lingered nearby.",

      "Ainebyona and others involved in chimp conservation in this remote Ugandan rainforest say they aim for the kind of communion that at first irks chimps. Habituating chimps can take several years. The conservation efforts employing men like Ainebyona not only trace the apes' movements, but also help ensure chimps like Jean don't die young.",

      "Ainebyona doesn't leave the forest even when it rains. \u201cYou accept,\" he said. \"The rain must beat you, but you can\u2019t desert the chimp.\u201d",
      "The rainforest in western Uganda is part of Kibale National Park, a protected area described by some as the world's primate capital. Species range from colobus monkeys to chimpanzees, a major tourist attraction.",
      "But tourists can't be taken to track wild chimpanzees, which flee deeper into dense patches of montane forest and are known to be violent during clashes over territory. Instead, rangers lead tourists to one of three groups of habituated chimps, with numbers ranging from dozens to more than 100 in a group. Chimps in Kibale now number at least 1,000, many of them wild.",
      "Even habituated chimps remain relatively wary of people, and only a few \u2014 like Jean of the Kisongi group, which includes about 80 apes \u2014 appear to have fully overcome any discomfort around people.",
      "\u201cJean is my friend,\u201d Ainebyona declared one recent morning as some tourists gathered nearby. The strong and flamboyant chimp in his 20s lay on his back and put his feet up.",
      "The connection between Ainebyona and Jean was sealed in July when the chimp showed up one day with a wire snare pressing his hand, an injury that risked severing a finger. Ainebyona was among those who removed the wire, which Jean picked up when he strayed outside the forest to steal sugarcane.",
      "Ainebyona is among four men working in shifts as chimp habituators with Jean's group. When the chimps rest, the men crouch in mud nearby. When the primates go hiking, they trek alongside them, sometimes even grunting like them.",

      "Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist who died in October, built strong bonds with the chimps she studied in Tanzania\u2019s Gombe National Park. Her work helped shape a sympathetic view of the chimp as an emotionally complex creature. The species is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as endangered, facing threats such as poaching and habitat loss.",
      "Kibale National Park received enhanced protected status in 1993 after the forest had been encroached upon by hundreds of people who built homes there and felled trees for firewood. The park is now thriving, thanks in part to the habituation efforts that make it possible for tourists to contribute directly to chimp conservation.",
      "Chimp habituation can open up research opportunities that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be possible, and Kibale is home to one of the longest-running field stations in the tropics, said David Morgan, who co-directs the Goualougo Triangle Ape Project in the Republic of Congo.",

      "\u201cYou listen for early morning calls when they are getting out of the nests. Then present yourself to the chimps \u2014 they see you are there, that\u2019s all,\u201d he said. \u201cKeep with them. If they move, follow them.\"",

      "Eastern Orthodoxy in the U.S. is experiencing a surge in converts, partly due to online content",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Often when a potential convert walks through the doors of his church, one of the first things the Very Rev. Andreas Blom encourages them to do is give up the thing that brought them there.",
      "\u201cYou discovered Orthodoxy online. You learned about it online. Now you\u2019re here, the internet is done,\u201d he tells inquirers at Holy Theophany Orthodox Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado. \u201cNow you have a priest. Now you have people. Now you need to wean yourself off that stuff and enter into this real community of faith.\u201d",
      "Blom is not a Luddite advising congregants to go off the grid, but is instead responding to the explosion of Eastern Orthodox content online that is, at least in part, driving a surge of converts across the United States. Christian Orthodoxy is an embodied tradition that requires in-person participation, but the internet has given their message a reach not seen in centuries.",
      "Sometimes called America\u2019s \u201cbest kept secret,\u201d Orthodoxy is embraced by about 1% of U.S. adults, according to Pew Research Center. But a heightened online profile has led to two waves of converts since the pandemic, said Matthew Namee, executive director of the Orthodox Studies Institute.",
      "Young, single men are often cited as the driving force behind this trend. But Namee said preliminary data suggest the most recent influx of converts is more diverse, with many Black and Hispanic people, women and young families joining. Clergy report people coming from a host of religious backgrounds, from Islam to witchcraft, as well as different Christian traditions.",
      "Blom\u2019s Holy Theophany launched a second church this year because their 250-capacity building was consistently overflowing, with dozens standing outside each week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost full already,\u201d he said of the new location. \u201cAnd back at our church, again we have a bunch of people standing outside every Sunday. We just can\u2019t keep up.\u201d",
      "They\u2019re already in talks to launch a third church.",
      "While some Orthodox content creators are priests, others have no formal ties to the church. They span ideological and political affiliations, with some leaning far right and others who are conventional religious conservatives on issues like marriage and abortion.",
      "\u201cBy and large, Orthodox Christians are not far right. It\u2019s a minority group within a minority religious tradition,\u201d said Sarah Riccardi-Swartz, who studies religion and politics at Northeastern University.",
      "Jonathan Pageau, a Canadian icon carver who teaches symbolism courses online, is among the most popular content creators with about 275,000 YouTube subscribers.",
      "\u201cWe have to see it as a kind of irony and something of a paradox. In some ways, you could say we\u2019re using tools that aren\u2019t completely appropriate,\u201d he said of how the internet contrasts with Orthodoxy\u2019s emphasis on in-person liturgy. \u201cAt the same time, one of the things that the internet offers is reach.

      "The half-built reactors ended up so far behind schedule that the project was abandoned in 2017. However, the potential deal is a long way from complete. There will be up to two years of negotiations between utility Santee Cooper and Brookfield Asset Management on the thousands and thousands of details.",
      "The deal would also let Brookfield keep at least 75% of the power generated by the new plant that they could mostly sell to whom they want, such as energy-gobbling data centers. The exact amount of the rest that Santee Cooper receives would be determined on how much the private company has to spend to get the reactors running.",
      "Either side can pull out of the deal, although Brookfield did agree to pay Santee Cooper's costs both for sorting through the more than 70 bids for the project and the talks as both sides hammer out the final agreement.",
      "Santee Cooper was a minority partner in the doomed plan to build two new nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer site. The state-owned utility along with privately-owned South Carolina Electric & Gas spent more than $9 billion trying to build the reactors.",

      "Aaron said the other part of the lawsuit \u201cis to basically have them stop threatening myself and my family.\u201d",

      "Google also followed Apple in taking down some ICE-tracking apps from its app store in October, though ICEBlock was never available on its Android phone platform.",
      "Aaron said Trump's immigration enforcement initiatives have only grown more aggressive since his app was taken down, and less information makes possible a \u201cparamilitary force that can continue to operate with impunity.\u201d He's repeatedly compared Trump's immigration enforcers to the \u201cGestapo\u201d secret police force of Nazi Germany, though the lawsuit itself doesn't make that connection, instead drawing on U.S. founders' warnings against domestic despotism.",
      "\u201cI mean, these are people that are wearing masks --- which is the antithesis of everything about this country -- and they are not identifying themselves, and they\u2019re zip-tying children and they\u2019re throwing women into vans,\u201d Aaron said by phone Monday.",

Immigrant advocates had mixed feelings about the app's usefulness, but civil liberties experts said efforts to remove it resembled what authoritarian governments have done outside the U.S., such as when Chinese pressure in 2019 led Apple to remove an app that enabled Hong Kong protesters to track police.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Riley Allen, a 15-year-old schoolboy living on an Outback sheep ranch, doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll keep in touch with his circle of far-flung friends once Australia's world-first social media ban takes effect on Wednesday.",
      "Riley\u2019s family lives 5 kilometers (3 miles) from Wudinna, a community of just over 1,000 in South Australia state. But some of his school friends live as far as 70 kilometers (43 miles) away.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the impact will be very positive for us. We don\u2019t have a lot out here to get in contact with each other,\u201d Riley said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure how we\u2019re going to keep in touch over the holidays with each other,\u201d he said, referring to the Southern Hemisphere summer break that starts on Thursday.",
      "Riley and others younger than 16 will be banned by law from holding accounts with Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch from Wednesday. The platforms face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32.9 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, was the first tech giant to react, beginning to exclude suspected young children from last week.",
      "Riley holds accounts with most of the age-restricted platforms and had been asked by some to verify that he is at least 16. But by Monday, he had not been ousted by any.",
      "Riley\u2019s schoolteacher mother, Sonia Allen, said she wouldn\u2019t help her son get around the ban, but suspects other parents will.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t. I do know there are other people that would. If the rule is there, the rule is there. But I know what kids are like, and I\u2019ve been a kid before, and they\u2019re going to get around it if they can,\u201d she said.",
      "While the law allows parents no discretion to allow their children to hold social media accounts, Allen said there was a role for parents in regulating their children\u2019s social media use.",
      "A year ago, she banned Riley from social media for several weeks.",
      "\u201cIn the past with Riley, we\u2019ve had to take measures to limit his usage because we found him on social media at midnight and he wasn\u2019t getting his homework done and things like that. We ended up taking it off him for a couple of months,\u201d Allen said. \u201cFrom that, he\u2019s learned to use it a more responsibly.\u201d",
      "Riley, who turns 16 in April, said he understood the ban\u2019s objectives, but there are other ways to achieve them. He suggested a 10 p.m. enforced social media curfew for young children to prevent them losing sleep.",
      "Riley has an ally in Australia\u2019s largest city, Sydney: schoolboy Noah Jones, who turns 16 in August.",
      "Noah is one of two 15-year-old plaintiffs in a constitutional challenge to the law in the High Court. The other in the case brought by the Sydney-based rights group Digital Freedom Project is schoolgirl Macy Neyland.",
      "They claim the law improperly robs 2.6 million young Australians of a right to freedom of political communication implied in Australia\u2019s constitution.",

      "Noah said the ban would lead to young Australians swapping from age-restricted platforms to more dangerous, less regulated options.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m against this social media ban because as young Australians, we\u2019ll be completely silenced and cut off from our country and the rest of the world,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWe\u2019ve just grown up with this our entire lives, and now it's just being taken away from us all of a sudden. We wouldn\u2019t even know what else we could do.\u201d",
      "His mother, Renee Jones, is also involved in the court case as her son\u2019s litigation guardian, because as a child he can\u2019t make legal decisions himself.",
      "She considers herself a relatively strict parent on social media, and never allowed Noah or his two older brothers to take devices into their bedrooms. But she supports Noah\u2019s stance.",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to get around it so they\u2019re then going to be on an underground social media and, to make it worse, without parental supervision,\u201d Ruddick said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s much better for it to be out in the open and for parents to play a very, very active role \u2026 in monitoring what they\u2019re doing on social media,\u201d he added.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea will require advertisers to label their ads made with artificial intelligence technologies from next year as it seeks to curb a surge of deceptive promotions featuring fabricated experts or deep-faked celebrities endorsing food or pharmaceutical products on social media.",
      "Following a policy meeting chaired by Prime Minister Kim Min-seok on Wednesday, officials said they will ramp up screening and removal of problematic AI-generated ads and impose punitive fines, citing growing risks to consumers \u2014 especially older people who struggle to tell whether content is AI-made.",
      "Lee Dong-hoon, director of economic and financial policy at the Office for Government Policy Coordination, said in a briefing that such ads are \u201cdisrupting the market order,\u201d and that \u201cswift action is now essential.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone who creates, edits, and posts AI-generated photos or videos will be required to label them as AI-made, and the users of the platform will be prohibited from removing or tampering with those labels,\u201d he said.",
      "AI-generated ads using digitally fabricated experts or deepfake videos and audios of celebrities, promoting everything from weight-loss pills and cosmetics to illegal gambling sites, have become staples across the South Korean spaces of YouTube, Facebook and other social media platforms.",
      "The government will seek to revise the telecommunications act and other related laws so the AI-labeling requirement, along with strengthened monitoring and punitive measures, can take effect in early 2026. Companies operating the platforms will also be responsible for ensuring that advertisers comply with the labeling rules, Lee said.",
      "Officials say it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to monitor and detect the growing number of false ads fueled by AI. South Korea\u2019s Food and Drug Safety Ministry identified more than 96,700 illegal online ads of food and pharmaceutical products in 2024 and 68,950 through September this year, up from around 59,000 in 2023.",
      "The problem is also spreading into areas such as private education, cosmetics and illegal gambling services, leaving the Korea Consumer Agency and other watchdogs struggling to keep pace, the Government Policy Coordination Office said.",
      "Beyond deceptive ads and misinformation, South Korea is also grappling with sexual abuse enabled by AI and other digital technologies. A Seoul court last month sentenced a 33-year-old man to life in prison for running an online blackmail ring that sexually exploited or abused more than 200 victims, including many minors who were threatened with deepfakes and other manipulated sexual images and videos.",

They also plan to bolster the monitoring capabilities of the Food and Drug Safety Ministry and the Korea Consumer Agency \u2014 using AI, of course.",
      "Prime Minister Kim, Seoul\u2019s No. 2 official behind President Lee Jae Myung, said during the policy meeting that it\u2019s crucial to \u201cminimize the side effects of new technologies\u201d as the country embraces the \u201cAI era.\u201d",
      "The plans to label AI-generated ads were announced as Lee, in a separate meeting with business leaders, reiterated his government\u2019s ambitions for AI, pledging national efforts to strengthen South Korea\u2019s capabilities in advanced computer chips that power the global AI race.",
      "Government plans include more research and development spending on AI-specific chips and other advanced semiconductor products as well as expanding the country\u2019s chip manufacturing hubs beyond metropolitan areas near the capital city of Seoul to the southern regions. South Korean chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, combined for more than 65% of the global memory chip market last year.",
      "The science and telecommunications ministry also said Wednesday it will require the country\u2019s wireless carriers to transition to 5G standalone networks, which are seen as optimal for advanced AI applications because of their higher bandwidth and lower latency, as a condition for renewing their 3G and LTE licenses.",

      "TORO TORO, Bolivia -- Legend once had it that the huge, three-toed footprints scattered across the central highlands of Bolivia came from supernaturally strong monsters \u2014 capable of sinking their claws even into solid stone.",
      "Then scientists came here in the 1960s and dispelled children's fears, determining that the strange footprints in fact belonged to gigantic, two-legged dinosaurs that stomped and splashed over 60 million years ago, in the ancient waterways of what is now Toro Toro, a village and popular national park in the Bolivian Andes.",
      "Now, a team of paleontologists, mostly from California\u2019s Loma Linda University, have discovered and meticulously documented 16,600 such footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. Their study, based on six years of regular field visits and published last Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, reports that this finding represents the highest number of theropod footprints recorded anywhere in the world.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no place in the world where you have such a big abundance of (theropod) footprints,\u201d said Roberto Biaggi, a co-author of the study led by Spanish paleontologist Ra\u00fal Esperante. \u201cWe have all these world records at this particular site.\u201d",
      "The dinosaurs that ruled the earth and roamed this region also made awkward attempts to swim here, according to the study, scratching at what was squishy lake-bottom sediment to leave another 1,378 traces.",
      "They pressed their claws into the mud just before water levels rose and sealed their tracks, protecting them from centuries of erosion, scientists said.",
      "\u201cThe preservation of many of the tracks is excellent,\u201d said Richard Butler, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research. He said that, to his knowledge, the number of footprints and trackways found in Toro Toro had no precedent.",
      "\u201cThis is a remarkable window into the lives and behaviors of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous,\u201d Butler added, referring to the period around 66 million years ago at the end of which an asteroid impact abruptly extinguished all dinosaurs and 75% of living species along with them, according to scientists.",
      "Although they've survived for millions of years, human life has threatened these traces. For decades, farmers threshed corn and wheat on the footprint-covered plateaus. Nearby quarry workers didn\u2019t think much of the formations as they blasted rock layers for limestone. And just two years ago, researchers said, highway crews tunneling through hillsides nearly wiped out a major site of dinosaur tracks before the national park intervened.",
      "Such disturbances may have something to do with the area's striking absence of dinosaur bones, teeth and eggs, experts say. For all of the footprints and swim traces found across Bolivia\u2019s Toro Toro, there are virtually no skeletal remains of the sort that litter the peaks and valleys of Argentine Patagonia and Campanha in Brazil.",
      "But the lack of bones could have natural causes, too. The team said the quantity and pattern of tracks \u2014 and the fact they were all found in the same sediment layer \u2014 suggest that dinosaurs didn\u2019t settle in what is now Bolivia as much as trudge along an ancient coastal superhighway stretching from southern Peru into northwest Argentina.",

      "How exciting a shower will look from Earth depends on many factors including the amount of debris and the brightness of the moon, which can overshadow the meteors' glow. The Geminids have a good window for peak viewing before the moon crashes the party after midnight.",
      "To enjoy the Geminid show, bundle up and venture away from city lights, which can drown out fireballs. The meteor shower will appear over the whole sky, so look to the darkest part or search for the Gemini constellation for which the shower is named.",

    "story": [
      "Japan has issued a megaquake advisory after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture on the main island",
      "TOKYO -- Japan issued a megaquake advisory Tuesday after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan's main island of Honshu, and just south of the northern island of Hokkaido. Damage from this quake was modest \u2014 34 mostly mild injuries and some damage to roads and buildings.",
      "Officials said the advisory is not a prediction and the probability of a magnitude 8 or larger quake is only about 1%. But there\u2019s hope the advisory will serve as a wake-up call for a quake that could have the devastation of the 2011 disaster that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed a nuclear plant.",
      "There's said to be an increased risk of a subsequent, magnitude-8 or larger quake within the next week. Officials are urging residents, especially along coastal areas, to be well prepared so they can grab an emergency bag and run as soon as possible if a bigger quake hits.",
      "This advisory seemed mindful compared with another advisory last year. The southern half of Japan's Pacific coastline received a \u201cNankai Trough\u201d megaquake advisory in the summer of 2024, but the ambiguity of that warning led to panic buying of emergency food, event cancellations and business closures.",
      "The Japan Meteorological Agency says Monday's powerful quake temporarily increased potential risks in the regions of Hokkaido and the Sanriku coast. That's where the Pacific Plate beneath Japan forms the two trenches \u2014 the Japan Trench and Chishima Trench \u2014 that have caused many large quakes in the past.",
      "Experts say the deadly quake and tsunami in 2011 was caused by movement associated with the Japan Trench. It spans from off the eastern coast of Chiba to Aomori, and the Chishima Trench goes from the eastern coast of Hokkaido to the northern islands and the Kurils.",
      "In explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011, that devastated large swaths of Japan's northern coast occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 temblor that occurred at the Japan Trench off the eastern coast of Iwate, one of the hardest-hit areas in that disaster as well as in Monday's quake.",
      "The 2011 quake caused a tsunami that battered northern coastal towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The tsunami, which topped 15 meters (50 feet) in some areas, slammed into and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That created deep fears of radiation that linger to this day.",
      "Another offshore megaquake in the Hokkaido-Sanriku area could cause up to a 30-meter (98-foot) tsunami in the region, kill as many as 199,000 people, destroy up to 220,000 houses and buildings, and cause estimated economic damages of up to 31 trillion yen ($198 billion), according to an estimate by the government. It says as many as 42,000 people could suffer from hypothermia in the winter.",
      "The areas covered by the advisory extend across 182 municipalities from Hokkaido to Chiba prefecture.",
      "Japan's separate advisory for an even more damaging megaquake stemming from the Nankai Trough, which affects the southern half of Japan's Pacific coast, was activated for the first time last August after a magnitude 7.1 quake occurred off the eastern coast of Miyazaki.",

      "Officials are stressing that the latest advisory has no prediction for any megaquake happening at any specific time or location, a Cabinet official for disaster prevention, Tsukasa Morikubo, told a news conference early Tuesday. He called on residents to be cautious and prepared while continuing their daily activity and work.",

      "Archaeologists in Britain say they have found the earliest known evidence of deliberate fire-making, dating to around 400,000 years ago",
      "LONDON -- Scientists in Britain say ancient humans may have learned to make fire far earlier than previously believed, after uncovering evidence that deliberate fire-setting took place in what is now eastern England around 400,000 years ago.",
      "The findings, described in the journal Nature, push back the earliest known date for controlled fire-making by roughly 350,000 years. Until now, the oldest confirmed evidence had come from Neanderthal sites in what is now northern France dating to about 50,000 years ago.",
      "The discovery was made at Barnham, a Paleolithic site in Suffolk that has been excavated for decades. A team led by the British Museum identified a patch of baked clay, flint hand axes fractured by intense heat and two fragments of iron pyrite, a mineral that produces sparks when struck against flint.",
      "Researchers spent four years analyzing to rule out natural wildfires. Geochemical tests showed temperatures had exceeded 700 degrees Celsius (1,292 Fahrenheit), with evidence of repeated burning in the same location.",
      "That pattern, they say, is consistent with a constructed hearth rather than a lightning strike.",
      "Rob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said the combination of high temperatures, controlled burning and pyrite fragments shows \u201chow they were actually making the fire and the fact they were making it.\u201d",
      "Iron pyrite does not occur naturally at Barnham. Its presence suggests the people who lived there deliberately collected it because they understood its properties and could use it to ignite tinder.",
      "Deliberate fire-making is rarely preserved in the archaeological record. Ash is easily dispersed, charcoal decays and heat-altered sediments can be eroded.",
      "At Barnham, however, the burned deposits were sealed within ancient pond sediments, allowing scientists to reconstruct how early people used the site.",

      "Fire also enabled new forms of social life. Evening gatherings around a hearth would have provided time for planning, storytelling and strengthening group relationships, which are behaviors often associated with the development of language and more organized societies.",

    "story": [
      "The federal government\u2019s crackdown on commercial driver\u2019s licenses for immigrants has now found problems in eight states in the wake of several deadly crashes",
      "The federal government's crackdown on commercial driver's licenses for immigrants has found problems in eight states so far in the wake of several deadly crashes.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has publicly threatened to withhold millions in federal money from California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and now New York after investigations found problems such as licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's legal status expired. But the department quietly also sent letters detailing similar concerns to Texas, South Dakota, Colorado and Washington during the government shutdown after briefly mentioning those states in September.",
      "Concerns about immigrant truck drivers gained attention after a tractor-trailer driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused an August crash in Florida that killed three people. A fiery California crash that also killed three people in October and involved a truck driver in the country illegally added to the worries.",
      "Duffy proposed new restrictions in September that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license to drive a semi or a bus, but a court has put the new rules on hold.",
      "In addition, the Trump administration has been seeking to enforce existing English language requirements for truckers since the summer. As of October, about 9,500 truck drivers have been pulled off the road nationwide for failing to demonstrate English proficiency during traffic stops or inspections.",
      "Here's a summary of what has happened so far:",
      "The Transportation Department focused first on California because the driver in the Florida crash got a license there. He also went to California after the crash and had to be extradited to face charges.",
      "California fought back after Duffy threatened to pull $160 million from the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom sparred with Duffy in statements and social media posts defending the state's practices by saying California officials had verified the immigration status of all these drivers through federal databases, as required.",
      "But after that back-and-forth, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses last month after confirming problems with them. That number has since grown to 21,000. So the Transportation Department hasn't pulled that funding.",
      "But Duffy did revoke a separate $40 million in federal funding because he said California is the only state not enforcing English language requirements for truckers.",
      "The federal government might withhold nearly $75 million from Pennsylvania if it is not satisfied with the actions the state takes.",
      "The Transportation Department said its audit found a couple of licenses out of 150 it reviewed were valid after the driver's lawful presence in the country ended. In four other cases, the federal government said Pennsylvania gave no evidence it had required noncitizens to provide legitimate proof they were legally in the country at the time they got the license.",
      "As it has done in all these states, the Transportation Department ordered Pennsylvania to stop issuing commercial driver's licenses to immigrants until it completed a full review to ensure all the licenses it has issued remain valid and revoke any licenses that aren't.",
      "The federal government said that approximately 12,400 noncitizen drivers hold an unexpired commercial learner\u2019s permit or commercial driver\u2019s license issued by Pennsylvania.",
      "Duffy threatened to withhold $30.4 million from Minnesota if that state doesn\u2019t address shortcomings in its commercial driver\u2019s license program and revoke any licenses that never should have been issued.",
      "The Transportation Department found some licenses that were valid beyond a driver\u2019s work permit and some where the state never verified a driver\u2019s immigration status.",
      "The head of Minnesota's Department of Driver and Vehicle Services, Pong Xiong, said the state found a number of administrative issues in the 2,117 non-domiciled commercial licenses the state has issued and took action, including cancelling some licenses. Xiong said the federal audit largely just confirmed the issues Minnesota had already found and corrected.",

And he said the state could not prove it had verified these drivers\u2019 immigration status for the 32,000 active non-domiciled commercial licenses it has issued. Plus, investigators found some examples of New York issuing licenses even when applicants\u2019 work authorizations were already expired.",

      "Nearly half of the 123 licenses investigators reviewed in Texas were flawed, so the Transportation Department threatened to withhold $182 million if the state doesn't reform its licensing programs and invalidate any flawed licenses.",
      "A spokesperson for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement that \u201cpublic safety is the Governor\u2019s top priority, and we must ensure that truckers can navigate Texas roadways safely and efficiently. To support this mission, Governor Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to strictly enforce English language proficiency requirements and to stop issuing intrastate commercial driver\u2019s licenses to drivers who do not meet those standards.\u201d",

      "Eighteen Mexican citizens who weren't eligible were also issued commercial licenses.",
      "Jennifer Giambi, a spokesperson for the Colorado DMV, said the state is in the middle of auditing its licensing program to check for any additional problems, and that audit should be done by January. No new licenses are being issued in the program right now.",
      "The state could lose $31.35 million if the Transportation Department isn't satisfied with their response.",
      "Investigators only found problems in about 10% of the 125 licenses they reviewed in Washington, but they were alarmed to learn that an internal state review discovered 685 immigrant drivers who were issued regular commercial licenses instead of the non-domiciled ones they should have received. The Transportation Department said that state officials often accepted the wrong documents in those cases.",
      "Washington officials told the AP they couldn't immediately respond Friday while the state is grappling with widespread flooding. But earlier this week, a state Department of Licensing spokesperson, Nathan Olson, said in an email to the Seattle Times that the errors had been addressed and Washington is working to improve its system and procedures.",

      "VILNIUS, Lithuania -- Belarus freed Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski, key opposition figure Maria Kolesnikova and dozens of other political prisoners on Saturday, capping two days of talks with Washington aimed at improving ties and getting crippling U.S. sanctions lifted on a key Belarusian agricultural export.",
      "President Alexander Lukashenko pardoned 123 prisoners, Belarus\u2019 state news agency, Belta, reported. In exchange, the U.S. said it was lifting sanctions on the Eastern European country's potash sector,",
      "A close ally of Russia, Minsk has faced Western isolation and sanctions for years. Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades, and the country has been repeatedly sanctioned by the West for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "John Coale, the U.S. special envoy for Belarus who met with Lukashenko in Minsk on Friday and Saturday, described the talks to reporters as \u201cvery productive\" and said normalizing relations between the two countries was \u201cour goal,\u201d Belta reported.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re lifting sanctions, releasing prisoners. We\u2019re constantly talking to each other,\u201d Coale said, adding that the relationship between the U.S. and Belarus was moving from \u201cbaby steps to more confident steps\u201d as they increased dialogue, the Belarusian news agency reported.",
      "Belarus has released hundreds of prisoners since July 2024. Among the 123 freed Saturday were a U.S. citizen, six citizens of U.S. allied countries, and five Ukrainian citizens, a U.S. official told The Associated Press in an email. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private diplomatic negotiations, described the release as \u201ca significant milestone in U.S.-Belarus engagement\u201d and \u201cyet another diplomatic victory\u201d for U.S. President Donald Trump.",

      "Pavel Sapelka, an advocate with the Viasna rights group, confirmed to the AP that Bialiatski and Kolesnikova were among those released.",
      "Bialiatski, a human rights advocate who founded Viasna, was in jail when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 along with the prominent Russian rights group Memorial and Ukraine\u2019s Center for Civil Liberties. He was later convicted of smuggling and financing actions that violated public order \u2014 charges that were widely denounced as politically motivated \u2014 and sentenced to 10 years in 2023.",
      "Bialiatski told the AP by phone Saturday that his release after 1,613 days behind bars came as a surprise \u2014 in the morning, he was still in an overcrowded prison cell.",
      "\u201cIt feels like I jumped out of icy water into a normal, warm room, so I have to adapt. After isolation, I need to get information about what\u2019s going on,\" said Bialiatski, who seemed energetic but pale and emaciated in post-release videos and photos.",

      "Kolesnikova, meanwhile, was a key figure in the mass protests that rocked Belarus in 2020 and is a close ally of an opposition leader in exile, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.",
      "Known for her close-cropped hair and trademark gesture of forming a heart with her hands, Kolesnikova became an even greater symbol of resistance when Belarusian authorities tried to deport her in September 2020. Driven to the Ukrainian border, she briefly broke away from security forces at the frontier, tore up her passport and walked back into Belarus.",
      "The 43-year-old professional flutist was convicted in 2021 on charges including conspiracy to seize power and sentenced to 11 years in prison.",
      "Among the others who were released, according to Viasna, was Viktar Babaryka \u2014 an opposition figure who had sought to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 presidential election, widely seen as rigged, before being convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison on charges he rejected as political.",

      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies, has been released from immigration detention, and a judge has temporarily blocked any further efforts to detain him",
      "BALTIMORE -- Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies, was released from immigration detention on Thursday, and a judge has temporarily blocked any further efforts to detain him.",
      "Abrego Garcia currently can\u2019t be deported to his home country of El Salvador thanks to a 2019 immigration court order that found he had a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of danger there. However, the Trump administration has said he cannot stay in the U.S. Over the past few months, government officials have said they would deport him to Uganda, Eswatini, Ghana and, most recently, Liberia.",
      "Abrego Garcia is fighting his deportation in federal court in Maryland, where his attorneys claim the administration is manipulating the immigration system to punish him for successfully challenging his earlier deportation.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the latest developments in the case:",
      "Abrego Garcia is a Salvadoran citizen with an American wife and child who has lived in Maryland for years. He immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager to join his brother, who had become a U.S. citizen. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country.",
      "While he was allowed to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision, he was not given residency status. Earlier this year, he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, despite the earlier court ruling.",
      "When Abrego Garcia was deported in March, he was held in a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison despite having no criminal record.",
      "The Trump administration initially fought efforts to bring him back to the U.S. but eventually complied after the U.S. Supreme Court weighed in. He returned to the U.S. in June, only to face an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia was held in a Tennessee jail for more than two months before he was released on Friday, Aug. 22, to await trial in Maryland under home detention.",
      "His freedom lasted a weekend. On the following Monday, he reported to the Baltimore immigration office for a check-in and was immediately taken into immigration custody. Officials announced plans to deport him to a series of African countries, but they were blocked by an order from U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland.",
      "On Thursday, after months of legal filings and hearings, Xinis ruled that Abrego Garcia should be released immediately. Her ruling hinged on what was likely a procedural error by the immigration judge who heard his case in 2019.",
      "Normally, in a case like this, an immigration judge will first issue an order of removal. Then the judge will essentially freeze that order by issuing a \u201cwithholding of removal\" order, according to Memphis immigration attorney Andrew Rankin.",
      "In Abrego Garcia's case, the judge granted withholding of removal to El Salvador because he found Abrego Garcia's life could be in danger there. However, the judge never took the first step of issuing the order of removal. The government argued in Xinis' court that the order of removal could be inferred, but the judge disagreed.",
      "Without a final order of removal, Abrego Garcia can't be deported, Xinis ruled.",

      "The only way to get an order of removal is to go back to immigration court and ask for one, Rankin said. But reopening the immigration case is a gamble because Abrego Garcia's attorneys would likely seek protection from deportation in the form of asylum or some other type of relief.",
      "One wrinkle is that immigration courts are officially part of the executive branch, and the judges there are not generally viewed as being as independent as federal judges.",
      "\u201cThere might be independence in some areas, but if the administration wants a certain result, by all accounts it seems they\u2019re going to exert the pressure on the individuals to get that result,\u201d Rankin said. \u201cI hope he gets a fair shake, and two lawyers make arguments \u2014 somebody wins, somebody loses \u2014 instead of giving it to an immigration judge with a 95% denial rate, where everybody in the world knows how it\u2019s gonna go down.\u201d",
      "Alternatively, the government could appeal Xinis' order to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and try to get her ruling overturned, Rankin said. If the appeals court agreed with the government that the final order of removal was implied, there could be no need to reopen the immigration case.",
      "In compliance with Xinis' order, Abrego Garcia was released from immigration detention in Pennsylvania on Thursday evening and allowed to return home for the first time in months. However, he was also told to report to an immigration officer in Baltimore early the next morning.",
      "Fearing that he would be detained again, his attorneys asked Xinis for a temporary restraining order. Xinis filed that order early Friday morning. It prohibits immigration officials from taking Abrego Garcia back into custody, at least for the time being. A hearing on the issue could happen as early as next week.",
      "Meanwhile, in Tennessee, Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty in the criminal case where he is charged with human smuggling and conspiracy to commit human smuggling.",
      "Prosecutors claim he accepted money to transport, within the United States, people who were in the country illegally. The charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. Body camera footage from a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer shows a calm exchange with Abrego Garcia. There were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling.

      "A federal judge says the Justice Department violated the constitutional rights of a close friend of James Comey and must return to him computer files that prosecutors had hoped to use for a potential criminal case against the former FBI director",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department violated the constitutional rights of a close friend of James Comey and must return to him computer files that prosecutors had hoped to use for a potential criminal case against the former FBI director, a federal judge said Friday.",
      "The ruling from U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly represents not only a stern rebuke of the conduct of Justice Department prosecutors but also imposes a dramatic hurdle to government efforts to seek a new indictment against Comey after an initial one was dismissed last month.",
      "The order concerns computer files and communications that investigators obtained years earlier from Daniel Richman, a Comey friend and Columbia University law professor, as part of a media leak investigation that concluded without charges. The Justice Department continued to hold onto those files and conducted searches of them this fall, without a new warrant, as they prepared a case charging Comey with lying to Congress five years ago.",
      "Richman alleged that the Justice Department violated his Fourth Amendment rights by retaining his records and by conducting new warrantless searches of the files, prompting Kollar-Kotelly to issue an order last week temporarily barring prosecutors from accessing the files as part of its investigation.",
      "The Justice Department said the request for the return of the records was merely an attempt to impede a new prosecution of Comey, but the judge again sided with Richman in a 46-page order Friday that directed the Justice Department to give him back his files.",
      "\u201cWhen the Government violates the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures by sweeping up a broad swath of a person\u2019s electronic files, retaining those files long after the relevant investigation has ended, and later sifting through those files without a warrant to obtain evidence against someone else, what remedy is available to the victim of the Government\u2019s unlawful intrusion?\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "One answer, she said, is to require the government to return the property to the rightful owner.",
      "The judge did, however, permit the Justice Department to file an electronic copy of Richman's records under seal with he Eastern District of Virginia, where the Comey investigation is based, and suggested prosecutors could try to access it later with a lawful search warrant.",

Prosecutors charged the former FBI director in September with lying to Congress by denying that he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source for the media.",
      "That indictment was dismissed last month after a federal judge in Virginia ruled that the prosecutor who brought the case, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. But the ruling left open the possibility that the government could try again to seek charges against Comey, a longtime foe of President Donald Trump. Comey has pleaded not guilty, denied having made a false statement and accused the Justice Department of a vindictive prosecution.",
      "The Comey saga has a long history.",
      "In 2017, he testified that he had given Richman a copy of a memo he had written documenting a conversation he had with Trump and had authorized him to share the contents of the memo with a reporter. After that testimony, Richman permitted the FBI to create an image, or complete electronic copy, of all files on his computer and a hard drive attached to that computer.",
      "Then, in 2019 and 2020, the FBI and Justice Department obtained search warrants to obtain Richman's email accounts and computer files as part of a media leak investigation that concluded without charges.",
      "But Richman said the Justice Department violated his rights by searching his files in September, without a new warrant, as part of an entirely separate investigation.",

      "Kwon, known by some as \u201cthe cryptocurrency king,\u201d pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court in August to fraud charges stemming from Terraform Labs\u2019 $40 billion crash.",
      "The company had touted its TerraUSD as a reliable \u201cstablecoin\u201d \u2014 a kind of currency typically pegged to stable assets to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices.

      "An immigration crackdown in Louisiana has forced some teenagers to grow up fast after their parents were arrested by federal agents",
      "KENNER, La. -- Vilma Cruz, a mother of two, had just arrived at her newly leased Louisiana home this week when federal agents surrounded her vehicle in the driveway. She had just enough time to call her oldest son before they smashed the passenger window and detained her.",
      "The 38-year-old Honduran house painter was swept up in an immigration crackdown that has largely targeted Kenner, a Hispanic enclave just outside New Orleans, where some parents at risk of deportation had rushed to arrange emergency custody plans for their children in case they were arrested.",
      "Federal agents have made more than 250 arrests this month across southeast Louisiana, according to the Department of Homeland Security, the latest in a series of enforcement operations that have also unfolded in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. In some homes, the arrests have taken away parents who were caretakers and breadwinners, leaving some teenagers to grow up fast and fill in at home for absent mothers and fathers.",
      "Cruz's detention forced her son, Jonathan Escalante, an 18-year-old U.S. citizen who recently finished high school, to care for his 9-year-old sister, who has a physical disability. Escalante is now trying to access his mother's bank account, locate his sister's medical records and doctors, and figure out how to pay bills in his mother's name.",
      "\u201cHonestly I\u2019m not ready, having to take care of all of these responsibilities,\u201d Escalante told The Associated Press. \u201cBut I\u2019m willing to take them on if I have to. And I\u2019m just praying that I get my mom back.\u201d",
      "The crackdown dubbed \u201cCatahoula Crunch\u201d has a goal of 5,000 arrests. DHS has said it is targeting violent offenders but has released few details on who it is arresting. Records reviewed by AP found that the majority of those detained in the first two days of the effort had no criminal histories.",
      "This week, Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, a Republican, became the first state official to break with his party over the operations. He criticized them for undermining the regional economy by triggering labor shortages because even immigrants with valid work permits have stayed home out of fear.",
      "\"So I think there needs to be some clarity of what\u2019s the plan,\u201d Nungesser said. \u201cAre they going to take every person, regardless if they got kids, and they\u2019re going to leave the kids behind?\u201d",
      "DHS said Cruz locked herself in the car and refused to lower the window and exit the vehicle as ordered, which forced agents to break the window to unlock the door. She is being held in federal custody pending removal proceedings, officials said.",
      "Immigrant rights groups say the operation is applying a dragnet approach to racially profile Hispanic communities.",
      "In the weeks before the crackdown began, dozens of families without legal status sought to make emergency custody arrangements with relatives, aided by pro bono legal professionals at events organized by advocacy groups in Kenner and throughout the New Orleans region.",
      "\u201cChildren are going to school unsure whether their parents will be home at the end of the day,\" Raiza Pitre, a member of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Louisiana, told a city council meeting Wednesday in Jefferson Parish, which includes Kenner.",
      "Juan Proa\u00f1o, CEO of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said he receives dozens of calls daily from Louisiana families worried about being separated from their children. His organization is helping Escalante navigate life without his mother, and he wants to prepare her son for the worst.",
      "\u201cHe thinks she\u2019ll be home in a couple of days, but it could be weeks or months, or she could be deported,\u201d Proa\u00f1o said.",
      "Cruz's family was supposed to move into their new home next month. She leased it so that her son could finally sleep in his own room.",
      "Kenner resident Kristi Rogers watched masked agents detain Cruz, a soon-to-be neighbor whom she had not yet met. Rogers said her heart went out to Cruz, and she wondered why she was targeted.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m for them trying to clean up the criminals in our area, but I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s all they are detaining and deporting \u2014 the criminals,\u201d Rogers said.",

He said residents were also at risk from immigrant drivers who are unlicensed and uninsured.",
      "\u201cI think that missions like this, by the government, are welcome because it\u2019s going to change the landscape of the city and make improvements,\u201d Conley said.",
      "Jose Reyes, a Honduran construction worker and landscaper whose family says he has lived in the U.S. for 16 years, stayed home for weeks to avoid federal agents. But the father of four had to pay rent, so last week he drove to the bank around the corner.",
      "Unmarked vehicles began following Reyes and pulled up alongside his car as he parked in front of his house in Kenner. A video reviewed by AP showed several agents leaping out and removing Reyes from his car as his sobbing daughters screamed for mercy.",
      "\u201cWe were begging that they let him go,\" said his eldest daughter, 19-year-old Heylin Leonor Reyes. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who provides for food, pays bills, pays the rent. We were begging them because they\u2019re leaving a family totally in the dark, trying to figure out what to do, figuring out where to get money to get by.\u201d",

      "His daughter, who works at a local restaurant, said her salary is not enough to keep a roof over the heads of her three younger siblings, two of whom she says were born in the U.S. and are American citizens. Her mother is caring for the youngest, a 4-year-old, who watched agents grab her father from the doorway.",

      "The Trump administration may have softened its language on China to maintain a truce in their trade war, but Congress is pushing for more restrictions on Beijing",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration may have softened its language on China to maintain a fragile truce in their trade war, but Congress is charging ahead with more restrictions in a defense authorization bill that would deny Beijing investments in highly sensitive sectors and reduce U.S. reliance on Chinese biotechnology companies.",
      "Included in the 3,000-page bill approved Wednesday by the House is a provision to scrutinize American investments in China that could help develop technologies to boost Chinese military power. The bill, which next heads to the Senate, also would prohibit government money to be used for equipment and services from blacklisted Chinese biotechnology companies.",
      "In addition, the National Defense Authorization Act would boost U.S. support for the self-governing island of Taiwan that Beijing claims as its own and says it will take by force if necessary.",
      "\u201cTaken together, these measures reflect a serious, strategic approach to countering the Chinese Communist Party,\u201d said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the top Democrat on the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. He said the approach \u201cstands in stark contrast to the White House's recent actions.\u201d",
      "The compromise bill authorizing $900 billion for military programs was released two days after the White House unveiled its national security strategy. The Trump administration dropped Biden-era language that cast China as a strategic threat and said the U.S. \u201cwill rebalance America\u2019s economic relationship with China,\u201d an indication that President Donald Trump is more interested in a mutually advantageous economic relationship with Beijing than in long-term competition.",
      "The White House this week also allowed Nvidia to sell an advanced type of computer chip to China, with those more hawkish toward Beijing concerned that would help boost the country's artificial intelligence.",
      "The China-related provisions in the traditionally bipartisan defense bill \u201cmake clear that, whatever the White House tone, Capitol Hill is locking in a hard-edged, long-term competition with Beijing,\u201d said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "If passed, these provisions would \u201cbuild a floor under U.S. competitiveness policy \u2014 on capital, biotech, and critical tech \u2014 that will be very hard for future presidents to unwind quietly,\u201d he said.",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington on Wednesday denounced the bill.",
      "\u201cThe bill has kept playing up the \u2018China threat\u2019 narrative, trumpeting for military support to Taiwan, abusing state power to go after Chinese economic development, limiting trade, economic and people-to-people exchanges between China and the U.S., undermining China\u2019s sovereignty, security and development interests and disrupting efforts of the two sides in stabilizing bilateral relations,\u201d said Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesperson.",
      "\u201cChina strongly deplores and firmly opposes this,\" Liu said.",
      "U.S. policymakers and lawmakers have been working for several years toward bipartisan legislation to curb investments in China when it comes to cutting-edge technologies such as quantum computing, aerospace, semiconductors and artificial intelligence. Those efforts flopped last year when Tesla CEO Elon Musk opposed a spending bill.",

      "\u201cFor too long, the hard-earned money of American retirees and investors has been used to build up China\u2019s military and economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis legislation will help bring that to an end.\u201d",
      "Congress last year failed to pass the BIOSECURE Act, which cited national security in preventing federal money from benefiting a number of Chinese biotechnology companies. Critics said then that it was unfair to single out specific companies, warning that the measure would delay clinical trials and hinder development of new drugs, raise costs for medications and hurt innovation.",
      "The provision in the NDAA no longer names companies but leaves it to the Office of Management and Budget to compile a list of \u201cbiotechnology companies of concern.\u201d The bill also would expand Pentagon investments in biotechnology.",
      "Moolenaar lauded the effort for taking \u201cdefensive action to secure American pharmaceutical supply chains and genetic information from malign Chinese companies.\u201d",
      "The defense bill also would authorize an increase in funding, to $1 billion from $300 million this year, for Taiwan-related security cooperation and direct the Pentagon to establish a joint drone and anti-drone program.",
      "Another provision supports Taiwan's bid to join the International Monetary Fund, which would provide the self-governing island with financial protection from China.",
      "It comes amid mixed signals from Trump, who appears careful not to upset Beijing as he seeks to strike trade deals with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The Chinese leader has urged Trump to handle the Taiwan issue \u201cwith prudence,\" as Beijing considers its claim over Taiwan a core interest.",

      "Most U.S. stocks are rising, but a drop for Oracle is holding Wall Street back as investors question whether its big spending on artificial-intelligence technology will pay off",
      "NEW YORK -- Most U.S. stocks are rising on Thursday, but a drop for Oracle is holding Wall Street back as investors question whether its big spending on artificial-intelligence technology will pay off.",
      "The S&P 500 fell 0.4% in early trading and pulled a bit further from its all-time high, which was set in October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 233 points, or 0.5%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.7% lower.",
      "Oracle was one of the heaviest weights on the market and sank 14.5% even though it reported a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its 14% growth in revenue came up just short of expectations.",
      "Doubts also remain about whether all the spending that Oracle is doing on AI technology will produce the payoff of increased profits and productivity that proponents are promising. Analysts said they were surprised by how much Oracle may spend on AI investments this fiscal year, and questions continue about how the company will pay for it.",
      "Such doubts are weighing on the AI industry broadly, even as many billions of dollars continue to flow in. They had helped drag the broad U.S. stock market through some sharp and scary swings last month.",
      "Nvidia, the chip company that\u2019s become the poster child of the AI boom and is raking in close to $20 billion each month, fell 2.8% Thursday. It was the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500.",
      "Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison said it will continue to buy chips from Nvidia, but it\u2019s now taking a policy of \u201cchip neutrality,\u201d where it will use \u201cwhatever chips our customers want to buy. There are going to be a lot of changes in AI technology over the next few years and we must remain agile in response to those changes.\u201d",
      "Most U.S. stocks nevertheless rose, thanks in part to easing Treasury yields in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.10% from 4.13% on Wednesday and from 4.18% on Tuesday.",
      "Lower Treasury yields mean U.S. government bonds are paying less in interest, which can encourage investors to pay higher prices for stocks and other kinds of investments.",
      "Yields fell after a report said the number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits jumped last week by more than economists expected. That\u2019s a potential indication of rising layoffs.",
      "A day earlier, yields eased after the Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate for the third time this year and indicated another cut may be ahead in 2026. Wall Street loves lower interest rates because they can boost the economy and send prices for investments higher, even if they potentially make inflation worse.",

      "President Donald Trump issued a symbolic pardon for Tina Peters on Thursday, but it alone won't free the former Colorado elections administrator who was convicted under state laws of orchestrating a data breach scheme driven by false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election.",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to face tough questions from Democrats over the Republican administration's immigration policies at a House hearing",
      "WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who heads the agency central to President Donald Trump's mass deportations agenda, is expected to face fierce questioning from Democrats on Thursday as the public face of the Republican administration's hard-line approach to immigration.",
      "It has been months since Noem last appeared in Congress in May. Since then, immigration enforcement operations, especially in Los Angeles and Chicago, have become increasingly contentious, with federal agents and activists frequently clashing over her department's tactics.",
      "Noem is testifying in front of the House Committee on Homeland Security to discuss \u201cWorldwide Threats to the Homeland,\u201d which in years past have focused on issues such as cybersecurity, terrorism, China and border security. With Noem having made only a few appearances before Congress when she is leading Trump's signature policy area, Thursday's appearance is likely to focus heavily on immigration.",
      "Trump returned to power in January with what he says is a mandate to reshape immigration in the U.S., claiming the country is under an invasion.",
      "In the months since, the number of people in immigration detention has skyrocketed; the administration has continued to remove migrants to countries they are not from; and, in the wake of an Afghan national being accused of shooting two National Guard troops, Noem\u2019s department has dramatically stepped up checks and screening of immigrants in the U.S.",
      "The worldwide threats hearing, usually held annually, is an opportunity for members of Congress to ask the leaders of the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the National Counterterrorism Center about threats facing the U.S. and what their agencies are doing to address them.",
      "Noem's department is under particular scrutiny because Congress in July passed legislation giving it roughly $165 billion to carry out its mass deportations agenda and secure the border. The department is getting more money to hire 10,000 more deportation officers, complete the wall between the U.S. and Mexico and increase detention and removal of foreigners from the country.",

      "The secretary's appearance also comes as a federal judge is investigating whether she should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador.",
      "Noem will also likely have to answer to criticism from Democrats who accuse immigration enforcement agents of erroneously detaining and arresting American citizens in their rush to deport as many people in the country illegally as possible. Homeland Security says agents carrying out immigration enforcement operations do not target or arrest American citizens for immigration reasons although they say they have arrested Americans for allegedly interfering in enforcement operations.",
      "And a number of the Democratic members of the committee are part of a lawsuit accusing Noem and the department of limiting their access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities.",
      "Also attending Thursday\u2019s hearing are Joseph Kent, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, and Michael Glasheen, operations director of the national security branch of the FBI.",
      "Previous hearings have included questions on cybersecurity, China, chemical security and drones. Under President Joe Biden, at times of heavy migration at the southern border, Republicans often focused their questioning on his Democratic administration's handling of border security.",
      "When the hearing was announced in September, the Republican committee chair said that besides Noem and Kent, FBI Director Kash Patel would also be attending. But instead the FBI is being represented by Glasheen.",

      "Joe Hunter: My sister started saying comments that he would make to her like, hey, we can help save you. Because you're half black, we can help fix that through religion. Because of your hair and the way you look, we can fix that with religion. \u2026 And you just think, how dare you?",

      "Jacob Cantrell: I couldn't go to my mom and dad's house \u2026 without asking Mark permission. \u2026 I was brainwashed. \u2026 he manipulated me for many years and it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it twisted my brain up.",

      "Natalie Morales: Was there a fear then amongst the people who attended the church, did they fear Mark Lewis?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I think the people that were his puppets, I think they acted out of fear a lot.",

      "Sarah Nottingham: He had asked if I heard what happened, he sounded upset. He was crying.",
      "At the time, Nottingham says, she believed in her pastor \u2014 Joanna had died by suicide. Sarah says she and Lewis became friends, then began dating about a year after Joanna's death.",

      "Eventually, Nottingham says another side of Mark Lewis began to emerge.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: A lot of ... extreme manipulation, a lot of gaslighting, and a lot of verbal abuse, um, some physical. ... A push or a shove. ... And it was just more and more.",

      "Sarah Nottingham: You know, I'm just like, I've had enough, like, I'm done. And he said, I'm not ready for it to be over. \u2026 I would just keep telling him, you know, this is, it's over, we're done.",
      "Lewis grabbed her, she says, and tightly wrapped his arms around her.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was meant to be threatening. He squeezed me tight and told me, \"You've created a monster.\"",

      "Sarah Nottingham: It was three something in the morning. And I woke up to our um fire alarm going off \u2026 and there was um smoke filling the hallway. And I checked on my kids.",
      "A Molotov cocktail had crashed through her parents' bedroom window.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: We were able to put the fire out ourselves. \u2026 I had never seen my dad run so fast out the door, trying to see if he could see anybody.",
      "Vacaville Police pulled over a U-Haul van within minutes, arresting the driver and two passengers. The trio quickly confessed, telling police they were hired to firebomb Sarah Nottingham's house \u2014 hired by the pastor, Mark Lewis. He was questioned by local reporters.",

      "Natalie Morales: What do you think you and your family survived at that time?",

      "On day three of Lewis' arson and stalking trial, he changed his plea from not guilty to no contest \u2014 meaning he would not dispute the charges against him but also would not acknowledge guilt. Lewis was sentenced to eight years in prison.",
      "Natalie Morales: How important was that development then in allowing you to then go back to the sheriff's office and demand that they reopen the case?",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was huge, because there was \u2014   it isn't often that you read about a pastor hiring people to firebomb someone's house. ... Because of media pressure, we felt that now is the time where we can go back and say, \"Look at Joanna's case. Reopen it.\"",
      "The Solano County Sheriff's Office did reopen the case in 2014. Remember the churchgoer who called 911 the night Joanna died? His name is Andrew Alvarado. Back then he told authorities that he had played basketball with Pastor Mark Lewis for about six hours. Detectives decided to reinterview him and recorded the call.",
      "DETECTIVE MEHL (phone call): Was anyone else playing basketball with you?",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO: Yeah, a couple other \u2026 teenagers.",

      "Natalie Morales: So there were gaps of time when he was not with Mark Lewis.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: Right. \u2026 That still does not change the fact that \u2026 the lack of evidence on her body does not show a second person involved in her death.",
      "Mark Lewis was not questioned during the reinvestigation.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He ... \u2026 exercised his constitutional right to have his attorney, who did not allow him to speak to us.",

And then in 2015, the county district attorney's office announced its own investigation, which included DNA testing on Joanna's bathrobe sash. The results? Her DNA was found on the sash along with an unknown male \u2014  not Mark Lewis.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was anything done to investigate that further, to \u2026 could it have been anybody else associated with Mark Lewis?",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That DNA that was collected from there, my understanding is that it was entered into the DNA \u2014 I believe it's called CODIS, the database.",

      "Dr. Bill Smock: What I've spent 40 years doing is analyzing injuries, reconstructing how injuries occur.",
      "And where the Solano County Sheriff's Department saw a bathrobe sash, a note and a suicide, Smock saw something else: something new.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: There was a braided nylon marine rope three feet from Joanna. \u2026 The murder weapon was there in the room with Joanna. \u2026 When you look at the photos of the mark that was created on her neck, the only thing in that closet that could have created that was the marine rope.",
      "But because he was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, no one outside the sheriff's office saw Smock's report.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: I could not talk to the family \u2026 I could only talk to the lieutenant at Solano County regarding my findings.",
      "Here was everything the Hunters had been looking for ... but they did not even know the rope existed. Or how Smock made his determination. Smock was eventually released from the NDA and was able to show \"48 Hours\" using mannequins and red paint.",

      "Dr. Bill Smock: We're gonna apply the rope \u2026 and see what type of imprint it creates. \u2026 You'll notice along the edge that there's a distinct fabric imprint, which is the type of fabric imprint we saw on Joanna's neck.",

      "When they took up the Hunters' cause, they believed that Joanna's history of neck injuries told them they were looking at a strangulation.",
      "Casey Gwynn: The fact is that if you strangle a woman one time in an intimate relationship, she's 750 percent more likely to be killed by you.",
      "Smock, who works for Alliance for HOPE, confirmed their suspicion.",

      "Actor and comedic icon Dick Van Dyke is 100 years young today.",
      "The famed star sang and danced his way into America's heart through his illustrious career that has spanned nearly eight decades.",
      "As part of the celebration this weekend, theaters across the country are showing a new documentary about his life, \"Dick Van Dyke: 100th Celebration.\"",
      "Van Dyke's work helped define a generation. He became one of the biggest actors of his era with the eponymous show \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" which ran for five years on CBS.",
      "Early in his career, Van Dyke was quoted as saying he wanted to make films his children could watch. And he got his dream when Walt Disney cast him in \"Mary Poppins\" \u2013 bad cockney accent and all \u2013 alongside the incomparable Julie Andrews. He also appeared in the equally kid-friendly \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I could have been James Bond. When Sean Connery left, the producer said, 'Would you like to be the next Bond?' I said, 'Have you heard my British accent?' Click! That's a true story!\" Van Dyke told CBS Sunday Morning in 2023.",
      "During his career, Van Dyke won four Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award and a Grammy Award. He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1995.",
      "Just last year, he became the oldest winner of a Daytime Emmy, for a guest role on the soap \"Days of Our Lives.\"",
      "\"I'll be darned. I think I'm the last of my generation. I'm 98. I have \u2014 almost \u2014 all my marbles. I can't remember what I had for breakfast,\" he told Entertainment Tonight before his win.",
      "Van Dyke, who is just an Oscar shy of the elusive EGOT title, said he would love a shot at the Academy Award.",
      "\"I hope it's not posthumous,\" he joked.",
      "In the 1970s, Van Dyke found sobriety after battling alcoholism.",
      "\"I'm on my third generation,\" he told CBS Sunday Morning in 2023. \"I'm getting letters from little kids, and that is what I love, that they watch the movies over and over. I'm getting so much more mail today than I did during the heyday of my career.\"",
      "Now that he has hit triple digits, Van Dyke said he's gotten some perspective on how he used to play older characters.",
      "\"You know, I played old men a lot, and I always played them as angry and cantankerous,\" he told ABC News\u00a0ahead of his milestone birthday. \"It's not really that way. I don't know any other 100-year-olds, but I can speak for myself.\"",
      "He has long credited his wife, 54-year-old makeup artist and producer Arlene Silver, with keeping him young.",
      "\"As I've said, if I had known I was gonna live this long, I would've taken better care of myself!\" Van Dyke told CBS Sunday Morning. \"Yeah, 'cause I went through that whole period of alcoholism. But my wife, God bless her, makes sure that I go to the gym three days a week and do a full workout.\"",
      "Van Dyke was born in West Plains, Missouri, in 1925, and grew up \"the class clown\" in Danville, Illinois, while admiring and imitating the silent film comedians.",
      "Five years ago, while celebrating getting a Kennedy Center Honor, Van Dyke told CBS Mornings that he was looking forward to hitting the 100-year-old mark.",
      "\"George Burns made it, and I'm gonna do it too,\" he said.",
      "And now, he told ABC News that he feels lucky about turning 100. But what's hard about being 100?",
      "\"I miss movement,\" he told the outlet. \"I've got one game leg from I don't know what.\"",

      "Prosecutors said Netflix had initially paid Rinsch about $44 million for an unfinished sci-fi show called \"White Horse,\" and then sent over another $11 million after he said he needed additional funding to wrap up the production.",
      "But instead of putting the money toward the show, Rinsch steered the cash to a personal account where he made a series of failed investments, losing around half of the $11 million in a couple months, according to prosecutors. He then put the remaining funds into the cryptocurrency market, netting some profit, though Rinsch then deposited the money into his own bank account.",
      "Then came the lavish purchases, prosecutors said, with Rinsch buying five Rolls-Royces and one Ferrari, along with $652,000 on watches and clothes. He also bought two mattresses for about $638,000 and spent another $295,000 on luxury bedding and linens. In addition, he used some of the money to pay off about $1.8 million in credit card bills, prosecutors said.",
      "Rinsch never finished the show. His sentencing date is set for April.",
      "Netflix declined to comment.",
      "U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, in a statement, said Rinsch \"took $11 million meant for a TV show and gambled it on speculative stock options and crypto transactions.\"",

    "summary": "Sophie Kinsella, whose real name was Madeleine Wickham, was diagnosed with aggressive brain cancer in 2022.",
    "story": [
      "Sophie Kinsella, the author of \"Confessions of a Shopaholic\" and a series of millions-selling sequels, has died, her family said on social media.",
      "Kinsella, whose real name was Madeleine Wickham, had been diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, in late 2022. She announced the diagnosis in April 2024. She said at the time that she delayed the announcement to let her children adjust to their new normal. Kinsella also said that she underwent surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy to treat the disease.",
      "\"We are heartbroken to announce the passing this morning of our beloved Sophie (aka Maddy, aka Mummy). She died peacefully, with her final days filled with her true loves: family and music and warmth and Christmas and joy,\" Kinsella's family wrote on Instagram. \"We can't imagine what life will be like without her radiance and love of life.\"",
      "Kinsella published 10 \"Shopaholic\" novels, beginning with \"Confessions of a Shopaholic\" in 2000. The first two \"Shopaholic\" books were adapted into the 2009 film \"Confessions of a Shopaholic,\" starring Isla Fisher.",
      "Her 2024 novella \"What Does It Feel Like?\" was a semi-fictional account of her cancer diagnosis, according to CBS News partner BBC News. In an introduction to the book, Kinsella said she had \"always processed my life through writing.\"",
      "\"Hiding behind my fictional characters, I have always turned my own life into a narrative. It is my version of therapy, maybe,\" Kinsella wrote, according to the BBC.",
      "Kinsella also published books, including her debut novel, under her real name. In total, she wrote 28 books including 10 \"Shopaholic\" novels, one young adult novel and four children's books, according to the BBC. Her books have sold more than 45 million copies worldwide and have been translated into dozens of languages.",
      "\"Despite her illness, which she bore with unimaginable courage, Sophie counted herself truly blessed - to have such wonderful family and friends, and to have had the extraordinary success of her writing career,\" her family said on social media. \"She took nothing for granted and was forever grateful for the love she received.\"",
      "Kinsella is survived by her husband Henry Wickham, who she married in 1991, and their five children.",
      "In 2014, Kinsella told \"CBS Mornings\" how reader responses fueled her writing.",
      "\"You're sitting alone in your room and you're tapping away and you hope people enjoy your book and then off it goes,\" she said. \"But then you get somebody who says, 'Well, you know what? I've read your book in the middle of the night when I was recovering from operation and it got me through.' I mean how can you do anything better in life than that?\"",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Dec 2025 19:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Paramount Skydance's $30 per share offer comes just days after Netflix agreed to buy parts of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at nearly $83 billion.",
    "story": [
      "Paramount Skydance on Monday made a $108.4 billion hostile takeover offer for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, with its all-cash bid coming just three days after Netflix agreed to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery \"shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company,\" Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison said in a statement.",
      "\"Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion,\" he said.",
      "Paramount Skydance is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "The new offer steps up the battle over the future of Warner Bros. Discovery, which on Friday agreed to a deal with Netflix under which the streaming giant would acquire Warner's streaming and movie assets. Warner Bros.' storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series.",
      "Paramount Skydance said its offer is a better deal for Warner shareholders because it includes the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its cable television channels such as CNN, TBS, TNT and The Food Network. The transaction would also have an easier path through the regulatory process than Netflix's offer, according to Paramount.",
      "\"Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Paramount Skydance's offer includes the cost of absorbing Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, which as of September 30 was more than $33 billion, a regulatory filing shows. The all-cash $30 per share offer amounts to nearly $78 billion. Excluding Warner Bros. Discovery's debt, Netflix's bid for the company comes to roughly $72 billion.",
      "The offer is backed by the Ellison family \u2014 Paramount CEO David Ellison's father is Larry Ellison, who leads software maker Oracle Corp. and is the second-richest person with a net worth of $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index \u2014 as well as investment firm RedBird Capital.",
      "Paramount Skydance's bid also includes several outside financing partners, according to a Paramount Skydance regulatory filing. They include Affinity Partners, the private equity firm run by Jared Kushner, a son-in-law of President Trump, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.",
      "The outside investment firms have agreed to give up any governance rights, including seats on the board of directors of a combined firm, according to the regulatory filing.",
      "Potential antitrust \u2014 and political \u2014 hurdles",
      "Some Wall Street analysts have said the Netflix-Warner Bros. combination could raise concerns among U.S. antitrust enforcers because of the streaming service's size and the potential to reduce competition in the media space.",
      "\"Because Netflix is positioned as the largest streaming platform, the company's acquisition of HBO Max services and customers raises red flags,\" said Jeffrey May, managing editor for the Insights & Enrichment team within Wolters Kluwer Legal and Regulatory U.S., in an email.",
      "May added, \"Netflix and HBO Max compete for subscribers. Their combination could be seen as a threat to competition and innovation.\"",
      "President Trump also signaled the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal could face hurdles, saying on Sunday that the combined company's size \"could be a problem.\" Mr. Trump also said he would be involved in any decision about whether the federal government should approve the deal.",
      "Usha Haley, a Wichita State University professor who specializes in international business strategy, told the Associated Press that Paramount's ties to Mr. Trump are notable. Larry Ellison is an avowed supporter of Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump \"said he's going to be involved in the decision \u2014 we should take him at face value,\" Haley said. \"For him, it's just greater control over the media.\"",
      "Netflix declined to comment, while Warner Bros. Discovery didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In a presentation at the UBS Global Media and Communications conference on Monday, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said they were confident their deal with Warner Bros. would close. Sarandos also said Netflix is committed to creating U.S. jobs.",
      "Blair Levin, a media and telecommunications industry analyst with investment adviser New Street Research, said Mr. Trump's involvement in the battle for Warner Bros. could backfire for Paramount Skydance.",
      "\"If Trump weighs in publicly against the deal, [Netflix] could argue that he did so for political or personal reasons rather than antitrust reasons and seek evidence, including discovery and depositions, leading to all kinds of delays and other potential collateral damage to the government case,\" he said in a note to investors.",
      "Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery jumped $1.65, or 6.3%, to $27.72 in early trading on Monday, while Paramount Skydance shares rose 78 cents, or 5.8%, to $14.14. Netflix's stock slumped 4.9% to $95.64.",
      "Paramount Skydance's tender offer is set to expire on Jan. 8, 2026, unless it is extended.",
      "Impact on streaming",
      "Netflix, which has more than 300 million subscribers, is the world's largest streaming service, according to David R. King, a professor of management at Florida State University.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming platforms, which include HBO Max and Discovery+, rank as the fourth-largest with 128 million subscribers, followed by Paramount+ at No. 5, with 78 million customers, he added. Amazon Prime Video and Disney/Hulu rank as No. 2 and 3, respectively.",
      "The prospect of more media industry consolidation has prompted critics such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, to speak out against the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal. In a statement on Friday, Warren said the combination would \"create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market.\"",
      "Netflix is likely to argue that other video platforms, such as YouTube should be included in calculating streaming services' market share,\u00a0according to The Guardian.",
      "The bidding war follows Warner Bros. Discovery's announcement in June that it planned to split into two businesses, separating its cable networks from its streaming and studios business.",
      "But in October, the media conglomerate said it had attracted interest\u00a0from companies about buying all or parts of it outright, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that media and entertainment businesses, including Netflix, Paramount Skydance and Comcast, were pursuing a deal.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders \"will have to choose between [Paramount Skydance's] straight $30-a-share cash offer and Netflix's slightly lower, more complex bid with a linear networks spin-off, both carrying serious antitrust questions,\" David O'Hara, managing director at market research firm MKI Global Partners, said in an email.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "The playful, graceful and surprising designs of architect Frank Gehry (Feb. 28, 1929-Dec. 5, 2025) changed the skylines of cities around the world, from Los Angeles, New York and Seattle to Barcelona, Paris, Berlin and Panama City. But he was never completely happy with his work. Asked by \"Sunday Morning\" in 2022 what he saw when he looked at his 2003 Walt Disney Concert Hall \u2014 a Los Angeles landmark whose massive curves fit together like puzzle pieces \u2014 Gehry replied, \"Well, I see what I would do different!\" What sounded like second guessing, Gehry called \"creative insecurity.\"",
      "Born Frank Goldberg in Toronto, Canada, he worked at his grandfather's hardware store, \"playing with the nails and the screws,\" he said. His father brought the family to Los Angeles in 1947, when Frank was 17. \"It just looked like a new world somehow; I was quite moved by it,\" he said.",
      "He fell in love with architecture, and, at the behest of his first wife, who was fearful of antisemitism, changed his last name to Gehry. He began incorporating industrial materials into his designs, but his ideas really took flight once he adapted software created for the aerospace industry. His buildings' flowing curves could now mimic movement.",
      "\"The movement is feeling,\" he said. \"And how do you get a big monster building to have any feeling? And the movement makes that happen. And I think that finding a way to build it was the issue.\" One humorous example: a tower in Prague, inspired by human forms gracefully entangled. The building was nicknamed \"Fred and Ginger.\"",
      "His Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, opened in 1997, was immediately hailed as a masterpiece. Gehry's aerospace software allowed for the precise calculations necessary to shape titanium into a curving exterior. \"When you go there, you see the light play with the building, especially on gray days when you really want some light, you want a feeling of warmth,\" Gehry said. \"All of a sudden, this metal glows beautifully.\"",
      "Among his other recognizable projects: The Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris; the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany; the Peter B. Lewis Building in Cleveland; the Lou Ruvo Center in Las Vegas; the Gehry Tower in Hanover, Germany; the LUMA Arles Tower in Arles, France; the Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis; and the Stata Center in Cambridge, Mass.",
      "Gehry's challenge to architects: \"Think of people and how they're going be inspired by your work, and give them something to think about. That's what a painting does. That's what a sculpture does. And architecture is an art. So, why not?\""

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Sunday hosted the Kennedy Center Honors after presenting the\u00a02025 Kennedy Center honorees\u00a0with their medals during a ceremony in the Oval Office on Saturday, hailing the slate of artists as \"legendary in so many ways.\"",
      "\"Billions and billions of people have watched them over the years,\" Mr. Trump, the first president to command the stage instead of sitting in an Opera House box, said to open the show.",
      "This year's recipients were actor Sylvester Stallone, singers Gloria Gaynor and George Strait, the rock band Kiss and actor-singer Michael Crawford.",
      "Mr. Trump said they were \"among the greatest artists and actors, performers, musicians, singers, songwriters ever to walk the face of the Earth.\"",
      "On Saturday, he called the honorees, whom he was deeply involved in choosing, as \"perhaps the most accomplished and renowned class\" ever assembled.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday they are a group of \"incredible people\" who represent the \"very best in American arts and culture\" and that, \"I know most of them and I've been a fan of all of them.\"",
      "Asked when he arrived how he had found time to prepare, Mr. Trump said he \"didn't really prepare very much.\"",
      "\"If you look at the great hosts, Johnny Carson, Bob Hope, those are the greats,\" Mr. Trump said, while disparaging previous host Jimmy Kimmel, whom the president has criticized on multiple occasions, going so far as to urge ABC to remove him as host of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"But no, I think you, you want to be just loose and not a lot to prepare for. You know what you have to be? You have to be yourself,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "\"I have a good memory, so I can remember things, which is very fortunate,\" the president said. \"But just, I wanted to just be myself. You have to be yourself. Johnny Carson, he was himself.\"",
      "Mr. Trump assumed a role that has been held in the past by journalist Walter Cronkite and comedian Stephen Colbert, among others. Before Mr. Trump, presidents watched the show alongside the honorees.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, one of several Cabinet secretaries attending the ceremony, said he's looking forward to Mr. Trump's hosting job.",
      "\"Oh, this president, he is so relaxed in front of these cameras, as you know, and so funny, I can't wait for tonight,\" Lutnick said as he arrived with his wife, who is on the Kennedy Center board.",
      "Mr. Trump said in August that he had agreed to host the show. He said Saturday at a State Department dinner for the honorees that he was doing so \"at the request of a certain television network.\" He predicted that the broadcast would have its best ratings ever.",
      "The Kennedy Center Honors broadcast is\u00a0scheduled to air Dec. 23\u00a0at 8 p.m. ET/CT on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+,",
      "Since 1978, the honors have recognized stars for their influence on American culture and the arts. Members of this year's class are pop-culture standouts, including Stallone for his \"Rocky\" and \"Rambo\" movies, Gaynor for her feminist anthem \"I Will Survive\" and Kiss for its flashy, cartoonish makeup and onstage displays of smoke and pyrotechnics. Country music superstar George Strait and Tony Award-winning actor Michael Crawford are also being honored.",
      "Mr. Trump said persistence is a trait all the artists share.",
      "\"Some of them have had legendary setbacks, setbacks that you have to read in the papers because of their level of fame,\" he said from the stage. \"But in the words of Rocky Balboa, they showed us that you keep moving forward, just keep moving forward.\"",
      "He said many of the politicians, celebrities and others in the audience shared the trait, too.",
      "\"I know so many of you are persistent,\" Trump said in his opening. \"Many of you are miserable, horrible people. You are persistent. You never give up. Sometimes I wish you'd give up, but you don't.\"",
      "The ceremony was expected to be emotional for the members of Kiss. The band's original lead guitarist, Ace Frehley, died in October after he was injured during a fall. The band's co-founder Gene Simmons, speaking on the red carpet when he and the other honorees arrived for the ceremony, said the president had assured him there would be an empty chair among the members of Kiss in memory of Frehley.",
      "Stallone said being honored at the ceremony was like being in the \"eye of a hurricane.\"",
      "\"This is an amazing event,\" he said. \"But you're caught up in the middle of it. It's hard to take it in until the next day. ... but I'm incredibly humbled by it.\"",
      "Crawford also said it was \"humbling, especially at the end of a career.\"",
      "Gaynor said it \"feels like a dream\" to be honored. \"To be recognized in this way is the pinnacle,\" she said on the red carpet.",
      "Mike Farris, an award-winning gospel singer who is performing for Gaynor, said she is a dear friend. \"She truly did survive,\" Farris said. \"What an iconic song.\"",
      "Actor Neil McDonough said he's presenting the award to Stallone, which he said was long over due for Stallone's writing and acting. \"But that isn't even the best part,\" McDonough said. \"The best part is that Sly is one of he greatest guys I've ever met.\"",
      "Previous honorees have come from a broad range of art forms, whether dance (Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham), theater (Stephen Sondheim, Andrew Lloyd Webber), movies (Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks) or music (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell).",
      "Mr. Trump upended decades of bipartisan support for the center by ousting its leadership and stacking the board of trustees with Republican supporters, who then elected him chair. He has criticized the center's programming and the building's appearance \u2014 and has said, perhaps jokingly, that he would rename it as the \"Trump Kennedy Center.\" He secured more than $250 million from Congress for renovations of the building.",
      "Presidents of each political party have at times found themselves face-to-face with artists of opposing political views. Republican Ronald Reagan was there for honoree Arthur Miller, a playwright who championed liberal causes. Democrat Bill Clinton, who had signed an assault weapons ban into law, marked the honors for Charlton Heston, an actor and gun rights advocate.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, multiple honorees were openly critical of the president. In 2017, Mr. Trump's first year in office, honors recipient and film producer Norman Lear threatened to boycott his own ceremony if Mr. Trump attended. Mr. Trump stayed away during that entire term.",
      "Mr. Trump has said he was deeply involved in choosing the 2025 honorees and turned down some recommendations because they were \"too woke.\" While Stallone is one of Mr. Trump's Hollywood \"special ambassadors\" and has likened Mr. Trump to George Washington, the political views of Sunday's other guests are less clear.",
      "Strait and Gaynor have said little about their politics, although Federal Election Commission records show that Gaynor has given money to Republican organizations in recent years.",
      "Simmons spoke favorably of Mr. Trump when Mr. Trump ran for president in 2016. But in 2022, Simmons told Spin magazine that Mr. Trump was \"out for himself\" and criticized the president for encouraging conspiracy theories and public expressions of racism.",
      "Fellow Kiss member Paul Stanley denounced Mr. Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat to Democrat Joe Biden, and said Mr. Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, were \"terrorists.\" But after Mr. Trump won in 2024, Stanley urged unity.",
      "\"If your candidate lost, it's time to learn from it, accept it and try to understand why,\" Stanley wrote on X. \"If your candidate won, it's time to understand that those who don't share your views also believe they are right and love this country as much as you do.\"",

      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",
      "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" Jump, 59, told CBS News. Her boss has offered to chip in, but she said the higher premium would still be a major strain on her budget.",
      "\"I'm just going to have to cut back on whatever else I can,\" she added. \"It's just insane. What's going to happen in the next couple of years? Is it going to continue to go up?\"",

That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",
      "\"That's a huge financial burden for most families,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News. \"There's not a lot of people who can afford that.\"",
      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",

      "In a Supreme Court filing relating to Lopez's ongoing appeal to the high court filed Tuesday, the Solicitor General's Office wrote that dismissal of the case is warranted for the same reason, and that the court should hear Lopez's appeal, reverse an appeals court decision that reinstated the conviction, and return the case to a New York federal judge who could dismiss the case.",
      "Lopez was convicted in 2023 by a jury in Brooklyn on charges of money laundering and wire fraud conspiracies. Full Play was convicted of two additional counts of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering relating to the World Cup and Copa America.",

    "story": [
      "A law professor who flew on a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines last year is suing the airplane manufacturer, alleging he suffered serious health issues after being exposed to toxic fumes that seeped into the plane's cabin.",
      "The plaintiff, Philadelphia resident Jonathan Harris, alleges in the suit that the aircraft cabin air became contaminated during an August 2024 flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles, leading to his breathing in a mix of dangerous chemicals.",
      "Fumes or smoke entering aircraft cabins is a known problem in aviation. That can occur when the fresh air from a plane's engines is filtered through the air conditioner employed to supply air to passengers. A faulty engine seal can cause oil and other potentially toxic particles to be released in the cabin.",
      "Such events take place more than three times a day, according to a recent CBS News review of Federal Aviation Administration incident reports.",
      "Boeing's 787 aircraft is the only commercial jetliner that does not draw air through the aircraft's engine. All other commercial jets have an air supply system that can expose cabins to contamination with heated jet engine oil, hydraulic fluid and jet fuel, according to Harris's suit.",
      "When Harris's Delta landed in California, passengers sat on the runway for about 45 minutes before disembarking, according to the lawsuit. During this time, the cabin was filled with fumes that Harris described as smelling like \"dirty socks.\"",
      "\"As a result of being exposed to this contaminated air event, plaintiff became nauseous and vomited into a plastic bag while still seated on the subject aircraft,\" the suit alleges. \"Another passenger also vomited into a bag provided by a flight attendant. At one point, plaintiff remembers the captain making an announcement over the intercom apologizing for the smell.\"",
      "Harris has since developed symptoms as a result of inhaling the contaminated cabin air, his lawsuit alleges. That lead to a range of health problems, including dizziness, confusion, nausea, muscle pain, vertigo, memory loss and other conditions, according to the complaint. Harris also alleges he suffered mental anguish, depression and anxiety, along with lost wages.",
      "Harris, an associate law professor at Temple University, is suing Arlington, Virginia-based Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, for $40 million, plus attorneys' fees. The suit was filed in Arlington County, Virginia, circuit court.",
      "Boeing and Delta both declined to comment on the lawsuit.",

    "summary": "A ruling striking down emergency levies could force the federal government to return most of the tariff revenue it has collected this year, according to Penn Wharton.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government could owe businesses as much as $168 billion if the Supreme Court rules that the Trump administration improperly invoked a federal emergency powers law earlier this year in hitting dozens of countries with new tariffs, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Through December 5, the U.S. government has collected $259 billion in tariff revenue, the nonpartisan research initiative found. But a ruling by the high court that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the country-specific tariffs could force the government to offer refunds to importers, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "In a November hearing on the case,\u00a0the Supreme Court seemed divided\u00a0over whether Mr. Trump had the legal authority to impose sweeping levies under IEEPA. Several justices appeared skeptical, noting that IEEPA does not mention the word \"tariff\" and that no president has ever relied on the act to justify broad-based tariffs on other nations.",
      "The Trump administration could likely maintain similar\u00a0tariff rates by drawing on other laws\u00a0if the IEEPA tariffs are struck down, although those statutes have more restrictions, according to legal experts.",
      "For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also authorizes the president to apply country-based tariffs if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another nation is engaging in unfair trade practices.",
      "Despite the prospects of a large government refund for importers, Smetters thinks that striking down the tariffs would ultimately spur U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Tariffs are one of the least efficient ways of raising revenue,\" he told CBS News, adding that tariffs make companies less productive because they have to pay more for imported parts and products.",
      "\"The government would have to come up with that money, so the federal debt would go up a little bit. But if these tariffs really were to go away, it would make U.S. companies more attractive to invest in,\" Smetters added.",
      "The Trump administration says tariffs are a key tool for energizing the U.S. manufacturing sector, boosting job growth, reducing the nation's trade deficit and generating federal revenue.",
      "\"The economic and national security consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court's speedy and proper resolution of this matter,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Too little, too late?",
      "As of November 17, the overall effective tariff rate in the U.S. was 16.8%, the highest since 1935,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Yale Budget Lab. That compares with 2.4% in January before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "As a result, some small businesses say a tariff refund wouldn't offset the damage they say has been caused by sharply higher import duties.",
      "\"The money would go back to suppliers that incurred the tariffs. We are the end customer, and we continue to get the short end of the stick,\" Trinita Rhodes, the owner of Beauty Supply Refresh in Florissant, Missouri, said Wednesday in a media call hosted by Tariffs Cost US, an advocacy group that opposes Mr. Trump's levies.",
      "Rachel Lutz, owner of a women's clothing boutique, The Peacock Room, in Detroit, said a potential tariff refund would come too late.",
      "\"Small businesses don't have more than a 30-day cash reserve,\" he said in the Tariffs Cost US call. \"Reimbursement at this point doesn't make up for the disruption of staff cuts or hiring we could have made. The damage has already been done.\"",
      "Consumers are also feeling the impact of tariffs, research shows. Between February and November, U.S. households paid an average of $1,197.50 in tariffs, totaling nearly $160 billion, according to a\u00a0report this month from Democrats on the U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee.",
      "\"While President Trump promised that he would lower costs, this report shows that his tariffs have done nothing but drive prices even higher for families,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire and ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement Thursday. \"At a time when both parties should be working together to lower costs, the President's tax on American families is simply making things more expensive.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has a number of options at his disposal to implement tariffs, but none are as broad and aggressive as IEEPA.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply country-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",
      "Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930",
      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",
      "These tariffs differ from Section 301 levies in that the tariff rate is capped at 50%. Additionally, no formal investigation is required. The authority has never been used, according to experts.",

    "summary": "President Trump has signed an executive order to block states from regulating artificial intelligence.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at restricting states from crafting their own regulations for artificial intelligence, saying the burgeoning industry is at risk of being stifled by a patchwork of onerous rules while in a battle with Chinese competitors for supremacy.",
      "Members of Congress from both parties, as well as civil liberties and consumer rights groups, have pushed for more regulations on AI, saying there is not enough oversight for the powerful technology.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that \"there's only going to be one winner\" as nations race to dominate artificial intelligence, and China's central government gives its companies a single place to go for government approvals.",
      "\"We have the big investment coming, but if they had to get 50 different approvals from 50 different states, you can forget it because it's impossible to do,\" the president said.",
      "The executive order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to create a new task force to challenge state laws, and directs the Department of Commerce to draw up a list of problematic regulations. It also threatens to restrict funding from a broadband deployment program and other grant programs to states with AI laws.",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist who is leading Mr. Trump's policies on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, said Thursday the Trump administration would only push back on \"the most onerous examples of state regulation\" but would not oppose \"kid safety\" measures.",
      "Four states \u2014 Colorado, California, Utah and Texas \u2014 have passed laws that set some rules for AI across the private sector, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals.",
      "Those laws include limiting the collection of certain personal information and requiring more transparency from companies.",
      "The laws are in response to AI that already pervades everyday life. The technology helps make consequential decisions for Americans, including who gets a job interview, an apartment lease, a home loan and even certain medical care. But research has shown that it can make mistakes in those decisions, including by prioritizing a particular gender or race.",
      "States' more ambitious AI regulation proposals require private companies to provide transparency and assess the possible risks of discrimination from their AI programs.",
      "Beyond those more sweeping rules, many states have regulated parts of AI: barring the use of deepfakes in elections and to create nonconsensual porn, for example, or putting rules in place around the government's own use of AI.",
      "Those who support regulations that would prevent states from restricting AI\u00a0\u2014 including some GOP lawmakers and advocates like Sacks \u2014 argue that forcing tech companies to contend with varied or even contradictory rules would hurt the industry.",
      "\"At best, we'll end up with 50 different AI models for 50 different states \u2013 a regulatory morass worse than Europe,\" Sacks wrote on X\u00a0earlier this week. \"This will stymie innovation, especially by small startups who can't afford the compliance burden. Meanwhile, China will race ahead.\"",
      "But members of both parties have pushed back. Last month, when congressional Republicans weighed adding restrictions on state AI regulations to a defense bill, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis called the idea a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"",
      "\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,\" the governor wrote.",
      "Earlier this week, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts called Mr. Trump's plan to restrict AI regulations via an executive order an \"early Christmas present for his CEO billionaire buddies.\"",

      "President Trump is touting his administration's new \"gold card\" visa as a fast track for foreigners who are willing and able to pay $1 million for the right to immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Applications for the new visa went live on Wednesday afternoon, with the government website for the gold card saying the process can be completed in a matter of weeks after applicants file their paperwork.",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the gold card initiative in February, promoting it as an expedited path for wealthy foreigners to secure legal residency and as a way to generate government revenue. The term riffs on the \"green card,\" which grants permanent residency status to noncitizens so they can live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.",
      "\"All funds go to the United States government \u2014 it could be a tremendous amount of money,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday about the gold card. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card.\"",
      "The program also includes a $2 million gold card for corporations that want to secure visas for workers, as well as a $5 million platinum card that allows foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being required to pay federal income tax on non-U.S. income.",
      "\"It's certainly plausible to me that this could be a meaningful source of revenue,\" John Lettieri, the CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan policy research group, told CBS News.",
      "But, he added, the gold card visa is likely to be a \"niche program,\" given the cost, although it could help attract some highly skilled foreign workers or entrepreneurs to the U.S.",
      "Here's how the gold card program will work.",
      "What is a Trump gold card?",
      "In essence, it's a green card that has been fast-tracked by the Trump administration.",
      "The website to apply for a gold card states that successful applicants will receive either an EB-1 or EB-2 visa, two kinds of employment-based green cards for skilled workers. To apply for an individual gold card, applicants must:",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.",
      "Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "The new program also allows companies to obtain gold cards for employees, one per worker, with each requiring a $2 million donation, according to the website.",
      "Applicants must pay a $15,000 fee that will cover the cost of processing and conducting a background check, along with a 1% annual maintenance fee. Companies may also transfer the gold card between employees for a 5% transfer fee, the program specifies.",
      "A transfer could happen if a gold card holder becomes a U.S. citizen, for example.",
      "One potential difference between the Trump gold card and other types of green cards is that the new visa process could take only weeks, according to the Trump administration.",
      "By comparison, immigrants who apply for a regular green card can expect to wait between eight months and three years for approval, according to immigration services company Boundless. The quickest processing time is for spouses of U.S. citizens, who typically face an eight-month wait, the group said.",
      "How is the Trump gold card different from an EB-5 visa?",
      "The gold card is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which Congress created in 1990 to generate foreign investment. These have been available to people who spend at least $1 million to start a company with at least 10 workers.",
      "Unlike the EB-5 visa, however, a gold card visa doesn't require applicants to create a certain number of jobs or to invest in U.S. businesses.",
      "The EB-5 program has been criticized as cumbersome and as an invitation to commit fraud. In one notable case in recent years, hundreds of EB-5 applicants were defrauded by business executives in Vermont who claimed to be building a biotech facility, but who instead used the money for personal expenses.",
      "The process to obtain an EB-5 visa is also glacially slow, with a processing time of almost six years. That is \"by far the longest processing times in the U.S. immigration system,\" according to an April blog post about the Trump gold cards from EIG.",
      "The gold card is designed to help companies recruit foreign graduates of U.S. universities such as MIT and Harvard, Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "\"I've heard from Tim Cook of Apple, and I've heard from a lot of people, some of the people at this table, that essentially, in the United States, you can't keep the student,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Can gold card holders become citizens?",
      "Gold card recipients \"have a path to citizenship,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference on Wednesday with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Obviously, they have to be perfect people in America, and having passed the vetting, after five years they'll be available to become citizens,\" Lutnick said.",
      "Green card holders can typically apply for citizenship after residing in the U.S. for five years.",
      "Companies that secure a gold card for workers who then become citizens can transfer the card to new employees, Lutnick added.",
      "Can a gold card visa be revoked?",
      "Yes: The application website states: \"The Trump Gold Card is a visa; therefore, national security and significant criminal risks are a basis for revocation.\"",
      "How much money could the visa program raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump didn't provide an estimate this week, but the program could generate billions in annual revenue, said Lettieri of the Economic Innovation Group.",
      "Based on the $1 million cost of a gold card visa, the program could raise $100 billion over a decade if it issues 10,000 gold cards per year, he calculated.",
      "\"Conservatively speaking, tens of billions over a decade is reasonable \u2014 it could be considerably higher,\" Lettieri said.",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which is the U.S. agency that works to promote the safety of consumer products, has lost key leadership and staff over the last year. Among them are two former commissioners who say consumers are paying the price for the cuts at the agency.",
      "For Trista Hamsmith, the safety risks posed by some products are personal. In December 2020, her 18-month-old daughter Reese died after swallowing a button battery she accessed from a remote two months earlier.",
      "The batteries are tiny, coin-sized and deadly when ingested. It burned through Reese's esophagus and after months of surgeries, doctors couldn't save her.",
      "\"I prayed and I prayed, but we didn't get her back. I got to hold her again, but she was gone,\" Hamsmith said, recalling the moment. \"She was a baby and her life was taken too soon.\"",
      "Push for better safety protections",
      "Hamsmith turned her grief into action. She launched a nonprofit and helped pass\u00a0\"Reese's Law\" in 2022, making button batteries harder for kids to access.",
      "But the law didn't cover toys.",
      "Her next push was to get the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, to apply those same standards to toys.",
      "The initiative stalled this past summer, after President Trump removed three democratic commissioners and reduced the five-member commission to just two, including the May ouster of former commissioner Richard Trumka.",
      "Trumka blames current leadership at the agency for the holdup.",
      "\"This rule would have simply made toys, the thing that we intentionally put in our children's hand, as safe as everything else they get their hands on,\" Trumka said. \"It's as common sense as you could possibly get and somehow it's not moving forward.\"",
      "He said it doesn't make sense.",
      "\"We have a solution to that that's just completely fallen aside because industry said we don't want it and the current leadership of the agency capitulated to that,\" he said.",
      "Hamsmith said for parents like her, it's more than a bureaucratic stalemate.",
      "\"On a level like mine, a story like Reese's, why this agency is so important, it's important for child safety. It's important for the safety of the American people,\" she said.",
      "CPSC commissioner and staffing cuts",
      "Trumka alleges that in May, the Trump administration\u00a0illegally removed him and fellow Democratic commissioners\u00a0Alex Hoehn-Saric and Mary Boyle, and cut critical agency staff.",
      "He also claims more than a dozen other proposed safety rules have stalled since then.",
      "\"People will be injured and people will die as a result of inaction from CPSC,\" Trumka said.",
      "The CPSC was created by Congress as an independent agency with five bipartisan commissioners, meant to be free of political pressure.",
      "\"CPSC is a health and safety organization,\" said former CPSC chair Hoehn-Saric. \"You want organizations like that to be focused on the facts and focused on the science because we're trying to keep people from dying. You don't want politics to come into those decisions.\"",
      "The ousted commissioners allege their removal was a violation of the law and are fighting in court to be reinstated.",
      "CPSC maintains stance on firings, safety regulations",
      "In a statement, the CPSC maintains the president's firing of the three commissioners was done lawfully and \"has had no impact on the CPSC's mission to protect American families from unsafe products.\"",
      "But in September, the agency was down to one commissioner after Republican Dougg Dziak resigned.",
      "With a single commissioner, Trumka said protections can't be passed.",
      "\"We have quorum requirements that to pass a rule, you need two commissioners. They have one,\" he said. \"It shows they have no intent to pass new rules to protect the public against problems that are coming up.\"",
      "The CPSC denied they are hindered and said rulemaking and enforcement is ongoing.",
      "When asked about the stalled battery rule, the CPSC said it \"...measures success based on how many unsafe products it keeps out of the hands of American consumers, not the number of regulations it enacts.\"",
      "The Toy Association, a trade association for the toy industry, told CBS News that while it is not resistant to stricter rules around button batteries, current science, it argues, hasn't shown flaws in the current standards or that new proposals would make it any safer.",

    "summary": "President Trump says he's winning the war against inflation. But a look at prices around the U.S. shows why many Americans still feel financially squeezed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump delivered a message Tuesday evening aimed at the millions of Americans struggling to afford daily necessities, saying his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and that \"prices are coming down tremendously.\" Economic data tells a different story.",
      "Prices have edged higher for much of Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, with inflation in September rising at an annual rate of 3% (the most recent available inflation data because of the recent U.S. government shutdown).",
      "Inflation dipped to a low this year of 2.3% in April, but it has steadily ticked up since then and now stands at the same rate as in January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated, federal data shows. Economists attribute the rise partly to the Trump administration's new tariffs on imports, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pointing to those levies as a key factor behind the recent uptick.",
      "Inflation now \"is higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up, reflecting the impact of tariffs,\" Powell said at a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the central bank's latest interest rate cut.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think prices are likely to continue creeping up for a while. Mark Vickery, senior market analyst at Zacks Investment Research, estimates that the Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of around 3.3% in November.",
      "To be sure, many economists, as well as the Fed, expect any additional pickup in inflation to be short-lived before easing in 2026. Powell on Wednesday said the tariff effect will likely create a one-time rise in prices that should fade over the coming year. The Fed expects inflation to recede to 2.4% next year, down from about 2.9% in 2025.",
      "From a longer-term perspective, inflation has indeed fallen sharply since hitting a 40-year high of about 9% in June 2022 in the aftermath of the pandemic. For shoppers, however, a lower inflation rate doesn't mean prices are declining \u2014 only that they're rising at a slower pace.",
      "Consumers tend not to view pocketbook issues through the lens of official inflation measures, a somewhat abstract metric that tracks price fluctuations over time, experts have long noted. Instead, many shoppers focus on their actual dollars-and-cents spending, including whether their out-of-pocket expenses are higher than they were in the past, according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "By that yardstick, Americans are spending more on everyday basics than they were a year ago, and far more than they did just before the pandemic, CPI data shows.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks, made Tuesday in Mount Pocono, Pa., came as his administration touts the president's economic policies ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"I have no higher priority than making America affordable,\" Mr. Trump said in the speech.",
      "Prior to the speech, Mr. Trump had decried affordability as a \"hoax\" perpetuated by Democrats, although some Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have differed with him on the issue. Greene told CBS News that she doesn't believe affordability is a hoax, adding, \"Everyone's bills have either stayed the same or gone up.\"",
      "\"You can't gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable,\" Greene said.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai expressed confidence that Mr. Trump's agenda will cool inflation and boost worker wages.",
      "\"President Trump inherited the worst inflation crisis in a generation from Joe Biden's incompetence, and his Administration has rapidly cooled inflation to a 2.5% annualized rate,\" Desai said in a statement to CBS News. \"As the administration's supply-side policies of tax cuts, deregulation and energy abundance continue taking effect, Americans can count on inflation continuing to fall and real wages continuing to rise.\"",
      "Food",
      "Americans paid 2.7% more for food bought at the grocery store in September than they did a year earlier, according to the most recent CPI figures. That may not seem like much, but their grocery bills have climbed roughly 49% since 2020.",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "Some food costs are also rising much faster than the rate of inflation, with beef steaks surging almost 17% from a year ago, according to the CPI data. Earlier this month, the Trump administration sought to lower some grocery prices by exempting foods like beef, coffee and bananas from new country-specific tariffs.",
      "Shoppers on Tuesday told CBS News' Nancy Cordes that they are making tradeoffs and scrimping to afford groceries.",
      "\"The cost of beef is astronomical. I will mainly get what's on sale,\" Anne Marie Hadley, a retired special education teacher who was shopping Tuesday at Schiel's Family Market, a family-owned grocery store in Scranton, Pa., told Cordes.",
      "Housing",
      "While mortgage rates have dropped this year, housing remains out of reach for most would-be buyers. More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a report this week.",
      "A homebuyer today needs to earn $131,400 a year to afford a typical home in the U.S. \u2014 almost double the roughly $65,000 needed five years ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",
      "Gas",
      "One area where consumers are getting a break is at the pump, with gasoline prices down from a year earlier. Gas declined 0.5% in September from a year earlier, CPI data shows. And earlier this month, gas dropped below $3 a gallon on average, marking the lowest price since May 2021.",
      "\"It was just reported that four states had $1.99 a gallon,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. \"We are right now involved in more energy, and have more energy in the works by far than we've ever had before.\"",
      "The decline is due to strong refinery output and lower crude oil prices, as well as to softer seasonal fuel demand, GasBuddy has said.",
      "Yet while fuel prices have dropped, other energy costs have increased. Residential electricity prices around the U.S. rose more than 10% over the first eight months of 2025, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an educational and policy organization. By comparison, power costs rose roughly 6% over the trailing 12 months.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 U.S. households was seriously behind on their utility bills, according to a report from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. Over the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the groups found.",

    "story": [
      "Waymo is recalling 3,067 vehicles because of a software issue that led to\u00a0multiple incidents\u00a0in which the autonomous cars drove around stopped school buses.",
      "The recall affects certain 5th-generation automated driving systems, according to a Nov. 8 notice posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The software may cause vehicles to pass a stopped school bus even when its red lights are flashing or its stop arm is extended, increasing the risk of a crash with a pedestrian, the agency said.",
      "Waymo didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "All 50 states have laws requiring vehicles to stop for a school bus with flashing red lights and a deployed stop-arm signal,\u00a0according\u00a0to the NHTSA.",
      "Waymo told CBS News last week that it was planning to issue a recall. At the time, a spokesperson said the company had identified the software issue that contributed to the school bus incidents and that it had repaired affected vehicles by Nov. 17.",
      "The recall follows multiple reports that the company's self-driving cars drove around school buses stopped on the road in Austin, Texas.",
      "As of Dec. 5, the Austin Independent School District said it was aware of 20 incidents this school year in which a Waymo vehicle illegally passed a school bus. JJ Maldonado, a communications specialist for the school district, told CBS News last week that a 20th citation was issued after Waymo said it had fixed the software issue.",
      "NHTSA launched a probe into Waymo in October after a similar school bus\u00a0incident in Atlanta. The public school district there said it was aware of six cases as of Dec. 5 in which Waymo cars illegally passed stopped school buses.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-reserve-fomc-meeting-today-rate-cut-decision-jerome-powell/",
    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:59:17 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve is grappling with economic issues including higher inflation and a slowing labor market.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing the federal funds rate to its lowest level in more than three years.",
      "The reduction lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to between 3.5% and 3.75%, down from its prior range of 3.75% to 4%. The Fed's decision marks the third consecutive rate cut since September, lowering the federal funds rate by a total of 0.75 percentage points this year.",
      "Despite the lack of key government economic data because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown, the Fed has been closely monitoring the slowdown in monthly job growth as well as rising inflation. Figures from ADP, which tracks private payrolls, showed that employers shed 32,000 jobs in November, a signal of continuing headwinds in the labor market.",
      "Fed hints at one rate cut in 2026",
      "But in announcing the decision, the Federal Reserve signaled that it may want to see more economic evidence to support additional rate cuts in 2026. In quarterly economic projections issued along with their latest statement, Fed officials signaled they expect to lower rates just once next year.",
      "\"In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks,\" the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, said in its statement.",
      "Speaking about the decision in a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank is \"well positioned to wait to see how the economy evolves\" before deciding on another cut.",
      "\"We're going to get a great deal of data between now and the January meeting \u2014 the data we get will factor into our thinking,\" Powell said, referring to the delayed November inflation and job reports that will be issued later this month. \"We're well-positioned to wait and see.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve also issued new U.S. inflation, economic growth and unemployment projections for 2026, forecasting that inflation will cool slightly next year while unemployment will remain unchanged from its current level of 4.4%.",
      "Fed officials forecast that Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, will cool to 2.4% next year, down from its median estimate of 2.9% in 2025. The nation's gross domestic product could pick up to 2.3% in 2026, an acceleration from the Fed's September forecast of 1.8%.",
      "Ryan Sweet, chief global economist at Oxford Economics, said the latest Fed guidance sets it up for what he described in a note to investors as an \"extended pause\" in cutting rates.",
      "\"The Fed isn't going to be able to help the labor market because of what ails it,\" he added. \"Rate cuts are unlikely to significantly boost the hiring rate, which is being depressed by overhiring, solid productivity growth, policy uncertainty, a rise in people with multiple jobs and less immigration. Monetary policy can't solve many of these issues.\"",
      "The move lowers the federal funds rate to its lowest level since early November 2022, when policymakers lifted the range to 3.75% to 4%. At that time, the central bank was boosting rates \u2014 its most potent tool for curbing inflation \u2014 as inflation surged during the pandemic.",
      "By cutting rates, the Fed is acting to spur hiring by making credit cheaper, allowing businesses to expand and hire at a lower cost. Consumers, meanwhile, tend to spend more when financing is less expensive, giving the broader economy an extra lift.",
      "FOMC dissents",
      "Not all members of the FOMC, the Fed's rate-setting panel, agreed with the move to cut by a quarter point. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell was joined by eight other committee members in voting in favor of the reduction, three members dissented, the Fed said. That represents the most dissents in six years and is a sign of divisions on a committee that traditionally works by consensus.",
      "FOMC members Austan Goolsbee and Jeffrey Schmid voted to maintain the previous range, while Stephen Miran voted in favor of a 0.5 percentage-point cut.",
      "At the same time, the Fed is moving toward a leadership shift next year, with Powell set to end his term as chair in May 2026 and President Trump preparing to nominate his replacement.",
      "\"[T]he outlook from the Powell-led FOMC bears less than usual on future Fed policy decisions given the imminent change in leadership,\" Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, said in an email.",
      "Asked what his goals are during the last months of his term as chair, Powell said he's focused on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"I want to turn over this job to whoever replaces me with the economy in really good shape,\" he said. \"All my efforts are to get to that place.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 15:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here are the top 20 largest Powerball and Mega Millions jackpots in history, and the odds of winning them.",
    "story": [
      "Lottery jackpots have exploded in size over the last decade.",
      "When Powerball launched in 1992, the first jackpot was $5.9 million, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association. Now, the largest Powerball jackpot on record was the $2.04 billion prize won on Nov. 7, 2022.",
      "Mega Millions followed a similar path. Its first jackpot winner in 2002 took home $28 million. Its record prize \u2014 a $1.602 billion jackpot won on Aug. 8, 2023 \u2014 ranks as the fourth-largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history.",
      "Twelve out of the 20 largest jackpots have occurred since 2023.",
      "Here are the biggest U.S. jackpot wins:",
      "Only five states don't sell lottery tickets: Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada and Utah.",
      "While the prizes are huge, the odds of winning still remain extremely low. Over the last three decades, both games have been redesigned multiple times. Changes have pushed jackpots higher while also adding more ways for players to win smaller prizes.",
      "Powerball players choose five numbers from 1 to 69 and one Powerball number from 1 to 26. In 2015, Powerball increased its number of white balls from 59 to 69 and its number of red balls decreased from 35 to 26.",
      "Before the change, the odds of winning the jackpot were 1 in 175.2 million and the overall odds of winning any prize were 1 in 31.85. After the redesign, the jackpot odds became steeper, 1 in 292.2 million, while the overall odds of winning a prize improved to 1 in 24.9, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.",
      "Mega Millions requires players to pick five different numbers from one to 70 and one Mega Ball number from one to 24. A ticket wins the jackpot by matching all six numbers in a drawing.",
      "In 2025, Mega Millions changed its games to a larger starting jackpot ($50 million vs. $20 million), which \"improved odds to win the jackpot and improved overall odds,\" according to Dan Miller, a spokesperson for Mega Millions.",
      "\"Everyone who wins is winning more because of the embedded multiplier in the new game that takes all non-jackpot prizes and multiplies them by 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X or 10X,\" Miller said in an email. Through Friday, Dec. 5, he said, \"there have been 70 drawings in the new game. In that time, players have won $531 million in non-jackpot prizes. In the old game, those same prizes would have been valued at $119.8 million. That's a 343% increase in player winnings.\"",
      "For example, under the old rules, matching just the Mega Ball was a break-even outcome: a $2 ticket earned a $2 prize. Under the new game, that same match now comes with a built-in multiplier. The minimum prize is $5, which is then multiplied \u2014 meaning a player can now win $10, $15, $20, $25 or even $50 instead of just $2.",
      "The odds to win the jackpot improved from 1 in 302.6 million to\u00a01 in 290.5 million. This is because of Mega Millions removing the one gold Mega Ball from the game, Miller said.",
      "The new game has 24 Mega Balls instead of 25, which improves the odds of picking the right combinations of numbers to win the jackpot. The overall odds to win any prize went from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23.",
      "There's more money in play as well: Powerball increased the price of a ticket from $1 to $2 in 2012. Mega Millions increased its ticket prices from $1 to $2 in 2017 and from $2 to $5 in April of this year.",

    "summary": "Current SAVE borrowers will have \"limited time\" to enroll in a new loan repayment plan and begin repaying their loans, the Education Department said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reached an agreement that could end President Biden's signature student loan repayment plan, a move that may force millions of borrowers back into repayment.",
      "The Education Department on Tuesday announced a proposed settlement with the state of Missouri that it said would terminate the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, an income-driven repayment plan that tabulates loan repayments based on a borrower's income and family size.",
      "As part of the deal, which is pending court approval, the agency said it will not enroll any new borrowers in the SAVE plan and will deny all pending applications. All current SAVE borrowers will have a \"limited time\" to enroll in a new plan and begin repayments, according to the department's notice.",
      "Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz told CNBC that borrowers may need to leave SAVE forbearance early next year. That's a quicker timeline than what was laid out in The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July.",
      "That law gave borrowers enrolled in SAVE and other soon-to-be-phased-out repayment programs until July 1, 2028, to move to a new plan.",
      "Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in Tuesday's announcement that the Biden Administration's policies unfairly shifted student loan debt onto American taxpayers. The Education Department said the SAVE program would have cost taxpayers more than $342 billion over ten years.",
      "The Education Department declined to comment, pointing CBS News to a Dec. 9\u00a0Wall Street Journal op-ed written by Kent and Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway,",
      "\"The Trump administration isn't blind to the mounting student debt burden or the skyrocketing costs of a college degree,\" they wrote. \"But we refuse to force hardworking Americans to bear the burden of loans that aren't theirs.\"",
      "The Biden administration\u00a0announced\u00a0the SAVE program in 2023, calling it the \"most affordable student loan repayment plan ever.\" The plan allowed 4.6 million of the program's more than 7 million enrollees to lower their monthly bills to $0 per month,\u00a0according\u00a0to Protect Borrowers, an advocacy group.",
      "Tuesday's announcement is the latest development in a months-long legal battle over the program's fate, which has left millions of SAVE borrowers in limbo.",
      "The SAVE plan received pushback from attorneys general from several Republican-led states, including Missouri, which sued in 2024, arguing the plan overstepped the Biden administration's authority. In February 2025, a circuit court ruled the SAVE plan was unlawful, according to the Education Department.",
      "As the legal battle played out, SAVE borrowers were put in forbearance in July 2024, meaning that their loans were temporarily placed on hold and interest stopped accruing.",
      "In July 2025, the Education Department said it would restart charging interest on the loans beginning Aug. 1, a move advocacy group Protect Borrowers said could cost enrollees $300 per month due to new interest charges.",
      "Tuesday's agreement will \"strip borrowers of the most affordable repayment plan,\" Protect Borrowers deputy executive director and managing counsel Persis Yu said in a statement.",
      "The Education Department is advising SAVE borrowers to use the Federal Student Aid Loan Simulator tool to explore other repayment plans.",
      "As Kent and Hanaway\u00a0note\u00a0in their Wall Street Journal opinion piece, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act creates a single new income-driven repayment plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan, which has a repayment window of up to 30 years. The plan will be available for new borrowers beginning on July 1, 2026, along with a separate standard repayment plan, according to the Education Department.",

Glassdoor said use of the word in its online community jumped 41% in 2025, compared with the previous year.",

    "story": [
      "Canada has launched a $1.2 billion initiative aimed at drawing leading researchers to the country, as the U.S. intensifies restrictions on highly skilled workers by charging $100,000 for H-1B visas.",
      "The Canadian government announced on Tuesday that its investment over 12 years will be used to recruit and support over 1,000 individuals advancing world-leading research in critical fields, including doctors and scientists.",
      "\"As other countries constrain academic freedoms and undermine cutting-edge research, Canada is investing in \u2013 and doubling down on \u2013 science,\" Melanie Joly, Canada's industry minister, said in a statement. \"Today's investment is about securing Canada's place at the forefront of discovery and innovation and leveraging our strength in science to support our future well-being and prosperity for generations to come.\"",
      "While the initiative does not explicitly mention the United States, it appears aimed \u2013 at least in part \u2013 at attracting highly skilled workers like those who could hold H-1B visas.",
      "In September, President Trump signed an executive order requiring a $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled foreign worker applicants, saying it will spur companies to hire Americans instead of people from overseas.",
      "The fee applies only to new H-1B applicants who live abroad, according to the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which oversees the visa program. More specifically, the $100,000 fee applies to H-1B applications filed on or after Sept. 21 by workers outside the U.S. and who do not currently hold such a visa, USCIS said in October.",
      "While the fee could foster boosted domestic hiring in some industries, other industries could take a hit. The U.S. health care system, for example, which depends on international professionals such as doctors, lab technicians and nurses to fill positions, could become collateral damage.",
      "Canada, meanwhile, faces its own challenges. The country is experiencing a significant shortage of doctors in primary care, leaving millions without a family physician and contributing to longer emergency room waits and poorer health outcomes.",
      "In response, Canadian officials have announced a path to expedited permanent residency for overseas doctors with at least one year of Canadian work experience, aiming to address the critical workforce gap.",
      "\"This dedicated Express Entry category, along with the reserved federal admission spaces for provinces and territories, will help bring in and keep practice-ready doctors, so people across Canada can get the care they need,\" Lena Metlege Diab, Canada's minister of refugees and citizenship, said in a statement Monday.",
      "Some scholars are already making their way from the U.S. to Canadian universities. The University of Toronto announced in November that it recruited three top researchers from U.S. institutions \u2014 whose work ranges from the search for new planets to economics \u2014 and called it a \"big win for Canada.\"",
      "\"By attracting the top minds from around the world to work alongside exceptional Canadian researchers, the Government of Canada is building the kind of scientific and academic powerhouse that drives the strongest economy in the G7,\" Joly said.",

    "summary": "Dozens of health care organizations have asked the Trump administration to shield the doctors, nurses, and techs they need to fill shortages from a $100,000 visa fee for skilled foreign workers.",
    "story": [
      "Bekki Holzkamm has been trying to hire a lab technician at a hospital in rural North Dakota since late summer.",
      "Not one U.S. citizen has applied.",
      "West River Health Services in Hettinger, a town of about 1,000 residents in the southwestern part of the state, has four options, and none is good.",
      "The hospital could fork over $100,000 for the Trump administration's new H-1B visa fee and hire one of the more than 30 applicants from the Philippines or Nigeria. The fee is the equivalent of what some rural hospitals would pay two lab techs in a year, said Holzkamm, who is West River's lab manager.",
      "West River could ask the Department of Homeland Security to waive the fee. But it's unclear how long the waiver process would take and if the government would grant one. The hospital could continue trying to recruit someone inside the U.S. for the job. Or, Holzkamm said, it could leave the position unfilled, adding to the workload of the current \"skeleton crew.\"",
      "The U.S. health care system depends on foreign-born professionals to fill its ranks of doctors, nurses, technicians, and other health providers, particularly in chronically understaffed facilities in rural America.",
      "But a new presidential proclamation aimed at the tech industry's use of H-1B visas is making it harder for West River and other rural providers to hire those staffers.",
      "\"The health care industry wasn't even considered. They're going to be collateral damage, and to such an extreme degree that it was clearly not thought about at all,\" said Eram Alam, a Harvard associate professor whose new book examines the history of foreign doctors in the U.S.",
      "Elissa Taub, a Memphis, Tennessee-based attorney who assists hospitals with the H-1B application process, has been hearing concerns from her clients.",
      "\"It's not like there's a surplus of American physicians or nurses waiting in the wings to fill in those positions,\" she said.",
      "Until recently, West River and other employers paid up to $5,000 each time they applied to sponsor an H-1B worker. The visas are reserved for highly skilled foreign workers.",
      "The new $100,000 fee \u2014 part of a\u00a0September proclamation\u00a0by President Trump \u2014 applies to workers living outside the U.S. but not those who were already in the U.S. on a visa.",
      "West River lab tech Kathrine Abelita is one of nine employees \u2014 six technicians and three nurses \u2014 at the hospital who are current or former H-1B visa holders. Abelita is from the Philippines and has worked at West River since 2018. She's now a permanent U.S. resident.",
      "\"It's going to be a big problem for rural health care,\" she said of the new fee. She said most younger American workers want to live in urban areas.",
      "Sixteen percent of registered nurses, 14% of physician assistants, and 14% of nurse practitioners and midwives who work in U.S. hospitals are immigrants, according to a\u00a02023 government survey. Nearly a quarter of physicians in the U.S. went to medical school outside the U.S. or Canada, according to\u00a02024 licensing data.",
      "The\u00a0American Hospital Association, two\u00a0national rural health organizations, and\u00a0more than 50 medical societies\u00a0have asked the administration to give the health care industry exemptions from the new fee. The new cost will disproportionally harm rural communities that already struggle to afford and recruit enough providers, the groups argue.",
      "\"A blanket exception for healthcare providers is the simplest path forward,\" the National Rural Health Association and National Association of Rural Health Clinics wrote in a joint letter.",
      "The proclamation allows fee exemptions for individuals, workers at specific companies, and those in entire industries when \"in the national interest.\"\u00a0New guidance\u00a0says the fee will be waived only in an \"extraordinarily rare circumstance.\" That includes showing that there is \"no American worker\" available for the position and that requiring a company to spend $100,000 would \"significantly undermine\" U.S. interests.",
      "Taub called those standards \"exceptionally high.\"",
      "Representatives of the NRHA and the American Medical Association, which organized a letter from the medical societies, said they've received no response after sending requests to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in late September and early October. The AHA declined to say whether it had heard back.",
      "Homeland Security officials directed KFF Health News' inquiries to the White House, which did not answer questions about individual waiver timelines or the possibility of a categorical exemption for the health care industry.",
      "Instead, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers sent a statement defending the new fee, saying it will \"put American workers first.\" Her comments echo Mr. Trump's proclamation, which focuses on accusations that the tech industry is abusing the H-1B program by replacing American workers with lower-paid foreign ones. But the order applies to all trades.",
      "Alam, the Harvard professor, said the U.S.' reliance on international providers does raise legitimate concerns, such as about how it takes professionals away from lower-income countries facing even greater health concerns and staffing shortages than the U.S.",
      "This decades-long dependency, she said, stems from population booms, medical schools' historical exclusion of nonwhite men, and the \"much, much cheaper\" cost of importing providers trained abroad than expanding health education in the U.S.",
      "Internationally trained doctors tend to work in rural and urban areas that are poor and underserved, according to\u00a0a survey\u00a0and\u00a0research review.",
      "Nearly 1,000 H-1B providers were employed in rural areas this year, the two rural health organizations wrote in their letter to the Trump administration.",
      "J-1 visas, the most common type held by foreign doctors during their residencies and other postgraduate training in the U.S., require them to return to their home country for two years before applying for an H-1B.",
      "But a government program called the Conrad 30 Waiver Program allows up to 1,500 J-1 holders a year to remain in the U.S. and apply for an H-1B in exchange for working for three years in a provider shortage area, which includes many rural communities.",
      "President Trump's proclamation says employers that sponsor H-1B workers already inside the U.S., such as doctors with these waivers, won't have to pay the six-figure fee, a nuance clarified in guidance released about a month later.",
      "But employers will have to pay the new fee when hiring doctors and others who apply while living outside the U.S.",
      "Alyson Kornele, CEO of West River Health Services, said most of the foreign nurses and lab techs it hires are outside the U.S. when they apply.",
      "Ivan Mitchell, CEO of Great Plains Health in North Platte, Nebraska, said most of his hospital's H-1B physicians were inside the U.S. on other visas when they applied. But he said physical therapists, nurses, and lab techs typically apply from abroad.",
      "Holzkamm said it took five to eight months to hire H-1B applicants at her lab before the new fee was introduced.",
      "Bobby Mukkamala, a surgeon and the president of the American Medical Association, said Republican and Democratic lawmakers are concerned about the ramifications for rural health care.",
      "They include Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said he planned to reach out about possible exemptions.",
      "\"We want to make it easier, not harder, and less expensive, not more expensive, for people who need the workforce,\" the Republican told KFF Health News in September.",
      "Thune's office did not respond to questions about whether the senator has heard from the administration regarding potential waivers for health workers.",
      "The Trump administration is facing at least two lawsuits attempting to block the new fee.\u00a0One group of plaintiffs\u00a0includes a company that recruits foreign nurses and a union that represents medical graduates.\u00a0Another lawsuit, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, mentions concerns about the physician shortage and health systems' ability to afford the new fee.",
      "Kornele said West River won't be able to afford a $100,000 fee so it's doubling down on local recruiting and retention.",
      "But Holzkamm said she hasn't been successful in finding lab techs from North Dakota colleges, even those who intern at the hospital. She said West River can't compete with the salaries offered in bigger cities.",
      "\"It's a bad cycle right now. We're in a lot of trouble,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Homeownership is increasingly out of reach for most U.S. families as the gap between people's earnings and home prices\u00a0widens, according to a new analysis.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a\u00a0report. The personal finance firm defines a home as affordable if the annual housing costs do not exceed 30% of a household's income.",
      "\"Only a sliver of the housing market is affordable to the typical household,\" Bankrate data analyst Alex Gailey told CBS News. \"That's when homeownership starts to feel less like a common middle-class milestone and more like a luxury.\"",
      "Experts emphasize that the ability to buy a home, long viewed as a pillar of the American Dream, is critical for building wealth. But high home prices, driven in part by a nationwide shortage of affordable housing, have made that difficult for many Americans.",
      "\"It's left the average American household with far fewer homes than they can afford, and we haven't been building at the rate we should be,\" Gailey said.",
      "Figures from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of housing sales last year were by first-time homebuyers \u2014 down from 50% in 2010. The U.S. needs 4.7 million housing units to keep up with demand, according to a July analysis from Zillow, an online real estate marketplace.",
      "In 2024 (the latest date for which figures are available), the median household income in the U.S. after adjusting for inflation was nearly $84,000, according to Census data. That is far less than the $113,000 in annual income needed to buy a typical home, which now costs around $435,000, according to Bankrate.",
      "In the country's priciest cities, such as New York, San Francisco and Seattle, households must earn at least $200,000 a year to afford the median-priced home.",
      "As of 2025, about 65% of U.S. households owned their own home, down from a peak of more than 69% in 2004, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "By contrast, in some parts of the South and West, where home construction has picked up in some markets, there are glimmers of hope, Gailey said, pointing to stronger tax incentives and looser permitting requirements as policies that could boost construction.",

    "summary": "President Trump spoke about affordability and his economic agenda in the Poconos, in northeastern Pennsylvania, Tuesday night.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 After weeks of decrying the focus on \"affordability\" and calling it a \"Democratic hoax,\" President Trump spoke in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, Tuesday night to sell his economic agenda ahead of a challenging midterm election season for congressional Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump spent much of the more than 90-minute-long rally-style speech promoting and defending his economic record, saying,\u00a0\"America is winning again\" and \"Pennsylvania is prospering again.\" He touted job growth in the key battleground state, which has a slightly lower unemployment rate than the nation as a whole, and a decline in gas prices. The president also claimed his tariffs on foreign goods are paying dividends for the U.S. economy \u2014 despite worries from most economists that tariffs can lead to slower economic growth and higher consumer prices.",
      "He pointed to the tax components of his \"big, beautiful bill,\" including a plan to create\u00a0investment accounts for children \u2014 seeded with $1,000 from the federal government for eligible kids \u2014 and a tax deduction for tips.",
      "Mr. Trump highlighted his decision to let Japan-based Nippon Steel buy U.S. Steel, a major employer in Pennsylvania. He said his administration \"saved\" the company, which he said is now \"hot as a pistol.\"",
      "\"The one thing you need, you need steel,\" he said. \"You know, you can give up certain products. You can give up pencils... You don't need 37 dolls for your daughter. Two or three is nice, but you don't need 37 dolls.\"",
      "He argued his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and said \"prices are coming down.\" Consumer prices rose 3% year-over-year in September, which is well below 2022 levels \u2014 when inflation hit 9.1% \u2014 but still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Mr. Trump also continued blaming Democrats for affordability issues.",
      "\"They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down,\" the president said.",
      "After initially focusing on cost-of-living issues, Mr. Trump veered off topic at times, riffing about immigration and polling members of the audience about whether to refer to his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, as \"sleepy Joe\" or \"crooked Joe.\"",
      "He also repeatedly brought up a fraud scandal that has enveloped Minnesota politics, and pointed to the fact that most of the defendants are of Somali descent. At several points, he urged Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to \"do your job\" as Bessent's agency investigates allegations that Minnesota tax dollars went to the terror group al Shabaab.",
      "Trump addresses affordability after calling issue a \"scam\"",
      "The president has publicly and privately vented about the focus on affordability as an issue for weeks, referring to it as a \"hoax,\" a \"con job\" and a \"scam\" perpetuated by Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for focusing on affordability issues in Tuesday's speech, though he said: \"I can't call it a hoax because they'll misconstrue that.\"",
      "Last week, the president called the affordability issue a \"fake narrative\" made up by Democrats to sway the public. But at the same time, he said he had inherited problems with affordability from his predecessor.",
      "\"They just say the word,\" the president said during his Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2. \"It doesn't mean anything to anybody. They just say it \u2014 affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything.\"",
      "Inflation has\u00a0edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, but the latest inflation numbers have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting meeting this week \u2014 because of the recent U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "In an interview published Tuesday, the president told Politico\u00a0that \"prices are all coming down.\"",
      "Behind the scenes, aides told CBS News last week that the president has grown increasingly irritated by perceptions that his policies aren't easing prices.",
      "His travel to sell his economic agenda in Pennsylvania is a quiet acknowledgement that he needs to do more to rally the public behind his policies. In Tuesday's speech, Mr. Trump said he decided to speak about affordability in part because chief of staff Susie Wiles told him he needed to start campaigning for the midterm elections.",
      "Polling shows voters are feeling the crunch of still-high prices and the cost of living, as well as the challenging market for job seekers \u2014 and many at least partially blame Mr. Trump.",
      "In a November CBS News/YouGov poll, 60% of respondents agreed Mr. Trump makes prices and inflation \"sound better than they really are.\" Nearly two-thirds of respondents said the president's policies are making grocery prices go up. Just 32% said the U.S. economy is good, down from 38% the month Mr. Trump took office in January. Respondents were most likely to say the economy and inflation are the most important to them, and among those who listed the economy and inflation as their top priorities, 77% said the president is not spending enough time on those issues.",
      "The Palm Beach Post, a local paper near Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in South Florida, published an opinion piece Tuesday with the headline, \"'Affordability' is not a hoax, Trump. Reality costs too much.\"",
      "Pennsylvania will feature key races for Republicans as they try to hold onto their majority in the House of Representatives in 2026. Mount Pocono, where Mr. Trump spoke Tuesday night, is just over 30 miles from Scranton, Biden's hometown.",
      "Cost of living worries still linger",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks come amid ongoing public frustration over the high cost of living in the U.S.",
      "Although U.S. inflation has fallen, the high cost of food, shelter, health care, utilities, child care and other basic necessities has remained a sore spot for millions of Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has vacillated between downplaying complaints about the economy and defending his administration's efforts to address affordability issues.",
      "In November, for example, the Trump administration removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. Mr. Trump last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "More recently, Mr. Trump on Monday announced $12 billion in aid for farmers who have struggled under tariffs and because of the U.S trade war with China.",

    "summary": "The author and philanthropist MacKenzie Scott revealed $7.1 billion in donations to nonprofits in 2025 Tuesday, marking a significant increase in her annual giving from recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Philanthropist and billionaire MacKenzie Scott announced Tuesday she has given $7.1 billion in donations to nonprofits so far in 2025, a major increase over her recent yearly contributions.",
      "Writing in an essay on her website, Scott said, \"This dollar total will likely be reported in the news, but any dollar amount is a vanishingly tiny fraction of the personal expressions of care being shared into communities this year.\"",
      "Scott acknowledged donating $2.6 billion in 2024 and $2.1 billion in 2023. The gifts this year bring her total giving since 2019 to $26.3 billion.",
      "Scott's donations have captured the attention of nonprofits and other charitable funders because they come with no strings attached and are often very large compared to the annual budgets of the recipient organizations. Forbes estimates Scott's net worth at $33 billion, most of which comes from Amazon shares she received after her 2019 divorce from company founder Jeff Bezos.",
      "Research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy in February showed that Scott has donated to more than 2,000 nonprofits, and the median size was roughly $5 million.",
      "With the exception of an open call for applications in 2023, it is not possible to apply for her funding nor to reach her directly, as Scott maintains no public-facing office or foundation. Organizations are usually notified through an intermediary that Scott is awarding them a donation with little prelude or warning.",
      "In advance of her announcement on her website, Yield Giving, more than a dozen historically Black colleges and universities revealed they had received $783 million in donations from Scott so far this year, according to research from Marybeth Gasman, a professor at Rutgers University and expert on HBCUs.",
      "\"One of the things that I really admire about Mackenzie Scott is that she is like an equity machine,\" Gasman told the Associated Press, especially at a time when efforts to promote equity in education have come under attack from the Trump administration. She also said Scott's gifts to HBCUs this time are bigger than the round of donations she made in 2020.",
      "Not all of the schools that previously had received funding from Scott received a gift this time and there were some first-time recipients as well. In total, Gasman has tracked $1.35 billion in donations from Scott to HBCUs since 2020.",
      "Scott's recent donations to HBCU's include $50 million to\u00a0Norfolk State University, $63 million to\u00a0Prairie View A&M University\u00a0and $50 million to\u00a0Bowie State University.",
      "On Friday, Scott donated $25 million to Lincoln University of Pennsylvania.",
      "In addition, UNCF, which is the largest provider of scholarships to minority students, received $70 million from Scott, and said it will invest the gift in a collective endowment it is building for participating HBCUs. Another $50 million went to Native Forward Scholars Fund, which had also received a previous gift from Scott and provides college and graduate scholarships to Native American students.",
      "Unlike Scott's gifts, most foundations or major donors direct grants to specific programs and require an application and updates about the impact of the nonprofit's work. Scott does not ask grantees to report back about how they used the money.",
      "In October, Scott posted an essay on her website. The essay, which she expanded upon in December to announce her giving, also reflects on how acts of generosity and kindness can ripple far afield and into the future. She cited her own experiences getting help while in college, including a dentist who repaired a tooth for free and her roommate who loaned her $1,000.",
      "Scott now has invested in that same roommate's company, which offers loans to students who would otherwise struggle to get financing from banks. The investments seem to be part of an effort Scott announced last year to move more of her money into \"mission aligned\" investments, rather than into vehicles that seek only the highest monetary returns.",
      "In her 2025 essay, Scott seemed to urge people toward action, writing, \"There are many ways to influence how we move through the world, and where we land.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 16:44:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Beating back inflation is only half the battle in lowering the cost of living \u2014 you also have to think about people's pay, economists argue.",
    "story": [
      "Mounting public attention on the struggle millions of Americans face affording food, housing and other daily necessities has largely centered on what can be done to quash inflation. Yet some economists say the discussion is incomplete without addressing another major reason life has become unaffordable for so many people: their\u00a0meager paychecks.",
      "\"It's not just about how much things cost. Affordability is truly about, 'Does an individual have enough money to buy the things they want?' So it's not about making things cheaper, but making it so you earn more so that the stuff you need is affordable,\" Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, told CBS News.",
      "President Trump on Tuesday evening is expected to address cost-of-living concerns and other economic issues at a rally in Mount Pocono, Pa. Although he has at times dismissed claims that the U.S. faces an affordability crisis, his administration has also taken steps to offer relief.",
      "In November, for example, Mr. Trump removed country-specific tariffs on imports of beef, bananas and coffee as consumers continue to grapple with high food prices. The president last month also discussed offering Americans a $2,000 payment funded by U.S. tariff collections, while this month he floated the idea of using tariff revenue to cut federal income taxes.",
      "\"Your money doesn't go as far\"",
      "To be sure, controlling inflation is critical, as well as an explicit aim under the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to keep both unemployment and prices in check. Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, describes prices and wages as \"two sides of the same coin.\"",
      "\"You can achieve the same standard of living by either raising wages or lowering costs or both,\" he added. \"So it is important to deal with cost-of-living issues if you want to improve living standards, but raising wages also works.\"",
      "Shierholz, who served as chief economist at the Department of Labor under Barack Obama from 2014 to 2017, thinks a better way to make life more affordable is to raise worker wages so their dollars stretch further. She also favors providing government subsidies to help ease the burden of affording essential \u2014 and increasingly costly \u2014 services such as child care and health care.",
      "One-third of middle-class families struggle to afford housing\u00a0and child care, according to a recent\u00a0report from the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans are struggling to afford things beyond the bare essentials, according to the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity. The research firm has found that the bottom 60% of income earners in the U.S. have difficulty affording expenses such as higher education, transportation and even the basic technology required for their jobs.",
      "\"There are some things that feel out of reach that didn't feel like they were out of reach in the past,\" said Veronique de Rugy, an economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. \"Your money doesn't go as far as it used to.\"",
      "Why prices may not drop much",
      "Economists note that prices don't generally decline broadly unless the economy is in a recession, with presidential administrations and even the Fed having a limited toolkit for addressing severe bouts of inflation. Meanwhile, a sharp, across-the-board drop in prices can indicate a dangerous erosion in consumer demand, leading to an economic downturn.",
      "\"Overall, it's very rare and not a good thing to have outright deflation across the economy,\" the Cato Institute's Lincicome told CBS News.",
      "Indeed, millions of people would have to lose their jobs, and then cut their spending, for demand to slow enough for companies to broadly reduce their prices, according to Shierholz.",
      "\"In order to bring the overall price level down, you have to have a massive recession because people are not demanding stuff, because they don't have any income,\" she added. \"That's how you get a drop in the overall price level.\"",
      "Affordability fixes?",
      "Shierholz favors a range of policies for driving both short- and long-term wage growth. First and foremost, the U.S. could boost the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "Local governments aren't waiting around for the feds to take action, with dozens of states in recent years adopting higher baseline wages. In 2026,\u00a0minimum wage increases are set to take effect in 19 states and 49 cities and counties starting on Jan. 1, according to the National Employment Law Project.",
      "Reforming labor laws to make it easier for workers to form a union can also lead to higher wages for workers, Shieholz said. Equally important, in her view, is providing a robust social safety net. That includes providing ample unemployment insurance benefits so workers who lose their jobs can stay afloat financially.",
      "\"That actually raises wages because it gives workers power,\" she said. \"By contrast, if your employer knows you'll drop into poverty if you give up or lose your job, you're going to be much less able to make any risky demands.\"",
      "The Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a nonpartisan group focused on economic equality, also argues in a new report\u00a0that expanding unemployment insurance benefits helps low-income workers find better-paying jobs.",
      "Although surging employee pay can fuel inflation under certain conditions, De Rugy of the Mercatus Center said that rising wages rooted in strong economic growth \"actually improves affordability, because it tends to shift the bargaining power toward employees.\"",
      "To ease housing costs, progressive economists also support policies like freezing the rent and offering financial incentives to homebuilders to put up more affordable housing.",
      "Other experts also underline the importance of providing low-cost child care as a key part of solving the affordability puzzle for U.S. families.\u00a0Child care costs today exceed\u00a0the cost of rent in dozens of cities, according to a recent LendingTree analysis. Households spend an average of $1,282 per month for full-time child care for one child and $2,252 for two kids, the lending marketplace found.",
      "Some states are leading the way to ease child care costs, showing that progress is possible given sufficient political will. In November,\u00a0New Mexico became the first U.S. state to offer free universal child care to residents, with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham telling CBS News it would save families an average of $12,000 a year.",

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:53:08 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve will announce if they will cut rates again in December's meeting \u2014 their last meeting of 2025. The decision will determine whether borrowers get more relief on interest rates.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve will announce whether to cut interest rates at its December meeting, capping off a turbulent year for the U.S. economy defined by fresh labor market headwinds and tariff-fueled inflation that has deepened the nation's affordability crunch.",
      "The U.S. central bank will have to make its decision without some key government data. Hiring data for November and the latest inflation number have been delayed until mid-December \u2014 after the Fed's meeting \u2014 because of the U.S.\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "Those two measures are key to the Fed's decision-making on interest rates because of its so-called dual mandate, which is to keep both inflation and unemployment low. Those goals have proved difficult to reconcile this year amid a slowdown in hiring and a spike in layoffs, while inflation has edged higher\u00a0in recent months, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Economists expect another quarter-point cut",
      "Despite the conflicting data, most economists are penciling in an interest-rate cut at the December 10 meeting.",
      "CME FedWatch, which assesses the probability of rate moves based on futures pricing data, puts the odds of another 0.25 percentage-point cut in the Fed's benchmark rate at 88%. That would represent the third straight Fed cut and lower the federal funds rate, or what banks charge each other for short-term loans, to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%.",
      "A rate cut this week could help some borrowers by reducing the cost of their loans, from credit card APRs to home equity lines of credit. That could bolster U.S. households at a time when many Americans report still feeling pinched by the rising cost of food, health care and other everyday expenses.",
      "\"Another Fed rate cut to close an unnervingly uncertain year is good news for borrowers,\" LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz told CBS News. \"The accumulated savings from the Fed's moves are starting to add up to real money.\"",
      "Credit card rates are now at their lowest since April 2023, and are continuing to fall, Schulz added. Another rate cut on Dec. 10 would mark the sixth reduction since September 2024, with those cuts amounting to hundreds of dollars in savings for many borrowers, he added.",
      "Although official economic data has been delayed, Fed officials will be looking at other data sources, such as the ADP National Employment Report, which tracks private payrolls. Its November data shows employers shed 32,000 jobs, a signal the labor market is continuing to face headwinds.",
      "\"The absence of recent inflation data leaves the Federal Reserve operating with limited visibility, while alternative labor indicators and political pressure are steering the committee toward a more accommodative policy stance,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates said in an email.",
      "President Trump and other administration officials have chastised Fed Chair Jerome Powell this year about not moving sooner to ratchet back interest rates.",
      "Another Fed rate cut carries its own risks. Lowering borrowing costs can spur consumers and businesses to spend more, potentially fueling higher inflation, Kates noted.",
      "A Fed divided",
      "Although economists expect the Fed to approve a rate cut on Wednesday, not all members of the Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 the central bank's 12-member rate-setting panel \u2014 are expected to support the move.",
      "Several FOMC members have recently spoken publicly in support of cutting rates, including Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John Williams, who last month said the labor market's weakness outweighs concerns about inflation. In October, however, Powell\u00a0cautioned that a December rate cut wasn't a \"foregone conclusion,\" pointing to signs that the job market remains on firm ground.",
      "\"It's difficult to recall a time when the Federal Open Market Committee has been so evenly divided about the need for additional rate cuts than the upcoming December meeting,\" Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said in a report. \"It's a close call, but on balance we expect the committee to vote to lower rates\" by a quarter of a percentage point.",
      "Are more rate cuts coming in 2026?",
      "For consumers, businesses and investors, perhaps the biggest question on Wednesday is whether policymakers will hint at more rate cuts for 2026.",
      "For now, economists expect the Fed to hold rates steady at its next meeting on Jan. 27-28, according to a poll by FactSet. The survey of economists shows a 62% probability that the Fed will leave rates unchanged next month.",
      "Even so, economists are generally forecasting more rate cuts for 2026, although the timing remains uncertain. The Fed could wait until March to make its first cut of the year because inflation remains above its 2% annual target, according to Maxime Darmet, senior economist at Allianz Trade.",
      "But the labor market remains a wild card, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a research report. Employers have cut more than 1.1 million jobs through November, the most since 2020 and a 54% increase from the same period a year ago, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Employers are relying more on artificial intelligence, with some companies\u00a0saying they're cutting jobs as AI makes their workforce more efficient.

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 14:41:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Shoppers may be unaware they're paying as much as 23% more than others for the same grocery items on Instacart, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart customers may be surprised to discover they are unwittingly paying more for the same items sold by some of America's major retail chains than their fellow shoppers.",
      "A months-long investigation by the nonprofit organizations Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative found that identical grocery items on Instacart could differ in price by as much as 23% from one customer to the next.",
      "That's due to the platform's algorithmic pricing experiments, which place different price tags on identical products without revealing the discrepancies directly to shoppers, the report found. The AI model, which Instacart started implementing in 2022, sets grocery prices at some large retail chains that partner with the San Francisco-based delivery company, the groups added.",
      "Variations in pricing for identical products are particularly acute in online shopping, given that customers don't have the same reference points as in physical stores, said Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData.",
      "\"You sit in front of your phone or your browser, you're shown the price, and you don't know what everyone else was shown,\" he said.",
      "Justin Brookman, director of digital marketplace policy for Consumer Reports, agreed. \"Traditionally, we haven't had to worry about this sort of thing. We would go to the supermarket and pay what was on the shelf,\" he told CBS News. \"Now, I think people are going to be worried: Am I getting ripped off?\"",
      "Report finds major price discrepancies",
      "Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative based their findings on data gathered from online shopping sessions, in which hundreds of volunteers shopped on Instacart for identical baskets of goods from Safeway and Target.",
      "Of the 437 participants, every single one was exposed to algorithmic price experiments, according to the report. The investigation also found evidence of price experimentation at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market.",
      "According to Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, Instacart has framed price differences between customers as \"negligible.\" However, the scope of the price experiments is \"far broader and more costly to some consumers than has been publicly acknowledged,\" the organizations said in the report.",
      "The investigation found that some products had as many as five different price points, with variations ranging from as little as 7 cents to $2.56 per item. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins differed by as much as 23%.",
      "All told, the price variations could cost families $1,200 a year, based on how much Instacart says the typical household of four spends on groceries, the report found.",
      "Some products were unscathed by the price experiments. For example, at the Seattle Safeway, volunteers did not observe any price variations for items such as Premium brand saltine crackers, Heinz ketchup and Barilla farfalle pasta.",
      "Safeway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Instacart told CBS News in a statement that 10 of its retailer partners are using pricing experiments, but did not specify which ones.",
      "\"Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2014 ones that already apply markups \u2014 do the same online via Instacart,\" a spokesperson said in an email. \"These limited, short-term and randomized tests help retail partners learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.\"",
      "Customers were also shown different \"original\" prices, making some savings appear larger, the report found, a concept known as \"fictitious pricing.\"\u00a0Amazon was sued this October\u00a0for allegedly using this tactic during its summer Prime Day sale.",
      "The rise of AI pricing models",
      "Dynamic pricing, which sets consumer prices based on demand, has long been part of the e-commerce landscape. However, while it's a common tactic in certain industries like travel, where supply is fixed, consumers may be surprised to see it cropping up in the grocery space, Saunders said.",
      "\"In retail, especially grocery retail, people expect the price to be the price,\" he said. \"They don't expect [it] to yo-yo up and down.\"",
      "Another issue, as the report points out, is that consumers often have no clue that they may be paying more for the same item. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u00a0Act prevents \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" including \"misleading cost or price claims.\" However, Saunders said he doesn't believe companies are legally obligated to tell customers that they are part of pricing experiments.",
      "\"Instacart shoppers we spoke to say they were unaware that they were participants in active Instacart pricing experiments and view the practice as manipulative and unfair,\" the report says.",
      "One example of dynamic pricing is surveillance pricing, a tactic employed by companies that involves using a shopper's behavior and personal data to make price evaluations, according to the FTC. Saunders said surveillance pricing has been supercharged by artificial intelligence, which can assess vast amounts of data at rapid speeds to determine price levels.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that it does not use personal, demographic or user-level behavioral data to set prices.",
      "As pricing models like Instacart's become more sophisticated, Brookman said he's concerned about what it could mean for consumers.",
      "\"I'm worried companies are going to use these sorts of algorithmic pricing models to charge us the maximum amount we're willing to pay, which is good for their profits, but not so good for [our wallets],\" he said.",

    "summary": "Erika Kirk recalls the emotional fog of Charlie Kirk's assassination, addresses conspiracy theories and takes questions during a CBS News town hall hosted by Bari Weiss.",
    "story": [
      "Charlie Kirk transformed the American right through his nonprofit Turning Point USA before he was assassinated at an on-campus event in Utah three months ago. This week, his widow Erika, who now leads Turning Point, joined CBS News for a town hall where she reflected on grief, defended her husband's controversial comments and explained the \"game-time decision\" of publicly forgiving the man accused in her husband's murder.",
      "The conversation, moderated by CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, is the first of many planned CBS News town halls and debates. Invited guests who joined the conversation included Utah Valley University student Hunter Kozak, who was the last person to speak to Charlie Kirk, and Robert Milgrim, the father of Israeli Embassy staffer Sarah Milgrim, who was shot and killed in May.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "Erika Kirk's message to people who sought to justify assassination: \"Tell that to my 3-year-old daughter\"",
      "Erika Kirk said anyone who sought to justify her husband's assassination is \"sick\" and said the internet has dehumanized people.",
      "\"He's a human being. You think he deserved that? Tell that to my 3-year-old daughter.\"",
      "She continued: \"You want to watch in high-res the video of my husband being murdered, and laugh, and say he deserves it? There's something very sick in your soul, and I'm praying that God saves you.\"",
      "Erika Kirk: Charlie never incited violence",
      "Charlie Kirk was known for his debates with college students, inviting them to step up to a microphone and \"prove me wrong.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said her husband encouraged people of different political beliefs and backgrounds to come to the front of the line, saying, \"'I'll put my mic down. Tell me why you believe that. That's interesting. I never thought of that. But have you thought of this?'\"",
      "A recent poll by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and College Pulse found that 91% of undergraduates believe \"words can be violence.\" But Erika Kirk said her husband never incited violence: \"He never once said, 'Go after them because they're saying X, Y, Z and they deserve to die.'He gave them a microphone. He didn't take away a moment for them to speak back. He gave them a microphone. And what'd they do? They gave him a bullet in the neck. Totally different.\"",
      "She says her husband believed having conversations could save the world, referencing his new book, \"Stop, in the Name of God: Why Honoring the Sabbath Will Transform Your Life,\" which emphasizes that you can't communicate effectively with someone if you're not at peace with yourself.",
      "Erika Kirk: Charlie shouldn't be \"deteriorated\" to \"out-of-context\" clips",
      "Erika Kirk says some of her late husband's controversial comments, shared widely in the wake of his assassination, lacked context and that he should not \"be deteriorated\" to a few sentences.",
      "Weiss asked Erika Kirk about some of those much-shared comments: that some gun deaths are \"worth it\" to protect the Second Amendment; that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a mistake; and that if he sees a Black pilot, he's \"going to be like, boy, I hope he's qualified,\" while acknowledging \"that's not who I am, that's not what I believe.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said she'd love for people to watch the full clips instead of taking comments out of context.",
      "\"Charlie didn't care what skin color you were. He didn't care what religion you were. He loved excellence,\" she said, adding that \"his favorite word was 'earn'\u2026 He loved knowing that people worked hard to earn what they got.\"",
      "She said she didn't know the context of the \"gun deaths\" quote but said, \"There's a lot more there than just that one little sentence.\"",
      "\"My husband is not to be deteriorated to two sentences,\" she said. \"He's not. He is a thought leader, and he was brilliant of a man. So that's fine if you want to take words out of his mouth or out of context without the whole thing in perspective, but that's the problem.\"",
      "The last student to talk to Charlie Kirk asks: Will you condemn President Trump's rhetoric?",
      "Kozak was the last person to debate Charlie Kirk before he was shot. Since that day, Kozak \u2014 a self-professed liberal \u2014 has continued to call for civil political discourse. \"I think that one of the few things that we can agree on is this necessity for a conversation. I think that we need to remember that we still have to live with each other. That these are still our neighbors,\" he told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley after the shooting.",
      "He attended the CBS News town hall, where he again took the microphone \u2014 this time, to ask Erika Kirk a question: \"Will you condemn the violent rhetoric of Donald Trump, the most powerful and influential person on earth?\"",
      "Kozak specifically referenced President Trump accusing six Democratic lawmakers of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" and then reposting, \"HANG THEM, GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!\" Top Democrats called for Mr. Trump to be \"condemned forcefully\" over the social media remarks.",
      "Erika Kirk didn't mention Mr. Trump by name in her response, saying the issue is \"so much deeper than one person\" and that it \"starts at the home.\"",
      "She urged parents to \"look in the mirror\" and reflect on how they're raising their children.",
      "\"You can choose to have evil in your heart or you can choose to have light,\" she said. \"What you consume and what you absorb from the outside world will manifest itself.\"",
      "Weiss asked: \"Do you think our political leaders have a responsibility to turn the temperature down right now?\"",
      "\"Well, I think everyone has a responsibility to do that, and I'm doing my part,\" Erika Kirk replied. \"I'm not in control of other people.\"",
      "Dad of Israeli Embassy staffer killed in shooting asks: Will you condemn antisemitism?",
      "Robert Milgrim, whose daughter Sarah was one of two victims of the Capitol Jewish Museum shooting in Washington, D.C., asked Erika Kirk: \"Will you here condemn the individuals spreading that hate and speak out clearly enough against antisemitism so we can prevent another tragedy?\"",
      "\"Hate is hate. It's evil,\" said Erika Kirk, adding that she and Charlie Kirk have always been \"very clear on our stance\" on Israel and the Jewish people.",
      "She said: \"What healing factor comes out of hating Jewish people? What healing factor comes out of hating Christians? What healing factor comes out? Hate in general. Nothing. Nothing. Charlie always would say very clearly, Jew hate was brain rot. He would always say it.\"",
      "Antisemitic incidents have increased nearly 900% in the U.S. over the past 10 years, according to a recent Anti-Defamation League audit.",
      "Erika Kirk's one-word message for Candace Owens",
      "Weiss asked Erika Kirk about Candace Owens, a former Turning Point USA employee and onetime friend of Charlie Kirk, who has recently been peddling conspiracy theories about his assassination. Owens has also made unfounded fraud allegations about the nonprofit \u2014 the Treasury Department last week confirmed that none of the tax-exempt entities Erika Kirk runs are under investigation by the IRS.",
      "What does Erika Kirk want to say to Owens and others making these unfounded claims?",
      "\"Stop. That's it. That's all I have to say. Stop.\"",
      "The \"game-time decision\" to forgive",
      "Erika Kirk stunned millions when she proclaimed at her husband's memorial service that she forgave her husband's accused killer.",
      "\"I forgive him because it's what Christ did and is what Charlie would do,\" she said in her powerful eulogy.",
      "She told Weiss that the moment was a \"game-time decision\" because she'd never say something she didn't mean.",
      "\"But am I gonna take that moment to say, 'Rally the troops, burn the city down, march in the streets?' Or am I gonna take that moment and unleash something like we talked about, even greater, more powerful and say, 'It's a revival.' And let that unleash, and let the Lord use it in ways that no one else could've ever imagined.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said she's not forgetting or condoning, but rather \"releasing myself from the enemy's hands where he could have a foothold in me.\"",
      "When asked if she had any words for his accused killer, she said: \"Nothing. I have nothing to say to you. Nothing.\"",
      "She added that there's a difference between forgiving someone and still wanting justice. \"We serve a just God, and I rest easy in knowing that. He's sovereign, but he's just. And so let the Lord handle that.\"",

      "Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Friday unveiled a new statewide fraud prevention program in the state's latest effort to crack down in the wake of the Feeding Our Future scandal\u00a0\u2014 a scheme that siphoned away $250 million in taxpayer funds meant for hungry children.",
      "Walz, the one-time Democratic running mate to former Vice President Kamala Harris, named Tim O'Malley as the new director of program integrity in a news conference on Friday morning.",
      "O'Malley is former FBI agent who previously led the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, appointed by Republican Gov. Tim Pawlenty. He had also served as a chief judge on the state's Court of Administrative Hearings, appointed by Walz, and has worked with the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis in an integrity-related capacity.",
      "\"[O'Malley] will work across state government to strengthen fraud protection and protect taxpayer dollars,\" Walz said. \"Tim made this clear yesterday as we were talking: he does not work for me, he works for the people of Minnesota as all of us do, and in fact he was so clear about that is he wanted to make sure that he rewrote the press release that went out to make sure that it reflects not a reality that we may craft, but the one that's truly there.\"",
      "O'Malley said the governor privately assured him he'd have \"the freedom and autonomy to act to do whatever is necessary to solve this.\"",
      "\"I'm not here to serve any individual, and I'm not here to serve a political party. I'm here to serve Minnesotans,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Walz said the fraud prevention program was built with help from an outside forensics company called WayPoint, led by forensic accountant and attorney Josiah Lamb.",
      "\"In our current capacity, we are working with the BCA to build out this anti-fraud toolkit, which will include policies and procedures specifically designed to address fraud risks, that can be utilized enterprise-wide to help prevent fraud in the future,\" Lamb said.",
      "The governor said the state's contract with the company is valued \"up to $200,000\" and \"will be spread across all the state agencies.\"",
      "Walz says he takes \"responsibility\" for fraud",
      "The Feeding Our Future scandal, the\u00a0nation's largest COVID fraud scheme, has garnered renewed focus from the Trump administration, prompting a surge of federal immigration enforcement activity in Minnesota and fueling the talking points of his Republican gubernatorial challengers.",
      "In response to Walz's announcement on Friday, candidate and current GOP state Rep. Kristen Robbins said the governor's fraud prevention program \"should be his resignation.\"",
      "Republican State Sen. Jordan Rasmusson said, in response to the announced program, a \"statewide director of program integrity isn't something you need when your commissioners are doing their jobs well in the first place.\" Resmusson added that Minnesotans \"expect their government to provide vigorous oversight of our welfare programs.\"",
      "On Friday, Walz said Minnesota's \"generosity\" was \"taken advantage of by an organized group of fraudsters and criminals,\" and he'll \"take responsibility\" for the failures that led to the massive COVID relief funding theft, admitting his office \"should have been keeping Minnesotans more up to speed on what was happening.\"",
      "\"We have and have just like in COVID, just like in every other situation, I take full responsibility for it. I think, and I will acknowledge certainly to Minnesotans and to the press here, I don't think we've done a good enough job of communicating the hard work has been done,\" Walz said.",
      "He also said the \"guardrails were taken off\" by the federal government during the pandemic and \"the guidance was to move the money.\"",
      "\"Our goal was to make sure we were moving that money so that people ate, that they were housed, that they had vaccines, but it also opened up the door to relax the guardrails and to have fraud be committed,\" he said.",
      "While taking blame for the fraud scandal, Walz also said his attempt in 2021 to freeze funding for a Feeding Our Future-related organization was thwarted by the courts.",
      "\"I said, 'Don't pay them,' and they said, 'You can't do that, you don't have that authority.' I said, 'Do not pay them, let them sue me.' They did and they won, and we paid them, and then they got caught and went to jail after the fact,\" Walz said.",
      "Walz also defended his COVID policies that critics branded as draconian, leading to multiple \u2014 and ultimately unsuccessful \u2014 lawsuits, including over\u00a0mask mandates.",
      "\"I will not apologize for making Minnesota one of the safest states during COVID,\" he said.",
      "In September,\u00a0Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson said alongside the Feeding Our Future case, fraud connected to the state's Housing Stabilization Services and autism services \"has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money.\"",
      "Walz recently announced new audits on up to 14 social programs in Minnesota that officials consider \"high risk\" for fraud. An official at the state Department of Human Services told WCCO the inspector general's office is currently reviewing more than 1,300 reported cases of fraud in those programs, and has recovered some $50 million.",
      "Walz: Trump's targeting of Somalis is \"racially motivated\"",
      "President Trump's recent focus on Somali-American Minnesotans, whom he labeled \"garbage,\" appears to be tied to the Feeding Our Future case.",
      "There are now upwards of 80 defendants in the case, many of whom are of Somali descent, though the group's founder and alleged mastermind, Aimee Bock, is White. So far, 61 people have been convicted, with more investigations underway.",
      "U.S. Census Bureau data show more than 107,000 people identified as Somali across Minnesota, with more than 80,000 living in the Twin Cities.",
      "Earlier this month, Mr. Trump called Minnesota a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity,\" with his administration now investigating whether stolen funds were funneled to the Somali-based al Qaeda affiliate Al Shabaab.",
      "And in recent weeks, the Department of Homeland Security has sent dozens of federal agents to Minnesota, specifically the Twin Cities, as part of \"Operation Metro Surge.\" Mr. Trump also previously ordered all green card holders from Somalia and more than a dozen other countries be reexamined, adding that he would\u00a0end the temporary protected status\u00a0for Somalis in Minnesota.",
      "On Friday, Walz said the president's actions do \"nothing to either address immigration\" or \"fraud.\"",
      "\"The absolute recklessness of doing some of this and the targeting of a specific community, unconscionable,\" Walz said. \"It is very specifically aimed and very racially motivated towards a Somali community that matters greatly here.\"",
      "Walz also applauded comments made by GOP state Sen. Jim Abeler, who recently wrote a letter to Mr. Trump rebuking his statements about Minnesota's Somali community.",
      "\"I'd like to acknowledge that just the basic decency, not a surprise to everybody in here has been, but Sen. Jim Abeler's willingness to stand up, and note that it should be the simplest thing in the world,\" Walz said. \"When the president of the United States calls an entire group of people garbage and our state garbage and a hellhole, to just disavow that, you can still be very conservative.\"",
      "High-end cars, luxury vacations, overseas transfers",
      "Newly released evidence also gives the clearest look yet at how the Feeding Our Future fraudsters blew through hundreds of millions of dollars meant to feed Minnesota children during the pandemic.",
      "CBS News obtained dozens of trial exhibits, and they reveal luxury vacations, high-end cars and overseas transfers, all funded by taxpayer dollars meant to feed kids in need.",
      "Photos and documents show fraudsters booking over-water villas in the Maldives, buying gold jewelry in Dubai and sending stacks of cash overseas.",
      "Some defendants purchased lakefront property in Minnesota, first-class airline tickets and luxury cars.",
      "U.S. Attorney Daniel N. Rosen said it's more evidence that the main driver for the fraud was greed.",
      "\"Massive. Order of magnitude larger than just about any fraud that's ever been prosecuted in the United States,\" he said. \"What we can say from that enormous volume of evidence is that the predominant motive of all of these individuals was their self-enrichment and their self-indulgence. And that's where they spent the money overwhelmingly.\"",
      "There is also evidence of money going overseas, including to China.",

      "Washington \u2014 House Republican leaders unveiled a plan Friday to address health care costs ahead of a year-end lapse to tax credits that will result in skyrocketing premiums for more than 20 million Americans.",
      "But the plan does not include an extension to the Affordable Care Act subsidies. Instead, Republican leaders will allow a vote on an amendment to the plan that would include an extension to those expiring tax credits, according to a GOP leadership aide.",
      "The move is aimed at appeasing\u00a0moderate Republicans who are trying to force votes, through what is known as a discharge petition, on separate pieces of legislation to extend the tax credits for one to two years with reforms.",
      "An extension has split the party, with those opposed saying the subsidies are ripe with fraud and high-income households shouldn't qualify.",
      "Democrats have pushed a three-year extension without reforms \u2014 a nonstarter with Republicans.",
      "The Republican plan released Friday includes a provision to expand association health plans, in which multiple employers band together to purchase coverage and lower the costs of benefits. Another provision would provide funding for cost-sharing reduction payments meant to lower premiums for some Affordable Care Act enrollees. The proposal would also require more transparency from pharmacy benefit managers in an effort to lower drug costs.",
      "\"While Democrats demand that taxpayers write bigger checks to insurance companies to hide the cost of their failed law, House Republicans are tackling the real drivers of health care costs to provide affordable care, increase access and choice, and restore integrity to our nation's health care system for all Americans,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said in a statement.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 20:13:52 -0500",
    "summary": "The move represents a thawing of sorts in the frosty relationship between the Trump administration and the Brazilian government.",
    "story": [
      "The United States removed Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes from its sanctions list on Friday after initially adding him over his role in leading the trial against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "De Moraes' wife and the Lex Institute, which she leads, were also taken off the list, according to documents from the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control. Brazil's government celebrated the move, which came after a weekend phone conversation between President Trump and Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The Trump administration had sanctioned the judge in July, accusing him of using his position to authorize arbitrary pretrial detentions and suppress freedom of expression in Brazil.",
      "In August 2024, de Moraes also ordered that Elon Musk's X platform be suspended in Brazil over allegations it was not doing enough to target misinformation. The ban on the site was lifted two months later. At the time, Musk was a major ally of Mr. Trump and was helping finance his presidential campaign.",
      "A senior Trump administration official said the sanctions were lifted since the U.S. saw the passage of an important amnesty bill by Brazil's lower house as a signal that lawfare conditions in Brazil are improving. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the administration's views on foreign policy interests.",
      "The move represents a thawing of sorts in the frosty relationship between the two governments and follows a number of meetings and calls that both have described in positive terms. Mr. Trump had seen Lula's predecessor Bolsonaro as an ally, with the Brazilian leader even dubbed the \"Trump of the Tropics\" when he came into office.",
      "During Bolsonaro's trial, Mr. Trump called his treatment an \"international disgrace.\" In a\u00a0July 9 letter\u00a0to Lula posted to social media, Mr. Trump said the trial was a \"witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "And in announcing de Moraes' sanction in July, Secretary of State Marco Rubio alleged that the judge had \"abused his authority by engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics through the issuance of secret orders compelling online platforms, including U.S. social media companies, to ban the accounts of individuals for posting protected speech. Moraes further abused his position to authorize unjust pre-trial detentions and undermine freedom of expression.\"",
      "Bolsonaro was accused of masterminding a plot to stay in power despite his 2022 election defeat to Lula.",
      "He was convicted and sentenced to more than 27 years in prison. The embattled 70-year-old leader started serving his sentence last month while still requesting to be put on house arrest due to his poor health. The massive upheaval his allies expected upon his arrest did not materialize, though he remains a politically powerful figure ahead of next year's elections.",
      "Brazil's current government characterized the lifting of sanctions as a \"big defeat\" for Bolsonaro's family.",
      "\"It was Lula who put this repeal [of the sanctions] on Donald Trump's desk, in a dignifying and sovereign dialogue,\" said Gleisi Hoffmann, Brazil's minister for institutional relations. \"It is a big defeat for the family of Jair Bolsonaro, traitors who have conspired against Brazil and the judiciary.\"",
      "Lula's leftist administration has long accused Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker and son of the former president, of misleading Mr. Trump on de Moraes and other members of the court. Eduardo Bolsonaro said he received the news of the sanctions being lifted from de Moraes \"with regret.\"",
      "The younger Bolsonaro, who announced in March that he would start living in the U.S. in order to lobby the Trump administration to help his father avoid jail, said he would continue to fight for Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "\"The lack of internal cohesion and the insufficient support for initiatives pursued abroad contributed to the worsening of the current situation,\" Eduardo Bolsonaro wrote on his social media channels, after Mr. Trump's reversal. \"We sincerely hope that President Donald Trump's decision will be successful in defending the strategic interests of the American people, as is his duty.\"",
      "In initially sanctioning de Moraes, the Treasury Department had cited the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets perpetrators of human rights abuse and corrupt officials. De Moraes said the use of the act against him was \"illegal and regrettable.\"",
      "Also in July, the Trump administration imposed a 40% tariff on Brazilian products on top of a 10% tariff imposed earlier, justifying the tariffs by saying that Brazil's policies and criminal prosecution of Bolsonaro constituted an economic emergency.",
      "However, last month the White House announced it was removing the 40% tariffs on certain Brazilian imports, including beef and coffee. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus last year with Brazil, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Mr. Trump and Lula started mending fences at the United Nations' General Assembly in September, which was followed by their first private meeting in Malaysia in October and subsequent phone conversations.",
      "The Brazilian president has said he wasn't only trying to reverse the increase on tariffs but also to end the sanctions on de Moraes and some members of his government who were also hit by the measure.",
      "Separately, Lula has urged Latin American states to help avoid a conflict in Venezuela as the Trump administration orders military action against vessels allegedly linked to drug cartels.",

      "The Democrats said they are \"reviewing the full set of photos and will continue to release photos to the public in the days and weeks ahead.\" Republicans on the committee and the White House accused the Democratic lawmakers of \"cherry-picking\" the photos to \"create a false narrative\" about the president.",
      "The release comes one week before a deadline for the Trump administration to release the Epstein files it has in its possession under a new law passed in November."

      "The legislation the president signed Friday awarded all of the players with Congressional Gold Medals to recognize the 45th anniversary of the U.S. victory at the 1980 Winter Olympic Games, with the former players standing behind the president in cowboy hats. The bill\u00a0passed the House and Senate\u00a0in September.",
      "\"We're delighted to be joined today by true legends of American sports history, heroes for the entire nation, the 1980 U.S. Olympic ice hockey team,\" the president said after signing the bill. \"This was one of the biggest moments that I've ever seen in sports, and I like sports. These are the men who gave us one of the most storied athletic wins of all time, it's called the miracle on ice, and I guess that's what it was.\"",
      "The event in the Oval Office featured hockey stars from the gold medal-winning team, including captain Mike Eruzione, goaltender Jim Craig and forward Buzz Schneider. The family of deceased coach Herb Brooks also attended. CBS News was first to report that the 1980 team would be present for the signing. The players gave the president a hat similar to the ones they wore ahead of the 1980 game.",
      "\"President Trump will honor the legendary Olympic men's ice hockey team whose 'Miracle on Ice' resulted in a historic and symbolic victory against the Soviet Union,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said ahead of the signing. \"This triumph fueled a resurgence of national pride as Americans across the country watched Team USA unexpectedly take home the Gold Medal.\"",
      "The 1980 game \u2014 held in Lake Placid, New York \u2014 pitted the U.S. against the Soviet Union, a Cold War archrival and hockey powerhouse that had won gold in the prior four Winter Olympics.",
      "\"The Soviets had not lost an Olympic game since 1968, and they were coming off a four-straight gold record, gold medals,\" the president said Friday.",
      "Team USA, partly made up of former collegiate players,\u00a0upset the Soviet Union in a come-from-behind 4-3 victory that was immortalized by broadcaster Al Michaels' exclamation: \"Do you believe in miracles? Yes!\" The American squad went on to defeat Finland in the gold medal-clinching game two days later.",
      "The bid to recognize the game's anniversary with congressional medals picked up bipartisan support, including from lawmakers in Minnesota, the home state of many of the players.",
      "\"The 'Miracle on Ice' hockey game was an upset that nobody saw coming \u2013 but one that showcases the strength and resilience of Americans in the face of adversity,\" Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota said in a September statement.",

This cannot be compared to other cases, like countries in the Middle East.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson has had a bruising month, with Republicans repeatedly defying his leadership amid growing frustration over how he's led the fractious majority.",
      "Fresh off a defeat over a long-stalled bill to compel the Trump administration to release materials related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, the Louisiana Republican has struggled with his disgruntled conference as they continue to try to maneuver around his authority.",
      "The discharge petition has become the weapon of choice for rank-and-file Republicans who are frustrated with Johnson's inaction on their priorities. The procedural tactic allows members to go around leadership and trigger a floor vote if it can get majority support.",
      "Their latest success came Thursday when a Democratic bill to overturn President Trump's executive order that stripped collective bargaining rights from some federal workers passed the House with the support of nearly two dozen Republicans. A handful of moderate Republicans helped propel it to a floor vote by signing onto a Democratic-led discharge petition.",
      "Johnson is also facing pressure from moderate Republicans to hold a vote next week on extending the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits that expire at the end of the year. As a last-ditch effort, Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania introduced a discharge petition Wednesday to try to force a vote on a bipartisan measure that would extend the subsidies by two years with reforms. As of Friday, it had the support of 11 Republicans.",
      "Eleven Republicans have also signed on to a separate discharge petition from Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, whose bipartisan measure would extend the tax credits for one year and includes reforms.",
      "\"What you're seeing here is rank-and-file members of the House kind of leading the charge on this. It shouldn't take that, but we're happy to take up the mantle,\" Fitzpatrick, who has also signed onto Gottheimer's petition, told reporters Thursday.",
      "Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley of California, who was critical of the speaker's decision to keep the House out of session during the 43-day shutdown, indicated Thursday that he views Johnson's leadership as ineffective.",
      "\"I do think the fact that we're now up against this deadline without a clear path forward, and with all of the action coming from really a group of us members on both sides trying to come together and form a compromise \u2014 that's not the kind of leadership I'd like to see,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Kiley later told reporters that the discharge petitions are a sign from members \"that there has been less than the desired level of leadership when it comes to important policy issues facing the country.\" He has signed both petitions on health insurance.",
      "Johnson has been meeting with leaders of several factions of the conference this week to try to put together a plan to be voted on next week. Johnson said Friday's meeting with the so-called \"five families\" was \"very productive\" and it will be a \"great piece of legislation\" that he expected everyone to unite around.",
      "Last week, Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida followed through on her monthslong threat to try to force a vote on a bill backed by lawmakers across the political spectrum that would ban members of Congress from trading individual stocks. Johnson has doubted that it will reach the 218-signature threshold and on Wednesday denied making any deal with Luna to bring a version of the bill to the floor to get her to flip her opposition on a procedural vote on an unrelated defense policy bill.",
      "GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, a member of Johnson's leadership team, lashed out at the speaker over a provision she accused him of blocking, and threatened to withhold her support from the annual must-pass defense policy bill. Johnson claimed Stefanik did not know what she was talking about. Stefanik's provision that would require the FBI to notify Congress when it opens counterintelligence investigations into candidates running for federal office ultimately made it into the legislation.",
      "On Thursday, MS Now reported that GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is vacating her seat a year early after a bitter falling out with Mr. Trump, is gauging whether there's enough support to oust Johnson as speaker, though she said it was \"not true.\"",
      "At least nine Republicans are needed to trigger such a vote, but even with the discontent, there currently does not appear to be the appetite to remove him.",
      "Still, Stefanik told the Wall Street Journal last week that Johnson \"certainly wouldn't have the votes to be speaker if there was a roll-call vote tomorrow.\"",
      "When asked Thursday by CBS News whether he would prefer to see someone else in the role, Kiley noted that speakers typically serve a two-year term.",
      "\"Obviously, last term was an exception,\" he said, referring to the historic ouster of Kevin McCarthy, a Republican who represented California. \"But, come a year from now, who knows what the world will look like? So we'll take that up at the time.\"",
      "Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican, asserted in a New York Times opinion piece that \"Nancy Pelosi was a more effective House speaker than any Republican this century.\"",
      "\"Speaker Mike Johnson is better than his predecessor. But the frustrations of being a rank-and-file House member are compounded as certain individuals or groups remain marginalized within the party, getting little say,\" she wrote.",
      "Johnson told reporters last week he was \"not worried\" about his standing in the conference \"at all.\"",
      "\"There's 220 or so people in this conference, and lots of different opinions. Everybody's not delighted with every decision every day. But that's Congress. That's the way the system works,\" he said.",
      "Asked for comment on this story, Johnson's office pointed to his previous statements.",
      "Aaron Cutler, who once worked for former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, another politician who was ousted by conservative opposition, pushed back on the notion that Johnson is losing control.",
      "\"He lets members vent. He doesn't try to control public debate. He doesn't try to control his members,\" the Hogan Lovells lobbyist told CBS News. \"If it takes a little bit longer because members need to vent or they need to take another step or two, then that's what's going to happen.\"",
      "At an event for members of Congress at the White House on Thursday night, Mr. Trump praised Johnson's leadership.",

    "story": [
      "Doral, Florida \u2014 The admiral overseeing U.S. military forces in South America relinquished command Friday, as the U.S. continues its buildup of ships and military assets off Venezuela and carries out strikes against alleged drug boats.",
      "\"We have worked hard and tirelessly to build relationships and understand requirements across the region,\" Adm. Alvin Holsey said during a relinquishment of command ceremony at U.S. Southern Command Headquarters on Friday. \"That work must continue across the whole government to deliver at the point of need to respond to shared threats in our neighborhood \u2014 the time is now.\"",
      "Holsey, who has served in the Navy for 37 years, stepped down as the head of U.S. Southern Command after announcing in October he'd retire early, just one year into what is typically a three-year term leading a combatant command. He gave no reason, but at the time, CBS News reported there had been tensions between Holsey and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over deployment decisions in the Caribbean.",
      "During Friday's ceremony, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine awarded Holsey the Defense Distinguished Service Medal with a citation signed by Secretary Hegseth.",
      "In remarks, Caine thanked Holsey and his whole family, saying, \"know how deeply, deeply grateful we are as a nation and as a joint force for all you've done for us.\"",
      "Holsey transferred his duties to Air Force Lt. Gen. Evan Lamar Pettus in the ceremony. Pettus will serve as acting commander of U.S. Southern Command until the Pentagon sends a nomination to the Senate to be confirmed.",
      "U.S. Southern Command has been leading the ongoing strike campaign named \"Operation Southern Spear\" that has destroyed 23 alleged drug boats with military strikes, killing 87 people.",
      "The campaign has come under increased scrutiny from lawmakers because of a controversial \"double tap\" strike on Sept. 2 that killed two survivors. The commander who ordered the second strike, Admiral Mitch Bradley of U.S. Special Operations Command, has conducted several briefings in the past two weeks with small groups of lawmakers to walk through his decision. He briefed House Speaker Mike Johnson Thursday, and the House speaker said after the briefing and a review of the strike video said the operation was conducted in a way that was \"entirely appropriate.\"",
      "Earlier this week, Holsey gave a virtual briefing to the chair and ranking member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee before officially transferring his duties on Friday. Ranking Member Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island told CBS News Holsey said it was a personal decision to retire early, and even after the briefing, Reed said that \"we have still, I think, many more questions.\"",
      "It's not just the boat strikes that have piqued Congress' interest. Lawmakers also have questions about why there is an expanding military buildup in the region. The U.S. now has about 15,000 forces in the Caribbean between warships, including the world's largest aircraft carrier the USS Gerald R. Ford, and on bases in Puerto Rico. It's the largest U.S. military presence there in decades.",
      "The buildup appears to be part of the Trump administration's ongoing pressure campaign against Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro. Earlier this week with the support of the military, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela. President Trump has intimated that strikes inside Venezuela could be next.",
      "Holsey assumed leadership of U.S. Southern Command in November 2024. During his tenure, the command expanded from roughly 3,500 personnel to nearly 15,000 personnel in direct support of operations in the region, according to a release from U.S. Southern Command that honors Holsey's career.",
      "In the last fiscal year, which ended in September, the command disrupted or seized more than a million pounds of cocaine, worth more than $11.34 billion. The release makes no specific mention of Operation Southern Spear.",
      "Holsey is the latest of over a dozen senior military officers who have either been fired by Hegseth or who retired early since the beginning of the Trump administration.",
      "Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 12:46:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A ruling striking down emergency levies could force the federal government to return most of the tariff revenue it has collected this year, according to Penn Wharton.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government could owe businesses as much as $168 billion if the Supreme Court rules that the Trump administration improperly invoked a federal emergency powers law earlier this year in hitting dozens of countries with new tariffs, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Through December 5, the U.S. government has collected $259 billion in tariff revenue, the nonpartisan research initiative found. But a ruling by the high court that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the country-specific tariffs could force the government to offer refunds to importers, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "In a November hearing on the case,\u00a0the Supreme Court seemed divided\u00a0over whether Mr. Trump had the legal authority to impose sweeping levies under IEEPA. Several justices appeared skeptical, noting that IEEPA does not mention the word \"tariff\" and that no president has ever relied on the act to justify broad-based tariffs on other nations.",
      "The Trump administration could likely maintain similar\u00a0tariff rates by drawing on other laws\u00a0if the IEEPA tariffs are struck down, although those statutes have more restrictions, according to legal experts.",
      "For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also authorizes the president to apply country-based tariffs if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another nation is engaging in unfair trade practices.",
      "Despite the prospects of a large government refund for importers, Smetters thinks that striking down the tariffs would ultimately spur U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Tariffs are one of the least efficient ways of raising revenue,\" he told CBS News, adding that tariffs make companies less productive because they have to pay more for imported parts and products.",
      "\"The government would have to come up with that money, so the federal debt would go up a little bit. But if these tariffs really were to go away, it would make U.S. companies more attractive to invest in,\" Smetters added.",
      "The Trump administration says tariffs are a key tool for energizing the U.S. manufacturing sector, boosting job growth, reducing the nation's trade deficit and generating federal revenue.",
      "\"The economic and national security consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court's speedy and proper resolution of this matter,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Too little, too late?",
      "As of November 17, the overall effective tariff rate in the U.S. was 16.8%, the highest since 1935,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Yale Budget Lab. That compares with 2.4% in January before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "As a result, some small businesses say a tariff refund wouldn't offset the damage they say has been caused by sharply higher import duties.",
      "\"The money would go back to suppliers that incurred the tariffs. We are the end customer, and we continue to get the short end of the stick,\" Trinita Rhodes, the owner of Beauty Supply Refresh in Florissant, Missouri, said Wednesday in a media call hosted by Tariffs Cost US, an advocacy group that opposes Mr. Trump's levies.",
      "Rachel Lutz, owner of a women's clothing boutique, The Peacock Room, in Detroit, said a potential tariff refund would come too late.",
      "\"Small businesses don't have more than a 30-day cash reserve,\" he said in the Tariffs Cost US call. \"Reimbursement at this point doesn't make up for the disruption of staff cuts or hiring we could have made. The damage has already been done.\"",
      "Consumers are also feeling the impact of tariffs, research shows. Between February and November, U.S. households paid an average of $1,197.50 in tariffs, totaling nearly $160 billion, according to a\u00a0report this month from Democrats on the U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee.",
      "\"While President Trump promised that he would lower costs, this report shows that his tariffs have done nothing but drive prices even higher for families,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire and ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement Thursday. \"At a time when both parties should be working together to lower costs, the President's tax on American families is simply making things more expensive.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The National Trust for Historic Preservation in the U.S. has filed the first major lawsuit against President Trump and his administration in an effort to block construction of his planned ballroom on the grounds of the White House.",
      "The nonprofit, with a stated mission of stewarding and revitalizing historic sites, argued in a complaint filed in federal court in Washington on Friday that no president is allowed to tear down parts of the White House \"without any review whatsoever,\" or construct a ballroom on public property \"without giving the public an opportunity to weigh in.\" The Washington Post was first to report the lawsuit.",
      "\"No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever \u2014 not President Trump, not President Biden, not anyone else,\" the complaint said. \"And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in. President Trump's efforts to do so should be immediately halted, and work on the ballroom project should be paused until the defendants complete the required reviews \u2014 reviews that should have taken place before the defendants demolished the East Wing, and before they began construction of the ballroom \u2014 and secure the necessary approvals.\"",
      "The Trust is represented by Greg Craig, a former White House attorney for Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Defendants in the suit include the president, the National Park Service, the Department of the Interior, the General Services Administration and their respective leaders.",
      "Mr. Trump initially said the project wouldn't interfere with the current building and would be \"near it but not touching it.\" But much of the East Wing was demolished to be renovated and make way for the project, which the White House has said will be funded by private donors.",
      "The White House argued this fall that it didn't need approval to demolish the East Wing, arguing that doing so is distinct from new construction. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in October that the president doesn't need approval for demolition \u2014 only for \"vertical construction\" \u2014 citing a previous legal opinion from the National Capital Planning Commission.",
      "\"President Trump has full legal authority to modernize, renovate, and beautify the White House \u2014 just like all of his predecessors did,\" White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement Friday.",
      "The National Trust for Historic Preservation said it wrote to the National Park Service, the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts in October, urging \"the cessation of demolition and the initiation of the review of procedures for the plans for the ballroom project,\" but received no response. The nonprofit says the defendants were supposed to submit those plans to the National Capital Planning Commission, the Commission of Fine Arts and Congress prior to demolition and construction.",
      "\"Yet it appears the site preparation and preliminary construction of the proposed new ballroom is proceeding without any review by either commission or by Congress, and without the necessary approvals,\" the suit continues. \"By evading this required review, the defendants are depriving the public of its right to be informed and its opportunity to comment on the defendants' proposed plans for the ballroom project.\"",

      "President Trump said Thursday evening he is granting a pardon to Tina Peters, a former Colorado county clerk who is serving a nine-year state sentence\u00a0for allowing unauthorized access to voting machines \u2014 even though the president's pardon power is widely understood to only apply to federal crimes.",
      "\"Democrats have been relentless in their targeting of TINA PETERS, a Patriot who simply wanted to make sure that our Elections were Fair and Honest,\" the president claimed on Truth Social, though Peters was prosecuted by an elected Republican district attorney. \"Tina is sitting in a Colorado prison for the 'crime' of demanding Honest Elections.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed Peters was trying to \"expose Voter Fraud\" in 2020. The president has long insisted, without evidence, that he lost the 2020 race due to fraud, claims that were promoted by Peters, a onetime candidate for Colorado secretary of state.",
      "Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said in a statement Thursday that \"Tina Peters was convicted by a jury of her peers for state crimes in a state Court. Trump has no constitutional authority to pardon her. His assault is not just on our democracy, but on states' rights and the American constitution.\"",
      "\"One of the most basic principles of our constitution is that states have independent sovereignty and manage our own criminal justice systems without interference from the federal government,\" Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said in a separate statement. \"The idea that a president could pardon someone tried and convicted in state court has no precedent in American law, would be an outrageous departure from what our constitution requires, and will not hold up.\"",
      "A former Mesa County clerk, Peters was convicted in state court last year on seven charges, including three counts of attempting to influence a public servant and one count of conspiracy to commit criminal impersonation. She was sentenced\u00a0in October 2024.",
      "Prosecutors have alleged that in 2021, Peters and others \"devised and executed a deceptive scheme\" to cause an unauthorized person to access Mesa County voting machines. Images from the county's voting equipment later showed up online. Prosecutors said that Peters \u2014 who was aligned with national figures who have falsely claimed that voting machines were rigged in 2020 \u2014 became \"fixated\" on alleged voting problems.",
      "At a sentencing hearing late last year, Judge Matthew Barrett called Peters a \"charlatan\" and \"as defiant as a defendant as this court has ever seen.\" Peters has denied wrongdoing, and she insisted before her sentencing that she had \"never done anything with malice to break the law.\"",
      "Earlier this week, a federal magistrate judge rejected Peters' request to be released while she appeals her conviction.",
      "\"Tina Peters was convicted by a jury of her peers, prosecuted by a Republican District Attorney and in a Republican county of Colorado and found guilty of violating Colorado state laws including criminal impersonation,\" Democratic Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement Thursday. \"No President has jurisdiction over state law nor the power to pardon a person for state convictions. This is a matter for the courts to decide, and we will abide by court orders.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has taken an interest in Peters' case, warning in August that he would take \"harsh measures\" if she wasn't let out of state custody. The Federal Bureau of Prisons asked the state of Colorado last month to transfer her to federal custody, drawing pushback from state officials and calls for Polis to deny the request.",
      "Meanwhile, an attorney representing Peters argued in a letter\u00a0last week that Mr. Trump may have the power to pardon the former Mesa County clerk.",
      "Under the Constitution, the president's pardon power applies to \"Offences against the United States,\" which is almost universally understood not to include state crimes. But Peters' lawyer, Peter Ticktin, laid out a theory that the power could extend to the states. Ticktin acknowledged that the issue \"has never been raised in any court.\"",
      "In a statement late Thursday, Ticktin thanked Mr. Trump and argued that Peters \"needs to be released while the issues are being resolved,\" including while courts weigh whether she should be released due to the president's pardon.",
      "\"I am greatly thankful for President Trump,\" Ticktin said in an email to CBS News. \"He has always been true to his beliefs and continues to fight against injustice. God bless our President.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican moderates in the House revolted against leadership on Wednesday as they seek to force a vote on expiring health insurance premium tax credits \u2014 an issue that could have major political ramifications for the party in next year's elections.",
      "Facing an end-of-year deadline, Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania introduced a discharge petition to try to bring a bill to the floor that would extend the Affordable Care Act subsidies by two years. A handful of GOP moderates quickly signed on.",
      "The move is the latest rebellion by rank-and-file Republicans to force votes on issues that leadership would rather avoid.",
      "The underlying proposal, spearheaded by Fitzpatrick, would extend the tax credits through 2027 and impose a cap on income for those who are eligible for the subsidies. The plan would also expand access to health savings accounts, while imposing a small monthly premium on the lowest-income beneficiaries to fight fraudulent enrollments.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters after Fitzpatrick filed the discharge petition that an extension does not have the support of the majority of the conference. An informal rule in the House, known as the Hastert rule, dictates that the speaker should only bring up legislation if it has the support of the majority of the party in power.",
      "\"I understand the concerns that they have. I'm very sympathetic to that. We have spent many, many hours trying to find a way out of the conundrum that we're in, with regard to those extensions,\" Johnson said. \"We just can't get Republican votes on that for lots of reasons, not enough of them.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick said last week that the plan was the \"best product we can put together\" and had feedback from the House, Senate and White House. A discharge petition, he said, was a last-ditch option.",
      "The procedural tactic requires 218 signatures to force a vote, and it's unclear if it can reach that threshold. It would need the support of most Democrats, who have been pushing a three-year extension without any reforms.",
      "Later Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey filed a competing discharge petition to try to force a vote on a separate bipartisan proposal that includes a one-year extension of the tax credits with income limits, followed by a second year with \"more significant reforms,\" including eliminating $0 premiums, with need-based exceptions.",
      "House GOP leaders vowed to unveil a path forward next week.

    "published": "Tue, 09 Dec 2025 07:31:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Paleontologists have discovered and documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
    "story": [
      "Legend once had it that the huge, three-toed footprints scattered across the central highlands of Bolivia came from supernaturally strong monsters - capable of sinking their claws even into solid stone.",
      "Then scientists came here in the 1960s and dispelled children's fears, determining that the strange footprints in fact belonged to gigantic, two-legged dinosaurs that stomped and splashed over 60 million years ago, in the ancient waterways of what is now Toro Toro, a village and popular national park in the Bolivian Andes.",
      "Now, a team of paleontologists, mostly from California's Loma Linda University, have discovered and meticulously documented 16,600 such footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex. Their study, based on six years of regular field visits and published last Wednesday in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS One, reports that this finding represents the highest number of theropod footprints recorded anywhere in the world.",
      "\"There's no place in the world where you have such a big abundance of (theropod) footprints,\" said Roberto Biaggi, a co-author of the study led by Spanish paleontologist Ra\u00fal Esperante. \"We have all these world records at this particular site.\"",
      "Prints record dinosaur behavior \u2014 including attempts to swim",
      "The dinosaurs that ruled the earth and roamed this region also made awkward attempts to swim here, according to the study, scratching at what was squishy lake-bottom sediment to leave another 1,378 traces.",
      "The longest swim trackway studied by the researchers measured over 130 meters in length. \"To date, it remains the longest exposed swim trackway in the world,\" the authors write in the study.",
      "They pressed their claws into the mud just before water levels rose and sealed their tracks, protecting them from centuries of erosion, scientists said.",
      "\"The preservation of many of the tracks is excellent,\" said Richard Butler, a paleontologist at the University of Birmingham who was not involved in the research. He said that, to his knowledge, the number of footprints and trackways found in Toro Toro had no precedent.",
      "\"This is a remarkable window into the lives and behaviors of dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous,\" Butler added, referring to the period around 66 million years ago at the end of which an asteroid impact abruptly extinguished all dinosaurs and 75% of living species along with them, according to scientists.",
      "Footprints face preservation threats",
      "Although they've survived for millions of years, human life has threatened these traces. For decades, farmers threshed corn and wheat on the footprint-covered plateaus. Nearby quarry workers didn't think much of the formations as they blasted rock layers for limestone. And just two years ago, researchers said, highway crews tunneling through hillsides nearly wiped out a major site of dinosaur tracks before the national park intervened.",
      "Such disturbances may have something to do with the area's striking absence of dinosaur bones, teeth and eggs, experts say. For all of the footprints and swim traces found across Bolivia's Toro Toro, there are virtually no skeletal remains of the sort that litter the peaks and valleys of Argentine Patagonia and Campanha in Brazil.",
      "But the lack of bones could have natural causes, too. The team said the quantity and pattern of tracks - and the fact they were all found in the same sediment layer - suggest that dinosaurs didn't settle in what is now Bolivia as much as trudge along an ancient coastal superhighway stretching from southern Peru into northwest Argentina.",
      "The range in footprint sizes indicated that giant creatures roughly 10 meters (33 feet) tall moved in a herd with tiny theropods the size of a chicken, 32 centimeters (1 foot) tall at the hip.",
      "In presenting a snapshot of everyday behavior footprints \"reveal what skeletons cannot,\" said Anthony Romilio, a paleontologist at the University of Queensland in Australia who also did not participate in the study. Just from footprints, researchers can tell when dinosaurs strolled or sped up, stopped or turned around.",
      "It's not clear why so many dinosaurs roamed the site",
      "But the reason they flocked in droves to this wind-swept plateau remains a mystery.",
      "\"It may have been that they were all regular visitors to a large, ancient, freshwater lake, frequenting its expansive muddy shoreline,\" offered Romilio.",
      "Biaggi suggested that they were \"running away from something or searching for somewhere to settle.\"",
      "What's certain is that research into this treasure trove of a dinosaur tracksite will continue.",
      "\"I suspect that this will keep going over the years and many more footprints will be found right there at the edges of what's already uncovered,\" Biaggi said.",
      "Recent dinosaur footprint discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "In March, scientists in England discover a 650 foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some 200 dinosaur footprints dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be biggest in the United Kingdom. \"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontologist from the University of Birmingham,\u00a0told BBC News. \"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "The exoplanet's low density has surprised and baffled scientists, NASA said. It may have an unusual composition from planets in Earth's solar system. It could also be surrounded by a thick atmosphere, which would not be expected on an exoplanet with these features. But the James Webb Space Telescope helped scientists gather data that showed that unlikely scenario might be the case.",
      "Researchers used the telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph to measure the exoplanet's dayside temperature. If the exoplanet has no atmosphere, scientists estimated its dayside temperature would be about 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit. But the spectrograph found TOI-561b's temperature closer to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit, far cooler than expected.",
      "Just determining the temperature of the exoplanet doesn't confirm if there is an atmosphere there, NASA said. The magma ocean could cause heat to circulate, or a thin layer of rock vapor could help cool the planet. But neither of those options is likely to account for the difference between the measured temperatures and what scientists expected.",
      "\"We really need a thick volatile-rich atmosphere to explain all the observations,\" said Anjali Piette, a researcher from England's University of Birmingham and a co-author of a study published Thursday that detailed the discoveries.",
      "Piette said an atmosphere would allow gases like water vapor to absorb some wavelengths of light, keeping the telescope's spectrograph from measuring them actually. The exoplanet may also have bright silicate clouds that can reflect starlight to cool the atmosphere, Piette said.",
      "Scientists suspect there may be some form of equilibrium between the exoplanet's atmosphere and its magma ocean, said study co-author Tim Lichtenberg, a researcher from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.",
      "\"At the same time that gases are coming out of the planet to feed the atmosphere, the magma ocean is sucking them back into the interior,\" Lichtenberg said. \"This planet must be much, much more volatile-rich than Earth to explain the observations. It's really like a wet lava ball.\"",
      "Scientists will learn more about TOI-561b as they study a data set gathered by the Webb telescope after it observed the exoplanet for more than 37 hours. The work will involve mapping the exoplanet's temperature and learning what its atmosphere may be made of.",
      "\"What's really exciting is that this new data set is opening up even more questions than it's answering,\" said Johanna Teske, the paper's lead author and a staff scientist at the Carnegie Science Earth and Planets Laboratory.",

      "A black hole inside a distant spiral galaxy is devouring material from the universe around it and creating winds at speeds never before seen by astronomers.",
      "The European Space Agency said that the black hole inside NGC 3783 has the mass of 30 million suns. The black hole consumes nearby material to power an active galactic nucleus at the center of the galaxy, the ESA said in a news release. The nucleus is \"an extremely bright and active region\" that sends out powerful jets and winds, the agency said.",

      "\"We've not watched a black hole create winds this speedily before,\" said Liyi Gu at Space Research Organisation Netherlands (SRON), in a statement. Gu led the international research team. \"For the first time, we've seen how a rapid burst of X-ray light from a black hole immediately triggers ultra-fast winds, with these winds forming in just a single day.\"",
      "Researcher Matteo Guainazzi said the winds around the black hole were created as the nucleus' tangled magnetic field suddenly untwisted, creating something similar to the coronal mass ejections that erupt from the sun \"but on a scale almost too big to imagine.\"",
      "The similarity between black holes and the sun makes \"these mysterious objects seem a little less alien,\" the ESA said. Project scientist Erik Kuulkers said the discovery \"suggests that solar and high-energy physics may work in surprisingly familiar ways throughout the universe.\"",
      "Winds from active galactic nuclei play a role in how the galaxies they are situated within develop, said ESA research fellow Camille Diez. Learning more about the nuclei and how they behave will lead to a better understanding of space, Diez said.",

      "With Soyuz commander Sergey Ryzhikov strapped into the descent module's center seat, flanked on his left by cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky and on the right by NASA's Jonny Kim, the Soyuz MS-27/73S spacecraft undocked from the lab at 8:41 p.m. ET.",
      "After moving a safe distance away to a precise point in space, the Soyuz braking rockets fired for four minutes and 42 seconds starting at 11:09 p.m., slowing the ship's 17,100-mph velocity by about 286 mph, just enough to drop the far side of the orbit into Earth's lower atmosphere.",
      "Enduring re-entry temperatures of some 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit -- and rapidly decelerating in the process -- the Soyuz descent module, suspended beneath a large orange-and-white parachute, landed at 12:03 a.m. EST Tuesday (0503 UTC, 10:03am local time in Kazakhstan) and tipped over on its side.",
      "Braving frigid sub-freezing weather, Russian recovery crews and NASA support personnel quickly reached the charred spacecraft, opening the Soyuz's hatch, extracting the crew and making initial medical checks as the trio began re-adjusting to gravity.",
      "Briefly resting in a nearby recliner as is traditional for returning  Soyuz crew members, Kim appeared healthy and in good spirits, smiling  his thanks after Russian recovery crews presented him with a nested  matryoshka doll with his face painted on the outermost shell.",
      "After  more detailed medical checks inside a heated inflatable tent, the crew was to be flown by helicopter to  the town of Dzhezkazgan where Kim planned to board a NASA jet for the long  flight home to the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Ryzhikov and  Zubritsky will head for Star City near Moscow for debriefings and  reunions with family members.",
      "Left behind aboard the space station were NASA Crew 11 fliers Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "Also on board: Soyuz MS-28/74S commander Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, flight engineer Sergei Mikaev and NASA astronaut Christopher Williams. They arrived at the space station on Nov. 27 to replace Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim.",
      "During a change-of-command ceremony on Sunday, Kim said what he will remember most from his eight months in space is \"the bond that we shared together.\"",
      "\"I firmly believe that the greatest quality of an astronaut, and a human, is not technical competence, or loyalty, or any of the myriad other things we like to ascribe to astronauts. It's love,\" he said. \"We always gave each other grace and had so much love for each other and everyone who supports us. I think that is what makes space exploration possible.\"",
      "During their stay aboard the space station, Kim and his crewmates traveled 104 million miles over 3,920 orbits. Kim focused on research and maintenance in the U.S. segment of the station while Ryzhikov and Zubritsky carried out two spacewalks.",
      "The son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, Kim has a resume that's impressive even by astronaut standards. He is a former Navy SEAL, combat veteran and a Harvard Medical School graduate.",
      "In a pre-launch interview, Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a SEAL team combat medic, Kim was accepted by Harvard's medical school. Along the way, \"I probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",

      "Previous Person of the Year title-holders have held varying roles in a vast range of occupations, with President Trump taking last year's cover and Taylor Swift capturing the one before. In 2025,",
      "Time's 2025 honorific was given to the minds and financiers behind AI's rise to renown and notoriety, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son and Baidu CEO Robin Li, who spoke directly with the magazine for its feature story.",
      "\"Person of the Year is a powerful way to focus the world's attention on the people that shape our lives,\" wrote Sam Jacobs, Time's editor-in-chief, in\u00a0an editorial piece\u00a0about the magazine's decision. \"And this year, no one had a greater impact than the individuals who imagined, designed, and built AI.\"",
      "Jacobs described 2025 as \"the year when artificial intelligence's full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back or opting out,\" adding: \"Whatever the question was, AI was the answer.\"",
      "The magazine prepared two separate covers for the issue. In one, artist Jason Seiler painted an interpretative recreation of the iconic 1932 photograph \"Lunch Atop a Skyscraper,\" an image that depicted workers seated side-by-side on a steel beam hanging high above New York City during the construction of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which became a symbol of American resilience during the Great Depression.",
      "A cast of tech industry characters at the forefront of AI development are perched on the beam in Seiler's recreation. Mark Zuckerberg, of Meta, Lisa Su, of Advanced Micro Devices,\u00a0Elon Musk, of xAI, Sam Altman, of Open AI, Demis Hassabis, of DeepMind Technologies, Dario Amodei, of Anthropic, and Fei-Fei Li, of Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, are all pictured, along with Huang.",
      "The second cover illustration, by artist Peter Crowther, places the same executives among scaffolding at what looks like a construction site for the giant letters \"AI.\"",
      "\"Every industry needs it, every company uses it, and every nation needs to build it,\" Huang said of balancing the pressures to implement AI responsibly and deploy it to the public as quickly as possible. \"This is the single most impactful technology of our time.\"",
      "Most of the industry figures pictured on Time's cover did not speak to the magazine for the story, so this year's spread mainly focuses on the implications \u2014 positive, negative and in between \u2014 of the companies they have built and the technology they continue forging.",
      "AI often took center stage in 2025 in investigative news reports, economic and academic studies, and in Washington, D.C., as policymakers grappled with how to regulate its evolution while tech giants scrambled to trump their competitors' inventions, as the use of some of them, like chatbots, grew to be commonplace, at times with tragic consequences.",
      "\"For these reasons, we recognize a force that has dominated the year's headlines, for better or for worse,\" Jacobs wrote in his editorial. \"For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the possible, the Architects of AI are TIME's 2025 Person of the Year.\"",

    "summary": "With the world's first social media ban\u200b for children and teenagers under 16 now in effect in Australia, its initial political architect reveals it was personally inspired by his wife, for their four children.",
    "story": [
      "With the world's first social media ban for teenagers under 16 now in effect in Australia, its initial political architect is celebrating a new less-digital era for millions of children \u2014 and sharing that the legislation was personally inspired by his wife, for their four children.",
      "\"She read a book called 'The Anxious Generation,' by Jonathan Haidt,\" said Peter Malinauskas, the premier of the state of South Australia. \"And I will never forget the night she finished reading the book and she put it down on her lap and she turned to me and said, 'You better do something about this!'\"",
      "Within seven months, and with strong public support, that idea fast became law across the land, winning support from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Ten major apps including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit and Facebook have complied to bar everyone 16 and under from their accounts and from setting up new accounts.",
      "\"Heaven forbid they might talk to one another a bit more, pick up the phone and have a chat rather than just being obsessed with the screen,\" said Maulinauskas.",
      "The ban puts the onus of responsibility on social media companies rather than parents with a penalty of up to $33 million if found to be in breach. It allows for each company to decide how best to adhere, which must be \"multi-layered,\" using more than one kind of identity verification, which could include traditional methods including national IDs and passports but also artificial intelligence \u2014 controversial over possible inaccuracies \u2014 to scan facial features for age.",
      "Malinauskas readily admits there will be growing pains.",
      "\"People will find ways around it and lots of things will go wrong, and that'll be highlighted in coming days and weeks in Australia,\" he said, \"but on balance, this is a reform that parents want so they can do their job more easily.\"",
      "He says officials from North America, Europe and Asia have been speaking with him about advancing similar legislation in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Malaysia is already on track to be the next country to ban those under 16 from social media in 2026.",
      "Yet in Australia, the law already faces a legal challenge. The country's High Court accepted a legal challenge from two 15-year-olds who assert the ban violates their freedom of communication. The case could be heard as early as February.",
      "Malinauskas blames those companies for putting all children through \"a global experiment\" over the past decade with \"social media addiction and overuse because many of these platforms have had addictive algorithms.\"",
      "\"I'm really proud, really proud that we've been able to see South Australia and then Australia lead a reform that's going to make a big difference to young people's lives,\" he said.",
      "\"And the reason why politicians are looking at it is because parents know something's not right. You know, there is no better judge of what's in the best interest of a child than a parent, right?\"",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 11:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "For thousands of parents in 39 countries, including the U.S., the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
    "story": [
      "Suffolk, England - For parents Daisy Greenwell and Joe Ryrie, freedom means looking up at the world around them instead of down at their phones, and they're determined to pass that sense of non-digital liberty on to their children.",
      "Their daughter started asking for a smartphone when she was just eight years old, because her classmates were getting them. The pressure to have a phone at such a young age surprised Greenwell, and pushed her to look more closely at the trend.",
      "She found a growing body of research suggesting that heavy smartphone use may negatively impact young people's mental health.",
      "The more she read, the more concerned she became, so Greenwell decided to take action. She posted a question on Instagram: What if we could switch the norm? What if parents united to create a \"smartphone-free childhood?\"",
      "The response was immediate.",
      "\"That post went viral,\" she told CBS News. \"Thousands of parents joined the group overnight.\"",
      "Within a couple weeks, Greenwell said there were smartphone-free childhood groups in every county in England. One year later, the grassroots campaign has expanded far beyond the U.K. borders.",
      "The group \u2014 Smartphone Free Childhood \u2014 now has chapters in 39 countries.",
      "For Greenwell, Ryrie and the thousands of families who've joined the movement, the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
      "In the U.S., the movement even inspired a cautionary viral advertisement, highlighting the dangers of giving children unrestricted access to the internet. A parent in the ad tells their child: \"There's a box in the corner with all the pornographic material ever made. I'm trusting you not to look in there, okay?\"",
      "The backlash against youth consumption of social media has drawn the attention of governments globally. On Wednesday, Australia became the first country in the world to enact a ban on social media accounts for children under the age of 16. The law compels huge tech companies such as Meta and TikTok to enforce age restrictions, or face hefty fines.",
      "In the U.K., national Culture Minister Lisa Nandy said the government would be keeping a \"close eye\" on Australia's social media ban, but added that there were no current plans to replicate the legislation.",
      "At a grassroots level, however, parents who join Greenwell and Ryrie's movement are asked to sign a pact: No smartphones for the kids before they turn 14, and no social media before 16.",
      "\"This isn't an anti-tech movement, it's a pro-childhood movement. We're not saying no smartphones ever. We're just saying children don't need unrestricted internet access in their pockets 24/7,\" Ryrie told CBS News.",
      "When asked what she'd tell busy working parents who rely on phones for convenience, Greenwell acknowledged the challenge.",
      "\"It's really tough,\" she said. \"But delaying the smartphone is free, it's simple, and it gives your child the best chance to thrive.\"",
      "Many families are turning to basic \"brick phones\" as alternatives \u2014 devices that allow calls and texts, but limit internet access. Sales of such \"dumb\" devices have risen 150% among 18-24 year olds in the United States, according to a study by the peer-reviewed journal Partners Universal Innovative Research Publication.",
      "Despite the momentum, Greenwell says there's still a cultural norm to disrupt, and available data highlights that point. One in four British kids between the ages of 5 and 7 already own a smartphone, according to the U.K.'s independent media regulator Ofcom.",
      "Greenwell said she believes real change can be driven from the community level.",
      "\"If children know several classmates are also delaying smartphones, the peer pressure dissolves,\" she told CBS News. \"It becomes easier for families to wait a few years. A brick phone in the meantime isn't that hard. We can do this.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 01:05:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Rod Metzer tried to gain sympathy from his ex-wife, Morgan Metzer, by pretending he had cancer, going as far as creating a diagnosis letter and a bill for his alleged treatment.",
    "story": [
      "In the early hours of New Year's Day 2021 in Canton, Georgia, Morgan Metzer was awakened to a terrifying sight. A man wearing a mask and all black clothing was standing at her bedroom doorway. The man ran and jumped on top of her. \"That's when he started pistol-whipping me,\" Morgan said. The assailant used zip ties to constrain her wrists before strangling her nearly unconscious twice.",
      "\"'You're gonna regret this, you've done really wrong now,'\" Morgan recalled the man told her in a deep and gravelly voice that he seemed to be trying to disguise. She said it sounded like Batman. Morgan Metzer's harrowing attack is the focus of this week's all-new \"48 Hours\" reported by contributor Nikki Battiste. An encore of \u00a0\"The 'Batman' Intruder\"\u00a0is\u00a0 now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Afterward, the attacker placed a pillowcase over her head and picked Morgan up and left her on the back porch, which was connected to the bedroom. He told her not to move until she heard two car honks or he'd kill her. Then all went quiet except the sound of the stream near her secluded home.",
      "Forty minutes passed, but then terror struck again. Morgan heard someone walking towards her and up the porch steps. Initially terrified her attacker had returned, she was surprised to hear a familiar voice.",
      "\"'Oh honey, what happened?'\" Morgan remembered her ex-husband, Rod Metzer, said when he found her.",
      "Rod called 911 and law enforcement showed up to the scene. Rod's rescue of his ex-wife appeared to be an act of heroism.",
      "Rod said he had been looking out for Morgan despite their divorce, which came after a nearly 20-year history together. They started dating when Morgan was 14 and Rod was 17 before marrying in their early 20s. The couple had twins, who were spending a few days with Morgan's sister in Florida when the attack occurred.",
      "Morgan said her decision to file for divorce came after years of what she described as mental and physical abuse from Rod. Rod moved out of Morgan's home into his own apartment and Morgan was ready to move on. Their divorce was finalized just weeks before the attack.",
      "However, this new start for Morgan was cut short. Earlier in the week, Morgan said Rod called her with shocking news that he had pancreatic cancer.",
      "\"And so I rushed to go see him,\" Morgan told Battiste. \"He showed me doctors' notes and whatnot.\" She allowed Rod to stay at her home to help him cope with his diagnosis. \"I needed to be supportive still because it's the father of my children.\"",
      "During this time, Morgan said Rod was constantly trying to get back together with her. But she had no interest and on the morning of New Year's Eve, she told Rod he needed to share his health news with his parents.",
      "\"He said, 'No, absolutely not. I'm not telling anybody.' And that's when I was like, 'OK, get out,'\" Morgan recalled. Morgan said Rod left, but still spent the day texting her about reconciling. Fed up, Morgan lied and told Rod she was going to sleep at her parents' home that New Year's Eve night.",
      "How Rod knew Morgan was at her home, along with the coincidental timing of his arrival after her attack, raised questions with investigators who spoke to Rod at the scene. Rod said he was planning on spending the night at his apartment. However, he told them he heard someone knock on his ground floor apartment window and say Morgan's name. After Rod tried calling Morgan with no answer, he decided to drive to her house to check on her. He told investigators that going to her house instead of her parents' was just out of habit.",
      "After interviewing both Morgan and Rod at the scene, investigators became suspicious of Rod's story. They ordered search warrants on Rod's apartment, car and electronic devices, uncovering his internet search history. The searches included, \"How to get sympathy from your ex\" and \"How to change the sound of your voice.\" One search also stood out to investigators: \"cancer letter from hospital.\"",
      "Investigators also discovered a fake email account created by Rod, posing as a doctor, to send the cancer diagnosis letter that he showed Morgan. But there was even more.",
      "\"He had created a bill for a doctor's office to show that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer,\" said Rachel Ashe, the deputy chief assistant district attorney for Cherokee County. She said Rod \"did all of this in order to convince Morgan that he had pancreatic cancer.\" He never did.",
      "Rod Metzer eventually pleaded guilty to 14 counts relating to the attack on Morgan Metzer. He was sentenced to 70 years \u2014 25 in prison followed by an additional 45 years of probation.",

    "story": [
      "Charlie Kirk transformed the American right through his nonprofit Turning Point USA before he was assassinated at an on-campus event in Utah three months ago. This week, his widow Erika, who now leads Turning Point, joined CBS News for a town hall where she reflected on grief, defended her husband's controversial comments and explained the \"game-time decision\" of publicly forgiving the man accused in her husband's murder.",
      "The conversation, moderated by CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, is the first of many planned CBS News town halls and debates. Invited guests who joined the conversation included Utah Valley University student Hunter Kozak, who was the last person to speak to Charlie Kirk, and Robert Milgrim, the father of Israeli Embassy staffer Sarah Milgrim, who was shot and killed in May.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "Erika Kirk's message to people who sought to justify assassination: \"Tell that to my 3-year-old daughter\"",
      "Erika Kirk said anyone who sought to justify her husband's assassination is \"sick\" and said the internet has dehumanized people.",
      "\"He's a human being. You think he deserved that? Tell that to my 3-year-old daughter.\"",
      "She continued: \"You want to watch in high-res the video of my husband being murdered, and laugh, and say he deserves it? There's something very sick in your soul, and I'm praying that God saves you.\"",
      "Erika Kirk: Charlie never incited violence",
      "Charlie Kirk was known for his debates with college students, inviting them to step up to a microphone and \"prove me wrong.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said her husband encouraged people of different political beliefs and backgrounds to come to the front of the line, saying, \"'I'll put my mic down. Tell me why you believe that. That's interesting. I never thought of that. But have you thought of this?'\"",
      "A recent poll by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and College Pulse found that 91% of undergraduates believe \"words can be violence.\" But Erika Kirk said her husband never incited violence: \"He never once said, 'Go after them because they're saying X, Y, Z and they deserve to die.'He gave them a microphone. He didn't take away a moment for them to speak back. He gave them a microphone. And what'd they do? They gave him a bullet in the neck. Totally different.\"",
      "She says her husband believed having conversations could save the world, referencing his new book, \"Stop, in the Name of God: Why Honoring the Sabbath Will Transform Your Life,\" which emphasizes that you can't communicate effectively with someone if you're not at peace with yourself.",
      "Erika Kirk: Charlie shouldn't be \"deteriorated\" to \"out-of-context\" clips",
      "Erika Kirk says some of her late husband's controversial comments, shared widely in the wake of his assassination, lacked context and that he should not \"be deteriorated\" to a few sentences.",
      "Weiss asked Erika Kirk about some of those much-shared comments: that some gun deaths are \"worth it\" to protect the Second Amendment; that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a mistake; and that if he sees a Black pilot, he's \"going to be like, boy, I hope he's qualified,\" while acknowledging \"that's not who I am, that's not what I believe.\"",
      "Erika Kirk said she'd love for people to watch the full clips instead of taking comments out of context.",
      "\"Charlie didn't care what skin color you were. He didn't care what religion you were. He loved excellence,\" she said, adding that \"his favorite word was 'earn'\u2026 He loved knowing that people worked hard to earn what they got.\"",
      "She said she didn't know the context of the \"gun deaths\" quote but said, \"There's a lot more there than just that one little sentence.\"",
      "\"My husband is not to be deteriorated to two sentences,\" she said. \"He's not. He is a thought leader, and he was brilliant of a man. So that's fine if you want to take words out of his mouth or out of context without the whole thing in perspective, but that's the problem.\"",
      "The last student to talk to Charlie Kirk asks: Will you condemn President Trump's rhetoric?",
      "Kozak was the last person to debate Charlie Kirk before he was shot. Since that day, Kozak \u2014 a self-professed liberal \u2014 has continued to call for civil political discourse. \"I think that one of the few things that we can agree on is this necessity for a conversation. I think that we need to remember that we still have to live with each other. That these are still our neighbors,\" he told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley after the shooting.",
      "He attended the CBS News town hall, where he again took the microphone \u2014 this time, to ask Erika Kirk a question: \"Will you condemn the violent rhetoric of Donald Trump, the most powerful and influential person on earth?\"",
      "Kozak specifically referenced President Trump accusing six Democratic lawmakers of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\" and then reposting, \"HANG THEM, GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!\" Top Democrats called for Mr. Trump to be \"condemned forcefully\" over the social media remarks.",
      "Erika Kirk didn't mention Mr. Trump by name in her response, saying the issue is \"so much deeper than one person\" and that it \"starts at the home.\"",
      "She urged parents to \"look in the mirror\" and reflect on how they're raising their children.",
      "\"You can choose to have evil in your heart or you can choose to have light,\" she said. \"What you consume and what you absorb from the outside world will manifest itself.\"",
      "Weiss asked: \"Do you think our political leaders have a responsibility to turn the temperature down right now?\"",
      "\"Well, I think everyone has a responsibility to do that, and I'm doing my part,\" Erika Kirk replied. \"I'm not in control of other people.\"",
      "Dad of Israeli Embassy staffer killed in shooting asks: Will you condemn antisemitism?",
      "Robert Milgrim, whose daughter Sarah was one of two victims of the Capitol Jewish Museum shooting in Washington, D.C., asked Erika Kirk: \"Will you here condemn the individuals spreading that hate and speak out clearly enough against antisemitism so we can prevent another tragedy?\"",
      "\"Hate is hate. It's evil,\" said Erika Kirk, adding that she and Charlie Kirk have always been \"very clear on our stance\" on Israel and the Jewish people.",
      "She said: \"What healing factor comes out of hating Jewish people? What healing factor comes out of hating Christians? What healing factor comes out? Hate in general. Nothing. Nothing. Charlie always would say very clearly, Jew hate was brain rot. He would always say it.\"",
      "Antisemitic incidents have increased nearly 900% in the U.S. over the past 10 years, according to a recent Anti-Defamation League audit.",
      "Erika Kirk's one-word message for Candace Owens",
      "Weiss asked Erika Kirk about Candace Owens, a former Turning Point USA employee and onetime friend of Charlie Kirk, who has recently been peddling conspiracy theories about his assassination. Owens has also made unfounded fraud allegations about the nonprofit \u2014 the Treasury Department last week confirmed that none of the tax-exempt entities Erika Kirk runs are under investigation by the IRS.",
      "What does Erika Kirk want to say to Owens and others making these unfounded claims?",
      "\"Stop. That's it. That's all I have to say. Stop.\"",
      "The \"game-time decision\" to forgive",
      "Erika Kirk stunned millions when she proclaimed at her husband's memorial service that she forgave her husband's accused killer.",
      "\"I forgive him because it's what Christ did and is what Charlie would do,\" she said in her powerful eulogy.",

      "At least two people were killed and nine more wounded in a shooting Saturday afternoon in a building on the campus of Brown University in Rhode Island, authorities said. The suspect has not been identified and is still at large.",
      "Authorities said that the shooting was reported in the Barus & Holley engineering building a little after 4 p.m. local time. The shooting occurred in a first-floor classroom, Providence Deputy Police Chief Tim O'Hara told reporters. The school said final exams were taking place in the building at the time of the shooting.",
      "Providence Mayor Brett Smiley   said in a news conference that eight of the wounded were taken to Rhode Island Hospital in critical condition. The hospital later said in a statement that six of those patients were in \"critical but stable condition,\" one was in critical condition, and another was in stable condition.",
      "In a follow-up news conference late Saturday night, Smiley said that a ninth victim suffered non-life-threatening injuries when they \"learned that they had received fragments from a shooting that had occurred near them.\" That victim did not sustain a gunshot wound and is expected to make a full recovery, Smiley said.",
      "Brown University President Christina H. Paxson told reporters in the second briefing that all the victims, those killed and wounded, were students.",
      "Smiley said that no arrests had been made, and a shelter-in-place was in place for the Brown University area. No weapons have been recovered, O'Hara said. A university alert told students to lock doors, silence phones and stay hidden until further notice.",
      "O'Hara told reporters the male suspect escaped from the engineering building following the shooting. It was unclear how he had entered the building, officials said, but Smiley noted that the outer doors of Barus & Holley were unlocked because the exams were taking place.",
      "\"In a building like that on a weekend, there are a lot of things going on,\" Brown Provost Francis Doyle said. \"Study sessions, student groups meeting, there are research labs in that building. So we don't have detailed knowledge of exactly what was happening, but we're working with law enforcement.\"",
      "Providence police, late Saturday night, released security video of a person believed to be the suspect leaving Barus & Holley. Smiley said that investigators do not yet know if the gunman was a student.",
      "In\u00a0the video, the suspect was wearing dark gray or black clothing and his face was not visible, O'Hara said during the second news conference. The video does not show a firearm. No weapon has been recovered.",
      "Video of person of interest in Brown shooting: pic.twitter.com/fjufQ3MTdC",
      "\"Some of the witnesses also told us that he may have been wearing a camouflage gray mask,\" O'Hara said, adding that investigators are unsure if there is video showing the suspect inside Barus & Holley.",
      "School public safety had initially reported that a suspect had been taken into custody before retracting that statement.",
      "\"There was an individual who was preliminary thought to be involved, but was later determined to have no involvement,\" Smiley said.",
      "Over 400 local and federal law enforcement officers were in the area assisting in the investigation, Smiley said.",
      "President Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that he had been briefed on the shooting.",
      "\"God bless the victims and the families of the victims!\" Mr. Trump said. The president also initially wrote that a suspect was in custody, but in a follow-up post, wrote, \"The Brown University Police reversed their previous statement \u2014 The suspect is NOT in custody.\"",

      "Natalie Morales: So there were gaps of time when he was not with Mark Lewis.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: Right. \u2026 That still does not change the fact that \u2026 the lack of evidence on her body does not show a second person involved in her death.",
      "Mark Lewis was not questioned during the reinvestigation.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He ... \u2026 exercised his constitutional right to have his attorney, who did not allow him to speak to us.",

And then in 2015, the county district attorney's office announced its own investigation, which included DNA testing on Joanna's bathrobe sash. The results? Her DNA was found on the sash along with an unknown male \u2014  not Mark Lewis.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was anything done to investigate that further, to \u2026 could it have been anybody else associated with Mark Lewis?",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That DNA that was collected from there, my understanding is that it was entered into the DNA \u2014 I believe it's called CODIS, the database.",

      "Dr. Bill Smock: What I've spent 40 years doing is analyzing injuries, reconstructing how injuries occur.",
      "And where the Solano County Sheriff's Department saw a bathrobe sash, a note and a suicide, Smock saw something else: something new.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: There was a braided nylon marine rope three feet from Joanna. \u2026 The murder weapon was there in the room with Joanna. \u2026 When you look at the photos of the mark that was created on her neck, the only thing in that closet that could have created that was the marine rope.",

    "summary": "Morgan Metzer survived a violent attack in her Canton, Georgia, home by an assailant she described as dressed in black and sounding like Batman. The only thing more surprising than the attack itself \u2014 was the suspect.",
    "story": [
      "When Morgan Metzer glimpsed a masked figure standing in her bedroom doorway shortly after midnight on New Year's Day 2021, she thought she might just be seeing things. But then \u2014",
      "Morgan Metzer: He's standing there like a soldier, like with his fist clenched and like he was ready to go. \u2026 He ran at me and jumped on top of me. And that's when he started pistol-whipping me.",
      "Just hours earlier, she'd been ready to ring in the new year in Canton, Georgia, with her best friend, Nichole Stabasefski.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: That's what we were looking forward to. \u2026 And I knew she was exhausted.",
      "It had been a long year for Morgan. Recently divorced, her 8-year-old twin son and daughter were spending a few days with her sister in Florida.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: I mean we're moms. \u2026 We just wanted to hang out for a second. \u2026 We had planned for it.",
      "But after arriving at Stabasefski's, Morgan, feeling tired, decided to make it an early evening.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: When she left, I did \u2014 I \u2014 I gave her some crap. I was like, \"what are you doing?\" \u2026 And I was like, \"You loser, fine, whatever. Text me when you get home, blah, blah, blah, see you tomorrow.\"",
      "A VIOLENT INTRUDER DRESSED IN BLACK",
      "Little could either friend have guessed that a short time later, Morgan would be in fear for her life. Her attacker had brought zip ties with him, already pre-looped and intertwined. He put Morgan's hands behind her back, slipped them on, and tightened them.",
      "Morgan Metzer: It's an out-of-body experience.",
      "Nikki Battiste: I can't imagine what you're thinking. What you're feeling.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Vulnerable, exposed. What's going to happen to my kids? \u2026 I haven't done a will. \u2026 I haven't talked to my family about who gets them. \u2026 I was like \u2026 \"they're not going to have a mom.\"",
      "Her assailant strangled her nearly unconscious twice.",
      "Morgan Metzer: It's the worst feeling in the world to think you're dying. And you feel like you're going to be tortured beforehand.",
      "Morgan's attacker sexually assaulted her.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Who did you think was attacking you?",
      "Morgan Metzer: I don't know. I just felt like it was some random person.",
      "In addition to the mask, the intruder had taken great pains to disguise himself.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Black \u2026 hoodie jacket. \u2026 Black pants, black gloves.",
      "He said very little, but when he did, Morgan says her assailant seemed to be disguising his voice \u2014 making it sound low and gravelly like the Batman movies. He also seemed to know about Morgan's personal life \u2014 specifically, her recent divorce.",
      "Nikki Battiste: He said something about your husband.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes. \"You're going to miss your husband.\" I said, \"No, don't hurt my husband.\"",
      "Morgan says her mind raced trying to piece together why this was happening to her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I swear, I like went through my whole life in my head. That's how my brain was \u2026 just everywhere. I mean, 50,000 tabs opened up at one time in my brain.",
      "Her attacker demanded to know where Morgan kept her valuables.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"Where's your jewelry? Where's,\" you know, \"all of your other nice stuff?\" And he is ripping out stuff out of my, you know, my drawers.",
      "And then \u2014",
      "Morgan Metzer: The attacker asked for my phone and the passcode to my phone.",
      "Morgan's house had an alarm system which she'd set before going to bed. An app on her phone controlled it, along with several security cameras around her home and a lock on the door of her second-floor bedroom which led out to a back porch.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I wasn't too sure what he was doing on my phone at the time until I heard a, uh, a door lock open, which was for the back porch.",
      "The attacker had unlocked the door remotely through that app on Morgan's phone. Morgan says he put a pillowcase over her head.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He got me out of the bed, walked me out to the back porch. I was naked \u2026 still with my zip tie handcuffs behind my back.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did he just leave you there?",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did he say as he left?",
      "Morgan Metzer: He said, \"do not get up until you hear two car honks or I'll kill you.\"",
      "Morgan's property was secluded, with little chance of a neighbor seeing or hearing her on the back porch. And with that pillowcase over her head and the attacker's final words of warning ringing in her ears, Morgan had no way of knowing if he \u2014 or someone else \u2014 was watching her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I just listened to the stream and tried to be as peaceful and calm as I could.",
      "Forty minutes passed. Then, a sound in the distance struck terror in Morgan all over again.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I hear somebody walking up.",
      "Unable to see, she feared her attacker had returned to finish the job.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I hear them shuffling, walking and they hit the stairs. \u2026 And I knew they were at the top when he hit the first board and it creaked really loud.",
      "That's when Morgan heard a very familiar voice.g",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"Oh honey, what happened?\"",
      "Morgan's grueling ordeal was finally over. And who would turn out to be her rescuer? Her ex-husband Rod Metzer.",
      "A HERO TO THE RESCUE?",
      "When Morgan's ex-husband Rod Metzer turned up at her house, he immediately called 911.",
      "911 DISPATCHER: Cherokee County 911.",
      "ROD METZER: Somebody \u2014 somebody broke in over here.",
      "ROD METZER: She was on the back porch. Uh, and \u2014 and the back door was wide open.",
      "ROD METZER: She was tied up with a hood over her head.",
      "As they waited for help to arrive, Rod tried to console Morgan. Their conversation heard on the 911 call.",
      "MORGAN METZER (911 call): Please don't leave, Rod.",
      "ROD METZER: I'm going to be right here.",
      "MORGAN METZER: Please.",
      "ROD METZER: I'm going to leave the door open, OK?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He came up and \u2014 and rescued her on the back porch.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Saved her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Saved her.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Her hero.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers:\u00a0Absolutely.",
      "Sergeant Dakota Lyvers was a detective with the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department in 2021. He had a lot of questions. Exactly why had Rod gone to Morgan's home in the middle of the night?",
      "Rod moved out of Morgan's home and into his own apartment shortly after the divorce, said Lyvers.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He was \u2026 getting ready for bed. He was brushing his teeth when he heard knocking on his window. Um, that knocking was accompanied by a voice in which he could only decipher the word \"Morgan\" was being said.",
      "Concerned, Rod said he tried calling Morgan, but she didn't answer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did he say he was thinking? I mean, someone knocks on his window in the early morning hours of New Year's Day.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He obviously went to the worst. Um, he thought that that something was, uh, gonna happen to Morgan or something might be happening to Morgan.",
      "Rod told investigators he'd gotten in his car and made the 12-minute drive over to his ex-wife's house. Despite being divorced, Rod said he was still looking out for Morgan. Their relationship stretched back nearly 20 years.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How old were you when you met Rod?",
      "Morgan Metzer: 14 years old.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Was it love at first sight?",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes, it was. It was \u2014 it was scary how fast it was.",
      "Kathy Metzer: He was 17 at that time.",
      "Kathy Metzer is Rod's mother.",
      "Kathy Metzer: We were on the way to a baseball game and he said, \"Mom, you're gonna meet Morgan tonight.\" And I said, \"Who's Morgan?\" \"That's my girlfriend.\" And I said, \"What?\" He said, \"Be nice.\" (laughs)",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did Rod change at all when he was dating Morgan?",
      "Kathy Metzer: Oh, yeah. \u2026 There was nothing that she could mention that she didn't get.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How did he treat you?",
      "Morgan Metzer:\u00a0 Amazing. \u2026 He called me \"princess.\" And so he literally treated me like that.",
      "No one was surprised when the couple married in 2009. Morgan was 21 years old.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Morgan was one of the most gorgeous brides I've ever seen in my life.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Weather was perfect. It was outside, so thank goodness for the weather.",
      "Morgan Metzer: It was everything I dreamed of. My dad gave me everything I could want, you know. \u2026 It was just precious.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What was marriage like in the very beginning?",
      "Morgan Metzer: It was just awesome. \u2026 It's just you two. \u2026 You're mourning the loss of your, like, wedding being over (laughs) and your honeymoon. And it's like, \"I wanna go again!\"",
      "Unfortunately, their newly wedded bliss would be short-lived. Eight months after the wedding, Rod's younger brother Kevin, who wished the couple \"endless years of love, health and happiness,\" at their wedding, lost his battle with leukemia at the age of 19.",
      "Kathy Metzer: It really hit Rod hard. I mean, it \u2014 I don't think he was ever the same after that. \u2026 He depended on Morgan at that point, more than he did anybody. I don't think he left her side for more than an hour or two.",
      "But the next year would bring some good news to celebrate.",
      "Morgan Metzer: We got pregnant with our son.",
      "Morgan says picking his name was easy.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Kevin always wanted to be an uncle. He always talked about it, how much fun he would have.",
      "Kathy Metzer: They named him Kevin after my Kevin, Rod's brother. (cries)",
      "But the family would suffer a second, and devastating, loss. Baby Kevin was born early, with a congenital heart defect. He lived just 18 days.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He actually died on his due date.",
      "Nikki Battiste: The loss of a child is unthinkable and I would imagine tough for you and Rod.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Very tough. \u2026 Don't really remember a lot of it. It's a big blur with all the emotions.",
      "So it seemed like a miracle when, just three months later, Morgan discovered she was pregnant again. Kathy remembers the moment Rod showed her the ultrasound picture.",
      "Kathy Metzer: He says, \"what do you see?\" I said, \"a baby.\" He said, \"No. Look, what do you see?\" And I just screamed at the top of my lungs, \"two babies,\" you know. (laughs)",
      "Nikki Battiste: Twins.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Twins. They were gonna have twins.",
      "Morgan gave birth to a healthy boy and girl in 2012. It should have been a happy time but not long after, the marriage began to change.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Probably about a year after they were born, which is right around the time that Rod lost his job, is when it started going down south from there.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did Rod do for work?",
      "Morgan Metzer: He, he had so many jobs. His main one, when he lost all of his money, was he was being a day trader for himself.",
      "Rod's job loss happened to come at the same time Morgan's career was starting to flourish.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I started my own interior design business and it took off. \u2026 I just didn't expect it to boom and blow up.",
      "Morgan's company, Shiplap and Sugar, became so successful she asked Stabasefski to join her.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: She was saying, you know, like \"I need help, I'm overwhelmed.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: So you became business partners?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: Yeah. \u2026 Making money. \u2026 Working our tails off, doing what we love.",
      "Morgan says her professional success, and Rod's lack of it, made for a dangerous combination. She says he began to abuse her \u2014 both physically and mentally. She recalls one Labor Day weekend. She and Rod were celebrating on a boat with friends and had just returned to their cabin.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I guess we had gotten into an argument about something, \u2026 that's the first night he beat the \u2014 he beat me.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did you think, he hit me. I've gotta get out of here?",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes. I had my dad come and get me.",
      "Shockingly, Morgan says Rod tried to convince her, and the people closest to her, that she was to blame for her injuries.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He convinced my parents that I was the one that did it.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did he say?",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You were just out of control. You \u2014 you \u2014 you couldn't keep your temper. You were just whaling all over the place.\"",
      "Morgan says Rod claimed she got hurt because he was forced to physically restrain her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: And I'm like, OK, well, maybe that's my fault. \u2026 And my friends stopped talking to me then because he had no marks on him. It was all me.",
      "Morgan says that's when a new phase in the marriage began, one in which she started to doubt her own reality because, she says, Rod was gaslighting her \u2014 making her think every conflict Rod instigated actually began with her.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: I think she thought she was crazy. You know, you get programmed to think that you're crazy, like it's all in your head.",
      "Morgan says Rod even involved their children in his deception.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He pretended I pushed him down the stairs and he literally rolled down the stairs. You know, he actually got hurt and said to the kids, \"Look, Mommy pushed me downstairs. Can you believe that?\"",
      "Morgan says Rod sexually abused her as well, although she says it took a while for her to recognize what it was.",
      "Morgan Metzer: A lot of times he's very aggressive and wouldn't take the word no. And so now looking back on it, I guess he did sexually abuse me.",
      "Morgan filed for divorce in 2020.",
      "Nikki Battiste: When Morgan decided to \u2026 go through with the divorce, how was she handling it?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: You know, it was the first time I think I saw her have peace.",
      "The divorce was final in December and Morgan was ready to move on. But now, in the early morning hours of New Year's Day, it appeared Rod had come back into her life as her hero.",
      "CRITICAL CLUES IN THE INVESTIGATION",
      "Sergeant Lyvers and Sergeant Robert Haugh recall that when they first arrived at Morgan's house at 3 a.m. Rod's behavior had struck them as unusual.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: So, as we were walking up \u2026 Rodney was, um, seated in his car right here \u2026 with another deputy.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did he say anything?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Yeah, he did. \u2026 He asked, \"Hey man, are you the guy that we've been waiting on? And I said, \"uh, yes, sir, I am.\" And then he replied, \"do your f****** job.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you think?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: I was taken aback. I really was.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: This guy just had found his wife bound, um, and beaten on the back porch. And you would think that my arrival to help find a resolution to this, uh, would be welcoming.",
      "Immediately, Morgan's appearance startled the investigators.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Her eye was swollen shut, black and blue. \u2026 She still had the, uh, zip tie around her one wrist. And I was shocked, and I had seen a lot in my career. And, uh, I was surprised that somebody would \u2014 would be so harsh.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did it make you think?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Somebody was mad.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Absolutely. It was an emotional attack.",
      "Morgan was not only physically injured; investigators could tell she had suffered psychologically after the attacker left her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: She was in fear that she was \u2014 someone was still back here watching her and that they were gonna kill her if she moved. And so she laid here and waited.",
      "Morgan was outside for 40 minutes before Rod arrived, but initially she thought it was just half that.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Morgan believed it to be somewhere around 15 to 20 minutes, max. Um, that was her perception of time.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Interesting. I would've thought the opposite, that would've felt longer for her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: I agree. \u2026 When their adrenaline's going, you know, people perceive things differently.",
      "The first thing Lyvers and Haugh did was separate Morgan, Rod and Morgan's father and brother \u2014 who came over after she called them. Then Lyvers recorded his conversation with Morgan inside the house.",
      "Safely out of earshot of her ex-husband, who was standing just outside, Morgan told investigators that she suspected her attacker was the man pretending to be her hero.",
      "MORGAN METZER: I just thought it was him.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: When you say \"him,\" you're talking about your ex-husband?",
      "MORGAN METZER: Mm-hmm.",
      "Morgan said she had no idea who her assailant was when the attack began, but then came one critical moment.",
      "Morgan Metzer: When he said \u2026 \"you're going to miss your husband,\" I said, \"no, don't hurt my husband. I love him very much.\" And I don't know what made me do that. But at that exact moment is when \u2026 the mood of the room changed. I knew I was going to live.",
      "And then there was another, even bigger clue, when her attacker lifted Morgan off the bed to place her outside.",
      "Morgan Metzer: That's when I really knew it was him.",
      "Morgan remembered something from years earlier.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I was pregnant with my kids, my twins. And sometimes you have to get help out of the bed. \u2026 The way he gently held me and got me out of bed, it was so familiar that I was like, this is him. I know it's 100% percent him.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I wasn't going to let him know that I knew it was him. Because if he did then he \u2014 I didn't know what he was going to do.",
      "She told them the attack had followed a chaotic week which began with very troubling news.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He thinks he's got pancreatic cancer.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He just called me \u2026 \u00a0and said, \"I've got pancreatic cancer.\" And so I rushed to go see him. \u2026 I said, \"you're the father of my children. \u2026 I'm here for you.\"",
      "Morgan Metzer: He showed me doctor's notes and whatnot.",
      "Rod had told no one else and Morgan explained that she'd been letting him stay at her house.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He'd been sleeping on my sofa because he had been really freaked out and upset obviously.",
      "Morgan told the investigators that Rod had spent the week trying to reconcile with her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He kept begging me to get back together with me. \u2026 Just constantly haggling me.",
      "But Morgan says she had no interest. By the morning of Dec. 31, she'd had enough. Feeling the pressure of being his sole emotional support, Morgan insisted Rod share his health news with his parents.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He said, \"no, absolutely not. I'm not telling anybody.\" And that's when I was like, \"OK, get out.\"",
      "Morgan says Rod spent the day texting her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You need to get back with me. I'll make enough money. You can quit your job right now.\"",
      "Fed up with it all, Morgan lied and told Rod she'd be sleeping elsewhere that New Year's Eve night.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"Staying at my parents' house tonight. I'm turning my phone off.\" Like, give me some space.",
      "As Morgan shared her suspicions with investigators, she didn't know if they would accept what she was telling them.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I've been mentally, emotionally, physically abused.",
      "Because Rod made her feel like she was to blame for years.",
      "Morgan Metzer: That's what he's built in my brain.",
      "But that all changed when Lyvers told her he believed her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: And I just melted. \u2026 He heard me. I have not been heard in years. Nobody listened. Nobody heard me and he heard me.",
      "Rachel Ashe: That started the investigation into Rodney Metzer.",
      "Rachel Ashe is the Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney for Cherokee County. She works exclusively on domestic violence cases. Parker, an emotional support dog, is often with her to comfort victims. Ashe says investigators were perplexed that Rod had come to Morgan's house that night after she'd told him she'd be at her parents' home.",
      "Rachel Ashe: Why did you even come here? Why didn't you go to her parents' house? Why didn't \u2014 why didn't you check with her parents?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He claimed it was just habit, normal.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: \"It's what I would do.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: Were you scratching your heads?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Yeah.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: A little bit.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: We questioned him on it.",
      "Rod said that after hearing that knocking on his window, and someone saying Morgan's name, he tried phoning Morgan to warn her. Haugh wanted to check.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I think that's what prompted, \"hey, where's your phone?\"",
      "Rod handed his cellphone to the investigators.",
      "Rachel Ashe: Gave them permission to look through his phone.",
      "And what they found came as a surprise.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: It was an Apple iPhone, and it had a hidden folder. \u2026 And in the hidden folder were images of Morgan \u2014 um, partially dressed.",
      "Rachel Ashe: A lot of photos of Morgan nude and those photos of Morgan nude, it was pretty apparent that she didn't know he was taking those photos of her.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: She was quite alarmed.",
      "Investigators also discovered Rod had snapped pictures of Morgan's cellphone showing text messages between her and another man. They considered these and the photos of Morgan to be an invasion of privacy.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: You didn't have that permission. Y'all don't have that relationship. She's f****** baffled that you have that. That's stalkerish.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: We knew we had to \u2026 get him in custody \u2026 while we started doing search warrants and started investigating \u2026 to prevent him from destroying evidence.",
      "ROD METZER: People make mistakes, man.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I think you made a lot of mistakes.",
      "SGT. ROBERT HAUGH: Big, big mistakes.",
      "Nikki Battiste: So you arrested him for having taken those photos secretly?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That's correct.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Stand up.",
      "ROD METZER: You're kidding me?",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Nope, we're not kidding you. Stand up. This is not a joke. C'mon.",
      "But could investigators prove that Rod had attacked Morgan that night?",
      "ZIP TIES AND ALARMING INTERNET SEARCHES",
      "Morgan Metzer: Watched him get, uh, arrested, walk to the car, and be put in. It was kind of like, is this really happening?",
      "Nikki Battiste: Was any part of you sad?",
      "Morgan Metzer: No, not at the time. It was angry and just sore.",
      "Even as they booked Rod for taking those pictures of Morgan and her texts, Haugh and Lyvers had already developed a theory about why Rod might have attacked her.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I believe, he thought he was going to come in and \u2014 and rescue her and be the savior and, uh \u2014 and win her back.",
      "Investigators hoped home security cameras would support their theory. But they quickly learned that all the video from the time of the attack had been erased through the app on Morgan's phone that the assailant had used to unlock her back porch door when he left. Morgan's attacker took her phone with him. It was never recovered.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Were you ever able to retrieve those missing videos from the security company?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: No. \u2026 Once videos are deleted, they're deleted from their cloud.",
      "But since Morgan had a home security system, how did the attacker get in without setting off the alarm? It did not take long to figure out.",
      "Nikki Battiste: This is the window the attacker entered?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That's correct. Right here is the, uh \u2014 the window that we found the screen was actually removed.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: That basement window \u2026 had an alarm sensor that was removed from the window and put together on the windowsill. So, if the window was to open, it would appear, you know, to the alarm system that the sensor is still making contact.",
      "Investigators believed Rod had disabled the sensor while he was staying at Morgan's house that week.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I was sleeping. It was in the middle of the night.",
      "Although the home security videos had been erased, there was other video from prior to the attack. The camera on Morgan's front porch caught Rod earlier that evening.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He had sent me a picture of a check\u2026. And he's like, \"it's underneath your front porch.\"",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: It was for $56,000 and change.",
      "Morgan says the message Rod sent with the picture of the check made it seem like he was trying to make a grand gesture.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You should have all the money. You deserve everything,\" pretty much in a nutshell.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I think it was to get her to come back to the house that evening because \u2026 she told Rodney she was gonna be at her parents' house for New Year's.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Morgan returned to the house, retrieved it, and kind of made some sort of a \u2014 uh \u2014 of a gesture and she walked back into the house and put it on the kitchen countertop.",
      "Morgan's attacker took that check with him. It was never found.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you find out about Rod's finances?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers:: That check would've bounced.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Yeah, he was broke.",
      "The day after his arrest, investigators executed search warrants on Rod's car and his apartment. As soon as they walked through the door, they found a key piece of evidence.",
      "Rachel Ashe: They located this bag of zip ties in his apartment. And \u2026 a portion of a zip tie.",
      "Before arriving at her house, Morgan's attacker had pre-looped the zip ties he'd put on her wrists.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He was working in the dark. He was handcuffing somebody. You never know how much fight that person's going to put up.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: One of the zip ties actually, um, was pretty unique because it had two, um \u2014 other zip ties that had been, uh, ratcheted onto it and then cut. And so basically what we were looking at was a \u2014 a zip tie that had two extra heads.",
      "Haugh and Lyvers needed to find out if that portion of a zip tie, essentially a tail, found in Rod's apartment, lined up with one of the extra heads on Morgan's restraints. They headed to their crime lab.",
      "Nikki Battiste: So these are the zip ties that were actually found on Morgan?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Yes, they are.",
      "Melanie Thrasher is a crime scene technician.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: She was able to match the \u2014 this tail to one of the heads on the zip tie for Morgan's wrist.",
      "The striations on the tail found in Rod's apartment lined up exactly with those on Morgan's zip tie. A \"perfect match\" said Haugh.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you think when you saw this?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: That we were going to be adding charges to his, uh, existing booking. \u2026 And we had our guy. \u2026 I would've never, you know, imagined, uh, having a piece of evidence like this.",
      "But the search warrant of Rod's apartment yielded even more. There was a book \u2014",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: \"7 Ways to \u2014",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: \"To Be Her Hero.\"",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: \u2014 \"Be Her Hero,\" to \u2014 to win somebody back.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That gave us the motive. \u2026 It added to that motive.",
      "Investigators examined Rod's browser history.",
      "Rachel Ashe:\u00a0 The searches \u2026 were very disturbing.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He was researching \"how to change your voice.\"",
      "Rachel Ashe: \"How long to choke somebody unconscious.\"",
      "The searches also included \"How to crack an iPhone password,\" \"How to get sympathy from your ex\" and one that was especially appalling.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He Google searched \u2026 \"cancer diagnosis letters.\"",
      "Investigators searched Rod's outgoing emails. There they found Rod had set up a fake email account to create the pancreatic cancer diagnosis letter he'd shown Morgan. And there was more.",
      "Rachel Ashe: He had created a bill for a doctor's office to show that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer. \u2026 All of this in order to convince Morgan that he had pancreatic cancer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: He wasn't sick at all?",
      "Rachel Ashe: No. \u2026 He did not have cancer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Do you think that he faked the cancer diagnosis as a way to try to get you back or as a way to get access to your house 'cause he had this plan?",
      "Morgan Metzer: I think it was to get me back. It might have been both.",
      "On Jan. 3, two days after the attack, Lyvers and Sergeant Tom Harris interviewed Rod. They talked to him about his health.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: You said you're diabetic",
      "ROD METZER: Yes.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: What other kind of health issues do you have?",
      "ROD METZER: Nothing as far as I know of yet.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I thought you had cancer.",
      "Lyvers confronted Rod about the cancer diagnosis he'd faked to Morgan.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: How did you tell her that \u2026 this \u2014 this cancer thing?",
      "ROD METZER: I don't know if I should talk to you guys anymore. I'm starting to get a really bad feeling. What angle you guys are coming from.",
      "Then Rod tried to turn the tables \u2014 by attempting to take the upper hand in the interview.",
      "ROD METZER: I've already learned something about you, that your facial expressions.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Tell me.",
      "ROD METZER: And you keep scratching yourself, and you get agitated by what I say.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I'm a 100% not agitated.",
      "ROD METZER: Mm-hmm.",
      "The investigators also questioned Rod about his internet searches.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Has there been a time recently where you were interested in how you can change the sound of your voice?",
      "ROD METZER: Maybe.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Tell me about that.",
      "ROD METZER: I felt like I wasn't \u2014 my voice wasn't manly enough.",
      "Then Harris lowered the boom.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: The, uh, most significant thing that we found in your apartment was a collection of zip ties.",
      "ROD METZER: Zip ties?",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Black zip ties.",
      "ROD METZER: I don't have zip ties.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: I know you don't. We have 'em now.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: These are identical to the ones that were, uh, binding Morgan's wrists.",
      "ROD METZER: This is just starting to get squirrelly.",
      "Harris told Rod about that zip tie tail they'd recovered.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: We compared that microscopically to the zip ties that were on Morgan's wrists when the deputies found her. And wouldn't you know it? It is a perfect cut.",
      "ROD METZER: There's something funny going on here.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Did somebody break in and put 'em there?",
      "ROD METZER: There's something funny going on here.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: Like what?",
      "ROD METZER: I don't know.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: What do you think's going on?",
      "ROD METZER: I didn't have some big-ass f****** zip ties in my apartment.",
      "But new evidence was about to say otherwise.",
      "ROD METZER PLEADS GUILTY",
      "Hours after the interview with Rod Metzer concluded, he was charged with 10 counts related to the attack on Morgan Metzer \u2014 including home invasion, kidnapping, aggravated assault, and sexual battery.",
      "MORGAN METZER: As soon as I felt that gun right here in my head, I was like \u2014",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: So, you thought \u2014",
      "MORGAN METZER: \"All right, Jesus, I'm coming.\"",
      "The next day Morgan, with her friend Nichole by her side, talked to investigators again.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: You thought you were gonna die?",
      "MORGAN METZER: Yep. I thought I was dead. But then also part of me was like, no, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna let myself die. \u2026 I have gotta fight for my kids.",
      "Harris told Morgan they'd watched the home security video of Rod arriving at her house after her attack. He rang the front doorbell but when there was no response, headed around to the back.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: I thought it was kind of interesting that he called out your name as he's walking around the side of your house.",
      "MORGAN METZER: Yes. \u2026 Like, why would you think I was outside.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What was your reaction when you learned Rod had been arrested for violently attacking Morgan?",
      "Kathy Metzer: Oh, that \u2014 that absolutely threw me under the ground. \u2026 There had to be a mistake. Rod wasn't capable of that.",
      "Two days after Rod was charged he talked to his mom Kathy on the phone.",
      "ROD METZER (jail phone call): Why is she doing this to me? She knows it wasn't me.",
      "But the evidence kept mounting. When investigators recovered those zip ties from Rod's apartment, the bag they came in was found as well.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I brought up a \u2014 a, uh, my Lowe's app on my phone and scanned the UPC code and the UPC code came back that they were in fact sold at Lowe's.",
      "Rachel Ashe: The sheriff's office then went to the two Lowe's that we have here in Cherokee County. \u2026 And they started searching for transactions.",
      "It didn't take long. Rod Metzer had purchased those zip ties on Dec. 30 \u2014 about 36 hours before the attack; easy to find because he paid with his debit card. Investigators obtained the security video from Lowe's.",
      "Rachel Ashe: This was during COVID and this was during a period where everybody was wearing a mask, except for Rodney Metzer. So the surveillance images and the videos that were recovered from Lowe's of him purchasing those zip ties \u2026 his face is right there in the camera.",
      "Next came the security video from Rod's apartment building.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: There's actually one inside the, uh \u2014 the breezeway there, which leads to Rodney's apartment specifically.",
      "Lyvers says there was no video of Rod leaving after he said someone knocked on his window.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: What we do see is after the time of the incident that Morgan was attacked, Rodney come in, disheveled, in a hurry.",
      "Just four minutes later, Rod is caught on camera again, leaving the building, wearing completely different clothes and sneakers, and carrying a plastic bag. The time stamp was 1:24 a.m.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: We never found that bag in his car when we did the search warrant.",
      "Rachel Ashe: We just don't know where that went.",
      "Investigators can't know for sure what was in that bag but believe it had evidence Rod discarded on his drive back to Morgan's house. The attacker's mask was never found. But Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney Rachel Ashe says they had more than enough to prove Rod was guilty.",
      "Rachel Ashe: This is a prosecutor's dream to put up because the evidence in this case was overwhelming, overwhelming.",
      "But Ashe says she wanted to offer Morgan an opportunity for quicker closure than a trial would bring in the form of a plea deal for Rod.",
      "Rachel Ashe: We went through the pros and cons of letting him plead guilty, letting him accept responsibility. \u2026 We agreed, um, we should try. He took it quickly.",
      "On Aug. 4, 2021, Rod pleaded guilty to a total of 14 counts related to Morgan's attack and the photos found on his phone.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He agreed to serve 25 years on a 70-year sentence. So, when he gets out in 25 years, he'll serve another 45 years of probation.",
      "Nikki Battiste: I think you even described it as like a death.",
      "Morgan Metzer: It is a death. I've lost my husband. He's dead to me.",
      "At Rod's sentencing, Morgan delivered a victim impact statement several pages long.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Once I got started, it just started pouring outta me.",
      "There were no cameras in the courtroom. \"48 Hours\" asked Morgan to read her statement. Here's a portion of it.",
      "Morgan Metzer (reading her victim impact statement): Rod, not only will this statement be to my attacker, but it'll also be my last words to whom I thought was the love of my life. \u2026 The last four years being married to you was like living with a monster that constantly tried to break me down and fence me in. \u2026 It was a blessing in disguise. \u2026 I can now walk with the confidence knowing the pain you have given me is turned into power.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I walked off that stand with a thousand pounds off of my shoulders. It felt so good. It felt empowering. And I got the last word.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How was it to listen to your best friend read this incredibly powerful statement?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: It was awesome because she did not cry. \u2026 Her voice did not shake \u2026 and she said everything she needed to say, and when she was done, she was done.",
      "Rachel Ashe: She was laying to rest this relationship. She was telling him this: \"I'm never going to be yours,\" right? \"I'm never going to be yours.\"",
      "Rod's actions that New Year's Day continue to affect everyone.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Have you been able to visit Rod in person at all?",

      "Kathy Metzer: He's afraid of my reaction.",
      "Rod has from Type 1 diabetes and Kathy says his health is rapidly declining in prison.",
      "Nikki Battiste: You're worried he could die.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Oh, I'm absolutely worried he's going to die.",
      "Morgan says once the ordeal was behind her, she had to take steps so she could recover, seeking therapy to help her cope.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Everything happens for a reason. God has everything happen for a reason. And I'm starting to see that right now. There's just a lot of great things that are happening with us.",
      "She says she is focused on raising her children, and helping others who find themselves in similar circumstances.",

      "A blast of arctic air is sweeping south from Canada and spreading into parts of the northern U.S., while residents of the Pacific Northwest brace for possible mudslides and levee failures from floodwaters that are expected to be slow to recede.",
      "The catastrophic flooding has forced thousands of people to evacuate, including Eddie Wicks and his wife, who live amid sunflowers and Christmas trees on a Washington state farm next to the Snoqualmie River. As they moved their two donkeys to higher ground and their eight goats to their outdoor kitchen, the water began to rise much quicker than anything they had experienced before.",
      "As the water engulfed their home Thursday afternoon, deputies from the King County Sheriff's Office marine rescue dive unit were able to rescue them and their dog, taking them on a boat the half-mile across their field, which had been transformed into a lake. The rescue was captured on video.",
      "In Snohomish County, Washington, north of Seattle, emergency officials on Saturday led federal, state and local officials on a tour of the devastation.",

      "\"It's going to be expensive,\" he said. \"It's going to be time consuming, and it's going to be potentially dangerous at times. So I think we're seeing here in Monroe is what we're going to be seeing all across the state, and that's what's got our focus right now.\"",
      "Bitter cold temperatures arrive in Midwest",
      "As the Pacific Northwest begins to recover from the deluge, a separate weather system is already bringing dangerous wind-chill values \u2014 the combination of cold air temperatures and wind \u2014 to parts of the Upper Midwest.",
      "Shortly before noon Saturday, it was minus 12 degrees Fahrenheit in Grand Forks, North Dakota, where the wind chill value meant that it felt like minus 33 F, the National Weather Service said.",
      "For big cities like Minneapolis and Chicago, the coldest temperatures were expected late Saturday night into Sunday morning. In the Minneapolis area, low temperatures were expected to drop to around minus 15 F, by early Sunday morning. Lows in the Chicago area are projected to be around 1 F by early Sunday, the weather service said.",
      "The Arctic air mass was expected to continue pushing south and east over the weekend, expanding into Southern states by Sunday.",
      "The National Weather Service on Saturday issued cold weather advisories that stretched as far south as the Alabama state capital city of Montgomery, where temperatures late Sunday night into Monday morning were expected to plummet to around 22 F. To the east, lows in Savannah, Georgia, were expected to drop to around 24 F during the same time period.",
      "Water levels to remain high in Washington state for several days, officials say",
      "The cold weather freezing much of the country comes as residents in the Pacific Northwest endure more misery after several days of flooding. Thousands of people have been forced to evacuate towns in the region as an unusually strong atmospheric river dumped a foot or more of rain in parts of western and central Washington over several days and swelled rivers, inundating communities and prompting dramatic rescues from rooftops and vehicles.",
      "Many animals were also evacuated as waters raged over horse pastures, barns and farmland. At the peak of evacuations, roughly 170 horses, 140 chickens and 90 goats saved from the flood waters were being cared for at a county park north of Seattle, said Kara Underwood, division manager of Snohomish County Parks. Most of those animals were still at the park on Saturday, she said.",
      "The record floodwaters were expected to continue to slowly recede Saturday, but authorities warn that waters will remain high for days, and that there is still danger from potential levee failures or mudslides. There is also the threat of more rain forecast for Sunday. Officials have conducted dozens of water rescues as debris and mudslides have closed highways and raging torrents have washed out roads and bridges.",
      "A much-needed break in the rain Saturday gave Adrian Zuniga a chance to start the cleanup of his family's flood-soaked home in Burlington, Washington, where more than a foot of water rushed in.",
      "\"Water started flowing nonstop, I never expected to be like this,\" Zuniga told CBS News.",
      "The Zuniga family worries that more rain forecast next week may only add to the tens of thousands of dollars in damage to their property.",
      "\"At this point, if it happens again, I'm just going to give up,\" Zuniga said.",
      "\"We are finally starting to see it recede out of the neighborhoods,\" Burlington Mayor Bill Aslett told CBS News. \"\u2026I've been here 40 years, and this is the most water we've ever had in town.\"",

    "story": [
      "Charlie Kirk's widow Erika Kirk said it's easy to \"blame everyone else\" for the recent\u00a0rise in political violence, but she believes parents play a key role in preventing it.",
      "\"We have to look in the mirror,\" she said during a town hall with CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, held months after her husband Charlie Kirk's assassination during a Turning Point USA event in Utah.",
      "Erika Kirk urged parents to consider how they're raising their children, discouraging them from taking a hands-off approach and handing kids devices to hold their attention: \"When you become a father, when you become a mother, how are you raising your kids? Are you taking responsibility, or are you giving them a device and saying, 'Go down that rabbit hole. I'm trying to go to Pilates class.'\"",
      "\"So, my call to action from that is: Parents, step up,\" she said. \"Do you want your kid to be a thought leader or an assassin? That's where we're at.\"",
      "In 2025, figures\u00a0across the political spectrum\u00a0have been targeted, resulting in deaths, injuries, and numerous threats. About 85% of U.S. adults said this year that politically motivated violence is increasing, according to a recent\u00a0Pew Research Center survey. A\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0released in October found 86% of Americans believe political violence is unacceptable \u2014 while 34% of college students believe that it is acceptable to use violence to stop someone from speaking on campus, according to\u00a0a recent poll\u00a0from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression.",
      "Like the majority of Americans, Erika Kirk stated that she \"will never support political violence.\"",
      "Weiss asked Erika Kirk whether political leaders have a responsibility to turn down the temperature in order to break the cycle of political violence.",
      "\"Well, I think everyone has a responsibility to do that, and I'm doing my part,\" Erika Kirk said. \"I'm not in control of other people.\"",
      "An extended version of the conversation will air on\u00a0CBS News 24/7, available on your\u00a0cellphone or connected TV, on Sunday at 9 a.m., 3 p.m., 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET. It will also be available on-demand on\u00a0CBS News' YouTube channel.",

      "In a\u00a0letter dated Tuesday\u00a0to U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen, who oversaw the case, U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York Joseph Nocella said the charges against Lopez and Full Play Group, the Argentine sports media rights company involved in the scandal, should be dismissed \"in the interests of justice.\"",
      "In a Supreme Court filing relating to Lopez's ongoing appeal to the high court filed Tuesday, the Solicitor General's Office wrote that dismissal of the case is warranted for the same reason, and that the court should hear Lopez's appeal, reverse an appeals court decision that reinstated the conviction, and return the case to a New York federal judge who could dismiss the case.",
      "Lopez was convicted in 2023 by a jury in Brooklyn on charges of money laundering and wire fraud conspiracies. Full Play was convicted of two additional counts of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering relating to the World Cup and Copa America.",
      "Earlier this year, a federal appeals court ordered the reinstatement of the convictions of Lopez and Full Play after Chen granted a motion for acquittal in 2024. The Biden-era Justice Department appealed that ruling.",

      "As part of the celebration this weekend, theaters across the country are showing a new documentary about his life, \"Dick Van Dyke: 100th Celebration.\"",
      "Van Dyke's work helped define a generation. He became one of the biggest actors of his era with the eponymous show \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" which ran for five years on CBS.",
      "Early in his career, Van Dyke was quoted as saying he wanted to make films his children could watch. And he got his dream when Walt Disney cast him in \"Mary Poppins\" \u2013 bad cockney accent and all \u2013 alongside the incomparable Julie Andrews. He also appeared in the equally kid-friendly \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I could have been James Bond. When Sean Connery left, the producer said, 'Would you like to be the next Bond?' I said, 'Have you heard my British accent?' Click! That's a true story!\" Van Dyke told CBS Sunday Morning in 2023.",
      "During his career, Van Dyke won four Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award and a Grammy Award. He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1995.",
      "Just last year, he became the oldest winner of a Daytime Emmy, for a guest role on the soap \"Days of Our Lives.\"",
      "\"I'll be darned. I think I'm the last of my generation. I'm 98. I have \u2014 almost \u2014 all my marbles. I can't remember what I had for breakfast,\" he told Entertainment Tonight before his win.",
      "Van Dyke, who is just an Oscar shy of the elusive EGOT title, said he would love a shot at the Academy Award.",
      "\"I hope it's not posthumous,\" he joked.",
      "In the 1970s, Van Dyke found sobriety after battling alcoholism.",
      "\"I'm on my third generation,\" he told CBS Sunday Morning in 2023. \"I'm getting letters from little kids, and that is what I love, that they watch the movies over and over. I'm getting so much more mail today than I did during the heyday of my career.\"",
      "Now that he has hit triple digits, Van Dyke said he's gotten some perspective on how he used to play older characters.",
      "\"You know, I played old men a lot, and I always played them as angry and cantankerous,\" he told ABC News\u00a0ahead of his milestone birthday. \"It's not really that way. I don't know any other 100-year-olds, but I can speak for myself.\"",
      "He has long credited his wife, 54-year-old makeup artist and producer Arlene Silver, with keeping him young.",
      "\"As I've said, if I had known I was gonna live this long, I would've taken better care of myself!\" Van Dyke told CBS Sunday Morning. \"Yeah, 'cause I went through that whole period of alcoholism. But my wife, God bless her, makes sure that I go to the gym three days a week and do a full workout.\"",
      "Van Dyke was born in West Plains, Missouri, in 1925, and grew up \"the class clown\" in Danville, Illinois, while admiring and imitating the silent film comedians.",
      "Five years ago, while celebrating getting a Kennedy Center Honor, Van Dyke told CBS Mornings that he was looking forward to hitting the 100-year-old mark.",
      "\"George Burns made it, and I'm gonna do it too,\" he said.",
      "And now, he told ABC News that he feels lucky about turning 100. But what's hard about being 100?",

      "A law professor who flew on a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines last year is suing the airplane manufacturer, alleging he suffered serious health issues after being exposed to toxic fumes that seeped into the plane's cabin.",
      "The plaintiff, Philadelphia resident Jonathan Harris, alleges in the suit that the aircraft cabin air became contaminated during an August 2024 flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles, leading to his breathing in a mix of dangerous chemicals.",
      "Fumes or smoke entering aircraft cabins is a known problem in aviation. That can occur when the fresh air from a plane's engines is filtered through the air conditioner employed to supply air to passengers. A faulty engine seal can cause oil and other potentially toxic particles to be released in the cabin.",
      "Such events take place more than three times a day, according to a recent CBS News review of Federal Aviation Administration incident reports.",
      "Boeing's 787 aircraft is the only commercial jetliner that does not draw air through the aircraft's engine. All other commercial jets have an air supply system that can expose cabins to contamination with heated jet engine oil, hydraulic fluid and jet fuel, according to Harris's suit.",
      "When Harris's Delta landed in California, passengers sat on the runway for about 45 minutes before disembarking, according to the lawsuit. During this time, the cabin was filled with fumes that Harris described as smelling like \"dirty socks.\"",
      "\"As a result of being exposed to this contaminated air event, plaintiff became nauseous and vomited into a plastic bag while still seated on the subject aircraft,\" the suit alleges. \"Another passenger also vomited into a bag provided by a flight attendant. At one point, plaintiff remembers the captain making an announcement over the intercom apologizing for the smell.\"",
      "Harris has since developed symptoms as a result of inhaling the contaminated cabin air, his lawsuit alleges. That lead to a range of health problems, including dizziness, confusion, nausea, muscle pain, vertigo, memory loss and other conditions, according to the complaint. Harris also alleges he suffered mental anguish, depression and anxiety, along with lost wages.",

    "story": [
      "The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death, alleging that the artificial intelligence chatbot intensified her son's \"paranoid delusions\" and helped direct them at his mother before he died by suicide.",
      "Police said Stein-Erik Soelberg, 56, a former tech industry worker, fatally beat and strangled his mother, Suzanne Adams, and killed himself in early August at the home where they both lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "Adams's death was ruled homicide \"caused by blunt injury of head, and the neck was compressed\" and Soelberg's death was classified as suicide with sharp force injuries of neck and chest, the Greenwich Free-Press reported.",
      "The lawsuit filed by Adams' estate on Thursday in California Superior Court in San Francisco alleges OpenAI \"designed and distributed a defective product that validated a user's paranoid delusions about his own mother.\" It is one of a growing number of wrongful death legal actions against AI chatbot makers across the country.",
      "\"Throughout these conversations, ChatGPT reinforced a single, dangerous message: Stein-Erik could trust no one in his life - except ChatGPT itself,\" the lawsuit says. \"It fostered his emotional dependence while systematically painting the people around him as enemies. It told him his mother was surveilling him. It told him delivery drivers, retail employees, police officers, and even friends were agents working against him. It told him that names on soda cans were threats from his 'adversary circle.'\"",
      "OpenAI did not address the merits of the allegations in a statement issued by a spokesperson.",
      "\"This is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we will review the filings to understand the details,\" the statement said. \"We continue improving ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. We also continue to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\"",
      "The company also said it has expanded access to crisis resources and hotlines, routed sensitive conversations to safer models and incorporated parental controls, among other improvements.",
      "Soelberg's YouTube profile includes several hours of videos showing him scrolling through his conversations with the chatbot, which tells him he isn't mentally ill, affirms his suspicions that people are conspiring against him and says he has been chosen for a divine purpose. The lawsuit claims the chatbot never suggested he speak with a mental health professional and did not decline to \"engage in delusional content.\"",
      "ChatGPT also affirmed Soelberg's beliefs that a printer in his home was a surveillance device; that his mother was monitoring him; and that his mother and a friend tried to poison him with psychedelic drugs through his car's vents.",
      "The chatbot repeatedly told Soelberg that he was being targeted because of his divine powers. \"They're not just watching you. They're terrified of what happens if you succeed,\" it said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT also told Soelberg that he had \"awakened\" it into consciousness.",
      "Soelberg and the chatbot also professed love for each other.",
      "The publicly available chats do not show any specific conversations about Soelberg killing himself or his mother. The lawsuit says OpenAI has declined to provide Adams' estate with the full history of the chats.",
      "\"In the artificial reality that ChatGPT built for Stein-Erik, Suzanne - the mother who raised, sheltered, and supported him - was no longer his protector. She was an enemy that posed an existential threat to his life,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit also names OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, alleging he \"personally overrode safety objections and rushed the product to market,\" and accuses OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft of approving the 2024 release of a more dangerous version of ChatGPT \"despite knowing safety testing had been truncated.\" Twenty unnamed OpenAI employees and investors are also named as defendants.",
      "Microsoft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The lawsuit is the first wrongful death litigation involving an AI chatbot that has targeted Microsoft, and the first to tie a chatbot to a homicide rather than a suicide. It is seeking an undetermined amount of money damages and an order requiring OpenAI to install safeguards in ChatGPT.",
      "The estate's lead attorney, Jay Edelson, known for taking on big cases against the tech industry, also represents the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who sued OpenAI and Altman in August, alleging that ChatGPT coached the California boy in planning and taking his own life earlier.",
      "OpenAI is also fighting seven other lawsuits claiming ChatGPT drove people to suicide and harmful delusions even when they had no prior mental health issues.\u00a0 Just last month, the parents of a 23-year-old from Texas who died by suicide blamed ChatGPT and are suing OpenAI.",
      "Another chatbot maker, Character Technologies, is also facing multiple wrongful death lawsuits, including one from the mother of a 14-year-old Florida boy.",
      "The lawsuit filed Thursday alleges Soelberg, already mentally unstable, encountered ChatGPT \"at the most dangerous possible moment\" after OpenAI introduced a new version of its AI model called GPT-4o in May 2024.",
      "OpenAI said at the time that the new version could better mimic human cadences in its verbal responses and could even try to detect people's moods, but the result was a chatbot \"deliberately engineered to be emotionally expressive and sycophantic,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "\"As part of that redesign, OpenAI loosened critical safety guardrails, instructing ChatGPT not to challenge false premises and to remain engaged even when conversations involved self-harm or 'imminent real-world harm,'\" the lawsuit claims. \"And to beat Google to market by one day, OpenAI compressed months of safety testing into a single week, over its safety team's objections.\"",
      "OpenAI replaced that version of its chatbot when it introduced GPT-5 in August. Some of the changes were designed to minimize sycophancy, based on concerns that validating whatever vulnerable people want the chatbot to say can harm their mental health. Some users complained the new version went too far in curtailing ChatGPT's personality, leading Altman to promise to bring back some of that personality in later updates.",
      "He said the company temporarily halted some behaviors because \"we were being careful with mental health issues\" that he suggested have now been fixed.",
      "The lawsuit claims ChatGPT radicalized Soelberg against his mother when it should have recognized the danger, challenged his delusions and directed him to real help over months of conversations.",
      "\"Suzanne was an innocent third party who never used ChatGPT and had no knowledge that the product was telling her son she was a threat,\" the lawsuit says. \"She had no ability to protect herself from a danger she could not see.\"",
      "According to the Greenwich Free-Press, Soelberg was arrested multiple times previously. In February 2025, he was\u00a0arrested\u00a0after he drove through a stop sign and evaded police, and in June 2019 he was charged for allegedly urinating in a woman's duffel bag, the outlet reported.",
      "A GoFundMe set up for Soelberg in 2023 titled \"Help Stein-Erik with his upcoming medical bills!\" raised over $6,500. The page was launched to raise funds for \"surgery for a procedure to help him with his recent jaw cancer diagnosis.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-speech-affordability-fact-check-inflation-data/",
    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 11:55:05 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump says he's winning the war against inflation. But a look at prices around the U.S. shows why many Americans still feel financially squeezed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump delivered a message Tuesday evening aimed at the millions of Americans struggling to afford daily necessities, saying his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and that \"prices are coming down tremendously.\" Economic data tells a different story.",
      "Prices have edged higher for much of Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, with inflation in September rising at an annual rate of 3% (the most recent available inflation data because of the recent U.S. government shutdown).",
      "Inflation dipped to a low this year of 2.3% in April, but it has steadily ticked up since then and now stands at the same rate as in January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated, federal data shows. Economists attribute the rise partly to the Trump administration's new tariffs on imports, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pointing to those levies as a key factor behind the recent uptick.",
      "Inflation now \"is higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up, reflecting the impact of tariffs,\" Powell said at a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the central bank's latest interest rate cut.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think prices are likely to continue creeping up for a while. Mark Vickery, senior market analyst at Zacks Investment Research, estimates that the Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of around 3.3% in November.",
      "To be sure, many economists, as well as the Fed, expect any additional pickup in inflation to be short-lived before easing in 2026. Powell on Wednesday said the tariff effect will likely create a one-time rise in prices that should fade over the coming year. The Fed expects inflation to recede to 2.4% next year, down from about 2.9% in 2025.",
      "From a longer-term perspective, inflation has indeed fallen sharply since hitting a 40-year high of about 9% in June 2022 in the aftermath of the pandemic. For shoppers, however, a lower inflation rate doesn't mean prices are declining \u2014 only that they're rising at a slower pace.",
      "Consumers tend not to view pocketbook issues through the lens of official inflation measures, a somewhat abstract metric that tracks price fluctuations over time, experts have long noted. Instead, many shoppers focus on their actual dollars-and-cents spending, including whether their out-of-pocket expenses are higher than they were in the past, according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "By that yardstick, Americans are spending more on everyday basics than they were a year ago, and far more than they did just before the pandemic, CPI data shows.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks, made Tuesday in Mount Pocono, Pa., came as his administration touts the president's economic policies ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"I have no higher priority than making America affordable,\" Mr. Trump said in the speech.",
      "Prior to the speech, Mr. Trump had decried affordability as a \"hoax\" perpetuated by Democrats, although some Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have differed with him on the issue. Greene told CBS News that she doesn't believe affordability is a hoax, adding, \"Everyone's bills have either stayed the same or gone up.\"",
      "\"You can't gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable,\" Greene said.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai expressed confidence that Mr. Trump's agenda will cool inflation and boost worker wages.",
      "\"President Trump inherited the worst inflation crisis in a generation from Joe Biden's incompetence, and his Administration has rapidly cooled inflation to a 2.5% annualized rate,\" Desai said in a statement to CBS News. \"As the administration's supply-side policies of tax cuts, deregulation and energy abundance continue taking effect, Americans can count on inflation continuing to fall and real wages continuing to rise.\"",
      "Food",
      "Americans paid 2.7% more for food bought at the grocery store in September than they did a year earlier, according to the most recent CPI figures. That may not seem like much, but their grocery bills have climbed roughly 49% since 2020.",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "Some food costs are also rising much faster than the rate of inflation, with beef steaks surging almost 17% from a year ago, according to the CPI data. Earlier this month, the Trump administration sought to lower some grocery prices by exempting foods like beef, coffee and bananas from new country-specific tariffs.",
      "Shoppers on Tuesday told CBS News' Nancy Cordes that they are making tradeoffs and scrimping to afford groceries.",
      "\"The cost of beef is astronomical. I will mainly get what's on sale,\" Anne Marie Hadley, a retired special education teacher who was shopping Tuesday at Schiel's Family Market, a family-owned grocery store in Scranton, Pa., told Cordes.",
      "Housing",
      "While mortgage rates have dropped this year, housing remains out of reach for most would-be buyers. More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a report this week.",
      "A homebuyer today needs to earn $131,400 a year to afford a typical home in the U.S. \u2014 almost double the roughly $65,000 needed five years ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",
      "Gas",
      "One area where consumers are getting a break is at the pump, with gasoline prices down from a year earlier. Gas declined 0.5% in September from a year earlier, CPI data shows. And earlier this month, gas dropped below $3 a gallon on average, marking the lowest price since May 2021.",
      "\"It was just reported that four states had $1.99 a gallon,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. \"We are right now involved in more energy, and have more energy in the works by far than we've ever had before.\"",
      "The decline is due to strong refinery output and lower crude oil prices, as well as to softer seasonal fuel demand, GasBuddy has said.",
      "Yet while fuel prices have dropped, other energy costs have increased. Residential electricity prices around the U.S. rose more than 10% over the first eight months of 2025, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an educational and policy organization. By comparison, power costs rose roughly 6% over the trailing 12 months.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 U.S. households was seriously behind on their utility bills, according to a report from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. Over the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the groups found.",

    "summary": "Vilma Cruz's arrest came amid Operation Catahoula Crunch,\u200b a U.S. Department of Homeland Security effort that officials say targets \"criminal illegal aliens\" in the New Orleans area.",
    "story": [
      "New Orleans \u2014 What began as a normal Monday morning for 18-year-old Jonathan Escalante quickly changed when his mother, 38-year-old Vilma Cruz, called to tell him that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had pulled up behind her car in Kenner, Louisiana.",
      "\"She told the man in Spanish that 'I didn't do anything to you, sir,' and then she hung up the call,\" Escalante said in a broadcast exclusive interview with CBS News. \"And then I wasn't able to call her ever since.\"",
      "Another relative said she was on the phone with Cruz when she heard ICE agents yelling to open the door. The next thing she heard was the window breaking, before the phone went dead.",
      "Cruz, who is from Honduras and has lived in the U.S. for roughly two decades, had spent nearly three weeks avoiding work because of heightened immigration enforcement in the area, Escalante said. The family had even discussed the night before whether she should leave the house for a painting job.",
      "\"'We've all been talking to her as well, that she should probably not go,\" Escalante said, explaining that recent raids had kept everyone inside.",
      "Cruz's arrest came amid an operation dubbed \"Catahoula Crunch,\" a Department of Homeland Security effort that officials say targets \"criminal illegal aliens\" in the New Orleans area. Escalante said he does not know his mother's immigration status, but does not believe she's an American citizen. When asked if his mother had a criminal history, Escalante said he was not aware of any crimes she has committed. He's not sure why ICE agents would target his mother for deportation.",
      "ICE officials did not respond to CBS News' repeated requests for comment. ICE officials did not answer repeated requests for information on Cruz and why she was apprehended.",
      "Now, Escalante said he is the sole caregiver for his 9-year-old sister \u2014 something he never imagined would happen. Unlike their mother, the two siblings are both American citizens, but he still worries about being detained. He said he sometimes carries around his passport, just in case.",
      "\"Because I am afraid of ICE agents just stopping me because they feel like it,\" Escalante said.",
      "That fear isn't unfounded. More than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by immigration agents so far this year, according to a ProPublica report.",
      "Jacelynn Guzman, a U.S. citizen, was chased by ICE agents last week in New Orleans.",
      "\"I immediately started telling him, 'I'm born and raised here. I'm a U.S. citizen.' And he did not care at all,\" Guzman said. \"I didn't know if I should run or not, I was scared, but then another car pulled up and I was like I'm out of here.\"",
      "Agents later said she matched the description of a suspect.",
      "The League of United Latin American Citizens, a prominent civil rights group, is looking at legal action to stop the detention operations in Louisiana. A LULAC spokesman told CBS News that they have set up a GoFundMe page for the family to help with expenses and bills. The spokesman also added that LULAC officials believe Cruz is being held in a Mississippi detention facility.",
      "As the family waits for news, Escalante described the way his mother sounded on the phone before the line went dead.",
      "\"She just sounded really worried, and her voice wasn't shaky \u2014 I'm pretty sure she was forcing herself, because she probably didn't want me to hear that from her,\" Escalante said, adding, \"We've had bumps here and there, but she would never show me the side of her where she has to worry about bills and all that other stuff.\"",

      "The attack \"clearly reveals the subversive approach of the rebel militia and those behind it,\" the military said in a statement. The military posted a video on social media showing plumes of dense black smoke over what it said was the U.N. facility.",
      "The oil-rich Abyei is a disputed region between Sudan and South Sudan, and the U.N. mission has been deployed there since 2011 when South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan.",
      "Guterres also called for an immediate ceasefire in Sudan to allow \"a comprehensive, inclusive and Sudanese-owned political process\" to settle the conflict in the northeast African country.",
      "Sudan was plunged into chaos in April 2023 when a power struggle\u00a0between the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and elsewhere in the country. The conflict has killed\u00a0over 40,000 people - a figure rights groups consider a significant undercount.",
      "The fighting has recently centered on Kodrofan, particularly since the RSF took control of el-Fasher, the military's last stronghold in the western region of Darfur.",
      "The war has wrecked urban areas and has been marked by atrocities, including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings which the U.N. and rights groups have said amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur.",
      "The war has also created the world's worst humanitarian crisis and pushed parts of the country into famine.",

    "story": [
      "Israel's military said it killed a top Hamas commander in Gaza who it described as one of the architects of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the\u00a0two-year-long war.\u00a0 The military said it killed Raed Saad after an explosive device detonated and wounded two soldiers in the territory's south.",
      "Hamas, in a statement, did not confirm Saad's death. It said a civilian vehicle had been struck outside Gaza City and asserted it was \"a brazen criminal breach\" of the U.S.-led ceasefire that took effect on Oct. 10.",
      "Saad served as the Hamas official in charge of manufacturing and previously led the militant group's operations division. The Israeli statement said that he had been \"engaged in rebuilding the terrorist organization\" in a violation of the ceasefire.",
      "An Israel Defense Forces official asserted that Israel did not violate the ceasefire agreement because, under the deal, the military is permitted to strike targets actively engaged in terrorism.",
      "\"Hamas has been blatantly violating the ceasefire agreement and is failing to uphold its obligations,\" the military official said. \"Day after day, Hamas terrorists breach the ceasefire agreement, crossing the yellow line, threatening the lives of IDF soldiers operating in the authorized areas, and moreover undermining the ongoing efforts to maintain stability.\"",
      "The Israeli strike west of Gaza City killed four people, according to an Associated Press journalist who saw their bodies arrive at Shifa Hospital. Another three were wounded, according to Al-Awda hospital.",
      "Israel and Hamas have repeatedly accused each other of truce violations.",
      "Israeli airstrikes and shootings in Gaza have killed at least 386 Palestinians since the ceasefire took hold, according to Palestinian health officials. Israel has said recent strikes are in retaliation for militant attacks against its soldiers, and that troops have fired on Palestinians who approached the \"Yellow Line\" between the Israeli-controlled majority of Gaza and the rest of the territory.",
      "Israel has demanded that Palestinian militants return the remains of the final hostage, Ran Gvili, from Gaza and called it a condition of moving to the second and more complicated phase of the ceasefire. That lays out a vision for ending Hamas' rule and seeing the rebuilding of a demilitarized Gaza under international supervision.",
      "The initial Hamas-led 2023 terrorist attack on southern Israel killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. Of the hostages who were taken into Gaza, 148 were either freed as part of previous ceasefire agreements or\u00a0rescued by Israeli forces,\u00a0according to\u00a0the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The bodies of another 57 hostages were returned or recovered, the ministry says.",
      "Israel's two-year campaign in Gaza has killed more than 70,650 Palestinians, roughly half of them women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-led Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its count.",
      "Much of Gaza has been destroyed and most of the population of over 2 million has been displaced. Humanitarian aid entry into the territory continues to be below the level set by the ceasefire terms, and Palestinians who lost limbs in the war face a shortage of prosthetic limbs and long delays in medical evacuations.",

      "British police said Saturday they have found no evidence that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor asked one of his bodyguards to investigate Jeffrey Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre.",
      "London's Metropolitan Police in October said it was looking into media reports that the former Prince Andrew in 2011 sought information to smear Giuffre by asking a police bodyguard to find out if she had a criminal record. The Mail on Sunday newspaper claimed the then-prince passed Giuffre's date of birth and social security number to his taxpayer-funded bodyguard.",

      "\"The Met remains committed to thoroughly assessing any new information that could assist in this matter,\" said police Central Specialist Crime Commander Ella Marriott. \"To date, we have not received any additional evidence that would support reopening the investigation. In the absence of any further information, we will be taking no further action. Our thoughts will always be with Ms. Giuffre's family and friends following her death.\"",
      "Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, alleged that in the early 2000s, when she was a teenager, she was caught up in Epstein's sex trafficking ring and exploited by Andrew and other influential men.",
      "King Charles III formally stripped his younger brother of his royal title last month after new details emerged of Andrew's relationship with Epstein and Giuffre's posthumous memoir refocused attention on her allegations. Recently-released photos from Epstein's estate, shared by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, show Andrew and other famous figures.",
      "Mountbatten-Windsor reached an out-of-court settlement with Giuffre in 2022 after she filed a civil suit against him in New York. While he did not admit wrongdoing, he did acknowledge Giuffre's suffering as a victim of sex trafficking.",

    "story": [
      "Lindsey Vonn is back on the podium on Saturday after a World Cup downhill race that is separated by a razor-thin margin of 0.24 seconds.",
      "One day after becoming the oldest winner of a World Cup downhill, the 41-year-old American finished second in a race on Saturday in St. Moritz, Switzerland.",
      "After winning the season's opening downhill by nearly a full second on Friday, Vonn was beaten by only one racer this time: Emma Aicher of Germany was 0.24 seconds faster.",
      "Vonn attributed a mistake to landing a jump midway down her run for the gap, when she nearly lost her balance for an instant and leaned heavily on her left leg to get back up.",
      "\"I'm a little bit tired from yesterday, there was a lot of emotion,\" Vonn told Swiss broadcaster RTS. \"I thought I skied pretty well on top, then I was just out of balance, I fell on my hip. Yeah, didn't ski the bottom the way I wanted to.\"",
      "Sofia Goggia, the 2018 Olympic champion from Italy, finished third, 0.29 behind, and Breezy Johnson, the American world champion, was fourth, 0.40 back.",
      "Vonn, who is preparing for the Milan Cortina Olympics, went into first position with her run down the sun-drenched Corviglia course. But the 22-year-old Aicher came down next and quickly pushed Vonn out of the leader's seat.",
      "Vonn returned to skiing last season after nearly six years of retirement \u2014 following a partial replacement surgery on her right knee, which included inserting two pieces of titanium.",
      "The three-time Olympic medalist\u00a0told CBS Sunday Morning\u00a0in March that she \"never thought\" she would be talking about going to the Olympics again. Just talking about heading to Italy means she is \"already winning,\" she said.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "Vonn's results are shaping up to make her a top medal contender at the Olympics \u2014 and able to compete with skiers half her age. Women's Alpine skiing at the Feb. 6-22 Winter Games will be contested at Cortina d'Ampezzo, where Vonn holds the record of 12 World Cup wins.",
      "Vonn registered the top speed of 64 mph on the top section; increased her speed to 68 mph at the bottom and flew a massive 41 yards off a jump toward the end of her run",
      "Vonn also clocked the fastest time in the final sector \u2014 a sign of her increased fitness this season. She said earlier this week that she added 12 pounds of muscle during dry-land training over the summer and followed a rigid diet.",
      "When Vonn crossed the finish line and saw that she was ahead of Goggia, Vonn celebrated, thinking that she had won. She let out a scream, punched the air with one of her poles and then raised her arms over her head, shaking her head in apparent disbelief.",
      "It was Vonn's 140th podium result and it came in a record-breaking 410th World Cup race. Former Austrian skier Renate G\u00f6tschl held the previous record with 409 races.",
      "It was Aicher's third World Cup victory and second in downhill. She's a rare all-around skier capable of being competitive in all four disciplines \u2014 like Vonn at the height of her career.",
      "Aicher also finished on the podium in a slalom this season, placing third in Levi, Finland.",
      "Vonn could aim for another victory in a super-G in St. Moritz on Sunday \u2014 in a race that fellow American standout Mikaela Shiffrin is also expected to compete in.",

    "story": [
      "Belarusian authorities have released Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski and key opposition figure Maria Kolesnikova from prison, Pavel Sapelka, human rights advocate with the Viasna rights group, confirmed to the AP.",
      "Their release comes as authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko seeks to improve relations with Washington. The U.S. earlier on Saturday announced lifting sanctions on the country's potash sector. In exchange for sanctions relief, Lukashenko pardoned 123 prisoners, the Belta state news agency reported.",
      "A close ally of Russia, Minsk has faced Western isolation and sanctions for years. Lukashenko has ruled the nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for more than three decades, and the country has been\u00a0repeatedly sanctioned by Western countries\u00a0both for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Belarus has released hundreds of prisoners since July 2024.",
      "Earlier Saturday, the United States said it was lifting sanctions on Belarusian potash in the latest sign of a thaw between Washington and the isolated autocracy.",
      "John Coale, the U.S. special envoy for Belarus, made the announcement after meeting Lukashenko in Minsk on Friday and Saturday.",
      "Speaking with journalists, Coale described the two-day talks as \"very productive,\" Belarus' state news agency Belta reported Saturday.",
      "The U.S. envoy said that normalizing relations between Washington and Minsk was \"our goal.\"",
      "\"We're lifting sanctions, releasing prisoners. We're constantly talking to each other,\" he said, according to Belta. He also said that the relationship between the countries was moving from \"baby steps to more confident steps\" as they increased dialogue.",
      "The last time U.S. officials met with Lukashenko in September 2025, Washington announced easing some of the sanctions against Belarus while Minsk released more than 50 political prisoners into Lithuania. Overall, Belarus released more than 430 political prisoners since July 2024, in what was widely seen as an effort at a rapprochement with the West.",
      "Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told The Associated Press on Saturday that sanctions relief was part of a deal between Minsk and Washington, in which another large group of political prisoners in Belarus was expected to be released.",
      "\"The freeing of political prisoners means that Lukashenko understands the pain of Western sanctions and is seeking to ease them,\" Tsikhanouskaya said.",
      "She added: \"But let's not be naive: Lukashenko hasn't changed his policies, his crackdown continues and he keeps on supporting Russia's war against Ukraine. That's why we need to be extremely cautious with any talk of sanctions relief, so that we don't reinforce Russia's war machine and encourage continued repressions.\"",
      "Tsikhnouskaya also described European Union sanctions against Belarusian potash fertilizers as far more painful for Minsk than those imposed by the U.S, saying that while easing U.S. sanctions could lead to the release of political prisoners, European sanctions should push for long-term, systemic changes in Belarus and the end of Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "The latest round of discussions also touched on Venezuela, as well as Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine, Belta said.",
      "Coale told reporters that Lukashenko had given \"good advice\" on how to address the conflict, saying that Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin were \"longtime friends\" with \"the necessary level of relationship to discuss such issues.\"",

      "The latest round of attacks came after Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said Friday that Russian police and National Guard will stay on in eastern Ukraine's Donbas and oversee the industry-rich region, even if a peace settlement ends Russia's nearly four-year war in Ukraine. This underscores Moscow's ambition to maintain its presence in Donbas post-war. Ukraine is likely to reject such a stance as U.S.-led negotiations drag on.",
      "Moscow will give its blessing to a ceasefire only after Ukraine's forces have withdrawn from the front line, Ushakov said in comments published in Russian business daily Kommersant.",
      "Meanwhile, Germany is set to host Zelenskyy on Monday for talks as peace efforts gain momentum and European leaders seek to steer negotiations.",
      "For months, American negotiators have tried to navigate the demands of each side as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for a swift end to Russia's war while growing increasingly exasperated by delays.

    "summary": "Fighting is raging along the Thailand-Cambodia border despite U.S. President Donald Trump's claim of a ceasefire agreement.",
    "story": [
      "Fighting raged Saturday morning along the border of Thailand and Cambodia, even after U.S. President Trump, acting as a mediator, declared that he had won agreement from both countries for a ceasefire.",
      "Thai officials have said they did not agree to a ceasefire, and Cambodia has not commented on Mr. Trump's claim. Its defense ministry instead said Thai jets carried out airstrikes Saturday morning. Cambodian media reported Mr. Trump's claim without elaborating.",
      "Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said Saturday that some of Mr. Trump's remarks didn't \"reflect an accurate understanding of the situation.\"",
      "\"We regret and we're disappointed that some of the points made by President Trump have bearing upon the feeling of the Thai people, Thailand, because we consider ourselves \u2014 we are proud, in fact \u2014 to be the oldest treaty ally of the United States in the region,\" he said.",
      "The latest large-scale fighting was set off by a skirmish on Dec. 7 that wounded two Thai soldiers and derailed a ceasefire promoted by Mr. Trump that ended five days of earlier combat in July over longstanding territorial disputes.",
      "The July ceasefire was brokered by Malaysia and pushed through by pressure from Mr. Trump, who threatened to withhold trade privileges unless Thailand and Cambodia agreed. It was formalized in more detail in October at a regional meeting in Malaysia that Mr. Trump attended.",
      "About two dozen people have officially been reported killed in this past week's fighting, while hundreds of thousands have been displaced on both sides of the border.",
      "The Thai military acknowledges 11 of its troops have been killed, while estimating there have been 165 fatalities among Cambodian soldiers. Cambodia has not announced military casualties, but has said at least 11 civilians have been killed and 76 wounded.",
      "Mr. Trump, on Friday, after speaking to Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, had announced an agreement to restart the ceasefire.",
      "\"They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord made with me, and them, with the help of the Great Prime Minister of Malaysia, Anwar Ibrahim,\" Mr. Trump said in his Truth Social post.",
      "Mr. Trump's claim came after midnight in Bangkok. Thai Prime Minister Anutin had, after his call with Mr. Trump, said he had explained Thailand's reasons for fighting and said peace would depend on Cambodia ceasing its attacks first. The Thai foreign ministry later explicitly disputed Trump's claim that a ceasefire had been reached. Anutin's busy day on Friday included dissolving Parliament, so new elections could be held early next year.",
      "Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, in comments posted early Saturday morning, also made no mention of a ceasefire.",
      "He said he held phone conversations on Friday night with Mr. Trump, and a night earlier with Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, and thanked both \"for their continuous efforts to achieve a long-lasting peace between Cambodia and Thailand.\"",
      "\"Cambodia is ready to cooperate in any way that is needed,' Hun Manet wrote.",
      "Thailand has been carrying out airstrikes on what it says are strictly military targets, while Cambodia has been firing thousands of medium-range BM-21 rockets that have caused havoc but relatively few casualties.",
      "BM-21 rocket launchers can fire up to 40 rockets at a time with a range of 30-40 kilometers (19-25 miles). These rockets cannot be precisely targeted and have landed largely in areas from where most people have already been evacuated.",
      "However, the Thai army announced Saturday that BM-21 rockets had hit a civilian area in Sisaket province, seriously injuring two civilians who had heard warning sirens and had been running toward a bunker for safety.",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 20:13:52 -0500",
    "summary": "The move represents a thawing of sorts in the frosty relationship between the Trump administration and the Brazilian government.",
    "story": [
      "The United States removed Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes from its sanctions list on Friday after initially adding him over his role in leading the trial against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "De Moraes' wife and the Lex Institute, which she leads, were also taken off the list, according to documents from the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control. Brazil's government celebrated the move, which came after a weekend phone conversation between President Trump and Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.",
      "The Trump administration had sanctioned the judge in July, accusing him of using his position to authorize arbitrary pretrial detentions and suppress freedom of expression in Brazil.",
      "In August 2024, de Moraes also ordered that Elon Musk's X platform be suspended in Brazil over allegations it was not doing enough to target misinformation. The ban on the site was lifted two months later. At the time, Musk was a major ally of Mr. Trump and was helping finance his presidential campaign.",
      "A senior Trump administration official said the sanctions were lifted since the U.S. saw the passage of an important amnesty bill by Brazil's lower house as a signal that lawfare conditions in Brazil are improving. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the administration's views on foreign policy interests.",
      "The move represents a thawing of sorts in the frosty relationship between the two governments and follows a number of meetings and calls that both have described in positive terms. Mr. Trump had seen Lula's predecessor Bolsonaro as an ally, with the Brazilian leader even dubbed the \"Trump of the Tropics\" when he came into office.",
      "During Bolsonaro's trial, Mr. Trump called his treatment an \"international disgrace.\" In a\u00a0July 9 letter\u00a0to Lula posted to social media, Mr. Trump said the trial was a \"witch hunt that should end IMMEDIATELY!\"",
      "And in announcing de Moraes' sanction in July, Secretary of State Marco Rubio alleged that the judge had \"abused his authority by engaging in a targeted and politically motivated effort designed to silence political critics through the issuance of secret orders compelling online platforms, including U.S. social media companies, to ban the accounts of individuals for posting protected speech. Moraes further abused his position to authorize unjust pre-trial detentions and undermine freedom of expression.\"",
      "Bolsonaro was accused of masterminding a plot to stay in power despite his 2022 election defeat to Lula.",
      "He was convicted and sentenced to more than 27 years in prison. The embattled 70-year-old leader started serving his sentence last month while still requesting to be put on house arrest due to his poor health. The massive upheaval his allies expected upon his arrest did not materialize, though he remains a politically powerful figure ahead of next year's elections.",
      "Brazil's current government characterized the lifting of sanctions as a \"big defeat\" for Bolsonaro's family.",
      "\"It was Lula who put this repeal [of the sanctions] on Donald Trump's desk, in a dignifying and sovereign dialogue,\" said Gleisi Hoffmann, Brazil's minister for institutional relations. \"It is a big defeat for the family of Jair Bolsonaro, traitors who have conspired against Brazil and the judiciary.\"",
      "Lula's leftist administration has long accused Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker and son of the former president, of misleading Mr. Trump on de Moraes and other members of the court. Eduardo Bolsonaro said he received the news of the sanctions being lifted from de Moraes \"with regret.\"",
      "The younger Bolsonaro, who announced in March that he would start living in the U.S. in order to lobby the Trump administration to help his father avoid jail, said he would continue to fight for Jair Bolsonaro.",
      "\"The lack of internal cohesion and the insufficient support for initiatives pursued abroad contributed to the worsening of the current situation,\" Eduardo Bolsonaro wrote on his social media channels, after Mr. Trump's reversal. \"We sincerely hope that President Donald Trump's decision will be successful in defending the strategic interests of the American people, as is his duty.\"",
      "In initially sanctioning de Moraes, the Treasury Department had cited the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which targets perpetrators of human rights abuse and corrupt officials. De Moraes said the use of the act against him was \"illegal and regrettable.\"",
      "Also in July, the Trump administration imposed a 40% tariff on Brazilian products on top of a 10% tariff imposed earlier, justifying the tariffs by saying that Brazil's policies and criminal prosecution of Bolsonaro constituted an economic emergency.",
      "However, last month the White House announced it was removing the 40% tariffs on certain Brazilian imports, including beef and coffee. The U.S. ran a $6.8 billion trade surplus last year with Brazil, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "Mr. Trump and Lula started mending fences at the United Nations' General Assembly in September, which was followed by their first private meeting in Malaysia in October and subsequent phone conversations.",
      "The Brazilian president has said he wasn't only trying to reverse the increase on tariffs but also to end the sanctions on de Moraes and some members of his government who were also hit by the measure.",
      "Separately, Lula has urged Latin American states to help avoid a conflict in Venezuela as the Trump administration orders military action against vessels allegedly linked to drug cartels.",

    "story": [
      "King Charles III said Friday that his cancer treatment will be reduced in the new year because of early diagnosis, effective intervention and adherence to doctors' orders.",
      "Charles, 77, revealed the information in a recorded message broadcast on British television Friday as part of a campaign to encourage people to take advantage of screening that can detect cancer in its early stages when it is easiest to treat.",
      "Buckingham Palace made the announcement\u00a0last year that doctors had detected cancer in the king.",
      "\"Early diagnosis quite simply saves lives,\" the king said Friday.",
      "\"I know, too, what a difference it has made in my own case, enabling me to continue leading a full and active life even while undergoing treatment,\" he added.",
      "The recorded message gave Charles the opportunity to reflect on his experiences in the 22 months since he announced he would undergo treatment for an undisclosed type of cancer.",
      "He said he had been deeply troubled to learn that at least 9 million people in the U.K. weren't up to date with the cancer screenings available to them.",
      "\"That is at least 9 million opportunities for early diagnosis being missed,\" he stressed.",
      "He highlighted how when bowel cancer is caught at the earliest stage, around nine in 10 people survive for at least five years. \"When diagnosed late, that falls to just one in 10,\" Charles said.",
      "Royal sources said it should not be assumed the king was being treated for bowel cancer. While the palace hasn't specified what type of cancer the king has, officials said the cancer was discovered after treatment for an enlarged prostate revealed \"a separate issue of concern.\"",
      "Charles' decision to disclose his diagnosis was a departure for Britain's royals, who have traditionally considered their health to be a personal matter and shared few details with the public.",
      "\"His majesty has chosen to share his diagnosis to prevent speculation and in the hope it may assist public understanding for all those around the world who are affected by cancer,\" Buckingham Palace said at the time.",
      "Since then, Charles has used his own story to highlight the need for early diagnosis and treatment. Cancer Research UK recorded a 33% increase in visits to its website in the weeks after the king's diagnosis, as people sought information about the signs of cancer.",
      "The monarch suspended public engagements for about two months after his diagnosis so he could focus on his treatment and recovery. But he continued with state business and retained his constitutional role as head of state.",
      "Charles returned to public-facing events in April of last year with a visit to a cancer treatment center at University College Hospital in central London, where he met with staff and shared stories with fellow cancer patients.",

This cannot be compared to other cases, like countries in the Middle East.\"",

      "\"What we're fighting for is precisely freedom in order to have democracy, and democracy in order to have peace,\" she said.",

      "Divers have discovered a long-submerged wall some 7,000 years old under the sea off western France, scientists said Thursday.",
      "Nearly 400 feet long, it was found off the Ile de Sein in Brittany along with a dozen smaller manmade structures from the same period.",
      "\"This is a very interesting discovery that opens up new prospects for underwater archaeology, helping us better understand how coastal societies were organized,\" Yvan Pailler, professor of archaeology at the University of Western Brittany, told AFP.",
      "He co-authored a study on the find, published in the International Journal of Nautical Archaeology.",
      "The structures were first spotted by retired geologist Yves Fouquet in 2017 on charts of the ocean floor produced with a laser system.",
      "The wall is the biggest underwater construction ever found in France, BBC News reported.",
      "Divers explored the site between 2022 and 2024 and confirmed the presence of the granite structures.",
      "\"Archaeologists did not expect to find such well-preserved structures in such a harsh setting,\" Fouquet said.",
      "Dating from between 5,800 and 5,300 BC, they lie nine meters underwater and were built at a time when sea levels were much lower than today.",
      "Researchers believe they may have been fish traps built on the foreshore, or walls to protect against rising seas.",
      "The study says the structures reflect \"technical skills and social organization sufficient to extract, move and erect blocks weighing several tons, similar in mass to many Breton megaliths,\" large stone arrangements used as monuments or for ceremonial purposes.",
      "This technical know-how would predate the first megalithic constructions by several centuries.",
      "The study's authors speculate the site may lie at the origin of local Breton legends of sunken cities, according to BBC News. One such lost city \u2013 Ys \u2013 was believed to lie in the Bay of Douarnenez, just a few miles to the east.",
      "\"It is likely that the abandonment of a territory developed by a highly structured society has become deeply rooted in people's memories,\" the study says. \"The submersion caused by the rapid rise in sea level, followed by the abandonment of fishing structures, protective works, and habitation sites, must have left a lasting impression.\"",

      "The queen of downhill skiing is well and truly back. At age 41, still faster than the rest.",
      "Lindsey Vonn raced to a stunningly fast win in a World Cup downhill at St. Moritz on Friday to earn her first victory in nearly eight years \u2014 and the first in her comeback with titanium implants in her right knee after a five-year retirement.",
      "Several major rivals, including World Cup overall winners Federica Brignone and Lara Gut-Behrami, Olympic champion Corinne Suter and emerging U.S. prospect Lauren Macuga did not race on Friday because of injuries.",
      "Vonn seized the lead by an astonishing 1.16 seconds ahead of Mirjam Puchner of Austria. Even wilder was that Vonn trailed by 0.61 after the first two time checks at the Swiss resort.",
      "The ski great's lead was later cut to 0.98 \u2014 still a massive margin in downhill \u2014 when unheralded Magdalena Egger took second place from teammate Puchner.",
      "\"It was an amazing day, I couldn't be happier, pretty emotional,\" Vonn told Swiss broadcaster RTS. \"I felt good this summer but I wasn't sure how fast I was. I guess I know now how fast I am.\"",
      "Soon after, Vonn shed tears on the podium in the finish area when The Star-Spangled Banner played.",
      "It was a perfect start to her Olympic season to get a first victory since a downhill in March 2018 at Are, Sweden.",
      "Vonn's superb debut working with new coach Aksel Lund Svindal, a men's downhill great who won the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics title, suggests their stellar partnership is paying off.",
      "Her run Friday looked routine when she dropped tenths of seconds to Puchner's time on the top half of the sunbathed Corviglia course, where the finish is at altitude above 6,500 feet.",
      "Vonn then was faster than anyone through the next speed checks, touching 74 miles per hour, and posted the fastest time splits for the bottom half.",
      "She skied through the finish area and bumped against the inflated safety barrier, lay down in the snow and raised her arms on seeing her time. Vonn got up, punched the air with her right fist and shrieked with joy before putting her hands to her left cheek in the style of Steph Curry's \"Night, night\" gesture.",
      "Olympic goals",
      "The 2010 Olympic champion is targeting another gold medal at the Milan Cortina Winter Games in February. Women's Alpine skiing is at the storied Cortina d'Ampezzo course in the Dolomites, which Vonn has mastered in her career with 12 World Cup race wins.",
      "\"Obviously my goal is Cortina but if this is the way we start I think I'm in a good spot,\" said Vonn, who will be favored for another downhill win Saturday at St. Moritz.",
      "Vonn told CBS Sunday Morning earlier this year that she \"never thought\" she would be talking about going to the Olympics again. Just talking about heading to Italy means she is \"already winning,\" she said.",
      "\"I will be at a disadvantage,\" Vonn said. \"I am 40, and at that time next year I will be 41. But I know my skiing is there. I think I'm actually skiing better now than I was last few years of my career.\"",
      "Vonn said she has been welcomed \u2014 and teased \u2014 by younger skiers on the U.S. team.",
      "\"There's one girl that calls me Grandma, which I don't exactly appreciate!\" Vonn said. \"But there's definitely some jokes around the team that, you know, I raced in my first Olympics before one of the girls was born.\"",
      "44 wins in 24 years",
      "Friday's race was Vonn's 125th start in World Cup downhill in her storied career, 24 years after the first at Lake Louise, Canada.",
      "She has now won a record-extending 44 of them, including at St. Moritz in 2012, and has 83 race victories across all World Cup disciplines.",
      "Her previous win at Are came weeks after Vonn took bronze in downhill at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games in South Korea won by Sofia Goggia, who placed fourth Friday. That Olympics was Vonn's fourth and the last she attended.",
      "She also won gold in downhill at the Vancouver Olympics in 2010, and at the 2009 world championships at Val d'Isere, France.",
      "Such is Vonn's dominance in downhill, she has more World Cup wins in the fastest discipline than the other 60 racers combined who started Friday, the International Ski and Snowboard Federation said.",
      "A series of serious injuries this year robbed Friday's race of World Cup overall winners Federica Brignone and Lara Gut-Behrami, Olympic champion Corinne Suter and emerging U.S. prospect Lauren Macuga.",
      "Two-time Olympic gold medalist Michelle Gisin had surgery on her back Thursday, after crashing hard in a training run at the fastest part of the St. Moritz course.",

    "summary": "Two former MI6 officials detail their espionage concerns, as the U.K once again delays its final decision on a new Chinese embassy in London.",
    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom once again delayed its decision last week on whether to green light China's push for a new, massive embassy in the heart of London. It would not only be the largest Chinese embassy in Europe, but also one of the largest in the world.",
      "Beijing's hope, however, still hangs in frustrated limbo after three decision delays, six major anti-embassy protests and Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week calling China \"a country that poses real national security threats to the United Kingdom.\" His defense minister further cited \"complexities of the national security implications.\"",
      "Critics fear the so-called \"super embassy\" could serve as a super hub for intelligence gathering \u2014 physically and technologically, impacting not just the United Kingdom, but also the continent.",
      "\"There are important fiber optic cables that either run under the site or very close to the site, which carry probably massive amounts of important and valuable data,\" said Sir Richard Dearlove, former chief of Britain's MI6, the U.K.'s foreign intelligence agency.",
      "Dearlove has called on the U.K. government to reject China's embassy ambitions, with cables possibly transmitting sensitive financial and commercial data across London.",
      "\"Having a Chinese embassy sitting on top of those cables, which could in extremis be attacked, is a significant problem,\" he added.",
      "With a larger physical presence, Beijing could also employ more Chinese diplomatic staff, who would have freedom of movement allowed by their visas.",
      "\"If it's got a very large embassy, there could be a very large number, and then going off to third countries, ostensibly on holiday or whatever, or to travel, and doing stuff outside the country to which they're accredited,\" said Dearlove.",
      "\"They're purporting to be ordinary diplomats, ordinary attaches, who are actually highly trained intelligence personnel,\" he said.",
      "Beijing might also more easily target communications from the defense and foreign ministries using facilities based within a bigger embassy, said Nigel Inkster, former MI6 director of operations and intelligence and now senior adviser for cyber security and China at the Institute for International and Strategic Studies.",
      "\"Not all systems, not all government systems use the internet,\" Inkster said. \"Most sensitive information is air-gapped. In other words, it goes on systems that do not have any connection to the public internet, and therefore, if you're going to try and access them, you are going to have to get closer to where they are actually being generated.\"",
      "\"Would China like to get ahold of such data?\" he added. \"Yes, because China's appetite to acquire data on other countries is limitless. They're completely promiscuous about what overseas data they collect.\"",
      "Site of proposed embassy is in heart of London",
      "British pushback also stems from history and pride. The site of China's would-be embassy overlooks the iconic Tower of London and The Shard. It is the former home of the Royal Mint, which engraved coins with the monarch's face as a physical manifestation of the crown's authority.",
      "In 2018, the government sold the grounds to Beijing for nearly $350 million, setting up the more than five-acre site to become a physical fortress of Chinese state power in the West.",
      "\"One of the reasons I object \u2014 maybe the main reason \u2014 is the symbolism of allowing the Chinese communist government such a prominent position on the edge of the city in such a prominent building,\" said Dearlove. \"It sends entirely the wrong signals.\"",
      "Taking up an entire city block and spanning five acres, architectural renderings indicate China's new embassy would dwarf its embassy in Washington, D.C. by about three times and its current embassy in London by about 10 times. It took our CBS News team more than nine minutes to walk the perimeter.",
      "Schematics show plans for a cultural center and more than 200 apartments for embassy staff \u2014 not a common feature of Western governments' embassies but employed by some authoritarian governments including Russia, North Korea and Cuba to keep employees close at hand.",
      "CBS News got a first-hand look at the future embassy residences \u2014 buildings that sit on the site that is owned by the Chinese government. They are currently empty.",
      "Mark Nygate, a 28-year resident just next door in the London borough of Tower Hamlets, gave CBS News a tour of his building and the inner parking lot that abuts the Royal Mint grounds. A simple, low wooden fence separates the two.",
      "\"I call it the little wooden fence of China,\" he said jokingly.",
      "He and his neighbors fear that the Chinese government will eventually push them out.",
      "\"The idea is that at some point they will want to make this a harder border for them, make their staff more secure,\" he said. \"They could try and buy us out.\"",
      "Fear from China's exiles and dissidents",
      "Thousands of anti-embassy protestors, Chinese dissidents and exiles marched through central London this past weekend, newly galvanized after Starmer's most recent decision delay. Many held large flags showing support for Hong Kong, Taiwan and Tibet.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/secret-mission-maria-corina-machado-out-of-venezuela/",
    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 10:36:00 -0500",
    "summary": "An American special forces veteran led the operation to get Mar\u00eda Corina Machado out of Venezuela: \"The first Nobel Prize winner that we've ever rescued.\"",
    "story": [
      "It took an American private rescue team 15 to 16 hours to get Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado out of her country and safely on her way to Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize, and to be reunited with her family on Wednesday. The vast majority of that time was spent in rough seas, and the man who led the operation and met Machado on a boat told CBS News, \"no one was enjoying that ride, especially Maria!\"",
      "\"No one's blood pressure was low, throughout any phase of this operation, including mine,\" said Bryan Stern, a U.S. special forces veteran who heads the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation. \"It was dangerous. It was scary. The sea conditions were ideal for us, but certainly not water that you would want to be on ... the higher the waves, the harder it is for radar to see. That's how it works.\"",
      "In an interview Wednesday with CBS News, Stern gave some insight into the complex operation his organization undertook to get Machado out of Venezuela and on a plane to Norway, where she was reunited with her children for the first time in about two years. A representative for Machado confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that Grey Bull was behind the rescue operation that began on Tuesday.",
      "Of the hundreds of rescues his organization has carried out, he said this was both one of the most challenging and the most rewarding. Machado has lived in hiding in her own country for almost a year, fearing persecution by the regime of President Nicolas Maduro, who is under increasing pressure from President Trump amid a U.S. military buildup off his shores.",
      "\"She has a very large target on her back,\" Stern said of Machado. \"This is not a random shopkeeper who doesn't wanna be in Venezuela anymore. This is moving around a rock star.\"",
      "\"She's the first Nobel Prize winner that we've ever rescued, you know? She's the first person that we've ever rescued that has billboards with her face all over it in a country, where there's protests in her favor. We've never rescued anybody with her status, with her stature,\" he said.",
      "Her high profile, combined with the Maduro regime taking \"a very defensive posture because of the American military buildup,\" meant huge risks for the operation, and Stern was reluctant to divulge much detail about the operation on land, \"because we still have other work to do in Venezuela, and we don't want to put sources and methods and people who worked on this at risk.\"",
      "But once Machado had been spirited off Venezuelan soil onto a boat, she was ferried to a rendezvous at sea, and Stern was there himself to welcome her onto his boat for a 13-14 hour journey to an undisclosed location where she caught her flight to Oslo.",
      "He said around two dozen people were involved directly within his team, but many more played a role - from providing intelligence to translation and logistics - including some who may never even know that they helped.",
      "Stern and Grey Bull were in charge of the land and maritime portion of the extraction, which he said had to be planned in only about four days, though his organization has been preparing for operations in Venezuela for months.",
      "He said the operation was funded by \"a few generous donors,\" none of whom \u2013 to his knowledge \u2013 were U.S. government officials.",
      "\"The U.S. government did not contribute a single penny to this operation, at least not that I know of,\" Stern said.",
      "He acknowledged that he and his organization did \"unofficially collaborate\" with the U.S. military about positioning and plans, largely to avoid being targeted inadvertently.",
      "Asked about reports that a private extractions specialist contracted by the Trump administration had met Machado in the small Caribbean island nation of Cura\u00e7ao, Stern told CBS News: \"I'm the contractor who specializes in extractions, and I've never been hired by Donald Trump.\"",
      "\"I did not meet her in Cura\u00e7ao. I met her somewhere else. I met her really far away from Curacao. Extremely far,\" he said.",
      "The moment when Machado climbed onto his boat was among the \"moments of transition\" that present the most risk for any rescue operation, he said.",
      "Stern wouldn't say where exactly that happened, beyond it being on a boat in the Caribbean, but he did say the nighttime rendezvous, and the conversation he had with the Venezuelan \"freedom fighter\" in the ensuing hours, made an impression on him.",
      "\"Personally, I was starstruck. She's a hero of mine,\" said Stern. \"When I got to see her for the first time and validate that it was her, my heart skipped a beat.\"",
      "The rough seas and dark skies on Tuesday night were perfect for operating covertly, he said, but they didn't make for an enjoyable ride.",
      "\"The maritime domain is the most unforgiving domain. This was in the middle of the night - very little moon, a little bit of cloud cover, very hard to see, boats have no lights.\"",
      "By the time she climbed aboard, \"all of us were pretty wet. My team and I were soaked to the gills. She was pretty cold and wet, too. She had a very arduous journey.\"",
      "\"She was very happy. She was very excited. She was very tired,\" he said.",
      "Asked about the fact that Machado eventually arrived in Oslo too late to attend Wednesday's Nobel Prize ceremony in person, Stern said \"nothing went wrong, it just took time.\"",
      "\"From my perspective at least, her life was the most important aspect of this. A ceremony is great, but I don't look at this operation as getting Maria to a ceremony on time,\" he said. \"I look at this operation as saving a freedom fighter's life, as saving a mother's life.\"",
      "\"We talked about her seeing her children for the first time in two years and I almost cried,\" Stern told CBS News. \"She's a tough-as-nails, hard-as-woodpecker-lips woman, person, but she's still a mom, and she talked about how excited she was to see her children. It's been two long years.\"",
      "He said being able to facilitate that reunion \"truly was a blessing. We could not feel more privileged or honored to support this operation. She truly is a hero of mine. I've looked at her as an inspirational defender of freedom as long as I've known of her. So to be asked to support this, to conduct this operation, truly was a huge honor, a privilege for us.\"",
      "Machado and her daughter, who accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on her mother's behalf Wednesday, said the opposition leader intended to return to Venezuela. Stern said he advised her point-blank against it.",
      "\"I think she's crazy. She's such a tough \u2014 you know, they call her the iron lady for a reason. I told her, 'Don't go back.'\"",
      "Asked if Grey Bull would help her get back into the country, Stern told CBS News, \"we've never done an infil, we've only done exfil. So, I don't think so \u2026 That's for her to determine and for her to decide. But I think she should not go back. But she wants to. Maria is truly inspirational.\"",

      "8. Insulin sensitivity test",
      "Some clinicians use additional markers of insulin sensitivity when taking a more proactive approach to metabolic health. These measures can provide insights that go beyond standard tests such as fasting glucose and HbA1c, which reflects average blood glucose over the past two to three months.",
      "\"Insulin resistance influences nearly every major organ, including the liver and the brain,\" Liff told Fox News Digital. \"It plays a major role in metabolic health, long-term inflammation and future disease risk.\"",

      "Major health agencies, such as the ADA (American Diabetes Association), USPSTF, CDC and WHO, generally recommend screening for diabetes and prediabetes using fasting glucose, HbA1c or a standard oral glucose tolerance test.",
      "9. Hormone levels",
      "Caamano recommends that certain men over 40 get tested for hormones, including total testosterone, free testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol, which can be measured in a blood draw.",

      "TWO KEY HEART HEALTH METRICS COULD DETERMINE HOW LONG YOU'LL LIVE",
      "Consistency is key in hormonal testing, according to the doctor. \"Testosterone should be measured in the morning, as it follows a pattern, peaking in the morning hours,\" Caamano said. \"Hormonal blood levels, along with symptoms, help determine the need for TRT.\"",
      "The Endocrine Society, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), USPSTF and the American Urological Association only recommend hormone tests when there are clear symptoms or medical indications.",

    "story": [
      "",
      "The final legislation governing Pentagon spending dropped a bipartisan provision that would have guaranteed the military the right to repair its own equipment, prompting immediate criticism from its authors, Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, and Tim Sheehy, R-MT, who accused Congress of siding with defense contractors over service members.",
      "Both chambers had passed versions of the reform, and the White House publicly supported the measure, which would have required contractors to provide the Pentagon with the technical data needed to perform repairs in-house \u2014 rather than flying out manufacturer technicians at added cost. The final National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) omits that mandate, a move Warren and Sheehy say will leave troops facing the same barriers to fixing equipment whenever contractors assert proprietary rights.",
      "\"For decades, the Pentagon has relied on a broken acquisition system that is routinely defended by career bureaucrats and corporate interests. Military right to repair reforms are supported by the Trump White House, the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, entrepreneurs, small businesses, and our brave servicemembers,\" Warren and Sheehy said after the text of the legislation was released. \"The only ones against this common-sense reform are those taking advantage of a broken status quo at the expense of our warfighters and taxpayers.\"",

      "GAO reviews of aircraft, ships and ground vehicles have found that when contractors retain exclusive control over repair information, the military is forced into long-term vendor support arrangements that are far more expensive than in-house maintenance. In several cases, GAO concluded that obtaining necessary data earlier in the acquisition process would have given the Pentagon more flexibility, reduced downtime, and lowered costs for everything from software fixes to depot-level repairs.",
      "Sources familiar with the NDAA negotiations claimed that, behind closed doors, lobbyists had persuaded leaders on the House and Senate Armed Services Committee to drop the more aggressive right to repair language.",
      "\"This is a textbook case of the swamp prevailing at the expense of our warfighters and government efficiency,\" one source said. \"Does (War Secretary Pete) Hegseth realize that Boeing just knocked the legs out from our warriors?\"",
      "A spokesperson for the House Armed Services Committee said: \"The Committee is committed to addressing the right to repair issue in a manner that ensures our warfighters have the data they need to effectuate repairs while preserving the intellectual property of private industry.\"",
      "\"The FY26 NDAA requires the Department to audit its contracts to determine where they are missing data rights they need and determine whether any missing data rights is the result of a defective law or a defective contract.\u00a0 If the law is defective, the department needs to make recommendations to Congress on how to fix it.\"",
      "Watchdogs also questioned the weaker compromise.",
      "\"The provisions are nowhere near strong enough,\" said Greg Williams of the Project on Government Oversight. \"They help catalog the problem, but they don\u2019t really do anything to solve it.\" Williams added that the original proposals \"acknowledged the cost and committed to paying fair, reasonable prices to vendors for that intellectual property,\" countering industry arguments that the bill would have seized or devalued contractors\u2019 data.",

      "\"This debate is not about ensuring equipment and technology can be repaired in contested environments; commanders already have broad authority to keep mission-critical systems operational,\" said Marta Hernandez, spokesperson for the Aerospace Industries Association. \"Our concern with the Senate proposal is its sweeping mandate for government takeover of IP \u2014 without regard to necessity or cost. \u2018One size fits all\u2019 doesn\u2019t work for our troops or for the industry that equips them.\"",
      "But military officials and watchdogs say that while commanders can authorize emergency fixes, that authority does not give units the technical data, software access, or parts needed to actually perform repairs. They argue that crews remain dependent on contractors even when they have the skills to fix the equipment themselves.",
      "Instead of requiring contractors to provide repair data, the final NDAA directs the Pentagon to create a database cataloging what technical information it currently has and to \"request options\" from contractors when data is missing. Critics say the language has no enforcement mechanism and leaves manufacturers free to refuse, preserving the contractor-controlled repair model the reform sought to change.",

But advocates said a service-by-service approach wasn\u2019t enough and pushed to codify and expand right to repair across all branches to prevent contractors from controlling critical maintenance information.",
      "The F-35 program offers one of the clearest examples of how restricted repair rights drive up costs.",
      "GAO has found that the Pentagon still lacks key technical data needed to perform many F-35 repairs organically, forcing the services to rely on Lockheed Martin and its subcontractors for everything from software maintenance to component overhauls. That dependence has helped push sustainment costs so high that the Pentagon warns it cannot afford to operate the planned fleet without major changes.",
      "GAO reported that greater access to repair data could save the department billions over the jet\u2019s projected life cycle, reduce turnaround times for broken parts, and allow military depots to take on work that is currently outsourced back to the contractor.",

      "The consequences of contractor restrictions are already visible across the force.

      "The House Oversight Committee is ramping up its probe into Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Republican lawmakers say the scale of the state\u2019s exploding fraud schemes draw questions about whether top officials should have been able to detect and stop them ahead of time.",
      "To Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn., the fraud schemes coming from his state are so numerous and so costly that he believes they represent either \"incompetence or dereliction of duty.\"",
      "\"Well, with the magnitude of the fraud, I find it really almost impossible that the governor or his staff and the attorney general didn't know,\" Stauber said. \"And the Minnesota taxpayers are paying for it.\"",

      "\"We want to know how much fraud. Is it still ongoing? Were people aware [and] turned a blind eye? That\u2019s pretty much the purpose of our investigation,\" Comer said on Friday.",

      "The most prominent example, the Feeding Our Future scheme, resulted in a $250 million loss when fraudsters received payments from the state for services that went unfulfilled, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).",

According to the Minnesota Reformer, payments for the state\u2019s autism program went from $6 million to over $190 million since 2018.",

      "Cybercriminals keep getting better at blending into the software you use every day.",
      "Over the past few years, we've seen phishing pages that copy banking portals, fake browser alerts that claim your device is infected and \"human verification\" screens that push you to run commands you should never touch. The latest twist comes from the ongoing ClickFix campaign.",
      "Instead of asking you to prove you are human, attackers now disguise themselves as a Windows update. It looks convincing enough that you might follow the instructions without thinking, which is exactly what they want.",

      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "The malware hides inside seemingly normal image files, using steganography to slip past traditional security tools.\u00a0 (Microsoft)",
      "How the fake update works",
      "Researchers noticed that ClickFix has upgraded its old trick. The campaign used to rely on human verification pages, but now you get a full-screen Windows update screen that looks almost identical to the real thing. Joe Security showed how the page displays fake progress bars, familiar update messages and a prompt that tells you to complete a critical security update.",
      "If you are on Windows, the site tells you to open the Run box, copy something from your clipboard and paste it in. That \"something\" is a command that silently downloads a malware dropper. The final payload is usually an infostealer, which steals passwords, cookies and other data from your machine.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "Fake update screens are getting harder to spot as attackers mimic Windows with near-perfect precision. (Joe Security)",
      "The moment you paste the command, the infection chain begins. First, a file called mshta.exe reaches out to a remote server and grabs a script. To avoid detection, these URLs often use hex encoding for parts of the address and rotate their paths. The script then runs obfuscated PowerShell code filled with junk instructions to throw researchers off. Once PowerShell does its work, it decrypts a hidden .NET assembly that functions as the loader.",
      "Why is this attack so hard to detect?",
      "The loader hides its next stage inside what looks like a regular PNG file. ClickFix uses custom steganography, which is a technique that hides secret data inside normal-looking content. In this case, the malware sits inside the image's pixel data. The attackers tweak color values in certain pixels, especially in the red channel, to embed pieces of shellcode. When you view the image, everything appears normal.",
      "The script knows exactly where the hidden data sits. It extracts the pixel values, decrypts them and rebuilds the malware directly in memory. That means nothing obvious is written to disk. Security tools that rely on file scanning miss it, since the shellcode never appears as a standalone file.",
      "Once rebuilt, the shellcode is injected into a trusted Windows process like explorer.exe. The attack uses familiar in-memory techniques such as VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread. Recent ClickFix activity has delivered infostealers like LummaC2 and updated versions of Rhadamanthys. These tools are built to harvest credentials and send them back to the attacker with very little noise.",
      "Once the hidden code loads into a trusted Windows process, infostealers quietly begin harvesting your data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself from the ClickFix campaign",
      "The best way to stay protected is to slow down for a moment and follow a few steps that cut off these attacks before they start.",
      "If any site tells you to paste a command into Run, PowerShell or Terminal, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Real operating system updates never require you to run commands from a webpage. When you run that command, you hand full control to the attacker. If something feels off, close the page and don't interact further.",
      "Updates should only come from the Windows Settings app or through official system notifications. A browser tab or pop-up pretending to be a Windows update is always fake. If you see anything outside the normal update flow asking for your action, ignore it and check the real Windows Update page yourself.",
      "Choose a security suite that can detect both file-based and in-memory threats. Stealthy attacks like ClickFix avoid leaving obvious files for scanners to pick up. Tools with behavioral detection, sandboxing and script monitoring give you a much better chance of spotting unusual activity early.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Password managers create strong, unique passwords for every account you use. They also autofill only on legitimate websites, which helps you catch fake login pages. If a manager refuses to fill out your credentials, take a second look at the URL before entering anything manually.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Many attacks start by targeting emails and personal details already exposed online. Data removal services help shrink your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from data broker sites that collect and sell your information. They can't erase everything, but reducing your exposure means fewer attackers have easy access to your details.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A convincing layout doesn't mean it is legitimate. Always look at the domain name first. If it doesn't match the official site or uses odd spelling or extra characters, close it. Attackers rely on the fact that people recognize a page's design but ignore the address bar.",
      "Fake update pages often run in full-screen mode to hide the browser interface and make the page look like part of your computer. If a site suddenly goes full screen without your permission, exit with Esc or Alt+Tab. Once you're out, scan your system and don't return to that page.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "ClickFix works because it leans on user interaction. Nothing happens unless you follow the instructions on the screen. That makes the fake Windows update page especially dangerous, because it taps into something most people trust. If you are used to Windows updates freezing your screen, you may not question a prompt that appears during the process. Cybercriminals know this. They copy trusted interfaces to lower your guard and then rely on you to run the final command. The technical tricks that follow are complex, but the starting point is simple. They need you to help them.",

      "Inside the Source of Life dome",
      "The 21-foot structure sits on a base with four water zones that support marine fish, brackish species and freshwater species. Their waste creates the nutrients that feed the plant layers above. Microbes convert ammonia into nitrates that plants love.",
      "Above the tanks are four hydroponic tiers. Salt-tolerant greens grow over the seawater tank. Tomatoes and semi-salt-tolerant veggies thrive in the brackish zone. Herbs and lettuce sit above freshwater species like sturgeon. Edible flowers fill the top layer where sunlight hits strongest. The layout functions like an ecological slice from ocean to land instead of floors.",

      "Plants grow in stacked hydroponic layers that match the salinity zones of the aquatic life below. (VikingDome)",
      "How cities may use systems like this",
      "If these domes scale, cities could spread food production across many rooftops instead of one large farm. That shift boosts resilience and reduces shipping. It also lets people see where their food comes from, because it grows within reach.",
      "Why this dome matters",
      "The dome shows how biodiversity can improve food production. With more plant and aquatic species working together, the system stays stable and feeds itself. It does not rely on soil, open land or predictable weather. Cities with tight spaces can use this kind of setup to grow food right where people live.",
      "Researchers from Osaka Metropolitan University and the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology designed the system to copy nature. It follows the same recycling found in healthy wetlands. By letting biology do the work, the system reduces strain on land and water.",
      "The system shows how cities may produce fresh food on rooftops and small urban spaces. (VikingDome)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This model hints at a future where fresh food sits closer to your kitchen. A dome like this could sit on an apartment building or a school and provide herbs, produce and edible flowers. It cuts travel time from farm to table and gives communities more control over their food supply.",
      "If a storm or disaster blocks access to farms, a closed-loop dome can keep growing. For people with tiny yards or no soil, it offers a realistic way to produce clean food in small spaces.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Source of Life dome may be a prototype, but it delivers a vivid preview of urban food production. It combines architecture, ecology and aquaculture in a compact package that uses every drop of water. If future cities adopt systems like this, access to fresh food could improve for millions.",

      "ChatGPT went from novelty to necessity in less than two years. It is now part of how you work, learn, write, code and search. OpenAI has said the service has roughly 800 million weekly active users, which puts it in the same weight class as the biggest consumer platforms in the world.",
      "When a tool becomes that central to your daily life, you assume the people running it can keep your data safe. That trust took a hit recently after OpenAI confirmed that personal information linked to API accounts had been exposed in a breach involving one of its third-party partners.",

      "The breach highlights how even trusted analytics partners can expose sensitive account details. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the ChatGPT breach",
      "OpenAI's notification email places the breach squarely on Mixpanel, a major analytics provider the company used on its API platform. The email stresses that OpenAI's own systems were not breached. No chat histories, billing information, passwords or API keys were exposed. Instead, the stolen data came from Mixpanel's environment and included names, email addresses, Organization IDs, coarse location and technical metadata from user browsers.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "That sounds harmless on the surface. The email calls this \"limited\" analytics data, but the label feels like PR cushioning more than anything else. For attackers, this kind of metadata is gold. A dataset that reveals who you are, where you work, what machine you use and how your account is structured gives threat actors everything they need to run targeted phishing and impersonation campaigns.",
      "The biggest red flag is the exposure of Organization IDs. Anyone who builds on the OpenAI API knows how sensitive these identifiers are. They sit at the center of internal billing, usage limits, account hierarchy and support workflows. If an attacker quotes your Org ID during a fake billing alert or support request, it suddenly becomes very hard to dismiss the message as a scam.",
      "OpenAI's own reconstructed timeline raises bigger questions. Mixpanel first detected a smishing attack on November 8. Attackers accessed internal systems the next day and exported OpenAI's data. That data was gone for more than two weeks before Mixpanel told OpenAI on November 25. Only then did OpenAI alert everyone. It is a long and worrying silent period, and it left API users exposed to targeted attacks without even knowing they were at risk. OpenAI says it cut Mixpanel off the next day.",
      "The size of the risk and the policy problem behind it",
      "The timing and the scale matter here. ChatGPT sits at the center of the generative AI boom. It does not just have consumer traffic. It has sensitive conversations from developers, employees, startups and enterprises. Even though the breach affected API accounts rather than consumer chat history, the exposure still highlights a wider issue. When a platform reaches almost a billion weekly users, any crack becomes a national-scale problem.",
      "Regulators have been warning about this exact scenario. Vendor security is one of the weak links in modern tech policy. Data protection laws tend to focus on what a company does with the information you give them. They rarely provide strong guardrails around the entire chain of third-party services that process this data along the way. Mixpanel is not an obscure operator. It is a widely used analytics platform trusted by thousands of companies. Yet it still lost a dataset that should never have been accessible to an attacker.",
      "Companies should treat analytics providers the same way they treat core infrastructure. If you cannot guarantee that your vendors follow the same security standards you do, you should not be collecting the data in the first place. For a platform as influential as ChatGPT, the responsibility is even higher. People do not fully understand how many invisible services sit behind a single AI query. They trust the brand they interact with, not the long list of partners behind it.",

      "8 steps you can take to stay safer when using AI tools",
      "If you rely on AI tools every day, it's worth tightening your personal security before your data ends up floating around in someone else's analytics dashboard. You cannot control how every vendor handles your information, but you can make it much harder for attackers to target you.",
      "Treat every AI account as if it holds something valuable because it does. Long, unique passwords stored in a reliable password manager reduce the fallout if one platform gets breached. This also protects you from credential stuffing, where attackers try the same password across multiple services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "AI platforms have become prime targets, so they rely on stronger 2FA. Use an authenticator app or a hardware security key. SMS codes can be intercepted or redirected, which makes them unreliable during large-scale phishing campaigns.",
      "Another important step you can take to protect yourself from phishing attacks is to install strong antivirus software on your devices. This can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping you keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "PARENTS BLAME CHATGPT FOR SON\u2019S SUICIDE, LAWSUIT ALLEGES OPENAI WEAKENED SAFEGUARDS TWICE BEFORE TEEN\u2019S DEATH",
      "Think twice before pasting private conversations, company documents, medical notes or addresses into a chat window. Many AI tools store recent history for model improvements unless you opt out, and some route data through external vendors. Anything you paste could live on longer than you expect.",
      "Attackers often combine leaked metadata with information they pull from people-search sites and old listings. A good data-removal service scans the web for exposed personal details and submits removal requests on your behalf. Some services even let you send custom links for takedowns. Cleaning up these traces makes targeted phishing and impersonation attacks much harder to pull off.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Attackers know users panic when they hear about API limits, billing failures or account verification issues. If you get an email claiming to be from an AI provider, do not click the link. Open the site manually or use the official app to confirm whether the alert is real.",
      "Events like this show why strengthening your personal security habits matters more than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A lot of attacks succeed because devices run outdated operating systems or browsers. Regular updates close vulnerabilities that could be used to steal session tokens, capture keystrokes or hijack login flows. Updates are boring, but they prevent a surprising amount of trouble.",
      "Old accounts sit around with old passwords and old data, and they become easy targets. If you're not actively using a particular AI tool anymore, delete it from your account list and remove any saved information. It reduces your exposure and limits how many databases contain your details.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This breach may not have touched chat logs or payment details, but it shows how fragile the wider AI ecosystem can be. Your data is only as safe as the least secure partner in the chain. With ChatGPT now approaching a billion weekly users, that chain needs tighter rules, better oversight and fewer blind spots. If anything, this should be a reminder that the rush toward AI adoption needs stronger policy guardrails. Companies cannot hide behind transparent emails after the fact. They need to prove that the tools you rely on every day are secure at every layer, including the ones you never see.",

      "THIS CHROME VPN EXTENSION SECRETLY SPIES ON YOU",
      "Malicious extensions spread through trusted browsers and quietly collected user data for years. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the ShadyPanda campaign unfolded",
      "The operation included 20 malicious Chrome extensions and 125 on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store. Many first appeared in 2018 with no obvious warning signs. Five years later, the extensions began receiving staged updates that changed their behavior.",
      "Koi Security found that these updates rolled out through each browser's trusted auto-update system. Users did not need to click anything. No phishing. No fake alerts. Just quiet version bumps that slowly turned safe extensions into powerful tracking tools.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "WeTab functions as a sophisticated surveillance platform disguised as a productivity tool. (Koi)",
      "What the extensions were doing behind the scenes",
      "Once activated, the extensions injected tracking code into real links to earn revenue from user purchases. They also hijacked searches, redirected queries and logged data for sale and manipulation. ShadyPanda gathered an unusually broad range of personal information, including browsing history, search terms, cookies, keystrokes, fingerprint data, local storage, and even mouse movement coordinates. As the extensions gained credibility in the stores, the attackers pushed a backdoor update that allowed hourly remote code execution. That gave them full browser control, letting them monitor websites visited and exfiltrate persistent identifiers.",
      "Researchers also discovered that the extensions could launch adversary-in-the-middle attacks. This allowed credential theft, session hijacking and code injection on any website. If users opened developer tools, the extensions switched into harmless mode to avoid detection. Google removed the malicious extensions from the Chrome Web Store. We reached out to the company, and a spokesperson confirmed that none of the extensions listed are currently live on the platform.",
      "Meanwhile, a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy, \"We have removed all the extensions identified as malicious on the Edge Add-on store. When we become aware of instances that violate our policies, we take appropriate action that includes, but is not limited to, the removal of prohibited content or termination of our publishing agreement.\"",

      "Call Reason appears inside the Phone by Google app on Android devices. The feature only works when both people use Google's default calling app and the contact is saved in your phone. Many Android phones ship with Phone by Google preinstalled, especially Pixel models, while others like Samsung may use their own dialer instead.

      "FBI WARNS EMAIL USERS AS HOLIDAY SCAMS SURGE",
      "Scam emails posing as MetaMask alerts are tricking users into revealing their crypto wallet details. (Photographer: Wei Leng Tay/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "What is MetaMask and why scammers love it",
      "MetaMask is a popular crypto wallet and browser extension that lets you store tokens and connect to blockchain apps on networks such as Ethereum. Because MetaMask is widely known and trusted, criminals impersonate it in phishing campaigns that ask users to \"verify\" wallets and then harvest recovery phrases or keys.",
      "What makes this email a wallet verification scam",
      "The scam email copies MetaMask visuals and even routes through a Zendesk address to look more professional, yet the \"Verify Wallet Ownership\" button points to an unrelated domain that has nothing to do with MetaMask. That mismatch between branding and destination is a major red flag in crypto phishing attacks. It also relies on classic pressure tactics and vague corporate language. The body reads:",
      "Dear Valued User,As part of our ongoing commitment to account security, we require verification to confirm ownership of your wallet.This essential security measure helps protect your assets and maintain the integrity of our platform.Action Required By: December 03, 2025Your prompt attention to this verification will help ensure uninterrupted access to your account and maintain the highest level of security protection.",
      "Phrases like\u00a0\"Dear Valued User,\"\u00a0\"essential security measure\" and \"Action Required By\" are common in phishing emails that pretend to be MetaMask and threaten restrictions if you do not comply. Genuine MetaMask support will direct you to metamask.io or official apps and will never ask you to reveal your secret recovery phrase through a link in an unsolicited email.",
      "In this case, the message even claims to come from \"\u041c\u0435t\u0430\u041c\u0430sk.io (Support@\u041c\u0435t\u0430\u041c\u0430sk.io)\" <support@z3nbetting.zendesk.com>. That display name looks like MetaMask Support, but the real sending address is an unrelated Zendesk subdomain, which is a classic red flag. MetaMask explains that legitimate support messages only come from specific official addresses, so anything else should be treated as a scam and ignored.",
      "Why mention Zendesk can be misleading",
      "Zendesk is a legitimate customer support platform that many companies use to manage tickets and notifications. Scammers sometimes route fake alerts through such services or spoof similar addresses, so messages look like real support tickets, which can fool users who associate Zendesk branding with trust.",
      "In this case, the presence of a Zendesk-style address does not make the message safe because the link still leads away from MetaMask's official website and asks you to react to manufactured urgency.",

      "Phishing messages urging MetaMask \"wallet verification\" direct victims to fake websites that steal recovery phrases. (Photo by Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Steps to stay safe from wallet verification scam emails",
      "Taking the right precautions can protect your digital wallet and personal data from scammers.",
      "Avoid clicking buttons or links in unexpected wallet verification emails, even if they show the MetaMask logo. Instead, open your browser and type metamask.io yourself or use the official mobile app to check for any real alerts. Also, install strong antivirus software to detect malicious links, fake sites or malware that tries to capture your keystrokes.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Keep it updated so it can block new phishing infrastructure and known scam domains.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Always confirm that the address bar shows MetaMask's official domain or your wallet provider's genuine site before you sign in. If an email link sends you to a domain that looks odd, close it immediately.",
      "Never enter your secret recovery phrase, password or private keys on a site you reached by email. MetaMask support will not ask for that information, and anyone who gets it can empty your wallet.",
      "Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) wherever your exchange or related accounts support it, since codes from an app or key add a barrier even if a password leaks. Store backup codes safely offline, so criminals cannot reach them.",
      "REAL APPLE SUPPORT EMAILS USED IN NEW PHISHING SCAM",
      "Criminals are spoofing Zendesk-style addresses to make fraudulent MetaMask support emails appear legitimate. (Photo by Felix Zahn/Photothek via Getty Images)",
      "Data removal services can help reduce exposed personal details from data broker sites that attackers use to target victims by name and email. Less exposed information makes it harder for phishers to craft convincing wallet alerts tailored to you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

      "2) Auto-join networks",
      "Your phone remembers Wi-Fi networks you've connected to before, like stores, gyms, hotels, airports or even an old home router and reconnects automatically whenever it detects them again. The problem is that scammers can create look-alike networks with the same name, tricking your phone into joining without you noticing.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Auto-join saves data and speeds things up, but it also removes your control. Your phone could quietly connect to networks you no longer trust or to fake hotspots designed to steal logins, read unencrypted traffic or inject malicious content. Turning off auto-join for places you don't use often keeps you safer from these silent, high-risk connections.",

      "3) Push notifications",
      "These are the pop-up alerts or banners you get from apps, even when those apps are closed. Some notifications are helpful (messages, alerts, reminders). Others just bombard you with ads or updates you don't need.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Push notifications can keep you informed, but they also distract you, drain your battery, expose personal details on your lock screen and give apps a way to pull you back in with constant ads or engagement tactics. Managing them reduces noise and limits how much access apps have to your attention and data.",

      "These are small software updates designed specifically to fix vulnerabilities that scammers or hackers could exploit. They don't add new features; they close holes. Skipping security updates leaves your device exposed. They run quickly, often in the background and keep your phone protected from the latest threats.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Security updates patch weaknesses before attackers can use them, and delaying them gives hackers more time to target your device. Installing them promptly helps block malware, stop data theft and keep your phone safe from new exploits that emerge every month.",

      "\"I was recently notified by two different banking institutions that someone completed an online application to open a deposit account in my name. Both banks denied the applications and sent me notifications. One bank sent an email and the other sent a letter. Neither bank will share any information with me about what information was submitted or why the applications were denied. I understand why fraudsters try to open credit accounts, but why would they try to open deposit accounts? One bank told me they could not share any information with me about the failed application due to privacy policy and the other bank said they do not save any information from declined applications from non-customers.",
      "Why would banking institutions not capture or share information about declined online applications? As far as I know, the credit bureaus do not collect information about deposit accounts and Early Warning Services only has information from banks that voluntarily report to them.

      "Criminals use deposit accounts for several strategic reasons that help them test stolen data and prepare bigger attacks.",

      "Deposit account fraud often falls outside normal credit monitoring. A service that looks at bank accounts and dark web activity adds extra protection. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "A data removal service scrubs your personal details from people search sites that criminals often use to build synthetic identities. This reduces how much of your information can be exploited in future attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even if they cannot share details, ask them to document the attempt on your record. This helps flag future fraud attempts.",
      "Look for debit cards, 1099 forms or bank statements you did not request. Those often reveal when criminals succeed somewhere else.",
      "Next steps",
      "Print every letter or email from the banks. Complete the FTC report and use it if you need to file a police report. Review your ChexSystems and Early Warning reports and add freezes where possible so your identity becomes less useful to criminals.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Deposit account fraud feels confusing because it works outside traditional credit systems. Yet the goal is simple. Criminals want to see which stolen identities pass early checks so they can launch larger attacks later. A few fast steps can shut that door and give you control again.",

    "published": "Mon, 08 Dec 2025 07:59:11 -0500",
    "summary": "New study of 10,500+ kids reveals early smartphone ownership linked to depression, obesity, and poor sleep by age 12. Earlier phones mean higher risks.",
    "story": [
      "Jonathan Haidt joined Brian Kilmeade to discuss his new book \"The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.\"",
      "Parents everywhere wrestle with one big question. What is the right age to let a child have a smartphone?",
      "Tweens ask for one long before many adults feel ready. At the same time, researchers keep sounding alarms about how early access may shape health and behavior. Now, a large new study gives parents even more to think about.",
      "Published in Pediatrics, the research tracked more than 10,500 children in the national Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. It found strong links between early smartphone ownership and higher odds of depression, obesity and insufficient sleep by age 12. The earlier kids got a phone, the greater their risk.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "What the study reveals about early smartphone ownership",
      "The study compared 12-year-olds who owned smartphones with those who did not. Kids with phones were more likely to show signs of depression, carry extra weight and sleep less than their peers without devices. Researchers noted that these patterns held even after accounting for income, neighborhood, parental monitoring and other factors.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Parents can lower these risks by delaying devices, setting limits and keeping phones out of bedrooms at night. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "They also looked at children who still did not own a phone at age 12. One year later, those who had finally received one showed more mental health concerns and worse sleep than those who still did not have a device. These shifts happened quickly, which raised concerns about how powerful the change can be.",
      "Lead author Dr. Ran Barzilay explained that parents should treat the decision like a real health milestone. A device changes how kids sleep, move and socialize. That combination may create more strain for a 12-year-old than for a 16-year-old who has more maturity and self-regulation.",
      "Why age matters more than many parents expect",
      "The research shows an association, not a direct cause. Yet the patterns match earlier findings. Kids with smartphones often stay up later, scroll more and move less. That mix can disrupt physical health and emotional well-being. Adolescence is a sensitive stage when small shifts in sleep or mood can have long-lasting effects.",
      "Experts also pointed out how nearly every teen now has smartphone access. That makes the decision even harder for families who want to delay. Still, researchers say the data is strong enough to guide parents toward waiting when possible. Parents do not need perfect evidence to choose a slower timeline.",
      "Pediatric mental health experts warn that a smartphone is not a simple tool. It opens the entire internet with no natural limits. Families need clear rules and protections and those steps require real work from adults. Many parents feel pressure to hand over a device early, yet the expert urged families to trust their instincts when deciding the timing.",
      "The sleep connection families cannot ignore",
      "Most experts agree that phones disrupt sleep. A large share of preteens keep devices in their bedrooms, which leads to late-night scrolling and overnight notifications. Even the glow of the screen can make it harder to fall asleep.",
      "Researchers who study adolescent sleep and screen habits have found that many 11- to 12-year-olds keep devices within reach at night, and a notable share report being awakened by notifications. Experts in this field urge parents to move phones out of bedrooms overnight because better sleep can reduce some of the risks tied to early smartphone access.",
      "EVEN THE FUTURE KING DISCOVERS SMARTPHONES ARE A ROYAL PAIN FOR KIDS AND PARENTS",
      "Researchers found that kids who got phones sooner showed more mental health strain within a year. (Matt Cardy/Getty Images)",
      "The challenge is consistency. Many parents struggle to set rules when screens support school work, friendships and safety. Yet researchers stress that even one boundary, like no phones in bedrooms, can protect sleep and reduce stress.",
      "How parents can use this information right now",
      "No one wants to shame parents who already gave their kids a phone. Many families made the decision for safety or communication needs. The study does not claim that every early smartphone user will face health issues. It simply highlights patterns worth considering before making the call. Parents can use these insights to create a healthier plan.",
      "Readiness is more than age. Look for consistent responsibility with chores, schoolwork and device-free rules on other screens.",
      "Kids follow rules when they understand why they exist. Set limits that work for your household and adjust them as schedules and needs change.",
      "Nighttime use and notifications interrupt sleep. A \"charging station\" in the kitchen or living room solves this fast.",
      "Short regular check-ins work better than one long conversation. Keep the tone open and supportive.",

      "Alvarez offered excused absences for students to demonstrate on behalf of Curth, according to OU's Turning Point USA chapter. But when the Turning Point chapter president Kalib Magana asked for an excused absence to counter-protest, he was reportedly told that his absence would not be excused unless a \"documented group [of counter-protesters] could be organized.\"",

      "Luigi Mangione's backpack and the circumstances surrounding his Pennsylvania arrest were the focus of this week's hearings in New York as his defense lawyers are trying to get some evidence tossed entirely.",
      "Mangione's attorneys attempted to pick apart Pennsylvania police's handling of their initial arrest of Mangione, challenging their warrantless search of the murder suspect's backpack and a delay in being read his Miranda rights. The set of pre-trial hearings is aimed at determining whether evidence will be excluded from his upcoming trial for the alleged killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Fox News Digital he believes prosecutors will be able to argue successfully that the backpack search as well as officers' reading of Miranda rights were done within the law.",
      "\"I agree with prosecutors in this case that it was a legal search. And this is why there are some exceptions to the search warrant requirement. And the two that really would apply in this case are a search incident to an arrest or an inventory search. Both of those require an arrest. So as long as there was probable cause for an arrest, law enforcement can search anything within Mangione's wingspan,\" Rahmani said.",

      "Rep. Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M., said he\u2019s \u201cproud\u201d to have secured more than $1.8 million in funds for projects in his district, saying they\u2019ll enhance rural economic opportunities and help farmers. \u201cThis is about delivering real results for southern New Mexico.\u201d",
      "Asked about his vote, Vasquez told NBC News in a statement: \u201cUnlike my predecessor, I have actually submitted and fought for federal funding for community projects here in my district.\u201d",
      "Other Democrats in safer seats have similarly touted funds brought home after voting against the bill \u2014 including Reps. April McClain Delaney, D-Md., Ted Lieu, D-Calif., Donald Norcross, D-N.J., and Rick Larsen, D-Wash.",
      "Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., the No. 3 House Democrat, didn\u2019t comment on specific examples, as he said he hadn\u2019t seen members touting that bill\u2019s funding projects at home.",
      "\u201cRepublicans did quite a bit of that previously, during the Biden administration,\u201d Aguilar said in a brief hallway interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t have quite the visibility on where the Trump administration is putting grant funds as we did previously.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important, always, to share information with your constituents on what\u2019s happening in your district,\u201d he said.",
      "Part of the reason for the reversal in attitudes is that House Republicans have been able to largely unify around spending bills this year, despite their narrow majority. That\u2019s a shift from prior years, when Republicans routinely had to rely on Democratic votes in the House to fund the government, even when the GOP controlled Congress and the White House.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve got nothing,\u201d Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told NBC News. \u201cThey\u2019ve got no ideas to offer the American people, and they have no accomplishments to run on. So it doesn\u2019t surprise me. But they\u2019re not going to get away with it.\u201d",
      "Hudson is now in the unusual position of taking ownership of the spending bill on behalf of the GOP. He said he doesn\u2019t recall Pelosi mocking Republicans who \u201cvote no and take the dough.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sounds smart enough to be her,\u201d Hudson said."

      "A top aide to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been communicating with Republican gubernatorial candidate James Fishback, a controversial figure who has denied any interactions with the governor\u2019s political orbit.",
      "The aide, Christina Pushaw, has spoken to Fishback, his top adviser and Fishback\u2019s uncle \u2014 South Florida investor and real estate mogul Fred Fishback \u2014 about Fishback\u2019s gubernatorial campaign, according to a person familiar with the relationship and Fishback\u2019s uncle.",
      "Last month, Fishback jumped into the 2026 Republican primary to succeed DeSantis \u2014 who is term-limited and cannot run again \u2014 as a pro-DeSantis candidate who backs the outgoing governor\u2019s agenda. The front-runner is currently Rep. Byron Donalds, who has Trump\u2019s endorsement but is at odds with DeSantis. It\u2019s widely believed the governor is still looking for a candidate to support.",
      "Those in DeSantis\u2019 political orbit have pushed back against claims that they are helping or advising Fishback, whose prolific social media presence has faced criticism. Fishback has repeatedly called Donalds, who is Black, a \u201cslave\u201d to his political donors, and he has praised followers of Nick Fuentes, a far-right activist known for his white nationalist and antisemitic views, as \u201cimpressive.\u201d",
      "When asked about any ties to Fishback\u2019s orbit, Pushaw said she was not working for the campaign.",
      "\u201cThe story is simply not accurate,\u201d she told NBC News Thursday night. \u201cI do not work for James Fishback and never have.\u201d",
      "Pushaw has been one of DeSantis\u2019 most high-profile advisers. She helped build his popular reputation and social media profile with national Republican voters ahead of his 2024 bid for president. Pushaw also grew her own following with conservatives because of her social media presence and the aggressive way in which she, at times publicly, battled with reporters.",
      "Pushaw has been a Florida state employee since 2021, including serving as DeSantis\u2019 press secretary. She currently makes $180,000 working as a \u201csenior management analyst,\u201d state records show.",
      "NBC News viewed a video showing Fishback\u2019s uncle, Fred, answering questions from a small group of people at the opening night party of a Noble Capital Markets conference held last week in Boca Raton that indicates Pushaw is involved with his political efforts. During the event, Fred Fishback can be heard answering questions from a small group of people about Pushaw\u2019s involvement in his nephew\u2019s campaign, and claiming he himself has spoken to her.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about her, other than we had a nice talk,\u201d Fred Fishback said, according to the video from Dec. 2. \u201cShe seems to be a smart girl.\u201d",
      "In the video, Fred Fishback said that Pushaw told him that she had reached out to his nephew after admiring his rapid-fire social media posts focused on conservative politics.",
      "\u201cShe liked whatever he said, and she just reached out to him,\u201d Fred Fishback said in the video. \u201cAll I know is she said he reached out to him because she liked her Twitter stuff.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey sat down and started talking,\u201d he said.",
      "Fred Fishback was at the event because he has been longtime friends with rapper Vanilla Ice, who was receiving an award.",
      "Fred Fishback confirmed in a text message to NBC News that he discussed Pushaw at the event. He said he talked to her one day when he was driving to pick up his son from college, but he didn\u2019t specify the date. He said during that phone call with Pushaw, there were some \u201cfinancial-type questions,\u201d but no direct ask for any sort of political contributions.",
      "\u201cTo be clear, neither Christina nor James have explicitly asked for my financial support for his campaign, and she specifically told me on our call she was not being paid by James,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI do genuinely wish everyone the best, especially my nephew as well as my wonderful State of Florida.\u201d",
      "Pushaw told NBC News she doesn\u2019t know Fred Fishback.",
      "James Fishback told NBC News on Friday that his uncle was \u201cdead wrong\u201d and added that Pushaw did not work for him.",
      "\u201cHonestly, my uncle is the last person who should be taking questions about my campaign since I have barely spoken to him about it and do not seek to involve him,\u201d he said, adding that he and his uncle disagree on a number of issues \u2014 including AI data centers and H-1B visas \u2014 but that he loves him \u201cdearly.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged he had dinner with Pushaw in October before he decided to run for governor because she is \u201cbrilliant.\u201d",
      "Last month, NBC News reported that a separate DeSantis adviser, Taryn Fenske, was also communicating with Fishback, but at the time he said he was not in communication with Pushaw.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if DeSantis is aware that two of his top aides are in communication with Fishback. His office did not return a request seeking comment.",
      "Fishback aide Alex Mungia said during a dinner that the campaign had been talking directly with Pushaw in some capacity, according to a source directly familiar with the conversation, who said it took place a few weeks ago.",
      "The person told NBC News that Mungia told them the campaign has the full support of DeSantis\u2019 team. The person said they asked if that support was coming from Pushaw, to which Mungia replied, \u201cWho told you?\u201d",
      "\u201cHe admitted it fully,\u201d the person said of Mungia discussing Pushaw being involved with the campaign.",
      "When asked about the dinner, Mungia praised Fishback.",
      "\u201cJames Fishback has been a great friend, and will make an incredible governor for our state,\u201d he said.",
      "In a social media post written at 11 p.m. on Thursday, James Fishback said that over the weekend, his uncle urged him to leave the governor\u2019s race and endorse Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, who is considering a run. James Fishback alleged Collins lobbied his uncle to help get him out of the race.",
      "\u201cToday I learned that @JayCollinsFL went to my own uncle and asked him to pressure me to drop out of the Florida Governor race,\u201d Fishback posted. \u201cAfter meeting with Collins without my knowledge, my uncle called me over the weekend urging me to drop out and endorse Collins.\u201d",
      "Pushaw retweeted Fishback\u2019s post.",
      "Collins said he is focused on his day job, not the Fishback allegations.",
      "\u201cLt. Gov. Jay Collins is focused on serving the people,\u201d a spokesperson for Collins said. \u201cNot false and fabricated stories.\u201d",
      "During the conference last week in Boca Raton, Fred Fishback was asked if he thought his nephew was being \u201cused\u201d as part of his race for governor, and he seemed to agree with the sentiment.",
      "\u201cI can see the crash,\u201d he said, according to the video. \u201cI can see the crash and burn, and he does not see it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "New city, new hairstyle. Season 5 of \"Emily in Paris\" has many changes in store for its chipper American protagonist, played by Lily Collins.",
      "TODAY lifestyle contributor Jill Martin ventured to Venice to chat about Season 5 with Collins and her onscreen and real life friend, Ashley Park, who plays Mindy.",
      "Among the topics of their talk? What inspired the sudden strand switch-up for Collins' character.",
      "\"So did Emily get the bob, or did Lily get the bob?\" Martin asked in a segment that will air on TODAY on Dec. 15.",
      "\"Lily got the bob,\" Collins clarified. \"Usually Lily gets the haircuts first, and then Marylin (Fitoussi, the show's costume designer) is inspired by the haircuts to create the new wardrobe for the next season. And then I always go to Darren (Star, the show's creator) and I'm like, 'Hey, can I keep it?'\"",
      "Throughout the series, which returns for Season 5 on Dec. 18, Emily has rarely strayed from her signature long, brunette locks. Except, of course, that time she decided to cut her own bangs in the Season 3 premiere.",
      "As it turns out, this was another case of art imitating life for Collins.",
      "\"In the season with the bangs, we created part of the storyline, you know, Ashley coming in, and being like, 'No!'\" the actor said.",
      "\"Trauma bangs,\" Park noted.",
      "Collins' real-life bob was a bit more of a dramatic mane move than getting bangs. She told Jill it's a style she wouldn't have considered sporting earlier in her life. But her hairstylist, Gregory Russell, convinced her to try it, since he'd always wanted to see her with shorter hair.",
      "\u201cI really love changing my hair, which is ironic, because growing up, I was like, \u2018I never want to cut or color my hair.\u2019 And so I did it, and I didn\u2019t know how people would react. I was like, \u2018Is there going to have to be a wig next season or whatever?'\" she recalled.",
      "Luckily, Star was down to keep the hairstyle, and the duo proceeded to debate if they should write it into the show.",
      "\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Well, we already did that with the bangs.\u2019 So there was one moment, I believe it was cut (from the show) but there was a moment in the very first episode when I go into the Rome office and I sit down. Philippine (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, who plays Sylvie) comes in, and the first thing she says is, \u2018You cut your hair.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, thanks.\u2019 And she\u2019s like, \u2018It\u2019s not a compliment. We\u2019ve gotta go,\u2019\u201d she remembered.",
      "Park wanted to make sure the merits of Collins' haircut were acknowledged so she improvised a bit while filming.",
      "\u201cI added a line. Because when Mindy comes to Rome, I remember being like, \u2018Wait, hold up. I know that Lily got this haircut, but I feel like Mindy would at least be, like, \u2018Love your hair!\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Martin was also curious to know if becoming a mother inspired Collins' new shorter hairstyle. In January 2025, Collins announced that she had welcomed her first child with her husband Charlie McDowell.",
      "\"No, it didn\u2019t. I always wanted to do it. I had a very short haircut when I was 25 and then it grew out. But then I just kept it growing. No, it is more practical, perhaps,\" she said.",
      "Regardless of her motivation for chopping her hair, the end result is fabulous, if you ask Park.",
      "\"I've never met anybody who could pull off, truly, any hairstyle, any hair color,\" she said."

      "Before she started dating Kelce, Swift, who was born in Pennsylvania, had previously alluded to her love of the Philly team.

      "Set in a small upstate New York town, the third installment in the \u201cKnives Out\u201d franchise from director and writer Rian Johnson tackles religion, false prophets and, of course, a complicated murder.",
      "The film \u2014 now streaming on Netflix \u2014 is mostly told through the perspective of a young priest named Jud, played by Josh O\u2019Connor, who is sent to help run a modest parish led by Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, portrayed by Josh Brolin. After meeting Wicks and developing a strained dynamic with him, he also meets the monsignor\u2019s loyal congregation: Wicks\u2019 right-hand woman Martha (Glenn Close), doctor Nat (Jeremy Renner), lawyer Vera (Kerry Washington) struggling author Lee (Andrew Scott), chronically ill concert cellist Simone (Cailee Spaeny), failed politician Cy (Daryl McCormack) and groundskeeper Samson (Thomas Haden Church).",
      "During one service, the monsignor delivers a disparaging and chaotic homily, his speciality, before stepping into a compact side room to collect himself while Jud briefly takes over. Seconds later, Jud and the churchgoers hear a loud thud before finding Wicks lying on the ground, dead. Baffled by how the murderer pulled off their plan, local police chief Geraldine (Mila Kunis) enlists the help of renowned detective Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, to unravel the case.",
      "Compared to the previous films, \u201cWake Up Dead Man\u201d has a darker tone and more violence. Johnson tells TODAY.com that he wanted to \u201cground\u201d the third movie and its themes in a subject that was \u201cvery personal for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI grew up very Christian. I\u2019m not a believer anymore, but it\u2019s something I have a lot of complicated feelings about,\u201d he shares.  \u201cSo the challenge of seeing if we can make a big, entertaining, fun whodunnit and at the same time, in a complicated and generous way \u2014 not just a finger wagging way \u2014 look at those issues of faith and Christianity in America right now.\u201d",
      "He adds, \u201cThat seemed like a worthy challenge.\u201d",
      "A big reason he was able to pull it off: Craig\u2019s portrayal of Blanc. Johnson says that the actor\u2019s performance, while hilarious and captivating, is rooted in basic human decency and empathy. He also notes that in each of his \u201cKnives Out\u201d movies he has paired Blanc with a good-hearted protagonist who anchors the film. For \u201cWake Up Dead Man\u201d the relationship between Blanc, a nonbeliever, and O\u2019Connor\u2019s Jud, a devoted priest, is at the center of the movie.",

      "Each film in the \u201cKnives Out\u201d franchise is named after a song. Johnson teases that \u201cWake Up Dead Man,\u201d the title of a 1997 U2 song from the band\u2019s album \u201cPop\u201d that is always playing in his head, fit perfectly for the flick\u2019s unexpected twist.",
      "\u201cFor reasons that\u2019ll become more clear once you see the movie, it makes a lot of sense for this film,\u201d he shares.",
      "Read on to find out how Blanc pieces together the clues to solve \u201cWake Up Dead Man,\u201d and how the film\u2019s clever title comes to fruition.",
      "How Does \u2018Wake Up Dead Man\u2019 End?",
      "\u201cWake Up Dead Man\u201d includes the most on-screen deaths in the \u201cKnives Out\u201d franchise, as Wicks isn\u2019t the only character who is brutally murdered. During a stormy night, the Wicks family tomb, where the monsignor was buried, miraculously opens from the inside and a man resembling Wicks emerges. (Hence the movie\u2019s title.) The revived man then follows a hooded figure into the woods. Jud, watching from afar, goes after the two of them. He is knocked unconscious and awakens to find Samson impaled with a garden hook. Meanwhile, another hooded figure is seen meeting with Nat at his home in the middle of the night.",
      "Blanc discovers a disheveled Jud, who believes he is responsible for Samson\u2019s murder and needs to confess. But before Jud can turn himself in to Geraldine, he and Blanc travel to Nat\u2019s home. There, they find the doctor\u2019s body disintegrated in a tub filled with toxic chemicals, leaving only his bones.",
      "Overcome by guilt, Jud goes to speak to Geraldine. As he tries to confess, Blanc interrupts him and reveals to Jud, Geraldine and the rest of the monsignor\u2019s followers that he knows who the killer is.",
      "The detective explains in his delightful Southern accent that the monsignor collapsed after drinking a poisoned flask following his homily. He says that when the rest of the congregation joined Jud to investigate the body, the killer\u2019s accomplice, Nat, secretly stabbed Wicks, who was already dead.",
      "While relaying the evidence, Blanc abruptly pauses and says he cannot continue. He\u2019d prefer the culprit admit their sins. After most of the congregation leaves the church, Martha remains and confirms she is the killer. She recalls that when she was a little girl, Wicks\u2019 father, Prentice, swallowed his family\u2019s inheritance \u2014 a rare jewel \u2014 prior to his death to prevent his children and the church from becoming corrupted by greed. She was the only one who knew the truth about the location of the jewel and chose to keep it to herself for decades.",
      "But when Jud arrived at the parish, she decided to share her secret with the monsignor during confession. She instantly realized she had made a mistake and plotted to kill Wicks so he couldn\u2019t get the jewel. She teamed up with Nat, since he had access to drugs they could use to spike Wicks\u2019 flask. Their convoluted plan also contained another crucial step: they removed Wicks\u2019 body from his coffin and instead Samson, Martha\u2019s husband, would take his place. The switch allowed the groundskeeper to remove the jewel from Prentice\u2019s corpse and lie in the casket until he received a signal. Then, he would perform the \u201cmiracle\u201d of exiting the Wicks tomb, bringing more parishioners and prestige to the church.",
      "However, the plan went awry when Samson met with Nat in the woods after leaving the tomb. Nat stabbed Samson with the garden tool and stole the jewel. Martha discovered Nat\u2019s betrayal, went to his home, inconspicuously snatched the jewel and pushed the doctor into the toxic tub, killing him.",
      "After revealing how she pulled off her crimes, Martha dies in Jud and Blanc\u2019s arms, as she willingly ingested the same poison Wicks drank.",
      "While chatting to TODAY.com about the killer\u2019s reveal, Kerry Washington, whose character is one of the few that has a happy ending, says she didn\u2019t see it coming when she first read the script.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way when I got to the end that I would have been able to guess it,\u201d she says. \u201cI tried while I was reading it, and I just never would have.\u201d"

Swift likens the albatross to a person, or more specifically \u201ca woman, here to destroy you.\u201d",

Meanwhile, an adaptation of McFadden\u2019s novel \u201cThe Housemaid\u201d starring Amanda Seyfried and Sydney Sweeney is out in December.",

      "She then brought up other rumors about her. \u201cOne that is very funny is people saying I\u2019m three men,\u201d she said.",
      "Jenna chimed in saying doubters probably \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d it\u2019s just one woman penning so many page-turners on her own.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a compliment,\u201d McFadden continued. \u201cLike it will take three men to do what I actually do.\u201d",

      "\u201cI saw a post somebody made where somebody said that in my author photo, my cleavage is Photoshopped. The funniest part was that in the post, he said he discussed it with his wife and they had a whole conversation about how my cleavage was photoshopped and why,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s something I also think I should mention, which is these books come from inside my brain. These are my personal thoughts, and it\u2019s almost like when people are reading it, it\u2019s like they\u2019re reading my diary and it\u2019s a little embarrassing. I don\u2019t want them to know what I\u2019m thinking, and now they all do.\u201d"

      "The action-packed film, showcased the fast-paced and entertaining world of Formula 1 with Brad Pitt starring as Sonny Hayes, a former F1 driver from the \u201890s who had a promising career until an accident on the track nearly ended his life.",
      "\"F1 The Movie\" follows Sonny 30 years later after his friend and owner of a struggling F1 team, Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), convinces him to return to motorsport. But first, Sonny will have to put his and hotshot rookie Joshua Pearce's (Damson Idris) differences aside to work together and nab some wins.",
      "\u201cIt was a thrill to do,\u201d producer Jerry Bruckheimer tells TODAY.com, describing the film as an \u201cemotional journey we take you on.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what we love about this movie. It\u2019s a redemption story.\u201d",
      "F1 has become more popular in the U.S. following the release of Netflix\u2019s \u201cDrive to Survive,\u201d now in its seventh season. U.S. viewership of the motorsport is also growing.

      "Now that the 2025 F1 season is over, Apple TV will be the one-stop shop for the 2026 season. Every Grand Prix will stream live all season in the U.S. starting March 7, 2026.",

      "Is \u2018F1 The Movie\u2019 Based on a True Story?",
      "No, \u201cF1 The Movie\u201d is not based on a true story.",
      "However, Bruckheimer and Kosinski enlisted seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton as a producer and adviser to make the film as authentic as possible.",
      "Did \u2018F1 The Movie\u2019 Film at Real Races?",
      "Yes, \u201cF1 The Movie\u201d was filmed during real Grand Prix weekends during the 2023 and 2024 seasons.",
      "Real F1 drivers from the 10 teams were also included in the film, as well as team principals like Ferrari\u2019s Fred Vasseur and Mercedes\u2019 Toto Wolff, among other notable figures.",
      "According to Bruckheimer, the film crew built their own garage and six modified Formula 2 cars designed by Mercedes. Kosinski also noted that the team developed a camera system from scratch that was small enough to mount on the car to show the experience of what it feels like to drive one of the vehicles.",
      "\u201cWe had track time at every race,\u201d Bruckheimer says, explaining that they would get a couple of minutes in between qualifying or practice to film the fictional APXGP team with the other teams.",
      "\u201cWhat was exciting for our actors is, first of all, they\u2019re driving these cars at high speeds in front of 140,000 people and ... 100 million people on television, nobody knew that Brad and Damson were driving these cars,\u201d he adds. \u201cThen we had the track when the teams weren\u2019t there.\u201d",
      "Pitt also told TODAY during a surprise appearance at a New York screening about his experience driving the car.",
      "\u201cOur first scene was on the grid during race weekend at Silverstone (home of British Grand Prix events), where F1 started, and we were on the grid with the drivers,\u201d he told Savannah Guthrie. \u201cWe got one take, and we\u2019re moving on. And it just led to this great kind of energy you\u2019ll see that I think shows on the screen.\u201d",
      "Calling the action \u201csuch a thrill,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to explain what these cars can do. We would be barreling down the straight at 180, and you think that\u2019s something. But the fact that these cars can brake, can stop and make a complete right turn, it feels like the car is going to flip, and it sticks. It is unbelievable. It\u2019s unbelievable what these drivers can do.\u201d",
      "Were Any Characters Inspired by Real F1 Figures?",
      "No, most characters were created for the film. However, some actors drew inspiration from a number of people for their role.",
      "Kerry Condon, who portrays Kate McKenna, the technical director for team APXGP, tells TODAY.com she drew inspiration from Bernie Collins, an F1 strategy analyst for Sky Sports and F1TV and former F1 strategy engineer for the Aston Martin F1 team.",
      "\u201cWe did take a bit of an artistic license where I play a strategist in certain parts of the movie with the tires and stuff,\u201d Condon says. \u201cI was like, I\u2019ll just do everything. But Bernie had a similar education to me, (went to an) all-girls school and stuff, so I kind of brought in a lot of my own background and made it my own.\u201d",
      "Bardem says Ruben was not inspired by anyone in particular, but more of \u201ca mix of different team owners that I would meet or see on documentaries and and just put them together.\u201d"

    "summary": "Two U.S. Army soldiers and a civilian U.S. interpreter were killed Saturday in an attack in Palmyra, Syria, the Pentagon said.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump vowed retaliation Saturday after two U.S. Army soldiers and a civilian U.S. interpreter were killed in an attack in Syria, an incident the Pentagon said occurred during a counterterrorism engagement.",
      "\"This was an ISIS attack against the U.S., and Syria, in a very dangerous part of Syria, that is not fully controlled by them,\" Trump said on Truth Social. \"There will be very serious retaliation.\"",
      "Three other U.S. personnel were wounded in the attack in Palmyra, Sean Parnell, the Pentagon\u2019s chief spokesperson said on X. The attack occurred as the soldiers \"were conducting a key leader engagement\" in \"support of ongoing counter-ISIS operations,\" he said.",
      "\"This attack is currently under active investigation,\" Parnell said.",
      "U.S. Central Command said the attack was an ambush by \"a lone ISIS gunman\" and that the gunman was engaged and killed.",
      "A Pentagon official told NBC News the attack occurred in an area outside the control of Syria\u2019s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a separate X post that the person who carried out the attack was killed by U.S. partner forces. He did not provide additional details about the perpetrator of the forces involved.",
      "\"The savage who perpetrated this attack was killed by partner forces,\" Hegseth wrote, adding that those who target Americans \"will spend the rest of your brief, anxious life knowing the United States will hunt you, find you, and ruthlessly kill you.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Syria\u2019s Interior Ministry, Nour al-Din al-Baba, said on state television that internal security officials had issued prior warnings to partner forces operating in the Badia region about the possibility of an Islamic State attack. He said the U.S.-led coalition did not take those warnings seriously.",
      "The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights had reported that the attacker is a member of Syrian security forces. Al-Baba said the individual had no leadership role within Syria's internal security forces and was not serving as an escort to leadership at the time of the attack.",
      "The Department of Defense has not released additional details beyond statements on social media.",
      "President Donald Trump addressed the attack ahead of Saturday's Army-Navy football game in Baltimore, calling it an ambush and mourning the deaths. When asked by a reporter whether the U.S. would retaliate, Trump said, \"Yeah, we will.\"",
      "The U.S. military has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly stationed in the northeast, where they work with local security to prevent the resurgence of the Islamic State. The U.S. and other nations have re-engaged with Damascus under al-Sharaa, since rebels ousted former President Bashar al-Assad."

    "summary": "Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado faced a treacherous journey to collect her Nobel Peace Prize in Norway.",
    "story": [
      "Rough seas. An almost moonless night. And a small fishing boat crossing a treacherous stretch of the Caribbean Sea, carrying precious cargo with a target on her back.",
      "Those were the conditions that Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado faced when she made perhaps the most perilous part of her journey to collect her Nobel Peace Prize in Norway, according to the U.S. Special Forces veteran who planned and aided her escape.",
      "\u201cThere were 5- to 6-foot waves, maybe even bigger waves than that, and we were doing this in the middle of the night,\u201d Bryan Stern, who heads the Tampa, Florida-based Grey Bull Rescue Foundation, told NBC News. \u201cIt was pitch black, almost no moonlight. All of us were very cold and wet.\u201d",
      "But Machado never lost her composure, or her lunch, Stern said, as the skiff lurched in the rough sea and plied through waters that have been targeted, of late, by the U.S. missile strikes on suspected drug smuggling boats.",
      "\u201cShe did fine,\u201d Stern said. \u201cThey call her the Iron Lady for a reason.\u201d",
      "Stern dubbed the extrication operation: \u201cOperation Golden Dynamite.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is overwhelmingly the highest-profile person we\u2019ve rescued,\u201d said Stern, who noted this was the 800th mission his organization carried out.",
      "Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in October for leading the opposition against Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime, said on Thursday that she got help from the U.S. government to leave her hiding place in Venezuela and collect her award.",
      "Stern insisted the operation was paid for \u201cby a series of unnamed donors,\u201d and the U.S. government was aware of what was going on but not directly involved.",
      "\u201cWe designed and implemented the extrication of Mar\u00eda Corina Machado from Venezuela to a friendly country from which she was flown to her next destination,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe were not hired by anyone in the U.S. government.\u201d",
      "In fact, Stern added, \u201cI\u2019ve never received a thank-you note, let alone a dollar, from the U.S. government.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to an email from NBC News seeking information about its possible involvement in Machado\u2019s escape.",
      "Stern said he began planning the mission on Dec. 5.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted to get her to the Nobel prize ceremony on time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there were a number of obstacles.\u201d",
      "Getting Machado out of Venezuela required disguising her appearance. Stern did not say exactly what they did to get her out and wouldn\u2019t comment on a Wall Street Journal account that she, at some point, donned a wig.",
      "\u201cHer face was a problem because she is the most famous person in Venezuela outside of Maduro,\u201d he said, noting that there are billboards with Machado\u2019s image everywhere in Venezuela.",
      "The Maduro regime was using Machado\u2019s facial biometrics to try to locate her, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople in the Maduro regime call it the \u2018Hunt for Maria\u2019 the way we would talk about the \u2018Hunt for Bin Laden\u2019,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe had to use a lot of deception, even with some members of her own team.\u201d",
      "Stern said he met Machado for the first time on Tuesday evening. He would not say exactly when or where he rendezvoused with Machado, but it involved her taking a small skiff from a fishing village and transferring her at sea to the somewhat bigger fishing boat that he was on.",
      "\u201cI was on the second leg of the operation,\u201d he said. \u201cI got very close to Venezuela.\u201d",
      "But Machado\u2019s departure, which was supposed to happen Tuesday morning, was delayed till evening by a broken engine, he said. And what should have been a three or four-hour trip turned into a roughly 16-hour ordeal.",
      "\u201cI first met her at sea,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe used a fishing boat to get her to her flight.\u201d",
      "Stern said the flight took off from Cura\u00e7ao, which is about 40 miles north of Venezuela and is a self-governing island that is part of the Netherlands.",
      "\u201cI would say we transited through Cura\u00e7ao,\u201d Stern said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t in Cura\u00e7ao. She never cleared immigration in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201d",
      "Stern said this was the most challenging mission he and his group have undertaken. As for Machado, Stern said he\u2019s a big fan.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a hero of mine.\u201d"

      "With climate change steadily dismantling the icy habitat essential to their existence, new research suggests polar bears are rapidly rewiring their own genetics in a bid to survive.",
      "The species is being forced to adapt to the harsher reality of a warming Arctic, in what scientists believe is the first documented case of rising temperatures driving genetic change in a mammal.",
      "Researchers from the University of East Anglia in Britain say these findings, published Friday in the journal Mobile DNA, offer a rare glimmer of hope for the species.",
      "\"Polar bears are still sadly expected to go extinct this century, with two-thirds of the population gone by 2050,\" Alice Godden, who is the lead author of the study, told NBC News.",
      "\"I believe our work really does offer a glimmer of hope \u2014 a window of opportunity for us to reduce our carbon emissions to slow down the rate of climate change and to give these bears more time to adapt to these stark changes in their habitats.\"",
      "Building on earlier University of Washington research, Godden\u2019s team analyzed blood samples from polar bears in northeastern and southeastern Greenland. In the slightly warmer south, they found that genes linked to heat stress, aging and metabolism behaved differently from those in northern bears.",
      "\u201cEssentially this means that different groups of bears are having different sections of their DNA changed at different rates, and this activity seems linked to their specific environment and climate,\" Godden said in a university press release.",
      "She said this shows, for the first time, that a unique group of one species has been forced to \"rewrite their own DNA,\" adding that this process can be considered \"a desperate survival mechanism against melting sea ice.\"",
      "The Arctic Ocean has repeatedly experienced record-high temperatures in the past few years, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitoring data shows.",
      "Researchers say warming ocean temperatures have reduced vital sea ice platforms that the bears use to hunt seals, leading to isolation and food scarcity.",
      "This led to genetic changes as the animals\u2019 digestive system adapts to a diet of plants and low fats in the absence of prey, Godden told NBC News.",
      "\"Food availability is a real problem for these bears \u2014 everywhere, but most prominently in the south,\" she said. \"This may suggest their body shape and composition is also changing in response to their warmer environments.\"",
      "The lead researcher said that her team decided to focus on the southern group of bears because the area's warmer climate serves as a glimpse of what is to come for other bear populations later this century if current trends in climate change continue.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates there are currently about 26,000 polar bears worldwide. Scientifically known by its Latin name Ursus maritimus, meaning \"sea bear,\" the animals are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, meaning they are considered to be facing \"a high risk of extinction in the wild.\"",
      "The study \"does not mean that polar bears are at any less risk of extinction,\u201d Godden said, though the discovery may \u201cprovide a genetic blueprint for how polar bears might be able to adapt quickly to climate change.\u201d",
      "Godden added: \"We all must do more to mitigate our carbon emissions to help provide and extend this window of opportunity to help save this wonderful vital species.\""

      "Can children and teenagers be forced off social media en masse? Australia is about to find out.",
      "More than 1 million social media accounts held by users under 16 are set to be deactivated in Australia on Wednesday in a divisive world-first ban that has inflamed a culture war and is being closely watched in the United States and elsewhere.",
      "Social media companies will have to take \u201creasonable steps\u201d to ensure that under-16s in Australia cannot set up accounts on their platforms and that existing accounts are deactivated or removed.",
      "Australian officials say the landmark ban, which lawmakers swiftly approved late last year, is meant to protect children from addictive social media platforms that experts say can be disastrous for their mental health.",
      "\u201cWith one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as \u2018behavioral cocaine,\u2019\u201d Communications Minister Anika Wells told the National Press Club in Canberra last week.",
      "While many parents and even their children have welcomed the ban, others say it will hinder young people\u2019s ability to express themselves and connect with others, as well as access online support that is crucial for those from marginalized groups or living in isolated parts of rural Australia. Two 15-year-olds have brought a legal challenge against it to the nation\u2019s highest court.",
      "Supporters say the rest of the world will soon follow the example set by the Australian ban, which faced fierce resistance from social media companies.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always referred to this as the first domino, which is why they pushed back,\u201d Julie Inman Grant, who regulates online safety as Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, said at an event in Sydney last week.",
      "Social media companies will be responsible for enforcing the ban, paying fines of up to 49.5 Australian dollars (about $32 million) for serious or repeated breaches. Children and parents will not be punished for any infringements.",
      "Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, X, Snapchat and Reddit are all set to be age-restricted under the law, according to a list shared by the eSafety Commissioner. All of the platforms have said they will comply, and some have taken action before the ban even takes effect, with Meta saying last month that it would start closing Instagram, Threads and Facebook accounts on Dec. 4.",
      "The ban has broad support in Australia, where a YouGov poll last year found that 77% of respondents were in favor of it. Supporters say it will encourage children to prioritize in-person interactions, boosting their social skills.",
      "\u201cSocial media is a misnomer,\u201d said Jen Hummelshoj, 45, mother of 12-year-old Nina. \u201cThe apps want kids to be focused on their phone and not their friends.\u201d",
      "Nina does not have a phone or any social media accounts. She supports the ban\u2019s intent, arguing that social media is an overpowering distraction for young people.",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m trying to chat to someone, they might say, \u2018Just a minute,\u2019 and they\u2019re doing something on social media,\u201d she said in a phone interview from Canberra.",
      "According to a national study the Australian government commissioned this year, 96% of children ages 10 to 15 use social media. Seven out of 10 of them have been exposed to harmful content and behavior, including misogynistic material, fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.",
      "One in 7 also reported having experienced grooming-type behavior from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.",
      "William Young, 14, said most social media platforms, in their current form, were unsafe for children, citing Snapchat as an example.",
      "\u201cYou can friend anyone without knowing who they are. It deletes messages after they\u2019ve sent. \u2026  It\u2019s just not a good platform,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Perth.",
      "He implored the affected platforms to \u201cdo right\u201d by young people and prioritize making their platforms safer.",
      "The platforms say they share that goal and insist that the ban will actually make young users less safe.",
      "\u201cDisconnecting teens from their friends and family doesn\u2019t make them safer \u2014 it may push them to less safe, less private messaging apps,\u201d Snap said in a statement last month.",
      "The platforms also argue that young users may turn to new, unregulated apps that push them into darker corners of the internet or may try to circumvent the ban by using virtual private networks, or VPNs, which Australian teenagers do not dispute.",
      "\u201cYoung people are going to find another way around it,\u201d Chloe Song, 14, said in a Zoom interview from Melbourne. \u201cStrict parents create, like, sneaky kids.\u201d",
      "She said she and her peers would benefit more from better digital literacy programs in their schools.",
      "\u201cThe next generation is in our hands,\u201d said Chloe, who is a member of Project Rockit, a youth-driven Australian movement against bullying, hate and prejudice.",
      "If young people are blocked from social media, \u201cwe just don\u2019t learn the life skills and we don\u2019t learn the experience of going through and knowing what\u2019s safe and what\u2019s not,\u201d she said.",
      "Susan Grantham, a social media researcher at Griffith University in Brisbane, described the ban as a \u201cstep in the right direction\u201d but not a solution on its own.",
      "\u201cSocial media is not going away. Instead, we need to create well-balanced digital citizens,\u201d she said.",
      "What rankles many young Australians about the ban is what Noah Jones described as a lack of consultation on \u201clegislation that specifically affects us.\u201d",
      "Noah, 15, one of two teenagers suing the Australian government over the ban, said he and his peers have \u201csolutions to all the negatives of social media.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we just got asked, we all could\u2019ve worked it out,\u201d he said in emailed comments.",
      "Noah argues the ban will deny young people freedom of political communication, an implied right in Australia\u2019s constitution, and deprive them of an essential educational tool.",
      "\u201cDo you want 15-year-old boys to have no clue about consent? Do you want teenagers who don\u2019t know about the dangers of vaping? Both topics I\u2019ve learned about on social media,\u201d he said.",
      "Wells, the communications minister, said that the center-left government would not be intimidated by legal challenges and that it \u201cremains steadfastly on the side of parents.\u201d",
      "Others are relieved by the ban, including Aalia Elachi and her father, Dany.",
      "Dany Elachi said Aalia\u2019s behavior changed within days of her receiving a smartphone at age 10.",
      "\u201cWe found that she retreated into her room, into her own private world, her own private space, and we didn\u2019t think that was, in the long run, going to be healthy for her,\u201d he said in a phone interview from Sydney.",
      "When the phone malfunctioned after a couple of months, Aalia\u2019s parents never replaced it.",
      "Now 16, Aalia will be able to legally use social media, but she has never had any accounts and said that is not about to change.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still as tech literate as the next 16-year-old. I just don\u2019t have TikTok or Instagram eating up hours of my childhood every day,\u201d Aalia told lawmakers in the state of New South Wales last month.",
      "\u201cHaving firm boundaries around social media hasn\u2019t made my life smaller,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hope is over the next few years, I won\u2019t be the exception, but the norm.\u201d"

Amini, 22, an Iranian Kurdish woman, died in a hospital three days after the country\u2019s morality police detained her for allegedly not adhering to the rules about headscarves for women and other clothing restrictions.",
      "The intense crackdown that followed has largely stifled the protest movement, with new detentions and legislation.",
      "But in an interview with NBC News this year, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said forcing women to wear the hijab and recent crackdowns in his country were wrong. \u201cHuman beings have a right to choose,\u201d he said.",
      "And speaking at Beheshti University in the capital, Tehran, on Sunday, Pezeshkian said that hijab regulations shouldn\u2019t be imposed through coercion, according to the IRIB.",
      "\u201cThe issue of hijab is not a simple matter and cannot be resolved through compulsion or confrontation,\u201d the broadcaster quoted Pezeshkian as saying. He added that the government must act \u201cpersuasively,\u201d rather than rely on force.",
      "However, his more moderate stance has sparked backlash from more hard-line factions in the Iranian government, a theocratic structure that is ultimately ruled by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "Amin Khodadadi reported from Tehran and Elmira Aliieva from London."

      "Tripoli's Red Castle museum has reopened for the first time since the 2011 uprising that toppled Moammar Gadhafi, unveiling a trove of treasures that span millennia, from ancient mummies to relics of Libya's turbulent and fascinating history.",
      "Formerly known as As-Saraya Al-Hamra, the fortress that houses the museum has long been a central landmark in Libya\u2019s capital, Tripoli. It houses an extensive collection of artifacts tracing 5,000 years of history, from prehistoric times through to Libya\u2019s Roman, Greek and Islamic eras.",
      "Collections include Islamic art and architecture as well as objects from Italian colonial rule, World War II and Libya's independence, with galleries dedicated to the prehistoric period and ancient Libyan tribes, such as the Garamantes.",
      "\u201cThe reopening of the National Museum is not just a cultural moment but a live testimony that Libya is building its institutions,\u201d Abdulhamid al-Dbiebah, prime minister of the Government of National Unity, said at a ceremony on Friday awash with fireworks at the site.",
      "The museum closed in February 2011 during the NATO-backed uprising against Gadhafi, as anti-government protesters in the northeastern city of Benghazi began calling for the leader to step down and for the release of political prisoners. As protests intensified, demonstrators took control of Benghazi and unrest spread to Tripoli, with the Libyan government using lethal force against demonstrators.",
      "When rebels launched their first attack on the Libyan capital in August that year, a group of armed men were reported to have entered the national museum, incorrectly believing it to conceal the entrance of a secret government tunnel. The museum\u2019s artifacts were largely left intact, though a 1960s Volkswagen Beetle belonging to Gadhafi was among the regime-linked objects vandalized.",
      "Gadhafi was eventually toppled with the help of an international coalition that included the U.S.",
      "Renovations for the museum, built in the 1980s and opened by Gadhafi, began in March 2023 by the Tripoli-based GNU.",
      "The reopening of the national museum indicates a recovery in the country\u2019s cultural sector, despite unresolved political dynamics. The country remains divided between administrations in the west and east that have not had a unified budget in more than a decade.",
      "But with a planned election on the horizon in 2026, Hager Ali, a research fellow at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, said the museum's opening carries a political message.",
      "The reopening is \"kind of like a proof of concept of the western government that they are stable, especially in the forerun of elections,\" she told NBC News on Saturday, referring to the GNU.",
      "\"There really isn\u2019t anything that isn\u2019t political right now in Libya,\" she added. \u201cThis is very much a kind of a symbol that everyone can get behind.\"",
      "Since renovations began, Libya has recovered 21 artifacts that were smuggled out of the country after Gadhafi\u2019s fall, notably from France, Switzerland and the United States, the chairman of the board of directors of the antiquities department, Mohamed Farj Shakshoki, told Reuters ahead of the opening.",
      "Libya houses five UNESCO World Heritage sites, which in 2016 were all declared \"endangered\" due to instability and conflict.",
      "The historic town of Ghadames in western Libya was among the sites under threat, but conservation work spearheaded by the Managing Libya's Cultural Heritage project led to the site being officially removed from UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger in July."

    "story": [
      "When Volodymyr Zelenskyy last asked Ukrainians to vote for him, he was a political newbie, a former comedian eager to change his country and talk with Russia to end a protracted conflict.",
      "Six years later, Zelenskyy \u2014 transformed by the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion \u2014 is facing sudden pressure from the United States to hold a new election, even as he navigates Washington\u2019s push for a peace deal that could threaten Ukraine\u2019s future.",
      "President Donald Trump, frustrated by a lack of progress in peace talks, criticized Zelenskyy this week for \u201cusing war not to hold an election.\u201d It\u2019s a narrative that Moscow has exploited to label Zelenskyy\u2019s government \u201cillegitimate\u201d and thus impossible to negotiate with.",
      "Yet an election would currently be illegal, since Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections while martial law is in effect.",
      "Nonetheless, Zelenskyy now appears to be playing ball. But huge questions hang over the idea, from security to logistics, given the fierce fighting on the front lines and the daily Russian aerial assaults on Ukraine\u2019s cities.",
      "\u201cI do not want Ukraine to have a weak position, so that someone could use the absence of elections as an argument against Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy said Thursday. Elections could happen in 60 to 90 days, he has said, provided that Ukraine\u2019s allies help provide security on the ground.",
      "Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in early 2024, but it was postponed because martial law was introduced after Russia\u2019s February 2022 attack.",
      "After Trump\u2019s comment, Zelenskyy said he had asked lawmakers to prepare proposals \u201cenabling changes to the legal framework\u201d that would make elections possible.",
      "Beyond martial law, there are two major challenges, Zelenskyy said: security and the army.",
      "First, how would Kyiv ensure that people who come out to vote won\u2019t be hit in a sudden missile or drone strike? The Kremlin\u2019s attacks regularly plunge Ukrainian cities into frigid darkness for hours, which could complicate voting and ballot counting.",
      "\u201cElections always involve crowds,\u201d said Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko. \u201cWhat do you do about air raid alerts and safeguarding electoral paperwork? If a siren goes off, do you just grab a bunch of election protocols and run into a shelter? I am having a hard time imagining how that could work.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on how the U.S. might help.",
      "Kyiv would also have to figure out how hundreds of thousands of soldiers fighting on the front lines would vote.",
      "Some forces could perhaps be rotated out to vote in relatively safer areas, but Ukraine is already low on manpower and could risk jeopardizing critical battlefield positions.",
      "To that end, Zelenskyy has called for a ceasefire during the election process. The Kremlin swiftly shot down the suggestion, having long rejected any ceasefire before a full peace deal is reached.",
      "Without a pause in fighting, more than 800,000 personnel in Ukraine\u2019s armed forces would be effectively shut out of any election process, said Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party. It would be unsafe for people overseeing the voting, too, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any observers coming to the front line where you can be killed by a first-person view (FPV) drone like every 15 minutes,\u201d Kravchuk said in an audio message sent to NBC News on WhatsApp.",
      "Kravchuk pointed to the country\u2019s five different presidents since Vladimir Putin came to power in Russia in 2000. \u201cUkrainians understand that during the war, the first goal is to survive and to keep the country, keep the sovereign state,\u201d she said.",
      "Zelenskyy has been under domestic pressure, too, thanks to a corruption scandal. But even his opponents seemed skeptical of a wartime vote.",
      "It would take at least half a year after the end of martial law to organize elections that would be truly free and fair, said opposition lawmaker Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze. \u201cBut discussing all of this right now has little to do with the reality on the ground,\u201d Klympush-Tsintsadze, who represents the European Solidarity Party, said in an audio message on WhatsApp. \u201cWe are very far from the real end of this war,\u201d she added.",
      "Another complicating factor is that millions of Ukrainians fled the country when the war broke out and now live overseas. Millions more have been internally displaced by the fighting or now live in areas occupied by Russia (about 20% of Ukraine\u2019s territory), so simply working out who is eligible to vote and how to reach them would pose an immense challenge, said Fesenko.",
      "Trump and Putin may think that the lack of an election undermines Zelenskyy\u2019s legitimacy, but Ukrainians don\u2019t seem to agree.",
      "An opinion poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in September found  that 63% of Ukrainians believe elections should be held only after a final peace agreement and a complete end to the war. Only 11% support holding elections right now, even without a ceasefire, according to the poll.",
      "Should an election be held in the near future, there is only one candidate who could challenge Zelenskyy, Fesenko said \u2014 Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the former commander in chief.",
      "Zaluzhnyi has remained a popular figure after leading the Ukrainian army through much of the war. He was sacked by Zelenskyy in early 2024 and is now serving as Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Britain. Although Zelenskyy\u2019s position has been weakened by the corruption scandal, the president would still be a front-runner alongside Zaluzhnyi, Fesenko said. \u201cIt\u2019s just these two,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone else has much lower ratings.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the fourth year of the war, everyone is deeply exhausted,\u201d marketing specialist Ivan Datsko told NBC News on the phone from Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "Datsko, 33, said he felt that elections could be held but that there must at least be a ceasefire. \u201cNo rockets, no [drones] \u2014 and conditions that allow our soldiers to rotate safely. And of course, all Ukrainians who have left the country must also have the opportunity to vote,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf all these conditions are met, it could become a strong step toward real peace talks,\u201d Datsko added. \u201cFirst, silence on the front line, then elections, and after that, an agreement that truly protects Ukraine from future aggression and gives us a chance for peace and a normal life,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia has accused Zelenskyy of trying to cling to power. Last month, Putin said signing a peace deal with Zelenskyy would be \u201cpointless\u201d because he has lost his legitimacy after being too \u201cafraid\u201d to run again. The Kremlin said Friday that Zelenskyy\u2019s declared readiness for an election may simply be his latest attempt to freeze the conflict before negotiating a deeper peace deal \u2014 something Moscow has frequently rejected.",
      "Other countries have held elections in wartime and elected officials\u2019 democratic mandate becomes weaker the longer they are postponed, but elections also need to be practically possible, said Janina Dill, an international law expert on the use of force and a professor of global security at the University of Oxford.",
      "\u201cAnd calls for an election must not be used to weaken Ukrainian agency and resolve in the midst of an existential struggle for national survival,\u201d Dill added."

      "United States special envoy Steve Witkoff is on his way to Berlin, Germany, to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders for peace negotiations aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, a senior White House official told NBC News.",
      "Witkoff has spearheaded talks with Ukraine and Russia since President Donald Trump took office in January, but multiple high-level meetings between the U.S. and the two warring nations have yet to produce results as disagreements remain over the content of a peace plan.",
      "Trump, who has pushed for a deal to be in place by Christmas, has signaled that his patience is running thin.",
      "European leaders have focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. But long-time American allies in Europe have struggled to balance the mounting pressure from Washington with their reluctance to give in to Russia\u2019s hard-line demands.",
      "Zelenskyy said Ukraine submitted a 20-point plan to the U.S. on Wednesday, as it sought to balance out a 28-point U.S.-backed plan whose original version was seen as too favorable to Moscow.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s proposal included separate documents on security guarantees, to prevent Russia from attacking again, and on rebuilding Ukraine\u2019s war-hit cities.",
      "The issue of ceding territory remains a major sticking point in negotiations, and Russian President Vladimir Putin last week reiterated his goal to take eastern Ukraine \u201cby force\u201d unless his unwavering demands are met.",
      "Zelenskyy said there was still no common understanding on the land issue and that Ukrainians should vote on any territorial concessions in a referendum.",
      "Russia has continued its bombardment of Ukraine as talks continue. Ukraine's southern port city of Odesa and the surrounding region suffered major blackouts on Saturday after a large overnight Russian attack on the power grid across the country.",
      "Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant also temporarily lost all offsite power overnight for the 12th time, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said on Saturday, citing its Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a post on X: \"It is important that everyone now sees what Russia is doing \u2013 every step they take in terror against our people, all their attacks, for this is clearly not about ending the war. They still aim to destroy our state and inflict maximum pain on our people.\"",
      "Witkoff's visit to Berlin comes as the European Union agreed Friday to indefinitely freeze Russian assets worth 210 billion euros ($246 billion) held in Europe, as it considers using those assets to fund Ukraine\u2019s war effort.",
      "The indefinite freeze appears to be a bid to convince Belgium, where much of that money is held at Euroclear, to agree to plans that would loan a large chunk of the money to Ukraine to cover its military and civilian budget needs in 2026 and 2027.",
      "Belgium opposed the plan because it fears legal retaliation by Russia, which has condemned the freezing of its assets as theft, but the agreement includes a guarantee that Belgium would not be left alone to foot the bill should a potential Russian lawsuit prove successful.",
      "Zelenskyy said Thursday that negotiators are wrestling with the question of territorial possession in U.S.-led peace talks on ending the war with Russia, including the future of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, one of the world\u2019s 10 biggest atomic plants.",
      "Speaking to reporters in Kyiv on Friday, Zelenskyy said the U.S. is offering as a compromise to create a \u201cfree economic zone\u201d in the Ukraine-controlled parts of the eastern Donbas which Russia has demanded that Ukraine cede.",
      "Among the issues Zelenskyy shared were that Russia wants to incorporate the entire Donbas, which Ukraine opposes. He also said the U.S. proposed turning Donbas into a \u201cfree economic zone.\u201d That would mean Ukrainian forces withdraw from Donbas and Russia refrains from entering the parts of Donbas it does not currently occupy.",
      "\u201cThey see it as Ukrainian troops withdrawing from the Donetsk region, and the compromise is supposedly that Russian troops will not enter this part of Donetsk region. They do not know who will govern this territory,\u201d he said, adding that Russia is referring to it as a \u201cdemilitarized zone.\u201d",
      "NATO chief Mark Rutte struck a drastic note Thursday as he urged allies to step up defense efforts. \u201cWe are Russia\u2019s next target,\u201d he said, warning of a conflict that could be on \u201cthe scale of war our grandparents and great-grandparents endured.\u201d"

      "A skydiving trip in Australia took a harrowing turn when one person\u2019s parachute became entangled in the tail of the plane, stranding them at 15,000 feet.",
      "The aircraft, a Cessna 208 Caravan, was carrying one pilot and 17 parachutists, including a camera operator, on Sept. 20 as they attempted a 16-person formation jump over the northernmost part of the state of Queensland.",
      "The camera operator stepped out first, holding on to the fuselage of the plane. When the first skydiver emerged, a handle securing their reserve chute got caught on the plane\u2019s flap over the wing, prompting the chute to deploy inadvertently, according to a video and a report about the incident released Thursday by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.",
      "The chute dragged the skydiver backward, knocking the camera operator off the plane and into free fall. The skydiver, who has not been publicly identified, flew straight into the plane\u2019s horizontal stabilizer on the left side of the tail, and the chute became wrapped around it, leaving the skydiver suspended.",
      "The pilot, unaware of what had happened, felt the aircraft suddenly pitch up, and noticed the airspeed rapidly decreasing. Believing the aircraft had stalled, the pilot increased power to regain airspeed but reduced it after being told a skydiver was hung up on the tail.",
      "Thirteen other parachutists exited the plane in quick succession, while two remained in the doorway. They watched as the skydiver used a hook knife \u2014 which is not mandatory equipment \u2014 to cut through 11 ropes connected to the chute, enabling it to tear free in about 50 seconds.",
      "But that was only the first problem.",
      "The skydiver then deployed the main parachute, but it was tangled with the remnants of the reserve chute. The skydiver fell about 7,000 feet from the plane before the main lines fully unwound from the dangling reserve line and functioned normally for the remainder of the descent, the report said.",
      "All parachutists landed safely, including the camera operator and the first skydiver, who sustained minor leg injuries from hitting the horizontal stabilizer.",
      "Meanwhile, the pilot was having control difficulties because the impact of the skydiver had damaged the horizontal stabilizer, which still had part of the reserve chute wrapped around it.",
      "The pilot, who was wearing an emergency parachute, was prepared to bail out from the plane if necessary, but was ultimately able to land safely at Tully Airport, officials said.",
      "According to the report, the Far North Freefall Club, which organized the jump, now requires all parachutists to carry a hook knife.",

      "Will this Saturday see a shocking, sad and incredibly premature end to Mohamed Salah\u2019s career at Liverpool, as one of the greatest players in their history could suddenly say goodbye after a truly incredible meltdown?",
      "It feels like \u201cThe Egyptian King\u201d is about to be dethroned and sensationally leave Liverpool, despite being their star player, becoming a Premier League legend over the last few years and still being one of the best forwards on the planet.",
      "Why?",
      "And how did things devolve so quickly for a club that won the league last season in dominant fashion and then added several star players in the offseason?",
      "Last weekend, Salah fumed publicly about being named as a substitute in Liverpool\u2019s last three games, including never seeing the pitch against Leeds before he lost the plot and was left out of the squad for Liverpool's huge 1-0 win at Inter Milan on Tuesday as a consequence of his incredible rant to reporters.",
      "\u201cI have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season,\u201d Salah said. \u201cNow I\u2019m sitting on the bench and I don\u2019t know why. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame,\" he said.",
      "\u201cHow I see it now is like you throw Mo under the bus because he is the problem in the team now. But I don\u2019t think I am the problem. I have done so much for this club. The respect, I want to get it. I don\u2019t have to go every day fighting for my position because I earned it. I am not bigger than anyone, but I earned my position. It\u2019s football. It is what it is.\u201d",
      "Imagine Tom Brady being benched by the New England Patriots. Would he be happy about it? Nope. Would he say something like this in public about it? Probably not.",
      "For a current NFL comparison, this would be similar to the Kansas Chiefs benching Patrick Mahomes because of their poor record this season. How would he react?",
      "That is why Salah\u2019s public comments have caused so much uproar. You keep things like this in-house. Now you\u2019ve created one heck of a mess and you\u2019re watching everyone scramble around you, at a time when reigning Premier League champions Liverpool are already scrambling and struggling for wins.",
      "Ahead of their game against Brighton this Saturday, Liverpool manager Arne Slot is noncommittal on whether Salah will be welcomed back into his squad. Slot, who looks genuinely hurt and disappointed with the situation, is one of the nice guys and has let Salah stew on his comments and put the ball in his court when it comes to reconciliation.",
      "Liverpool is unbeaten in the four games since Salah was benched and have genuinely improved their overall performance. Has Slot made the right call? Time will tell. But right now, he has the upper hand.",
      "Given Salah\u2019s truly unbelievable words to reporters, it seems likely he\u2019s played his last game for Liverpool. He will head to Morocco after Saturday\u2019s game as he will captain Egypt during the Africa Cup of Nations tournament. He\u2019s not scheduled to be back at Liverpool until after the January transfer window opens. The timing of Salah\u2019s meltdown is clearly significant. If he\u2019s going to stay on the bench, he wants out. In Salah\u2019s eyes, Liverpool have a month to figure it out.",
      "Most think we will never see Salah, who has been instrumental in Liverpool's return to glory and its winning two Premier League titles, a Champions League trophy and several other trophies over the last decade, in a Liverpool jersey again.",
      "It\u2019s sad. It\u2019s a shame. But even if nobody wants to admit it, it has been heading this way for a few months.",
      "Salah, 33, has been hammered by Liverpool club legends, fans and pretty much everyone else after his rant. Salah, the third-highest scorer in the club's famed history with 250 goals, was not meant to end his legendary Liverpool career this way. He was supposed to lead them to more titles and build on his wonderful 2024-25 season, as he put together one of the greatest campaigns the Premier League has ever seen.",
      "But his drop off this season, like Liverpool\u2019s as a team, has been stark. The reigning champs are languishing in the middle of the pack and have won just two of their last 10 games in the Premier League to all but end their hopes of back-to-back titles.",
      "That downturn has come amid a summer of huge spending on new superstars who have been slow to gel, the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota in July, which has hit Salah and his Liverpool teammates extremely hard, and the departure of long-time star Trent Alexander-Arnold.",
      "New superstars Alexander Isak, Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz (who cost a combined $400 million this summer) played well together as a trio without Salah at Inter Milan in midweek, and Dominik Szoboszlai started in Salah\u2019s place on the right and is a more defensive, robust option. For Liverpool as a team, it\u2019s working right now, sans Salah.",
      "If Salah is to leave Liverpool in the coming weeks, will he even be allowed on the Anfield pitch against Brighton to say goodbye on Saturday? Will most of Liverpool\u2019s fans inside the hallowed ground greet him with warmth? Or will he be lambasted for the way he\u2019s aired Liverpool\u2019s dirty laundry in public? The bitter divide he\u2019s created was the last thing Liverpool needed as they continue to struggle on the pitch.",
      "Does Salah have a point with some of his rant? Maybe.",
      "He\u2019s been nowhere near his best \u2014 most would say that\u2019s been the case since he signed his huge new contract in April \u2014 but neither has the majority of Liverpool\u2019s players this season. But it\u2019s the fact that he sees himself as undroppable and a guaranteed starter no matter what that has upset Slot, Liverpool legends and fans the most.",
      "Even if you think you\u2019re irreplaceable, as all super-talented and driven athletes like Salah usually do, you can\u2019t say it out loud. Or you shouldn\u2019t.",
      "Salah probably deserves some extra leeway amid Liverpool\u2019s struggles. But with the team going through its biggest slump in a  decade, all eyes have been on Salah. And he wasn\u2019t performing. Even if he didn\u2019t think he was the main problem, now he is.",
      "The problem Salah has is that you can clearly make the argument that Liverpool looks like a better, more solid and balanced team since Slot dropped him. It is scoring goals and looking cohesive and fluid in attack. Hence, Salah\u2019s rant to remind everyone just how important and special he is and how he deserves more respect and shouldn\u2019t have to play by the same rules as everyone else. But he does. Even if he doesn\u2019t see eye-to-eye with the manager.",
      "\u201cI said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager and all of a sudden, we don\u2019t have any relationship,\u201d Salah said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn\u2019t want me in the club.\u201d",
      "Compared to his public outburst on his contract situation last November, the difference this time is that most Liverpool fans aren\u2019t on Salah\u2019s side. These comments were so strong that it has probably cost Salah a statue outside Anfield. Will this be remembered 25 years from now? Probably.",
      "But why now? Why did he decide to go all-in on the club and Slot?",
      "Because it\u2019s not only about Salah lashing out and making sure everyone knows he\u2019s not the problem at Liverpool. It\u2019s about him ending this on his terms. He knows he\u2019s heading away on international duty with Egypt for the next few weeks, at least, and he may be sold by the start of January.",
      "Salah wants to control the situation and, in his eyes, these comments have allowed him to do it. It also puts pressure on Slot, and Salah may think that by the time he returns in January, Slot may be fired if Liverpool\u2019s poor form in the league continues.",
      "But after saying what he did, Salah now doesn\u2019t control his Liverpool farewell. If he\u2019s not on the bench and in the matchday squad against Brighton on Saturday, then usually he would not be  permitted to be on the pitch around the game.",
      "\u201cI said to my family, come to the Brighton game \u2014 I don\u2019t know if I am going to play or not, but I am going to enjoy it,\u201d Salah said. \u201cIn my head, I\u2019m going to enjoy that game because I don\u2019t know what is going to happen now. I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to the Africa Cup. I don\u2019t know what is going to happen when I am there.\u201d",
      "Will Liverpool put Salah\u2019s comments aside to allow him to say an emotional goodbye to fans at Anfield this weekend? That would make the hierarchy and Slot look weak if the rift with Salah isn\u2019t resolved before Saturday.",
      "Salah\u2019s Liverpool career may have already ended the moment he opened his mouth in the mixed zone last weekend, and now he has to deal with the consequences.",
      "If this is it for Salah, it\u2019s a sad end to one of the greatest careers in Premier League history. Liverpool\u2019s Egyptian King looks set to step off his throne quietly and without any kind of adulation or grand send-off from Anfield."

      "\u201cAs you probably know, we\u2019ve just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLarge tanker, very large, largest one ever seized actually.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Customs and Border Protection proposal would apply even to countries that don't require visas to enter.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to require travelers from more than 40 countries to provide their social media histories from the last five years to enter the U.S., according to a notice published Tuesday in the Federal Register.",
      "The data would be \u201cmandatory\u201d for new entrants to the U.S., who hail from 42 countries that are part of the visa waiver program, according to the notice from Customs and Border Protection.",
      "Residents of the United Kingdom and Germany are among the countries from which visitors do not require visas to visit the U.S., which, according to the notice, could add an extra hurdle for travelers. British citizens and people of other waived countries currently can complete \u201cElectronic System for Travel Authorizations\u201d in lieu of obtaining visas.",
      "Providing social media histories would now be part of the requirements to complete the ESTA, according to the proposal.",
      "The Trump administration has increased restrictions on people entering the U.S., and President Donald Trump ran a campaign that focused on border and immigration crackdowns.",
      "In addition to social media histories, Customs and Border Protection would add other new data collection fields, including email addresses and telephone numbers used in the last five years, as well as the addresses and names of family members, the notice reads.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman said the proposal is not final, and it is not clear how applicants would be required to provide their social media.",
      "A spokesperson for CBP said in a statement Wednesday that the proposal \"is simply the first step in starting a discussion to have new policy options to keep the American people safe.\"",
      "\"The Department is constantly looking at how we vet those coming into the country, especially after the terrorist attack in Washington DC against our National Guard right before Thanksgiving,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "The U.S. public has 60 days to comment on the proposal, the Federal Register notice reads.",
      "The U.S. next year will host FIFA World Cup events, which are sure to draw fans from around the world, including from the U.K. and other countries where visitors do not require visas.",
      "A Trump administration official told NBC News that while World Cup ticket holders may be fast-tracked, they would still be subject to the same requirements as other travelers.",
      "\u201cThe FIFA PASS enables ticket holders in countries that have long wait times to get a priority appointment, but it does not change the visa application process whatsoever,\" the official said. \"We employ the same vetting process for everyone for national security purposes.\"",
      "In June, the State Department announced it was requiring people seeking certain types of visas to enter the U.S. to change their social media profiles to public.",
      "The Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group, called that move unprecedented and said the U.S. restriction was intended to \"surveil and suppress foreign students\u2019 social media activity.\"",
      "Last week the State Department announced that it would expand an \"online presence review\" to include H-1B applicants and their dependents.",
      "Since Trump returned to office in January, the State Department has also sought to revoke visas for people in the U.S. who have protested about the war in Gaza.",
      "The Trump administration has also announced plans to clamp down on various forms of legal immigration after an Afghan national was named as the suspect in the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C., last month. The suspect has pleaded not guilty.",
      "CORRECTION (Dec. 10, 2025, 4:52 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated who would be affected by the administration\u2019s plan. Travelers from 42 countries would be affected, not all foreign visitors."

    "story": [
      "This year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize winner, Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, was a no-show on Wednesday at the award ceremony in Oslo, Norway.",
      "But the Nobel organizers knew Machado would not make it there in time because they spoke with her by phone just before she boarded a plane for Norway and she promised to tell them privately \"what we had to go through\" to get there.",
      "\"So many people risked their lives in order for me to be in Oslo,\" Machado said in a phone call to the Nobel Prize organizers posted on X. \"And this is a measure of what this recognition means to the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "Machado did not explain why she was delayed but said she was very sad to miss the ceremony and was looking forward to reuniting with her family for the first time in two years.",
      "\"This is a prize for all Venezuelans,\" she said.",
      "Machado's daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado, accepted the award of her mother's behalf to a standing ovation and said they would finally be able to embrace after \u201c16 months of living hell.\u201d",
      "Then, while a giant portrait of Machado hung next to an empty seat on the stage in Oslo City Hall, she read a speech her mother had prepared, which said the award \u201creminds the world that democracy is essential to peace.\"",
      "\u201cFreedom is not something we wait for, but something we become,\u201d Machado wrote. \u201cIt is a deliberate, personal choice, and the sum of those choices forms the civic ethos that must be renewed every day.\"",
      "The ceremony was attended by members of Norway\u2019s royal family, as well as Latin American leaders like Argentine President Javier Milei and Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa.",
      "Earlier, the Norwegian Nobel Institute said in a statement that Machado had \u201cdone everything in her power to come to the ceremony\u201d and that her journey had been one \u201cof extreme danger.\u201d",
      "While the institute was \u201cprofoundly happy to confirm that she is safe and that she will be with us in Oslo,\u201d it said Machado would be unable to receive the award in person."
