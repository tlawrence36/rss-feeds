      "Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc is back. So are the stars of \u201cWicked\u201d and the animals of \u201cZootopia.\u201d",
      "Summer may be known as sequel season, but part twos, and threes, will play big roles this fall at the movies. That goes not just for the likes of Rian Johnson's \u201cWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery,\u201d \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d and \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d but for new installments in family sagas, ranging from the Crawleys (\u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d) to the Na'vi (\u201cAvatar: Fire & Ash\u201d).",
      "Still, much of the season will belong, as it always does, to original dramas and awards contenders. Hollywood tends to save its best for last.

    "story": [
      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry condemned Woody Allen for speaking at a Russian film festival, calling his participation in the event \u201ca disgrace and an insult\u201d to the victims of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine",
      "The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry on Monday condemned Woody Allen for speaking virtually at a Russian film festival over the weekend, calling his participation in the event \u201ca disgrace and an insult\u201d to the victims of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "According to Russian media, Allen spoke Sunday at the Moscow International Film Week via video conference. The appearance put him at odds with the Hollywood establishment, which has embraced the Ukraine cause during Russia's 3 1/2-year war, with prominent actors signing on to the United24 crowdfunding initiative and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy making virtual appearances at past Golden Globes and Grammys ceremonies.",
      "Footage aired by Russian state TV showed the filmmaker addressing a tightly packed movie theater from a massive screen, with pro-Kremlin film director Fyodor Bondarchuk moderating the session. Russian media reports quoted Allen as saying that he has always liked Russian cinema, recounting his past trips to Russia and the Soviet Union, and talking about what he would do if he were to receive a proposal to direct a movie in the country.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s Foreign Ministry in an online statement on Monday said that it \u201cstrongly condemns\u201d Allen\u2019s participation in the festival, which \u201cbrings together supporters and mouthpieces of Putin.\u201d The ministry called it \u201ca disgrace and an insult to the victims among Ukrainian actors and filmmakers who have been killed or wounded by Russian war criminals,\u201d adding that Allen \u201cis deliberately turning a blind eye to the atrocities that Russia has been committing in Ukraine.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press on Monday, Allen criticized Putin and denounced the invasion but called for cultural exchange to continue.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to the conflict in Ukraine, I believe strongly that Vladimir Putin is totally in the wrong. The war he has caused is appalling,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut, whatever politicians have done, I don\u2019t feel cutting off artistic conversations is ever a good way to help.\u201d",
      "The website of the festival, which runs through Wednesday, billed Allen as one of its headliners, along with Serbian film director Emir Kusturica and American actor Mark Dacascos. Moscow International Film Week is a relatively new festival, first held in the Russian capital in August 2024. It is separate from the decades-old Moscow International Film Festival, which in 2022 was stripped of its International Federation of Film Producers Associations accreditation following the invasion of Ukraine.",

      "Twenty-seven years ago he attended his first Venice Film Festival with the instant classic \u201cOut of Sight\u201d; 20 years ago, it\u2019s where he debuted his sophomore film, \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck,\u201d which earned him his first best director nomination; and 11 years ago, it\u2019s where he exchanged vows with then Amal Alamuddin, at the Aman Venice, a five-star hotel perched alongside the Grand Canal.",
      "Venice is a city that he, like many, thinks is one of the most beautiful in the world. Unlike most people, he also owns 15-bedroom villa a few hours away on Lake Como that famously co-starred in \u201cOcean\u2019s Twelve.\u201d",
      "This year he\u2019ll be back on the Lido again with Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u201cJay Kelly,\u201d in which he plays a middle-aged movie star on a journey through Europe with his manager, played by Adam Sandler. And his longtime friend and oft co-star Julia Roberts is making her Venice debut this year with \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d",
      "Here are some of Clooney\u2019s most memorable Venice moments.",
      "As legend has it, Clooney\u2019s long term love affair with Venice may have begun with the festival\u2019s premiere of Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Elmore Leonard adaptation \u201cOut of Sight.\u201d Then 37 and doing press alongside Jennifer Lopez, the actor would also make another big jump soon: Leaving \u201cER\u201d that February.",
      "This Coen brothers joint, co-starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, premiered out of competition at the 60th Venice Film Festival, alongside titles like \u201cMatchstick Men,\u201d \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Mexico\u201d and \u201cThe Dreamers.\u201d Clooney\u2019s nearby Italian residence was already as famous as him, and a stakeout spot for amateur and professional paparazzi.",
      "In a profile that fall, while shooting \u201cOcean\u2019s Twelve,\u201d Vanity Fair writer Ned Zeman observed: \u201cThat an affable, self-effacing Kentucky-born Hollywood actor is fast becoming the most popular public figure in Italy says a little about Italy and a lot about Clooney, who isn\u2019t Italian, doesn\u2019t speak Italian, and lives here only in summertime.\u201d",
      "Clooney\u2019s acclaimed black-and-white dramatization of journalist Edward R. Murrow\u2019s clash with Joseph McCarthy began its successful run in competition at the 62nd Venice Film Festival. Though it lost the Golden Lion to Ang Lee\u2019s \u201cBrokeback Mountain,\u201d it did go on to pick up six Oscar nominations including for Clooney\u2019s directing.",
      "During the trip, he also inspired a cocktail still served at the ritzy Belmond Hotel Cipriani on Giudecca. One night he retreated to the hotel\u2019s Gabbiano Bar where his friend, the legendary bar manager Walter Bolzonella, mixed him a drink of lemon, sugar, vodka, cranberry juice, ginger and Angostura bitters and named it Buona Notte in honor of the film. The two would later name a prosecco, passionfruit and elderflower cocktail La Nina after Clooney\u2019s mother, which was served at his wedding.",
      "Tony Gilroy\u2019s \u201cMichael Clayton,\u201d which nabbed Clooney an Oscar nomination for his turn as the titular law firm fixer, played in competition at Venice. The top prize went again to an Ang Lee film: \u201cLust, Caution,\u201d which also beat out the likes of \u201cI\u2019m Not There,\u201d \u201cAtonement\u201d and \u201cThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.\u201d",

      "Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s \u201cGravity\u201d opened the 70th edition of the Venice Film Festival before going on to win seven Oscars.

      "The canals were packed with paparazzi for the nuptials of one of Hollywood\u2019s favorite bachelors. On Sept. 27, Clooney, then 53, and Alamuddin, then 36, exchanged vows in front of 100 of their closest friends and family, including Bono and Matt Damon, at the luxury hotel Aman Grand Canal, originally a grand palazzo built in 1550. She wore a custom Oscar de la Renta dress, of French lace, pearls and diamant\u00e9 accents. He wore a black wool/cashmere Giorgio Armani tuxedo.",
      "Clooney returned to the festival with another of his directing projects, \u201cSuburbicon,\u201d a dark comedic satire about a seemingly idyllic 1950s community with Damon and Julianne Moore. This festival was especially notable for it being the Clooneys\u2019 first public appearance since the birth of their twins, Alexander and Ella, a few months prior.",
      "This time George was the plus one to Amal, who was receiving an award from the Diane von Furstenberg and The Diller-von Furstenberg Family Foundation for her work as a human rights lawyer. The power couple gave the festival some much-needed star power amid the actors strike with an appearance at the adjacent DVF Awards. \u201cI am here in Venice with my husband; he is a rising star,\u201d she said that night. \u201cI just wanted to say, you, my love, like this city, take my breath away.\u201d",
      "Clooney and Pitt reunited for the Jon Watts action comedy \u201cWolfs,\u201d that played out of competition. But the spotlight was less on the film and more on the off-screen drama of the AppleTV+ produced film only getting a limited theatrical release, and his then-recent New York Times op-ed urging President Joe Biden to end his reelection bid.",
      "\u201cThe person who should be applauded is the president who did the most selfless thing anyone\u2019s done since George Washington,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cAll the machinations that got us there, none of that\u2019s going to be remembered. And it shouldn\u2019t be. What should be remembered is the selfless act.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Netflix appears to have its first No. 1 box-office title in the streaming company\u2019s 18-year history thanks to the sensation of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "Rival studios on Sunday estimated \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d led all films over the weekend with $16-18 million in ticket sales. Distribution executives from three studios shared their estimates for the Netflix phenomenon on condition of anonymity because the streaming company has a policy of not reporting ticket sales.",
      "Following a dominating few weeks as one of the most popular Netflix releases ever, the streamer put the film into 1,750 theaters for sing-along screenings Saturday and Sunday. Studios are able to accurately estimate ticket sales for all releases on Sunday morning, though the uncommon nature of the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d releases means a wider variance. Some estimates were as high as $20 million.",
      "It amounted to a victory lap for \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d arguably the biggest hit of Hollywood\u2019s summer, and an ironic success for Netflix, whose emphasis on streaming, not theatrical release, upended the movie industry. Another sore spot for Hollywood: The film was developed and produced by Sony Pictures, which sold it to Netflix.",
      "Not all exhibitors went along. AMC, the largest theater chain in North America, declined to show the movie. But that didn\u2019t stop Netflix from claiming the box-office title its more traditional competitors typically own.",
      "David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm FranchiseRe, called it \u201ca completely unique two-day musical event.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt may turn out to be higher,\u201d said Gross. \u201cTheater owners are quick on their feet and can add capacity according to demand.\u201d",
      "The theatrical release, though limited, is out of the ordinary for the streaming giant, which has long stressed a commitment to subscriber releases. The movie debuted on the platform in late June and is currently Netflix's most-watched animated original film.",
      "The film centers on Huntr/x, a KPop superstar trio who double as demon hunters. The members, Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong) and Zooey (Ji-young Yoo), must protect their fans and face their biggest enemy yet: a rival boy band made up of demons in disguise.",
      "Zach Cregger's horror hit \u201cWeapons\u201d maintained strength in the box office during its third weekend, bringing in $15.6 million domestically. The buzzy horror movie has proved its staying power, raking in over $100 million globally since its release.",
      "Disney's \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d landed behind the horror movie once again, earning $9.2 million in North American theaters.",
      "The two films are \u201creal bright spots\u201d as the box office heads into a \u201crather quiet finish\u201d for the summer, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore. Both films, which premiered simultaneously earlier this month, had a minimal 36% drop from last weekend.",

      "Actor Jerry Adler has died at 96",
      "NEW YORK -- Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \u201cpassed peacefully in his sleep,\u201d Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a creature of nepotism,\u201d Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \u201cI got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\u201d",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \u201cSanta Barbara.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \u201cThe Public Eye\u201d and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \u201cchills\u201d when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \u201cNorthern Exposure\u201d paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d",

      "Films included Woody Allen's \u201cManhattan Murder Mystery,\u201d but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \u201cRescue Me,\u201d \u201cMad About You,\u201d \u201cTransparent\u201d and guest spots on shows ranging from \u201cThe West Wing\u201d to \u201cBroad City.\u201d",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \u201cTaller Than a Dwarf\u201d in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \u201cFish in the Dark.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\u201d Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\u201d",
      "Adler published a memoir, \u201cToo Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\u201d last year. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \u201ctoo goofy-looking\u201d to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",

      "Fandom is a funny thing in the age of social media. Spend enough time scrolling and it\u2019s easy to feel like you really know a celebrity, and all their friends. The new film \u201cLurker,\u201d a Sundance breakout in theaters Friday, explores the question of what might happen if a certain type of fan got a foot in the door, and what they might do to stay there.",
      "Archie Madekwe\u2019s Oliver hardly knows what\u2019s coming when he walks into a trendy Los Angeles clothing shop. A rising music star, Oliver seems already accustomed to a certain amount of attention wherever he goes, with asks for selfies and autographs just part of the deal. So of course he\u2019s taken aback when one of the employees, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin\u2019s Matthew, doesn\u2019t seem to know or care who he is. Oliver doesn\u2019t see that it\u2019s an act and is soon asking this stranger to come around and hang with his entourage.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning Matthew thinks Oliver has this god-given place of celebrity and success,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cHe quickly understands that he will have to give things to serve a certain purpose in Oliver\u2019s world and his ego. But also that they\u2019re not dissimilar. They\u2019re both playing by a certain rule book that is written by Oliver. If the power becomes Matthew\u2019s, he can also write the rules.\u201d",
      "The film is the directorial debut of Alex Russell, whose own star is rising. He wrote \u201cForks,\u201d widely considered one of the best episodes of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d and won an Emmy for co-executive producing the Netflix series \u201cBeef.\u201d His script for \u201cLurker,\u201d which he wrote sort of as a challenge for himself during COVID lockdowns, immediately became a hot commodity. Madekwe remembers being bummed when he didn\u2019t hear back after he put himself on tape to play the hanger-on.",
      "A few years later, Madekwe\u2019s agent called and said Russell wanted to meet him. Not for Matthew, but for Oliver.",
      "\u201cI had to completely rethink the film and the structure and the what it was about,\u201d Madekwe said. \u201cBut it was most daunting to imagine myself needing to go and meet Alex and convince him that I could play somebody like this cool character.\u201d",
      "He needn\u2019t have been so worried. Unbeknownst to Madekwe, Russell had been doing some stealth behind-the-scenes work. After someone recommended his name, Russell saw Madekwe in a coffee shop one day and just watched him for 20 minutes. His conclusion: This is Oliver.",
      "Russell was cognizant of the limitations he was faced with as a first-time director making an independent film, where things like casting and hiring are often rushed.",
      "\u201cMy goal was to get what I felt like were underrated actors,\u201d Russell said. \u201cPeople who could come in and really hit it out of the park. Then people would look at this movie and be like wow they really took a step up here. That\u2019s kind of where you can punch above your weight if you\u2019re making your first movie and don\u2019t have a huge budget.\u201d",

Putting it together was hard work, with strict limits on budget and time, but Russell said the experience of \u201cLurker\u201d was charmed nonetheless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only because I got so lucky with decisions I made early on with casting and hiring,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much of it is like I\u2019m just a kid with a screenplay and everyone else has to be really good at their job.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t feel a little like the movie sometimes, like just like a group of like young creatives,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cThere was a real LA film and music scene that was very present. That was helpful for me \u2014 it was like the fun aspect of the movie, not the hard-core humiliation.\u201d",
      "Many involved describe the process as uniquely collaborative. Madekwe also stepped up as a producer, which wasn\u2019t just a vanity title. He was actually involved in many major creative decisions, including recommending Suljic, who he\u2019d just worked with on a music video, and finding locations and some of the music for the film, including a song called \u201cLove and Obsession,\u201d written by Rex Orange County.",

I think that conversation is really interesting and exciting. But most importantly, I think it\u2019s really exciting to be at the beginning of Alex Russell\u2019s career and to invest into a filmmaker that I think is gonna be making incredible films for a very long time.\u201d",

      "Ron Howard\u2019s \u201cEden\u201d opens with a bold statement: \u201cFascism is spreading.\u201d",
      "It'll surely carry weight in modern society, but the phrase is referencing events from nearly a century ago. Based on a true story, \u201cEden\u201d retraces what happened when a group of Europeans attempted to start anew on the remote island of Floreana, only to encounter the earthly failings they hoped to escape: chaos, blackmail, betrayal and even murder.",
      "Howard assembles an impressive cast, though it isn't always enough to make up for the overambitious plot of a film that drags in the middle.",
      "1920s Germany, haunted after accepting blame for World War I, was on the brink of demise, as mass poverty and broad social unrest laid ground for the extremism that birthed the Nazi party.",
      "\u201cEden\u201d shows us none of that, instead dropping us on a small island of the Gal\u00e1pagos, where Dr. Friedrich Ritter ( Jude Law ) and his loyal partner, Dore Strauch Ritter ( Vanessa Kirby ) found solace after fleeing their native country. The idealist doctor is inspired by a newfound purpose of penning radical philosophy that will \u201csave humanity from itself.\u201d",
      "Yet the historical resonance, which could have provided pointed commentary on the parallels between today and the 1920s, falls flat amid the film\u2019s overlong runtime, unlikable characters and shaky accents that most actors stumble in and out of. In the midst of the film\u2019s crafted chaos, the story inevitably loses focus. Still, \u201cEden\u201d made room for some memorable performances.",
      "More adventurists eventually arrive on the island, and just like that, human interaction starts to breed madness.",

      "The Ritters' quiet isolation is disrupted by the couple, who arrive with Wittmer\u2019s young son, chasing the promise of an island utopia to ease their deep disillusionment with everyday reality. The tension between the two groups further exacerbates when Eloise Bosquet de Wagner Wehrhorn ( Ana de Armas ), who calls herself the Baroness, arrives with her two lovers, determined to build a resort on the island.",

      "The film lacks depth in exploring questions of morality and human nature while depicting Ritter\u2019s lofty goals to save humanity.

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After three decades in Hollywood, Daniel Dae Kim has done spy thrillers, sci-fi epics and medical dramas. But there\u2019s one role that\u2019s eluded the Korean American actor: romantic leading man. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years,\u201d Kim says with a laugh.",
      "His latest project, \u201cButterfly,\u201d which features a star-studded cast including top Korean actors Kim Tae-hee and Park Hae-soo (\u201cSquid Game\u201d), follows a former U.S. intelligence operative in South Korea whose past catches up with him. It premiered on Amazon Prime in the U.S. and elsewhere earlier this month, but makes its Korean debut Friday.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press in Seoul, South Korea, Kim revealed one of his biggest regrets, reflected on cultural lessons from the Korea-U.S. co-production, and opened up about what it\u2019s really like being the bridge between two cultures while pursuing his mission to tell stories \u201cthat haven\u2019t been told yet.\u201d The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "KIM: As an EP, I\u2019m a job creator. I am a person responsible for a lot of people, and I will fight so much harder for others than I often fight for myself. When I feel like one of the cast, or one of the crew, or one of the writers is not being taken care of, I\u2019m not afraid to talk to anybody and have a hard conversation.",
      "KIM: Every day, there was something that needed to be translated literally through language but also working styles. In Korea, because it\u2019s a more Confucian society, the hierarchy of departments is very clear. We had to learn to talk to the head of the department who would then talk to the staff, as opposed to if you have an issue with one of the staff, you go directly to the staff. This kind of thing was new to the Americans.",
      "KIM: I think in 2007 I got a DUI when I was working on \u201cLost,\u201d and I regret that night every day of my life. At the time, I felt so much shame, so much guilt, so much regret. I felt terrible to my parents, because that\u2019s not the way I think they wanted me to be raised. I think with the right perspective, these things, these mistakes that you made can actually be helpful for your life because they can guide you in certain ways.",
      "KIM: We\u2019re already seeing it. If you look at what happened with Paramount and CBS News, we\u2019re seeing a chilling effect on free speech and journalism and DEI. \u201cDEI\u201d is a bad word these days, but to me, DEI\u2019s not a fad. The idea of inclusion is not something that\u2019s a political trend. It\u2019s my life. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve lived every decade I\u2019ve been in this business.",

      "KIM: I got so much criticism when I did \u201cLost\u201d that I had to learn how to not take it so personally because it hurt a lot at the time. When I came to Korea when I was 18, cab drivers would give me such a hard time because I couldn\u2019t speak fluent Korean. And they were like, \u201cYou\u2019re Korean, your face is Korean, why don\u2019t you speak Korean?\u201d They had never thought about an immigrant experience from another country. But now Korea is so used to that kind of thing that people are much more understanding.",
      "KIM: I have a lot of sympathy for actors who take stereotypical roles when they\u2019re starting out because you need some way to break into the business. It\u2019s much easier once you\u2019re more successful and more established because you have more financial stability. It\u2019s something that, if you\u2019re not a person of color, or someone who\u2019s a minority in the United States, you don\u2019t have to think about. You don\u2019t think about what this role means for the rest of a nation or an ethnicity. You just do what you\u2019re drawn to, and that\u2019s very liberating. I am lucky enough now where I can also make those same choices. But I don\u2019t ever escape the fact that whatever I do will be watched and seen by so many people and judged through their own lens and filters.",
      "KIM: I\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years. I\u2019ve never gotten the opportunity and it\u2019s one of those interesting things because I look the way I do as an Asian American and Asian men were never considered handsome or sexy. That\u2019s changing now though. I\u2019m friends with Jimmy O. Yang and, a few years ago, he got to play a romantic lead in a rom-com. And I said to Jimmy like, \u201cWho would have thought you, Jimmy, would have been the one to be the romantic lead?\u201d But I was so happy for him because it meant that the way we were looking at Asian men was different.",

      "Much of the fun of \u201cSplitsville\u201d is seeing how things topple from here, but it\u2019s obvious enough that Julie and Paul\u2019s agreement will get tested, very quickly. From there, the four central characters of the film \u2014 Carey, Paul, Julie and Ashley \u2014 will take various turns in less of a romantic triangle than an adult game of musical chairs.",
      "Though there are elaborately choreographed long takes that smack of contemporary moviemaking, \u201cSplitsville\u201d belongs more to a screwball tradition stretching back to the 1930s. This is \u2014 even here in the low ebb of late summer \u2014 an uncommonly adult farce of infidelity that Cary Grant and Irene Dunne might have chuckled at, even if they didn\u2019t get the \u201cVanilla Sky\u201d reference, the digs about New Balance sneakers or the delight of seeing Nicholas Braun turn up, late in the film, as a mentalist.",
      "I\u2019m convinced, though, that the performer here who would have been most at home in that bygone comedy heyday is Johnson. For the second time this year, following \u201cMateralists,\u201d she finds herself caught between the affections of two men. Here, just her watchful poise brings a welcome perspective on the mostly male mayhem around her.",
      "The twists and turns of \u201cSplitsville\u201d can grow a little tiresome. Reversals pile on top of each other. But in a movie about infidelity where everyone is lying more to themselves than to their partners, those patterns effectively lead back to where everyone started.",

      "Pricey prescriptions and nagging medical costs are swamping some insurers and employers, which means patients may start paying more next year",
      "Pricey prescriptions and nagging medical costs are swamping some insurers and employers now. Patients may start paying for it next year.",
      "Health insurance will grow more expensive in many corners of the market in 2026, and coverage may shrink. That could leave patients paying more for doctor visits and dealing with prescription coverage changes.",
      "Price increases could be especially stark in individual coverage marketplaces, where insurers also are predicting the federal government will end some support that helps people buy coverage.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in a period of uncertainty in every health insurance market right now, which is something we haven\u2019t seen in a very long time,\u201d said Larry Levitt, an executive vice president at the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care.",
      "In conference calls to discuss recent earnings reports, insurers ticked off a list of rising costs: More people are receiving care. Visits to expensive emergency rooms are rising, as are claims for mental health treatments.",
      "Insurers also say more healthy customers are dropping coverage in the individual market. That leaves a higher concentration of sicker patients who generate claims.",
      "Enrollment in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance marketplaces swelled the past few years. But a crackdown on fraud and a tightening of eligibility verifications that were loosened during the COVID-19 pandemic makes it harder for some to stay covered, Jefferies analyst David Windley noted.",
      "People who use little care \u201care disappearing,\u201d he said.",
      "Prescription drugs pose another challenge, especially popular and expensive diabetes and obesity treatments sometimes called GLP-1 drugs. Those include Ozempic, Mounjaro, Wegovy and Zepbound.",
      "\u201cPharmacy just gives me a headache, no pun intended,\u201d said Vinnie Daboul, Boston-based managing director of the employee benefits consultant RT Consulting.",
      "New gene therapies that can come with a one-time cost of more than $2 million also are having an impact, insurance brokers say. Those drugs, which target rare diseases, and some newer cancer treatments are part of the reason Sun Life Financial covered 47 claims last year that cost over $3 million.",
      "The financial services company covers high-cost claims for employers that pay their own medical bills. Sun Life probably had no claims that expensive a decade ago and maybe \u201ca handful at best\u201d five years ago, said Jen Collier, president of health and risk solutions.",
      "Some of these drugs are rarely used, but they cause overall costs to rise. That raises insurance premiums.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s adding to medical (cost growth) in a way that we haven\u2019t seen in the past,\u201d Collier said.",
      "Price hikes will be most apparent on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual coverage marketplaces. Insurers there are raising premiums around 20% in 2026, according to KFF, which has been analyzing state regulatory filings.",
      "But the actual hike consumers see may be much bigger. Enhanced tax credits that help people buy coverage could expire at the end of the year, unless Congress renews them.",

There are numerous varieties of mint, oregano and cilantro, hyssop and New Zealand spinach, four-leaf sorrel, yarrow and a local variety of tarragon.",
      "R\u00f6tzel has built Monk Garden as a business since 2022, delivering to high-end restaurants that want flavorsome local plants for their dishes. It also organizes \u201cwild herb walks\u201d and workshops showing people how to make skin cream, wine and other items from the plants.",
      "Packed into about 2,000 square meters (21,530 square feet) in Marienfelde, on Berlin\u2019s southern edge, each of the plants has its own flavors and tangs and, in many cases, medicinal properties.",

      "During an illness 13 years ago, he deepened his knowledge of herbs and made teas that he said helped him regain his health. He also set up a medicinal monastic garden next to a church in the German capital, mirroring those grown in the Middle Ages to provide plants for food and healing.",
      "\u201cAt some point, the knowledge was lost,\u201d which was exacerbated by \u201cthe industrialization of food,\" R\u00f6tzel said. These days, \u201csomething like 99% of people don't know a single name of a plant.\"",

      "White blamed the COVID-19 vaccine for making him depressed and suicidal. On Aug. 8, he opened fire from a spot at a pharmacy across the street from CDC's main entrance. He killed a police officer and fired more than 180 shots into CDC buildings before killing himself. No one at CDC was injured.",
      "Williams, in his email, said: \u201cDue to our existing security protocols, the shooter did not attempt to enter campus on Friday, August 8, prior to the attack.\u201d",

      "The Ugandan farmer said recently that she regretted the loss of what would have been her second child \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t discover malaria and treat it early.\u201d",
      "Variations of such cases are commonly reported by Ugandan health workers who witness stillbirths or feverish babies that die within days from undiagnosed malaria. The deaths are part of a wider death toll tied to the mosquito-borne disease, the deadliest across Africa, but one easily treated in adults who seek timely medical care.",
      "Until recently, a major gap in malaria treatment was how to care for newborns and infants infected with malaria who weren\u2019t strong enough to receive regular medication. That changed last month when Swiss medical regulators approved medicine from the Basel-based pharmaceutical company Novartis for babies weighing between 2 and 5 kilograms (nearly 4\u00bd to 11 pounds).",
      "Swissmedic said the treatment, a sweet-tasting tablet that disperses into a syrup when dropped into water, was approved in coordination with the World Health Organization under a fast-track authorization process to help developing countries access much-needed treatment.",

      "Nigeria, Congo and Uganda \u2014 in that order \u2014 are the African countries most burdened by malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes that thrive and breed in stagnant water.",
      "The drug approved by Swiss authorities, known as Coartem Baby in some countries and Riamet Baby in others, is a combination of two antimalarials. It is a lower dose version of a tablet previously approved for other age groups, including for older children. Before Coartem Baby, antimalarial drugs designed for older children were administered to small infants with careful adjustments to avoid overdose or toxicity.",

      "China has been installing solar panels far faster than anywhere else in the world, and the investment is starting to pay off. A study released Thursday found that the country's carbon emissions edged down 1% in the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier, extending a trend that began in March 2024.",
      "The good news is China's carbon emissions may have peaked well ahead of a government target of doing so before 2030. But China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will need to bring them down much more sharply to play its part in slowing global climate change.",
      "For China to reach its declared goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, emissions would need to fall 3% on average over the next 35 years, said Lauri Myllyvirta, the Finland-based author of the study and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.",
      "\u201cChina needs to get to that 3% territory as soon as possible,\u201d he said.",
      "China's emissions have fallen before during economic slowdowns. What's different this time is electricity demand is growing \u2014 up 3.7% in the first half of this year \u2014 but the increase in power from solar, wind and nuclear has easily outpaced that, according to Myllyvirta, who analyzes the most recent data in a study published on the U.K.-based Carbon Brief website.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking really for the first time about a structural declining trend in China\u2019s emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "China installed 212 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first six months of the year, more than America's entire capacity of 178 gigawatts as of the end of 2024, the study said. Electricity from solar has overtaken hydropower in China and is poised to surpass wind this year to become the country's largest source of clean energy. Some 51 gigawatts of wind power was added from January to June.",

      "His lawyers have indicated they will rely on an insanity defense, which would mean he was incapable of understanding what he was doing or that it was wrong when he allegedly lit two fires in the multistorey boarding house. The defense team will not make a case until later in the trial, which is expected to run for five weeks.",
      "Prosecutor Stephanie Bishop rejected the case for an insanity defense during opening arguments Monday. She said the defendant lived in the building for a week but did not want to stay there and lit the fires in an attempt to seek a transfer to other accommodation.",
      "Bishop told the jury that the accused knew the potential consequences of his actions, New Zealand news outlets reported. The prosecutor said the man set a couch ablaze late in the evening, prompting an evacuation of the building.",
      "After residents put out the fire, the man returned and placed cushions and a blanket in a cupboard before setting them alight, Bishop said, adding that the man left the building without raising the alarm or calling emergency services.",
      "Some of the boarding house residents included social services clients and older, disabled and otherwise vulnerable people, as well as nurses working at a nearby hospital. The burned-out building remains standing in the district of Newtown, near the central city of New Zealand\u2019s capital.",

Non-local attendees pay 15 euros ($17.50) for a ticket and arrive from countries across the globe or cities a bus ride away.",
      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s going on, it\u2019s just a blur of tomatoes,\u201d said Adrian Columb of Ireland, who attended in 1999. \u201cIt was a blast.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the \u201cTomatina\u201d festival:",
      "Held on the last Wednesday of August, the event was inspired by a food fight between local children who pelted each other with tomatoes in 1945.",
      "After becoming a yearly tradition, \u201cTomatina\u201d was briefly banned in the 1950s by Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, a decision locals protested. Televised media attention in the 1980s turned the festival into a national event, eventually drawing an international crowd.",
      "In 2002, Spain officially recognized the festival as an international tourism attraction. Since then, the event has only been suspended twice, in 2020 and 2021, because of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "The tomatoes thrown aren\u2019t from crops treated like those used for food. That\u2019s because they\u2019re grown exclusively for the festival, said Bu\u00f1ol Deputy Mayor Sergio Galarza.",

      "Ukrainian war veteran Oleh Tserkovnyi has inspired two fellow veterans to swim across the Bosphorus on their country's Independence Day",
      "ISTANBUL -- During a pool training session months ago, Ukrainian war veteran Oleh Tserkovnyi was struck by an idea: What if a group of veterans swam across the strait of Bosphorus, between Turkey\u2019s European and Asian shores? And if they did it on Aug. 24, Ukraine\u2019s Independence Day?",
      "The symbolism of the day would draw attention to the toll and devastation inflicted by Russia's full-out war on Ukraine, now in its fourth year.",
      "When the 34-year-old pitched the idea to fellow veterans in their One for Another support group, none raised injuries, particularly their amputations, as a barrier. Two joined him right away.",
      "They trained for months, with the support of Superhumans Center, a veterans' rehabilitation clinic in Ukraine, and coached by CapitalTRI, an amateur triathlon team in Kyiv. They agreed their race would have another goal \u2014 to raise money for prosthetics, which remain costly and urgently needed by many of Ukraine\u2019s wounded.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for pity,\u201d Tserkovnyi told The Associated Press shortly before the competition. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for support.\u201d",
      "After months of rigorous training, discipline and physical challenges, the three Ukrainian veterans on Sunday joined more than 2,800 swimmers from 81 countries in the 6.5-kilometer (4-mile) crossing from Asia to Europe.",
      "The Bosphorus Intercontinental Swimming Race is an open-water event held each year in Istanbul, organized by the Turkish Olympic Committee since 1989.",
      "All three Ukrainians completed the crossing, each swimming for more than an hour. The two veterans with amputations faced setbacks even before the start \u2014 the organizers initially barred them from competing, insisting they have to be in a separate category for people with disabilities.",
      "But they persevered and swam the race, alongside the others.",
      "For the Ukrainians, it wasn\u2019t just about endurance but about reclaiming control over bodies transformed by war \u2014 and sharing their recovery with a world that often seems indifferent to the injuries they carry.",
      "Sports had always been a part of Tserkovnyi\u2019s life, but war and injury pushed him to use it as a survival tool after two severe, life-changing concussions \u2014 a bridge back to life for war veterans with disabilities.",
      "\u201cSport itself heals \u2014 we\u2019ve seen that firsthand,\" he said. \"And the community, it pulls you through. It pushes you, it disciplines you.\u201d",
      "When he speaks, he\u2019s quick to point out the changes he sees in himself \u2014 the stutter, the involuntary twitch in his eye.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s left over. It used to be much worse,\u201d he said.",
      "Both of his concussions were the result of prolonged exposure to artillery fire while serving on the front line. He was a sniper when the second one hit. Afterward, he said, it felt like he had lost his sense of balance entirely.",
      "\u201cThere were times I could walk, but then suddenly I'd just tip over like a pencil,\u201d Tserkovnyi said. \u201cI have third-degree hearing loss on one side, no peripheral vision.\u201d",
      "The sense of being \u201ca sick person,\u201d he said, felt so foreign to him that he threw himself into recovery with everything he had. For a long time, he also had PTSD symptoms, including dramatic flashbacks to the war.",

      "Shortly after Ko\u2019s statement, South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed it had fired warning shots Tuesday afternoon at North Korean soldiers who briefly crossed the military demarcation line in the central border region while carrying out unspecified construction work.

      "In recent months, South Korea's military has occasionally used loudspeaker warnings and fired warning shots to repel North Korean soldiers crossing the military demarcation line. The incidents were largely seen as accidental as North Korean troops build anti-tank barriers, plant mines and carry out other work to reinforce border defenses amid heightened tensions.",
      "Ko said the North Korean soldiers were conducting a \u201cbarrier project to permanently block the southern border,\u201d as part of broader efforts of \u201ccompletely separating\u201d the territory between the Koreas, when the South responded with an audio warning and warning shots. Ko said the North had informed U.S. forces in the South of their plans for the border work on June 25 and July 18 to prevent accidental clashes.",
      "\u201c As the commanding officer responsible for the southern border management and security, I strongly demand (the South) to immediately stop the dangerous provocation aimed to make the fortification project in the southern border necessary for defending our sovereignty an excuse for escalation of tension,\u201d Ko said in a statement.",

      "The Kurds in Afrin \u201chave been subjected to a lot over the past eight years,\u201d Hamouda said, adding, \u201cI hope that the youth of Afrin will not think badly of us because of this affiliation\u201d with the new authorities.",
      "Formerly a Kurdish-majority area, Afrin was seized by Turkish forces and allied Syrian opposition fighters in 2018, following a Turkey-backed military operation that pushed fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and thousands of Kurdish civilians from the area.",

      "Shares in China Evergrande, the real estate developer whose downfall led a collapse in the country\u2019s property market, have been delisted from Hong Kong's stock exchange as creditors work to wind up debts that totaled over $300 billion",
      "BANGKOK -- Shares in China Evergrande were removed from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on Monday, marking another step in the retreat of the giant real estate developer whose downfall contributed to a prolonged crisis in China's property market.",
      "Evergrande's creditors are still working to wind up debts that amounted to more than $340 billion. Once China's second-largest developer, it ran into trouble when Chinese regulators cracked down several years ago on what they deemed to be excess borrowing by developers.",
      "That caused dozens of property companies to default on their debts, triggering a downturn in the property market that is still dragging on the world's second-largest economy.",
      "Here's what to know about Evergrande:",
      "The Hong Kong Exchange said Monday that Evergrande's shares were delisted as of Monday morning, as expected. The shares were last traded on January 29, 2024, and then suspended after a court in Hong Kong ordered liquidation of the company when it failed to provide a viable debt restructuring plan.",
      "Rules of the exchange stipulate that a company's share listing may be canceled if trading in its securities is suspended for 18 straight months.",
      "After years of warnings that led to global rating agencies cutting the Chinese government\u2019s credit rating in 2017, the ruling communist party cracked down on real estate debt in 2020. It imposed controls known as \u201cthree red lines\u201d that prohibited heavily indebted developers like Evergrande from borrowing more to pay off bonds and bank loans as they matured.",
      "Fears of a possible Evergrande default in 2021 rattled global markets, but they eased after the Chinese central bank said its problems were contained and Beijing would keep credit markets functioning. Evergrande was one of the biggest of many developers that failed to repay their creditors.",
      "Chinese home buyers often pay up front for apartments before they're even built. The credit crunch for Evergrande and other developers led them to suspend construction, leaving many projects in limbo. The slowing of home purchases and building rippled throughout the economy, hitting demand for construction materials, appliances and even vehicles at a time when China was also contending with disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Since most Chinese families have their wealth tied up in property, the anemic housing market has been a major factor crimping consumer spending.",
      "There has been some recovery in the housing sector, but home prices and investment have continued to fall.",
      "Before the crackdown on borrowing, real estate accounted for some 20% of China\u2019s economy. When spending on steel and copper for construction, furniture and other related purchases was added in, estimates of its share of the economy rose to about a third.",

      "The cuts took effect as the school year began in the nation's sixth-most populous city and could herald similar moves by major transit agencies around the U.S. as they struggle with rising costs and lagging ridership.

    "story": [
      "The nonprofit that manages Central Park has thrown its support behind a proposal to end the horse-drawn carriages that have been fixtures in the greenspace for more than 150 years",
      "NEW YORK -- For more than 150 years, horse-drawn carriages have been trotting through Manhattan's Central Park, weathering the arrival of the automobile, years of criticism from animal rights activists and even a mayoral administration that vowed to ban the tourist activity.",
      "But now the influential nonprofit that manages the 843-acre park \u2014 and has previously stayed out of the debate \u2014 has now thrown its support behind a proposal to wind down the industry as early as next summer.",
      "The Central Park Conservancy argued in an Aug. 12 letter to the City Council that horse carriages have an outsized impact on public safety and road infrastructure in the increasingly crowded park.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t be just frozen in time,\u201d said Elizabeth Smith, the conservancy's CEO, in an interview this week. \u201cHorses are too unpredictable and the roadways are too busy with too many different kinds of users now \u2014 bikers, runners, pedestrians, strollers.\u201d",
      "Smith noted other cities have done away with the nostalgic rides, including San Antonio, which passed a five-year phase out of the industry last year. Chicago banned it starting in 2021 and Montreal did the same the year prior.",
      "The carriage industry argues it\u2019s being unfairly singled out, despite the number of horses in the park barely budging since World War II.",
      "There are currently 68 licensed carriage owners with a total of about 200 horses and 170 drivers, according to the Transport Workers Union, which represents industry employees.",
      "Meanwhile, Central Park sees some 40 million visitors annually, many of them increasingly zipping around on rental bikes or hitching a ride on one of the human-powered pedicabs that line the park\u2019s entry points. Cars were banned from the park's drives in 2018.",
      "Eliminating carriage horses also goes against famed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s vision for the park, with its hilly paths and undulating roads tailor-made for leisurely carriage rides, argues Christina Hansen, a longtime carriage driver and industry spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the park the way it was meant to be seen,\u201d she said as she gave a recent tour, which runs about $72 for the first 20 minutes and $29 for each additional 10 minutes.",
      "Animal rights groups have long complained the horses can get easily spooked on city streets, leading to accidents and injuries. They also claim the horses are overworked and live in inadequate stables and their drivers flaunt city regulations, including leaving behind piles of horse manure. All animals are supposed to be fitted with manure-catching devices.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s simply no way to operate horse-drawn carriages and have it be safe or humane for the horses,\u201d said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of the animal rights group New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets. \u201cNo amount of regulation can change that. Lord knows we have tried.\u201d",
      "The conservancy\u2019s call came after a carriage horse collapsed and died near its stables earlier this month, with videos and photos of the animal\u2019s body in a city street circulating widely online.",
      "But the organization, which was formed to revitalize the park in the 1980s, didn\u2019t weigh in on the animal welfare concerns in its letter to the council.",
      "Smith said the tipping point was two recent incidents of carriage horses running amok: in May, a spooked horse bolted from its handler and ran loose through the park. Days later, two more horses broke free from their drivers and crashed into a fleet of parked pedicabs, breaking a driver\u2019s wrist and causing other injuries.",

      "Lynn Buckalew, a tourist from Utah lined up for a carriage ride earlier this week, said a guided jaunt through the park was high on her to-do list.

      "Revolution Wind was expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut\u2019s first commercial-scale offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes.

      "Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House\u2019s demands",
      "WASHINGTON -- Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House's demands.",
      "For months, Powell has largely ignored President Donald Trump's constant hectoring that he reduce borrowing costs. Yet on Friday, in a highly-anticipated speech, Powell suggested that the Fed could take such a step as soon as its next meeting in September.",
      "It will be a fraught decision for the Fed, which must weigh it against persistent inflation and an economy that could also improve in the second half of this year. Both trends, if they occur, could make a cut look premature.",
      "Trump has urged Powell to slash rates, arguing there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and saying that a cut would lower the government\u2019s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.",
      "Powell, on the other hand, has suggested that a rate cut is likely for reasons quite different than Trump's: He is worried that the economy is weakening. His remarks on Friday at an economic symposium in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming also indicated that the Fed will move carefully and cut rates at a much slower pace than Trump wants.",
      "Powell pointed to economic growth that \u201chas slowed notably in the first half of this year,\u201d to an annual rate of 1.2%, down from 2.5% last year. There has also been a \u201cmarked slowing\u201d in the demand for workers, he added, which threatens to raise unemployment.",
      "Still, Powell said that tariffs have started to lift the price of goods and could continue to push inflation higher, a possibility Fed officials will closely monitor and that will make them cautious about additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed\u2019s key short-term interest rate, which influences other borrowing costs for things like mortgages and auto loans, is currently 4.3%. Trump has called for it to be cut as low as 1% \u2014 a level no Fed official supports.",
      "However the Fed moves forward, it will likely do so while continuing to assert its longstanding independence. A politically independent central bank is considered by most economists as critical to preventing inflation, because it can take steps \u2014 such as raising interest rates to cool the economy and combat inflation \u2014 that are harder for elected officials to do.",
      "There are 19 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee, 12 of whom vote on rate decisions. One of them, Beth Hammack, president of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Cleveland branch, said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press that she is committed to the Fed\u2019s independence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m laser focused ... on ensuring that I can deliver good outcomes for the for the public, and I try to tune out all the other noise,\u201d she said.",
      "She remains concerned that the Fed still needs to fight stubborn inflation, a view shared by several colleagues.",
      "\u201cInflation is too high and it\u2019s been trending in the wrong direction,\u201d Hammack said. \u201cRight now I see us moving away from our goals on the inflation side.\u201d",

But Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that was likely a deliberate choice and intended, ironically, to demonstrate the Fed's independence.",
      "\u201cThe not talking about independence was a way of trying as best they could to signal we\u2019re getting on with the business,\u201d Posen said. \"We\u2019re still having a civilized internal discussion about the merits of the issue. And even if it pleases the president, we\u2019re going to make the right call.\u201d",
      "It was against that backdrop that Trump intensified his own pressure campaign against another top Fed official.",
      "Trump said he would fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook if she did not step down from her position. Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to head the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged Wednesday that Cook committed mortgage fraud when she bought two properties in 2021. She has not been charged.",
      "Cook has said she would not be \u201cbullied\u201d into giving up her position. She declined Friday to comment on Trump's threat.",
      "If Cook is somehow removed, that would give Trump an opportunity to put a loyalist on the Fed\u2019s governing board. Members of the board vote on all interest rate decisions. He has already nominated a top White House economist, Stephen Miran, to replace former governor Adriana Kugler, who stepped down Aug. 1.",
      "Trump had previously threatened to fire Powell, but hasn\u2019t done so. Trump appointed Powell in late 2017. His term as chair ends in about nine months.",
      "Powell is no stranger to Trump's attacks. Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, noted that the president also went after him in 2018 for raising interest rates, but that didn't stop Powell.",
      "\u201cThe president has a long history of applying pressure to Chairman Powell,\u201d Strain said. \u201cAnd Chairman Powell has a long history of resisting that pressure. So it would be odd, I think, if on his way out the door, he caved for the first time.\u201d",
      "Still, Strain thinks that Powell is overestimating the risk that the economy will weaken further and push unemployment higher. If inflation worsens while hiring continues, that could force the Fed to potentially reverse course and increase rates again next year.",
      "\u201cThat would do further damage to the Fed's credibility around maintaining low and stable price inflation,\u201d he said.",

      "Beyond LA Fitness, California-based Fitness International operates brands like Esporta Fitness, City Sports Club, and Club Studio \u2014 spanning across more than 600 locations with over 3.7 million members nationwide. And the FTC pointed to two \u201cunfair and unlawful\u201d cancellation processes that it says these gyms have used for years: in-person cancellation or cancellation by mail.",

    "summary": "Ukraine's defense industry is gaining global attention for its innovative drone technology",
    "story": [
      "Ukraine's defense industry is gaining global attention for its innovative drone technology",
      "When a Ukrainian-made drone attacked an ammunition depot in Russia last September, it showcased Kyiv\u2019s determination to strike deep behind enemy lines and the prowess of its defense industry.",
      "The moment was especially gratifying for the woman in charge of manufacturing the drones that flew more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) to carry out this mission. For months after, Russia no longer had the means to keep up devastating glide bomb attacks like the one that had just targeted her native city of Kharkiv.",
      "\u201cFighting in the air is our only real asymmetric advantage on the battlefield at the moment. We don\u2019t have as much manpower or money as they have,\u201d said Iryna Terekh, head of production at Fire Point.",
      "Terekh spoke as she surveyed dozens of \u201cdeep-strike drones\u201d that had recently come off the assembly line and would soon be used by Ukrainian forces to attack arms depots, oil refineries and other targets vital to the Kremlin\u2019s war machine and economy.",
      "Spurred by its existential fight against Russia \u2014 and limited military assistance from Western allies \u2014 Ukraine has fast become a global center for defense innovation. The goal is to match, if not outmuscle, Russia\u2019s capabilities \u2014 and Fire Point is one of the companies leading the way.",
      "The Associated Press was granted an exclusive look inside one of Fire Point\u2019s dozens of covert factories. In a sprawling warehouse where rock music blared, executives showed off their signature FP-1 exploding drones that can travel up to 1,600 kilometers (994 miles). They also touted publicly for the first time a cruise missile they are developing that is capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles), and which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes will be mass-produced by the end of the year.",
      "Even as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for an end to the 3 1/2-year war \u2014 and dangles the prospect of U.S. support for NATO-like security guarantees \u2014 Ukrainian defense officials say their country is determined to become more self-sufficient in deterring Russia.",
      "\u201cWe believe our best guarantee is not relying on somebody\u2019s will to protect us, but rather our ability to protect ourselves,\u201d said Arsen Zhumadilov, the head of the country's arms procurement agency.",
      "Ukraine's government is now purchasing about $10 billion of weapons annually from domestic manufacturers. The industry has the capacity to sell triple that amount, officials say, and they believe sales to European allies could help it reach such potential in a matter of years.",
      "Like most defense companies in Ukraine, Fire Point grew out of necessity after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Despite pleas from Ukrainian military officials, Western countries were unwilling to allow Kyiv to use their allies' longer-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory.",
      "That's when a group of close friends, experts from various fields, set out to mass-produce inexpensive drones that could match the potency of Iranian-made Shahed drones that Russia was firing into Ukraine with devastating consequences.",
      "The company's founders spoke with AP on the condition of anonymity out of concern for their safety and the security of their factories.",
      "By pooling together knowledge from construction, game design and architecture, the company's founders \u2014 who had no background in defense \u2014 came up with novel designs for drones that could fly further and strike with greater precision than most products already on the market. Their long-range drones had another benefit: they did not need to take off from an air field.",
      "When Terekh \u2014 an architect \u2014 was hired in the summer of 2023, she was given a goal of producing 30 drones per month. Now the company makes roughly 100 per day, at a cost of $55,000 apiece.",
      "The FP-1 looks more like a hastily made science project than something that would roll off the production lines of the world's biggest defense contractors. \u201cWe removed unneeded, flashy glittery stuff,\u201d she said.",
      "But the FP-1 has been extremely effective on the battlefield.",

      "\u201cI think the best drones, or among the best, are Ukrainian drones,\" said Claude Chenuil, a former French military official who now works for a trade group that focuses on defense. \u201cWhen the war in Ukraine ends, they will flood the market.\u201d",
      "Fire Point\u2019s story is not entirely unique. Soon after Russia's 2022 invasion, hundreds of defense companies sprouted almost overnight. The Ukrainian government incentivized innovation by relaxing regulations and making it easier for startups to work directly with military brigades.",
      "Patriotic entrepreneurs in metallurgy, construction and information technology built facilities for researching and making weapons and munitions, with an emphasis on drones. The ongoing war allowed them to test out ideas almost immediately on the battlefield, and to quickly adapt to Russia\u2019s changing tactics.",
      "\u201cUkraine is in this very unique moment now where it is becoming, de facto, the Silicon Valley of defense,\u201d said Ukrainian defense entrepreneur Yaroslav Azhnyuk. \u201cThe biggest strategic asset that we have is that we have been at war with Russia for 11 years.\u201d",
      "A case in point: Fire Point had initially sourced navigational equipment for its drones from a major Western firm, but before long Russia was able to disrupt their effectiveness using electronic warfare; so Fire Point developed its own software to outwit the enemy.",
      "Because defense companies are high-value targets for Russia, many operate underground or hidden within civilian centers to evade detection. Although they are guarded by air defenses, the strategy has the disadvantage of putting civilians at risk. Many Ukrainians have died in imprecise Russian attacks that were likely targeting weapons facilities. Entrepreneurs said the alternative is to operate openly and face attacks that would set back the war effort.",
      "On the day AP reporters visited the Fire Point factory, there were dozens of drones awaiting delivery. They would all be gone within 72 hours, shipped to the battlefield in inconspicuous cargo trucks.",
      "The Fire Point team receives regular feedback from army units, and the company has reinvested most profits toward innovating quickly to keep pace with other drone makers. Increasingly, those profits are being directed to develop a new, more potent weapon.",
      "The company completed testing this year for its first cruise missile, the FP-5. Capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) and landing within 14 meters (45 feet) of its target, the FP-5 is one of the largest such missile in the world, delivering a payload of 1,150 kilograms (2,535 pounds), independent experts said. Because initial versions of the missile came out pink after a factory error, they called it the Flamingo \u2014 and the name has stuck.",
      "Fire Point is producing roughly one Flamingo per day, and by October they hope to build capacity to make seven per day, Terekh said.",
      "Even as Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials pursue ways to end the war, Terekh said she is skeptical that Russia will accept terms for a real peace. \u201cWe are preparing for a bigger, much scarier war.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- With electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, President Donald Trump has lashed out at renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, blaming them for skyrocketing energy costs.",
      "Trump called wind and solar power \u201cTHE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!\u201d in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or \u201cfarmer destroying Solar\u201d projects. \u201cThe days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!\u201d he wrote on his Truth Social site.",
      "Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand, aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. Increased use of electric vehicles also has boosted demand, even as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans move to restrict tax credits and other incentives for EV purchases approved under the Biden administration.",
      "Natural gas prices, meanwhile, are rising sharply amid increased exports to Europe and other international customers. More than 40% of U.S. electricity is generated by natural gas.",
      "Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to lower Americans\u2019 electric bills by 50%. Democrats have been quick to blame him for the price hikes, citing actions to hamstring clean energy in the sprawling tax-and-spending cut bill approved last month, as well as regulations since then to further restrict wind and solar power.",
      "\u201cNow more than ever, we need more energy, not less, to meet our increased energy demand and power our grid. Instead of increasing our energy supply Donald Trump is taking a sledgehammer to the clean energy sector, killing jobs and projects,\u201d said New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.",
      "The GOP bill will cost thousands of jobs and impose higher energy costs nationwide, Heinrich and other critics said.",
      "A report from Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank, found the GOP tax law will increase the average family\u2019s energy bill by $130 annually by 2030. \u201cBy quickly phasing out technology-neutral clean energy tax credits and adding complex material sourcing requirements,\u201d the tax law will \u201csignificantly hamper the development of domestic electricity generation capacity,\u201d the report said.",

      "Not all the pushback comes from Democrats.",
      "Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican who backs wind power, has placed a hold on three Treasury nominees to ensure wind and solar have \u201can appropriate glidepath for the orderly phase-out of the tax credits\u201d approved in the 2022 climate law under former President Joe Biden.",
      "Grassley said he was encouraged by new Treasury guidance that limits tax credits for wind and solar projects but does not eliminate them. The guidance \u201cseems to offer a viable path forward for the wind and solar industries to continue to meet increased energy demand,\u201d Grassley said in a statement.",
      "John Quigley, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said the Republican tax law will increase U.S. power bills by slowing construction of solar, wind, and battery projects and could eliminate as many as 45,000 jobs by 2030.",
      "Trump administration polices that emphasize fossil fuels are \u201can extremely backward force in this conversation,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cBesides ceding the clean energy future to other nations, we are paying for fossil foolishness with more than money \u2014 with our health and with our safety. And our children will pay an even higher price.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Both Wall Street and the White House will be paying close attention to Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s high-profile speech Friday at the Fed\u2019s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming",
      "WASHINGTON -- Just three weeks ago, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke to reporters after the central bank had kept its key interest rate unchanged for a fifth straight meeting and said the job market was \u201csolid.\u201d",
      "His assessment was important because if the job market is healthy, there is less need for the Fed to cut its key interest rate, as President Donald Trump has demanded. Two days later, the Labor Department issued a report that cast doubt on that assessment, showing hiring was weak in July and much lower than previously estimated in May and June.",
      "So, there will be a lot of attention paid by Wall Street and the White House to Powell's high-profile speech Friday at the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. If the famously data-dependent Powell shifts gears and takes a gloomier view of the job market, that could open the door for a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in September.",
      "Powell could also stick to the cautious approach he's maintained all year and reiterate that the central bank needs more time to evaluate the impact of Trump's sweeping tariffs on inflation.",
      "Most economists expect Powell to signal that a rate cut is likely this year, but won\u2019t necessarily commit to one next month. That could disappoint Wall Street, which has put high odds on a September cut.",
      "Powell's speech, his last address at Jackson Hole as chair before his term ends in May, will occur against a particularly fraught backdrop. About a week after the jobs numbers, the latest inflation report showed that price growth crept higher in July. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose 3.1% from a year ago, above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Stubbornly elevated inflation pushes the Fed in the opposite direction that weak hiring does: It suggests the central bank's short-term rate should stay at its current 4.3%, rather than be cut. That would mean other borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and business loans, would stay elevated.",
      "\u201cSo the plot has thickened,\u201d said David Wilcox, a former top Fed economist and now director of economic research at Bloomberg Economics and also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute. \u201cThe dilemma that the Fed is in has become, if anything, more intense.\u201d",
      "Powell is also navigating an unprecedented level of public criticism by Trump, as well as efforts by the president to take greater control of the Fed, which has long been independent from day-to-day politics.",
      "Most observers credit Powell for his nimble handling of the pressures. An iconic moment in his tenure was Trump's visit to tour the Fed's renovation of its office buildings last month. Trump had charged that Powell mismanaged the project, which had ballooned in cost to $2.5 billion, from an earlier estimate of $1.9 billion.",
      "With both the president and Fed chair in white hard hats on the building site, in front of cameras, Trump claimed the cost had mushroomed even further to $3.1 trillion. Powell shook his head, so Trump handed him a piece of paper purporting to back up his claim.",
      "Powell calmly dismissed the figure, noting that the $3.1 billion included the cost of renovating a third building five years earlier.",

      "Powell appeared to at least temporarily assuage Trump during the tour, after which the president backed off his threats to fire the Fed chair over the project.",
      "The attacks from Trump are the latest challenges for Powell in an unusually tumultuous eight years as Fed chair. Not long after being appointed by Trump in 2018, Powell endured the president's criticisms as the Fed slowly raised its key rate from the low levels where it had remained for years after the 2008-2009 Great Recession.",
      "Powell then found himself grappling with the pandemic, and after that the worst inflation spike in four decades that occurred as government stimulus checks fueled spending while crippled supply chains left fewer goods available.",
      "Powell then oversaw a rapid series of rate hikes that were widely predicted to cause a recession, but the economy continued plugging ahead.",
      "In his latest attempt to pressure the Fed, on Wednesday Trump called on Fed governor Lisa Cook to step down, after an administration official, Bill Pulte, accused her of mortgage fraud. Pulte is head of the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",
      "Cook said in a statement that she wouldn't be \u201cbullied\u201d into resigning and added that she was preparing to answer the charges.",
      "For Powell, there's a difficult decision to make on interest rates. The Fed's \u201cdual mandate\u201d calls for it to keep prices stable while seeking maximum employment. But while the weak jobs data suggest the need for a cut, many Fed officials fear inflation will get worse in the coming months.",
      "\u201cThere is still a fair amount that\u2019s still outstanding,\u201d Raphael Bostic, president of the Fed's Atlanta branch, said in an interview, referring to tariff-led price hikes. \u201cOne feedback we\u2019ve gotten both in our surveys and from direct conversations (with businesses) suggests that many still are looking to see the price that they charge their customers increase from where we are today.\u201d",
      "Other economists, however, point to the sharp slowdown in housing as a sign of a weak economy. Sales of existing homes fell in June to their lowest level in nine months amid elevated mortgage rates. Consumer spending has also been modest this year, and growth was just 1.2% at an annual rate in the first half of 2025.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot to like about the economy right now outside of AI,\" said Neil Dutta, an economist at Renaissance Macro. \u201cThe weakness in the economy isn't about tariffs,\u201d but instead the Fed's high rates, he added.",

He told U.S. authorities that he was wired about $2 million to do so, according to the complaint.",
      "Authorities did not specify in the complaint the types of weapons that were exported.",
      "To carry out his operation, Wen purchased a business in 2023 called Super Armory, a federal firearms licensee, for $150,000, and registered it under his business partner's name in Texas. He had other people purchase the firearms and then drove them to California, misrepresenting the shipments as a refrigerator and camera parts. Investigators did not say whether Wen had organized any shipments during his first 10 years in the U.S.",
      "The FBI in September seized 50,000 rounds of ammunition from Wen's home in the LA suburb of Ontario that had been stored in a van parked in the driveway, the complaint says. They also seized a chemical threat identification device and a transmission detective device that Wen said he planned to send to the North Korean government for military use, the complaint says.",

      "Back in 2023, Wimbledon brought on Morgan Riddle, a tennis influencer and the longtime girlfriend of fourth-ranked player Taylor Fritz \u2014 the runner-up at the U.S. Open 12 months ago \u2014 to lead a digital video series. Called \u201cThreads,\u201d the series focuses on tennis fashion and lifestyle through the eyes of Riddle, and has become a recurring series at the tournament.",
      "With titles like \u201cHow Wimbledon made tennis chic\u201d and \u201cBeing the best means being stylish,\u201d the \u201cThreads\u201d series appeals directly to fans on the fashion side of the sport, a niche that has been the entry point to tennis for many of the young audiences that these tournaments are targeting.",
      "Since the initial announcement of the U.S. Open\u2019s venture with \u201cGame, Set, Matchmaker\u201d \u2014 which garnered mixed reactions on social media \u2014 the concept of the show has changed from a more individual style, with one woman going on dates with multiple suitors, to the more expanded form it has now.",

      "NEW YORK -- Daniil Medvedev's match was delayed more than six minutes between points Sunday night, after a photographer entered the court on match point and the 2021 U.S. Open champion became enraged by the chair umpire's decision to award his opponent a first serve.",
      "The latest Medvedev meltdown on Louis Armstrong Stadium led to a wild change in the match. The No. 13 seed was a point away from being eliminated, then won the next two sets to force a deciding fifth before Benjamin Bonzi eliminated him from a second straight major with a 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5), 0-6, 6-4 victory that ended early Monday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy, this match,\u201d Bonzi said. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s like my best victory ever.\u201d",
      "And he blamed Medvedev for making it a tense one, saying he believed the Russian's behavior crossed a line.",
      "\u201cI mean, the rule is the rule. The guy went on the court between two serves,\u201d Bonzi said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not my call to say first serve. And I think, yes, Daniil started it, and he put oil on the fire.\u201d",
      "Bonzi had just hit his first serve leading 5-4 in the third set. After he missed it, a photographer left his position and began walking along the side of the court.",
      "Chair umpire Greg Allensworth told the photographer to get off the court, then announced that Bonzi would get another first serve because of the delay \u2014 which is common in tennis. Medvedev then approached the chair to complain about the decision.",
      "\u201cHe wants to go home, guys. He doesn\u2019t like to be here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour,\u201d Medvedev shouted into the microphones behind the chair.",
      "Medvedev said after the match that he didn\u2019t believe the interference from the photographer was long enough to warrant restarting the point.",
      "\u201cI was not upset with the photographer. I was upset with the decision,\u201d Medvedev said. \u201cThe delay from the photographer was probably four seconds and a half. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s enough for a (first) serve.\u201d",
      "Medvedev also shouted \u201cWhat did Reilly Opelka say? What did Reilly Opelka say?\u201d as he backed away from Allensworth's chair. Opelka was penalized by the ATP Tour in February after calling Allensworth the \u201cworst ump on tour. \u201d",
      "Medvedev wouldn't elaborate on that part of the exchange during his press conference.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m getting big fine enough, so if I speak I\u2019m in big trouble, so I\u2019m not going to speak,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone knows what I talked about when I said Reilly. Reilly got fined big-time for this, so I\u2019m going to get a big fine, too.\u201d",

When Bonzi finally did, he missed the first serve and then lost the point, and Medvedev won the game and later the set to prolong the match.",
      "Bonzi, who had fans chanting his name at times, appeared ready to serve at one point before some started whistling. He explained that he didn't want to hit because it's difficult to play tennis without being able to hear the sound of the ball.",
      "\u201cEvery time I went on the line to serve and every time I did that, everyone was booing. I felt I didn\u2019t do anything bad in the match to, like, receive this treatment, and I didn\u2019t want to serve in those conditions,\u201d Bonzi said. \u201cSo I was waiting.\u201d",
      "It was reminiscent of Medvedev's 2019 match on the same court, when fans booed him for his antics and he later taunted the crowd in his post-match interview, saying the jeers gave him energy. Medvedev had snatched the towel from a ballperson and was given a code violation by umpire Damien Dumusois. Medvedev then threw his racket in the direction of Dumusois, barked something at him and later flashed his middle finger next to his forehead as he walked past the umpire\u2019s chair, actions that led to him being fined $9,000 for that match.",
      "Medvedev reached the final that year, then won the title two years later. But he went just 1-4 in Grand Slam tournaments this year and was also upset by Bonzi in the first round at Wimbledon.",

      "Tommy Fleetwood and Patrick Cantlay share the lead going into what figures to be a thriller of a finish at the Tour Championship",
      "ATLANTA -- By the time Patrick Cantlay wrapped up his fourth birdie in the last five holes for a 6-under 64 to take the lead, and Tommy Fleetwood dried himself off from a double bogey with a pair of birdies for a 67 to catch him, the Tour Championship was left with tantalizing possibilities.",
      "At stake on the final day of the season was the FedEx Cup.",
      "And the Ryder Cup.",
      "There was Fleetwood, embracing yet another chance to get his first PGA Tour title. There was Scottie Scheffler, who wins all the time.",
      "And right in the thick of it was Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley, one of five Americans among the top nine players at East Lake under consideration for a captain's pick.",
      "As if he hasn't been weighing this possibility enough already, Bradley registered for the tournament next to a room celebrating the 1963 matches at East Lake. There was the bag of Arnold Palmer, the last one to be a playing captain.",
      "\u201cIt was really weird looking at it,\u201d Bradley said Saturday after a 63, which he called his best round of the year. \u201cLike really strange. Because I\u2019m nowhere in the world of Arnold Palmer and somehow I\u2019m in this with him right now.\u201d",
      "Saturday was plenty entertaining, even on a dreary day when rain was never far away.",
      "Fleetwood seized control with four straight birdies early, only to lose the lead when a 6-iron in the water on the 220-yard 15th hole, where the back tee and peninsula green added to 10 shots in the water \u2014 eight more than the opening two rounds combined.",
      "As he crouched to read his bogey putt, a video board in front of him showed him he was about to lose his lead \u2014 unaware Cantlay was about to bury a bending, 25-foot birdie on the 17th.",
      "\u201cIt was just one bad swing on a very tough hole and that\u2019s what can happen,\u201d Fleetwood said.",
      "He responded by hitting pitching wedge from a bunker to 12 feet for birdie and wedge to 9 feet for a birdie on the next, allowing him to catch Cantlay at 16-under 194.",
      "They were two shots ahead of Henley, who birdied the 18th for a 69.",
      "Fleetwood endured a two-shot swing on the final hole to Bradley that cost him at the Travelers Championship. He lost a two-shot lead with three to play at the FedEx St. Jude Championship. This is his third time with at least a share of the 54-hole lead in his last six events.",
      "All he wanted was another chance, and this is another great one.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what everybody wants,\u201d Fleetwood said. \u201cI am lucky enough that I get to be one of those guys, so I\u2019m having the time of my life out there and I\u2019m playing great and I\u2019ve got to enjoy it while it\u2019s happening. You never know.",

      "Scheffler was so frustrated with putts he felt he slightly misread that he tossed his putter at his bag after missing an 8-foot birdie try on the 16th. He had missed two other birdie chances from slightly closer. He still shot 66, his 20th consecutive round under par.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m either going to win or I\u2019m not and we\u2019re going to know the picks,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident with the picks that we have. One more day of golf to kind of finalize this whole thing, and I can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m done with this whole process. I want it over with either way.\u201d",

She showed us that you can be fierce on the court and strategic off the court, and unapologetically herself the entire time.\u201d",

      "The 61-page complaint filed in Texas federal court follows through on a threat that Musk made two weeks ago when he accused Apple of unfairly favoring OpenAI and ChatGPT in the iPhone's app store rankings for top AI apps.",
      "Musk's post insinuated that Apple had rigged the system against ChatGPT competitors such as the Grok chatbot made by his own xAI. Now, he is detailing a litany of grievances in the lawsuit \u2014 filed by xAI and another of his corporate entities, X Corp. \u2014 in an attempt to win monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the alleged illegal tactics.",
      "The double-barreled legal attack weaves together several recently unfolding narratives to recast a year-old partnership between Apple and OpenAI as a veiled conspiracy to stifle competition during a technological shift that could prove as revolutionary as the 2007 release of the iPhone.",
      "\u201cThis is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,\u201d the lawsuit asserts.",
      "The complaint portrays Apple as a company that views AI as an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to its future success, prompting it to collude with OpenAI in an attempt to protect the iPhone franchise that has long been its biggest moneymaker.",
      "Some of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything \u201csuper apps,\u201d such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "The complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.",

      "OpenAI has countered with a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of harassment \u2014 an allegation that the company cited in its response to Monday's antitrust lawsuit. \u201cThis latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk\u2019s ongoing pattern of harassment,\u201d OpenAI said in a statement.",
      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The crux of the lawsuit revolves around Apple's decision to use ChatGPT as an AI-powered \u201canswer engine\u201d on the iPhone when the built-in technology on its device couldn't satisfy user needs. The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",
      "The lawsuit doesn't mention the potential threat that ChatGPT could also pose to Apple and the iPhone's future popularity. As part of its expansion efforts, OpenAI recruited former Apple designer Jony Ive to oversee a project aimed at building an AI-powered device that many analysts believe could eventually mount a challenge to the iPhone.",

Those include reviewing wind and solar energy permits, canceling plans to use large areas of federal waters for new offshore wind development and stopping work on another offshore wind project under construction for New York, although construction was later allowed to resume.",
      "Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont is scheduled to go to State Pier in New London, Connecticut, on Monday, where components for the Revolution Wind project are kept before being taken out to sea.

      "Revolution Wind is expected to be Rhode Island and Connecticut\u2019s first large offshore wind farm, capable of powering more than 350,000 homes. Power would be provided at a rate of 9.8 cents per kilowatt hour, locked in for 20 years. That is cheaper than the average cost of electricity in New England.",

      "Climate change is fueling conditions across several states that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers",
      "PAW PAW, Mich. -- Robb Rynd and his brother grew up farming and wanted to do more of it outside their day jobs, so they went in together on what's now a little over 200 acres of corn, soybeans, wheat and sorghum. Last year was a good year, and Rynd said he enjoyed walking the fields with his kids to see how the corn was doing.",
      "This year is a different story.",
      "All summer he's been scouting for brown and wilting leaves or ears of corn with kernels missing, and now it's becoming clear that every kernel will count this harvest. \u201cIt\u2019s almost kind of depressing to go out there and look at it and say, \u2018oh yep, it does look bad,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Across major corn-growing states, climate change is fueling conditions that make watching the corn grow a nail-biter for farmers. Factors like consistently high summer overnight temperatures, droughts and heavier-than-usual rains at the wrong time can all disrupt the plants\u2019 pollination \u2014 making each full ear of corn less of a guarantee and more of a gamble.",
      "Overall, corn growers got lucky this year with late-season weather that contributed to what is now predicted to be a record bumper crop. But experts say bouts of extreme weather are intensifying the waiting game during a critical time of year between planting and harvest.",
      "Human-caused climate change has worsened multiple U.S. extreme heat events this year and has steadily increased the likelihood of hotter overnight temperatures since 1970, according to Climate Central, an independent group of scientists who communicate climate science and data to the public.",
      "\u201dThe hot nights too, like the corn's never getting a break. It\u2019s just hot all the time,\" Rynd said. \u201cI know it\u2019s wearing on me.\u201d",
      "As a corn plant grows, the leaves unroll to reveal the tassel, the part that sheds pollen, explained Mark Licht, an associate professor of agronomy and an extension cropping systems specialist at Iowa State University. If the plant grows too fast, which can happen when it's consistently very hot, the tassel may be wrapped too tightly by the leaf, meaning less pollen gets released.",
      "That can lead to patchy ears of corn. Tight tassel wrap was reported in pockets across parts of the Midwest and the Plains, according to some agricultural trade publication reports during the growing season. Licht said he'd only seen tassel wrapping issues once before in his 20 years as an agronomist.",
      "High temperatures can stress corn in other ways, lowering pollen production, reducing pollen's viability or drying out other parts of the plants, reducing fertility. \"I think any of the pollination issues that we might be having are more because the nights have been so exceedingly warm,\" said Larry Walton, who farms near Rynd in southwestern Michigan, where many farmers irrigate because it's a drier area.",
      "\u201cWe tend to see pollination issues being more problematic when we have high temperatures and drought conditions or lack of rainfall,\u201d Licht said. Yet Iowa had plenty of rain and still saw some pollination issues. Excessive moisture can cause corn smut, a type of fungus that grows on the ears.",
      "He said farmers are having to pay more attention to this because \u201cthere's just more variable weather.\"",
      "This winter, the U.S. drought monitor reported drought in nearly 60% of corn production areas in the Midwest. But near or above normal rainfall nearly everywhere east of the Rockies this summer brought that down to just 3% as of the beginning of August, said Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "That, combined with consistent heat, means that \"we are expecting a monster U.S. corn crop in 2025,\" Rippey said.",

He planted his corn and soybeans 60 days behind schedule because it rained nearly every day for two months.",
      "They lost some fertilizer and some plants died in standing water, Good said, but they made up for it with some lucky weather later in the season.",
      "\u201cThe rain does fall in heavier bursts,\u201d Rippey said. He said that can be an issue for farmers because even when it doesn't cause flash floods, the moisture doesn't necessarily percolate into the soil. It runs off and carries fertilizer with it, which is a problem for rivers' health and farmers' pocketbooks.",
      "The trend toward higher humidity levels and warmer ocean temperatures, contributing to hotter nights, could be a bigger issue going forward, putting stress on crops like corn and soybeans, Rippey added.",
      "Late summer is a make-or-break time for farmers: They're trying to gauge how much they'll make from the year's crop and planning their next steps, and patchy pollination doesn't help.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019d like to upgrade a tractor ... or we\u2019d maybe try to pick up some more ground,\u201d Rynd said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to want to go do those things when you have a bad year like this.\u201d",
      "When the uncertain pollination is at its worst, if 15% to 25% of every ear of corn doesn't have kernels, that could mean a significant yield loss over a large field, said Nicolle Ritchie, a Michigan State University extension agent who helps Walton and Rynd survey their crops.",
      "Jason Cope co-founded a farm tech company called PowerPollen whose equipment can mechanically collect pollen and then pollinate future crops. He said that due to extreme weather events, the number of \u201crescue\u201d pollination jobs they've done for customers \u2014 to save fields that didn't naturally pollinate very well \u2014 has nearly doubled since they started in 2018.",

      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Canada are learning to live with great white sharks",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Rick Clough spent some four decades fishing for lobsters and sea urchins off the Maine coast before spotting one of the ocean's most recognized predators \u2014 a great white shark.",
      "The approximately 8-foot (2.4-meter) shark, seen off the beach town of Scarborough in July, surprised Clough, but didn\u2019t make him fear the ocean \u2014 though he admitted, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to go urchin diving now.\u201d",
      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen like Clough who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Atlantic Canada are learning to live with great white sharks, the creatures made famous by the 1975 film \u201cJaws.\u201d Sightings of the apex predators are up in places like Maine, where they were once very rarely spotted.",
      "Scientists link the white shark sightings to increased availability of the seals the sharks feast on, and say beachgoers are generally very safe from shark bites. The sharks can grow close to 20 feet (6 meters) long, though most don't get that big.",
      "David Lancaster, a commercial clam digger in Scarborough, used a drone to get a look at an approximately 12-foot (3.6-meter) shark near the town\u2019s famed beaches earlier this month. He described the animal as \u201cmagnificent\u201d and \u201creally amazing\u201d to see. But he also said the shark's presence reminded him that swimmers need to look out for the big fish.",
      "Sightings of great whites off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, have become increasingly frequent in recent years, and the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy has documented hundreds of the animals over more than a decade. But new data shows the sharks are heading even farther north into New Hampshire, Maine and beyond, said Greg Skomal, a senior fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries and a veteran white shark researcher.",
      "The number of white sharks detected off Halifax, Nova Scotia, increased about 2.5 times from 2018 to 2022, according to a paper published by Skomal and others in May in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series. Even farther north, the number detected in the Cabot Strait that separates Nova Scotia and Newfoundland increased nearly four times over, the paper said.",
      "Skomal said the average residency in these northern waters has also increased from 48 days to 70 days, suggesting that white sharks appear to be increasingly comfortable farther north.",
      "A key reason for the shift seems to be the successful conservation of seals off New England and Canada via laws such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which has allowed seals to thrive and provide a food source for the predatory sharks, Skomal said.",
      "\u201cIt could be a function of a growing prey base,\u201d Skomal said. \u201cAnd that would be seals.\u201d",
      "Great white sharks also benefit from protections, including a ban on fishing for them in U.S. federal waters that has stood since 1997. They are still considered vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.",
      "In Massachusetts, the marine fisheries department said it strengthened its fishing laws after fishermen in 2024 chose to target white sharks anyway. The state prohibited the use of certain kinds of heavy fishing gear in shoreline areas where white sharks are most commonly found.",

      "The voting technology company suing Fox News for defamation is now entangled in a widening bribery investigation",
      "MIAMI -- Smartmatic, the elections-technology company suing Fox News for defamation, is now contending with a growing list of criminal allegations against some of its executives \u2014 including a new claim by federal prosecutors that a \u201cslush fund\u201d for bribing foreign officials was financed partly with proceeds from the sale of voting machines in Los Angeles.",
      "The new details about the criminal case surfaced this month in court filings in Miami, where the company's co-founder, Roger Pinate, and two Venezuelan colleagues were charged last year with bribing officials in the Philippines in exchange for a contract to help run that country's 2016 presidential elections. Pinate, who no longer works for Smartmatic, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "To buttress the case, federal prosecutors are seeking to introduce evidence they argue shows that some of the nearly $300 million the company was paid by Los Angeles County to help modernize its voting systems was diverted to a fund controlled by Pinate through the use of overseas shell companies, fake invoices and other means.",
      "Smartmatic itself hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, nor have U.S. prosecutors accused Smartmatic or its executives of tampering with election results. Similarly, they haven't accused Los Angeles County officials of wrongdoing, or said whether they were even aware of the alleged bribery scheme. County officials say they weren\u2019t.",
      "But the case against Pinate is unfolding as Smartmatic is pursuing a $2.7 billion lawsuit accusing Fox of defamation for airing false claims that the company helped rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Fox says it was legitimately reporting newsworthy allegations.",
      "Smartmatic said the Justice Department\u2019s new filing was filled with \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d and is \u201cuntethered from reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet us be clear: Smartmatic wins business because we\u2019re the best at what we do,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe operate ethically and abide by all laws always, both in Los Angeles County and every jurisdiction where we operate.\u201d",
      "Still, Fox has gone to court to try to get more information about L.A. County's dealings with Smartmatic. The network has long tried to leverage the bribery allegations to undermine Smartmatic\u2019s narrative about its business prospects \u2013 a key component in calculating any potential damages \u2014 and portray it as a scandal-plagued company brought low by its own legal problems, not Fox's broadcasts.",
      "South Florida-based Smartmatic was founded more than two decades ago by a group of Venezuelans who found early success working for the government of the late Hugo Chavez, a devotee of electronic voting. The company later expanded globally, providing voting machines and other technology to help carry out elections in 25 countries, from Argentina to Zambia.",
      "It was awarded its contract to help with Los Angeles County elections in 2018. The contract, which Smartmatic continues to service, gave the company an important foothold in what was then a fast-expanding U.S. voting-technology market.",
      "But Smartmatic has said its business tanked after Fox News gave President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers a platform to paint the company as part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election.",
      "Fox itself eventually aired a piece refuting the allegations after Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers complained, but it has aggressively defended itself against the defamation lawsuit in New York.",
      "\u201cFacing imminent financial collapse and indictment, Smartmatic saw a litigation lottery ticket in Fox News\u2019s coverage of the 2020 election,\u201d the network\u2019s lawyers said in a court filing.",
      "Smartmatic has disputed Fox's characterization in court filings as \u201clies\u201d and \u201canother attempt to divert attention from its long-standing campaign of falsehoods and defamation.\"",

      "As part of its effort to investigate Smartmatic's work in Los Angeles, Fox has sued to force LA County Clerk Dean Logan to hand over public records about his dealings with Smartmatic's U.S. affiliate.",
      "Fox's lawyers also questioned Logan in a deposition about a dinner a Smartmatic executive bought for him at the members-only Magic Castle club and restaurant in Los Angeles and a Smartmatic-paid trip that Logan made to Taiwan in 2019 to oversee the manufacturing of equipment by a Smartmatic vendor. U.S. prosecutors claim that vendor was deeply involved in the alleged kickback scheme in the Philippines. The five-day trip included business class airfare, hotel and numerous meals as well as time for sightseeing, Fox said.",
      "\u201cThe trip\u2019s itinerary demonstrates that the trip was not a financial inspection or audit. It was a boondoggle,\u201d Fox said in court filings.",
      "Logan, who did not report the gifts in his financial disclosures, said in his 2023 deposition that the meal at the Magic Castle was a \u201csocial occasion\u201d unrelated to business and that he was not required to report the trip to Taiwan because his visit was covered by the contract.",
      "Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for Logan's office, said in a statement that the bribery allegations are unrelated to the company\u2019s work for L.A. County and that the county had no knowledge of how the proceeds from its contract would be used. All of Smartmatic\u2019s work has been evaluated for compliance with the contract\u2019s terms, Sanchez added, and as soon as Pinate was indicted he and the other defendants were banned from conducting business with the county.",
      "As for the trip to Taiwan, Sanchez said another county official joined Logan for the trip and the two conducted several on-site visits and conducted detailed reviews of electoral technology products that were required prior the start of their manufacturing. Logan's spouse accompanied him on the trip, but at the couple's own expense, the spokesman added.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this is an attempt to use the County as a pawn in two serious legal actions to which the County is not a party,\u201d Sanchez said.",
      "Smartmatic has settled two other defamation lawsuits it brought against conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network over their 2020 U.S. election coverage. Settlement terms weren\u2019t disclosed.",
      "U.S. prosecutors in Miami have also accused Pinate of secretly bribing Venezuela's longtime election chief by giving her a luxury home with a pool in Caracas. Prosecutors say the home was transferred to the election chief in an attempt to repair relations following Smartmatic's abrupt exit from Venezuela in 2017 when it accused President Nicolas Maduro 's government of manipulating tallied results in elections for a rubber-stamping constituent assembly.",
      "Smartmatic has denied the bribery allegations, saying it ceased all operations in Venezuela in 2017 after blowing the whistle on the government and has never sought to secure business there again.",
      "\"There are no slush funds, no gifted house,\" the company said. Instead, it accused Fox of engaging in \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d and attempts to use \u201cfrivolous\u201d court filings \u201cto smear us further, twisting unproven Justice Department allegations.\u201d",

      "Stars can live for millions to trillions of years until they run out of fuel. The most massive ones go out with a bang in an explosion called a supernova.",
      "Using telescopes that peer deep into space, researchers have observed many such explosions. The cosmic outbursts tend to jumble up a dying star's layers, making it hard for scientists to observe the inner structure.",

      "President Donald Trump said that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\u201cI said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe agreed, and they\u2019ve agreed to do it.\u201d",
      "Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the agreement.",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The official announcement is expected to come later Friday, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel\u2019s largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world\u2019s largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country\u2019s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",

The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan\u2019s past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn\u2019t commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy.

      "BANGKOK -- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration.",
      "Huang was asked about a possible \u201cB30A\u201d semiconductor for artificial intelligence data centers for China while on a visit to Taiwan, where he was meeting Nvidia's key manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the world's largest chip maker.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m offering a new product to China for ... AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,\u201d Huang said. But he added that \"That\u2019s not our decision to make. It\u2019s up to, of course, the United States government. And we\u2019re in dialogue with them, but it\u2019s too soon to know.\u201d",
      "Such chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But they are less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s top semiconductors today, which cannot be sold to China due to U.S. national security restrictions.",
      "The B30A, based on California-based Nvidia's specialized Blackwell technology, is reported to operate at about half the speed of Nvidia's main B300 chips.",
      "Huang praised the the Trump administration for recently approving sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China after such business was suspended in April, with the proviso that the company must pay a 15% tax to the U.S. government on those sales. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, was told to pay the same tax on its sales of its MI380 chips to China.",
      "As part of broader trade talks, Beijing and Washington recently agreed to pull back some non-tariff restrictions. China approved more permits for rare earth magnets to be exported to the U.S., while Washington lifted curbs on chip design software and jet engines. After lobbying by Huang, it also allowed sales of the H20 chips to go through.",
      "Huang did not comment directly on the tax when asked but said Nvidia appreciated being able to sell H20s to China.",

      "BANGKOK -- China has been expanding use of digital currencies as it promotes wider use of its yuan, or renminbi, to reflect its status as the world's second-largest economy and challenge the overwhelming sway of the U.S. dollar in international trade and finance.",
      "However, restrictions on access to Chinese financial markets and limits on convertibility of the yuan, or \u201cpeople\u2019s money,\u201d are big obstacles blocking its global use.",
      "Still, Hong Kong already has stablecoin regulations and some Chinese experts are pushing for regulations to prepare for a possible stablecoin pegged to the yuan.",
      "Officials at the People's Bank of China and State Council Information Office in Beijing did not immediately respond to requests for comment on a Reuters report that the State Council, or Cabinet, is preparing to issue a plan for internationalizing the yuan that might include a yuan stablecoin.",

      "Stablecoins are digital currencies whose value is linked to a specific currency such as the U.S. dollar. They can be used as a substitute in situations where currency transactions might be difficult or costly. They are different from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in that their only purpose is to be a means of payment, not an investment meant to be traded to gain value.",
      "Dollar stablecoins are typically bought and sold for $1 each. They are based on a reserve equal to their value, but are issued by private institutions, not central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve.",
      "Stablecoins are not Digital Central Bank Currencies, which are digital versions of currencies issued by central banks. They are based on blockchain-based distributed ledgers. They are \u201cstable\u201d in the sense that their value is anchored to the currency they are based on.",

      "China launched its own digital yuan, the e-CNY issued by its central bank, on a trial basis in 2019, and McDonalds was an early participant in that project. Chinese regulators have banned mining, trading and other dealings in private, decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin, while encouraging use of the digital yuan.",
      "The nearly universal use of electronic payments has facilitated use of the e-CNY in the Chinese mainland, with some cities using it to pay wages of civil servants. State media reported that as of July 2024, there were 7.3 trillion yuan worth of transactions using the currency in areas where it is being used on a trial basis.",
      "China has also been promoting use of e-CNY in Africa, as it expands business dealings on the continent.",

      "Graven, 46, also known as Jean Pormanove, died on Monday in Nice during a broadcast on the Kick livestreaming platform that had been running for more than 298 hours. French media reported the broadcast was interrupted soon after Pormanove\u2019s co-streamers found him unconscious and lying on a bed.",
      "Damien Martinelli, the prosecutor in the southern French city, said in a statement that the autopsy carried out on Thursday showed the death was not caused by a trauma and \u201cnot related\" to the intervention of any third party. Some additional medical and toxicological analyses have been ordered, he said.",
      "Pormanove's death came as a judicial investigation was already underway into alleged violence and humiliations committed against him, prompted by reports from French investigative website Mediapart about what it described as the \u201conline abuse business.\u201d Mediapart said co-streamers were allegedly mistreating Pormanove in live broadcasts, sometimes encouraged by payments from viewers, to generate more subscriptions and money.",
      "The investigation, opened in December, is looking into \u201cdeliberate violence against vulnerable persons\u201d and \u201cspreading recordings of images related to offenses involving deliberate violations of physical integrity,\" Martinelli's statement said. It did not specify why Pormanove could be considered vulnerable.",
      "The statement said two co-streamers allegedly involved in the case were briefly taken into custody in January but were released pending further investigation.",
      "In parallel, the Nice prosecutor said, investigators interviewed Pormanove and one of his co-streamers who both appeared to be victims of violence and humiliation. They \"strongly denied being victims of violence, stating that the events were staged in order to \u2018generate a buzz\u2019 and make money.\u201d",
      "Pormanove's death prompted strong reactions on social media as many users questioned the authorities' failure to act.",
      "Clara Chappaz, France's digital media minister, said Pormanove\u2019s death was \u201cabsolutely horrific\u201d and she had contacted the platform\u2019s managers for an explanation.",

      "President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker. If the goal is realized, the investment would deepen the Trump administration's involvement in the computer industry as the president ramps up the pressure for more U.S. companies to manufacture products domestically instead of relying on overseas suppliers.",
      "The Trump administration is in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "That's what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn't commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",

The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn\u2019t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program \u2014 money that Lutnick derided as a \u201cgiveaway\u201d that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it\u2019s turned into Intel stock. \u201cWe think America should get the benefit of the bargain,\u201d Lutnick told CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s the right move to make.\u201d",

      "China has released new interim measures to tighten controls on mining and processing of rare earths that are used in many high-tech products including electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets",
      "BANGKOK -- China released new interim measures Friday tightening controls on mining and processing of rare earths that are used in many high-tech products including electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets.",
      "The rules released Friday by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology apply both to rare earths originating in China and those that are sent to China for refining.",
      "They require companies to comply with quotas for various minerals. Companies must have government approval to deal with rare earths and must accurately report the amount of rare earths products being handled. Violators will face legal penalties and also have their quotas for rare earths reduced.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "The 17 rare earth elements, including such minerals as germanium, gallium and titanium, aren\u2019t actually rare. But they're hard to find in a high enough concentration to make mining them worth the investment. China has been gradually tightening restrictions on exports of such materials, partly in response to U.S. controls on its access to American advanced technology.",
      "In April, just after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a raft of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, Beijing announced permitting requirements for seven more rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, citing the need to \u201cbetter safeguard national security and interests and to fulfill global duties of non-proliferation.\u201d",
      "Those limits raised worries that manufacturers in the U.S. and elsewhere would run short of vital materials needed for production, an issue in China-U.S. trade talks. In response to U.S. concessions on access to computer chip design software and jet engines, Beijing announced in June that it was speeding up approvals of rare earths exports.",
      "In July, China\u2019s Ministry of State Security said it was cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths materials that it said threatened national security, indicating Beijing was moving to exert more control.",
      "Over the past several decades, China has come to dominate rare earths processing. It now supplies nearly 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths, even though it mines only about 70% of such materials.",
      "China holds nearly half of the world's known reserves of rare earths, but it also imports significant amounts of rare earths from neighboring Myanmar for processing and export.",
      "Since it controls technologies used for refining rare earth elements and has banned exporting that know-how, China holds a near-monopoly on smelting and separating them.",

Some of the elements obtained from non-Chinese intermediate sources came from mineral concentrates processed in China and Australia, according to the U.S. Geologic Survey.",
      "China has agreed to issue some permits for rare earth exports but not for military uses, and much uncertainty remains about their supply.",
      "The rules released Friday spell out tighter controls on licensing of companies dealing in rare earths and centralize controls on mining, exports and processing. They also impose more stringent environmental standards for the industry.",
      "Trump has made it a priority to try to reduce American reliance on China for rare earths, while pushing for Beijing to ease its controls.",
      "China has opted to dial up or down the approval process as needed, while tightening overall controls on the industry.",

      "As students start school this year, 17 states and the District of Columbia are imposing new cellphone restrictions",
      "Jamel Bishop is seeing a big change in his classrooms as he begins his senior year at Doss High School in Louisville, Kentucky, where cellphones are now banned during instructional time.",
      "In previous years, students often weren\u2019t paying attention and wasted class time by repeating questions, the teenager said. Now, teachers can provide \u201cmore one-on-one time for the students who actually need it.\u201d",
      "Kentucky is one of 17 states and the District of Columbia starting this school year with new restrictions, bringing the total to 35 states with laws or rules limiting phones and other electronic devices in school. This change has come remarkably quickly: Florida became the first state to pass such a law in 2023.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have taken up the cause, reflecting a growing consensus that phones are bad for kids' mental health and take their focus away from learning, even as some researchers say the issue is less clear-cut.",
      "\u201cAnytime you have a bill that\u2019s passed in California and Florida, you know you\u2019re probably onto something that\u2019s pretty popular,\" Georgia state Rep. Scott Hilton, a Republican, told a forum on cellphone use last week in Atlanta.",
      "Phones are banned throughout the school day in 18 of the states and the District of Columbia, although Georgia and Florida impose such \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans only from kindergarten through eighth grade. Another seven states ban them during class time, but not between classes or during lunch. Still others, particularly those with traditions of local school control, mandate only a cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access.",
      "For students, the rules add new school-day rituals, like putting phones in magnetic pouches or special lockers.",
      "Students have been locking up their phones during class at McNair High School in suburban Atlanta since last year. Audreanna Johnson, a junior, said \u201cmost of them did not want to turn in their phones\u201d at first, because students would use them to gossip, texting \u201ctheir other friends in other classes to see what\u2019s the tea and what\u2019s going on around the building.\u201d",
      "That resentment is \u201cstarting to ease down\u201d now, she said. \"More students are willing to give up their phones and not get distracted.\u201d",
      "But there are drawbacks \u2014 like not being able to listen to music when working independently in class. \u201cI\u2019m kind of 50-50 on the situation because me, I use headphones to do my schoolwork. I listen to music to help focus,\u201d she said.",
      "In a survey of 125 Georgia school districts by Emory University researchers, parental resistance was cited as the top obstacle to regulating student use of social and digital media.",
      "Johnson\u2019s mother, Audrena Johnson, said she worries most about knowing her children are safe from violence at school. School messages about threats can be delayed and incomplete, she said, like when someone who wasn\u2019t a McNair student got into a fight on school property, which she learned about when her daughter texted her during the school day.",
      "\u201cMy child having her phone is very important to me, because if something were to happen, I know instantly,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Many parents echo this \u2014 generally supporting restrictions but wanting a say in the policymaking and better communication, particularly about safety \u2014 and they have a real need to coordinate schedules with their children and to know about any problems their children may encounter, said Jason Allen, the national director of partnerships for the National Parents Union.",

      "\u201cThey could focus more on teaching,\u201d Gazmararian said. \u201cThere were just not the disruptions.\u201d",
      "Another benefit: More positive interactions among students. \u201cThey were saying that kids are talking to each other in the hallways and in the cafeteria,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in the classroom, there is a noticeably lower amount of discipline referrals.\u201d",

And, because of previous litigation, the vast majority of redactions should have already been made,\" Edwards said.",
      "The House Oversight Committee also announced that Alexander Acosta, the former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida and former secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor, will appear voluntarily for a transcribed interview on Sept. 19, 2025. Acosta was previously found to have exercised \"poor judgement\" when he resolved a federal investigation into Epstein through a state-based plea agreement in 2008, the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility concluded in a 2020 report.",
      "Comer said the panel will allow for \"written declarations\" from former attorneys general Alberto Gonzelez, Eric Holder and Jeff Sessions instead of in-person interviews. The three individuals, who were subpoenaed by the committee, plan to formally declare they have no information on Epstein, according to Comer.",

    "story": [
      "The federal government has asked a Miami judge to pause her order to close an immigration detention center in Florida's Everglades, known as \"Alligator Alcatraz.\"",
      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- The federal government over the weekend asked a judge in Miami to put on hold her ruling ordering the winding down of an immigration detention center built by the state of Florida in the Everglades wilderness and nicknamed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d pending an appeal of her decision.",
      "Attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security said in their request for a stay that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams' order last week, if carried out, would disrupt the federal government's ability to enforce immigration laws. They asked the judge to rule on their request by Monday evening.",
      "The request came as a third lawsuit challenging practices at the facility was filed Friday by civil rights groups who claimed the state of Florida had no authority to run an immigration detention center.",
      "In a statement supporting the request for a stay, Garrett Ripa, field office director for Immigration and Customs Enforcement's enforcement and removal operations in Miami, said that the Everglades facility's 2,000 beds were badly needed since detention facilities in Florida were overcrowded.",
      "\u201cIts removal would compromise the government\u2019s ability to enforce immigration laws, safeguard public safety, protect national security, and maintain border security,\u201d Ripa said.",
      "The environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, whose lawsuit led to the judge's ruling, opposed the request.",
      "The judge said in her order that she expected the population of the facility to decline within 60 days through the transferring of the detainees to other facilities, and once that happened, fencing, lighting and generators should be removed. She wrote the state and federal defendants can\u2019t bring anyone other than those who are already being detained at the facility onto the property.",
      "Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe had argued that further construction and operations should be stopped until federal and state officials complied with federal environmental laws. Their lawsuit claimed the facility threatened environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars spent over decades on environmental restoration.",
      "The detention center was quickly built two months ago at a lightly used, single-runway training airport in the middle of the Everglades. State officials signed more than $245 million in contracts for building and operating the facility, which officially opened July 1.",
      "President Donald Trump toured the facility last month and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide as his administration races to expand the infrastructure needed to increase deportations.",
      "A second lawsuit also was filed by civil rights groups last month against the state and federal governments over practices at the Everglades facility, claiming detainees were denied access to the legal system. Another federal judge in Miami last week dismissed parts of the lawsuit which had been filed in Florida's southern district and then moved the remaining counts against the state of Florida to the neighboring middle district.",

      "\u201cLawyers often cannot find their clients, and families cannot locate their loved ones inside ICE\u2019s vast detention system,\u201d the civil rights attorneys said. \u201cDetainees have been prevented from accessing attorneys in numerous ways. Detainees without counsel have been cut off from the normal channels of obtaining a lawyer.\"",
      "Immigration is a federal issue, and Florida agencies and the private contracts hired by the state have no authority to operate the facility, the civil rights groups argued in asking that their lawsuit be certified as a class action.",
      "The civil rights attorneys described harsh conditions at the facility, including flooding, mosquitoes, lack of water and exposure to the elements as punishment. At least 100 people already have been deported from the facility, including several who were pressured to sign voluntary removal forms without being able to consult with attorneys, they said.",

      "A company that installs license plate-detecting cameras to aid law enforcement has halted operations with federal agencies because of ongoing concerns among officials in Illinois and elsewhere",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- One of the nation's leading operators of automated license-plate reading systems announced Monday it has paused its operations with federal agencies because of confusion and concern \u2014 including in Illinois \u2014 about the purpose of their investigations.",
      "Flock Safety, whose cameras are mounted in more than 4,000 communities nationwide, put a hold last week on pilot programs with the Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection and its law enforcement arm, Homeland Security Investigations, according to a statement by its founder and CEO, Garrett Langley.",
      "Among officials in other jurisdictions, Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias raised concerns. He announced Monday that an audit found Customs and Border Protection had accessed Illinois data, although he didn't say that the agency was seeking immigration-related information. A 2023 law the Democrat pushed bars sharing license plate data with police investigating out-of-state abortions or undocumented immigrants.",
      "\u201cThis sharing of license plate data of motorists who drive on Illinois roads is a clear violation of the state law,\" Giannoulias said in a statement. \"This law, passed two years ago, aimed to strengthen how data is shared and prevent this exact thing from happening,\u201d",
      "Flock Safety's cameras capture billions of photos of license plates each month. However, it doesn't own that data. The local agencies in whose jurisdictions the cameras are located do, and they're the ones who receive inquiries from other law enforcement agencies.",
      "Langley said the company had initiated pilot programs with Customs and Border Protection and Homeland Security Investigations to help combat human trafficking and fentanyl distribution. The company is unaware of any immigration-related searches the agencies made, but Langley said parameters were unclear.",
      "\u201cWe clearly communicated poorly. We also didn\u2019t create distinct permissions and protocols in the Flock system to ensure local compliance for federal agency users,\u201d Langley said.",

      "Although the sheriff in Johnson County, Texas, said he was simply trying to help the family locate the woman, Giannoulias demanded more vigilance from Flock Safety because of the abortion connection.",
      "In addition to halting the pilot programs, Flock has tweaked its system so that federal inquiries are clearly identified as such. And federal agencies will no longer be able to make blanket national or even statewide searches, but only one-on-one searches with particular police agencies.",

Those flag terms have been in effect since late June, a Flock Safety spokesperson said.",

      "The summoning to Paris of Ambassador to France Charles Kushner, following his allegations that the country had not done enough to combat antisemitism, marks his host country's formal displeasure with its top diplomat from the U.S.",
      "Kushner \u2014 the father of Jared Kushner, son-in-law to President Donald Trump \u2014 wrote a letter to French President Emmanuel Macron alleging the country did not do enough to combat antisemitism. France\u2019s foreign ministry has summoned Kushner to appear Monday at the French Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs, saying in a statement that his allegations \u201care unacceptable.\"",
      "The diplomatic discord comes as French-U.S. relations have faced tensions this year amid Trump\u2019s trade war and a split over the future of U.N. peacekeepers in Lebanon. France and the U.S. have also been divided on support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, but the split has eased with Trump expressing support for security guarantees and a warm meeting with Macron and other European leaders at the White House last week.",
      "Here's what to know about Charles Kushner:",
      "In the letter released late Sunday, Kushner wrote that \u201cpublic statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence and endanger Jewish life in France,\" urging Macron \u201cto act decisively: enforce hate-crime laws without exception, ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses ... and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\u201d",
      "In response, the French ministry said that Kushner\u2019s allegations violate international law and the obligation not to interfere with the internal affairs of another country.",
      "The dustup follows Macron\u2019s rejection this past week of accusations from Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that France\u2019s intention to recognize a Palestinian state is fueling antisemitism. France is home to the largest Jewish population in Europe; its estimated 500,000 Jews marks the third-largest Jewish population in the world after Israel and the U.S., as well as approximately 1% of the national population.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott on Sunday evening said it stood by Kushner\u2019s comments. The White House did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Monday.",
      "When he announced his intention to nominate Charles Kushner in November, Trump called him \u201ca tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker.\u201d",

      "After pleading guilty to 18 counts, Kushner was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison.

In 2018, Charles Kushner told The New York Times that he wasn\u2019t interested in clemency, saying he \u201cwould prefer not to have a pardon\u201d because it would garner publicity.",

      "The text of the executive order states that desecrating the American flag is \u201cuniquely offensive and provocative. It is a statement of contempt, hostility, and violence against our Nation \u2014 the clearest possible expression of opposition to the political union that preserves our rights, liberty, and security. Burning this representation of America may incite violence and riot.\u201d",
      "The order calls on the attorney general to prioritize enforcement \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d of criminal and civil laws against flag burning that cause harm unrelated to the First Amendment.",
      "Trump said the penalty for flag-burning would be one year in jail with no opportunity for early release.",

      "The fire began Thursday night and grew quickly amid hot, gusty conditions. Fire officials were keeping an eye on isolated thunderstorms in southern Oregon that could drift north on Sunday, state Fire Marshals spokesman Chris Schimmer said in a video posted to Facebook.",
      "\"If we get thunderstorms that roll through, it can ... cause the fire to jump (containment) lines,\u201d said Carr, adding the downdrafts can push fire in multiple directions.",
      "In central California, the state's largest blaze this year, the Gifford Fire, was at 95% containment Sunday after charring nearly 206 square miles (534 square kilometers) of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties since erupting on Aug. 1. The cause is under investigation.",
      "Although it's difficult to directly tie a single fire or weather event directly to climate change, scientists say human-caused warming from burning fossil fuels like coal and gas is causing more intense heat waves and droughts, which in turn set the stage for more destructive wildfires.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration said Friday it will not defend a decades-old grant program for colleges with large numbers of Hispanic students that is being challenged in court, declaring the government believes the funding is unconstitutional.",
      "In a memo sent to Congress, the Justice Department said it agrees with a lawsuit attempting to strike down grants that are reserved for colleges and universities where at least a quarter of undergraduates are Hispanic. Congress created the program in 1998 after finding Latino students were attending college and graduating at far lower rates than white students.",
      "Justice Department officials argued the program provides an unconstitutional advantage based on race or ethnicity.",

Tennessee argued all of its public universities serve Hispanic students, but none meet the \u201carbitrary ethnic threshold\u201d to be eligible for the grants. Those schools miss out on tens of millions of dollars because of discriminatory requirements, the lawsuit said.",
      "On Friday, the Justice Department released a letter in which Solicitor General D. John Sauer notified Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson that the department \u201chas decided not to defend\u201d the program, saying certain aspects of it are unconstitutional. The letter, dated July 25, cited the 2023 Supreme Court decision outlawing affirmative action, which said \u201coutright racial balancing\u201d is \u201cpatently unconstitutional.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Tennessee is backed in the suit by Students for Fair Admissions, a conservative legal group that successfully challenged affirmative action in admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. That suit led to a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that forbids universities from considering students\u2019 race in admissions decisions.",
      "Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, said Friday the group would decline to comment.",
      "More than 500 colleges and universities are designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions, making them eligible for the grant program. Congress appropriated about $350 million for the program in 2024. Colleges compete for the grants, which can go toward a range of uses, from building improvements to science programs.",
      "Former President Joe Biden made Hispanic-serving universities a priority, signing an executive action last year that promised a new presidential advisory board and increased funding. President Donald Trump revoked the order his first day in office.",
      "Trump is taking steps to dismantle the Education Department and has called for massive funding cuts, yet his 2026 budget request preserved grants for Hispanic-serving colleges and even asked Congress for a slight increase. Even so, there have been doubts about his administration\u2019s commitment to the funding.",
      "A national association of Hispanic-serving universities filed a motion last month to intervene as a defendant in the Tennessee lawsuit, voicing concern that the federal government would not adequately represent the group\u2019s members.",
      "The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities said Trump\u2019s agenda is \u201centirely adverse\u201d to the group\u2019s interests, citing the president\u2019s aim to close the Education Department entirely.

      "It was Kilauea's 31st display of molten rock since December, an appropriately high frequency for one of the world's most active volcanoes.",
      "The north vent at the summit crater began continuously spattering in the morning, and then lava overflowed a few hours later. The vent started shooting lava fountains in the afternoon.",

      "\u201cEvery eruption feels like I am sitting in the front row at nature\u2019s most extraordinary show,\u201d Wei said in an email.",
      "Kilauea is on Hawaii Island, the largest of the Hawaiian archipelago. It\u2019s about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of the state\u2019s largest city, Honolulu, which is on Oahu.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Kilauea\u2019s latest eruption:",
      "A lower magma chamber under Halemaumau Crater is receiving magma directly from the earth\u2019s interior at about 5 cubic yards (3.8 cubic meters) per second, said Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. This blows the chamber up like a balloon and forces magma into an upper chamber. From there it gets pushed above ground through cracks.",
      "Magma has been using the same pathway to rise to the surface since December, making the initial release and subsequent episodes all part of the same eruption, Hon said.",
      "Many have featured lava soaring into the air, in some cases more than 1,000 feet (300 meters). The fountains are generated in part because magma \u2014 which holds gases that are released as it rises \u2014 has been traveling to the surface through narrow, pipelike vents.",
      "The expanding magma supply is capped by heavier magma that had expelled its gas at the end of the prior episode. Eventually enough new magma accumulates to force the degassed magma off, and the magma shoots out like a Champagne bottle that was shaken before the cork was popped.",
      "This is the fourth time in 200 years that Kilauea has shot lava fountains into the air in repeated episodes. There were more episodes the last time Kilauea followed this pattern: The eruption that began in 1983 started with 44 sessions of shooting fountains. Those were spread out over three years, however. And the fountains emerged in a remote area, so few got to watch.",
      "The other two occurred in 1959 and 1969.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know how the current eruption will end or how it may change. In 1983 magma built enough pressure that Kilauea opened a vent at a lower elevation and started continuously leaking lava from there rather than periodically shooting out of a higher elevation. The eruption continued in various forms for three decades and ended in 2018.",

      "Restaurants could post the allergen information on physical menus, an allergen chart, allergen-specific menu or other printed materials. They can also post a QR code to access a digital menu that lists allergens. Food trucks and carts wouldn't be required to make changes.",
      "In September, the Legislature is expected to vote on Senate Bill 68, known as the Allergen Disclosure for Dining Experiences Act (ADDE). If approved and signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, the new law would take effect on July 1, 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really to protect the millions of people in California who have allergies like me,\u201d said Democratic state Sen. Caroline Menjivar of the San Fernando Valley, who introduced the bill earlier this year.",
      "Menjivar, who is severely allergic to most nuts and fruits, said she\u2019s had to go to the hospital multiple times for anaphylaxis \u2014 a life-threatening allergic reaction \u2014 to something she accidentally consumed.",
      "The Southern California lawmaker got the idea for the legislation last year while traveling in Europe, which has required restaurants to disclose food allergens since 2014.",
      "Soon after Menjivar returned to the U.S., she was approached about sponsoring legislation by parents whose daughter has severe allergies.",
      "Since then 9-year-old Addie Lao has become the bill\u2019s most visible advocate, appearing in social media videos, news interviews and legislative hearings.",
      "\u201cI want to be able to eat out with my friends and family like everyone else,\u201d the third grader told state senators in Sacramento in April. \u201cI have to avoid the foods I\u2019m allergic to since it\u2019s like poison to my body and can harm me.\u201d",
      "The bill has the backing of numerous groups representing medical practitioners and people who suffer from asthma and allergies.",

      "\u201cYou get into a situation where the menu becomes unwieldy and it becomes incredibly impractical and expensive to be constantly converting menus out with each ingredient shift that may occur and the need to do a new allergy notification,\u201d said Matthew Sutton, senior vice president at the California Restaurant Association.",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Aug 2025 20:12:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Jerry Adler's acting credits include \"The Sopranos\" and \"The Good Wife.\" He also had 53 Broadway productions to his name, all behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \"passed peacefully in his sleep,\" Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \"The Sopranos,\" on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \"The Good Wife,\" where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \"My Fair Lady\" and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \"Santa Barbara.\"",
      "\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \"The Public Eye\" and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \"chills\" when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \"Northern Exposure\" paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \"The Sopranos.\"",
      "\"When David was going to do the pilot for 'The Sopranos' he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\" he told Forward in 2015. \"But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\"",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"Transparent\" and guest spots on shows ranging from \"The West Wing\" to \"Broad City.\"",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf\" in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\" Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \"I wouldn't know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that's when I'll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\"",
      "Adler published a memoir, \"Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\" last year. \"I'm ready to go at a moment's notice,\" he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \"too goofy-looking\" to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\"I'm immortal,\" he said.",

      "\"That was probably the worst audition in my life,\" he recalled.",
      "\"I can't remember exactly what happened in the audition. But I remember it ended with me \u2026 holding Danny Boyle up against the wall. And I'd ripped his shirt open. And a couple of the buttons popped off. And he goes, 'All right, thanks a lot, Riz. Thanks for coming in. Appreciate that.' I didn't get the role for some reason,\" Ahmed added, jokingly.",
      "His breakout came in 2014 in the film \"Nightcrawler.\" Three years later, he earned an Emmy playing the suspect in the HBO crime drama \"The Night Of.\"",
      "In 2021 he scored his first Oscar nomination playing a drummer who loses hearing in \"Sound of Metal.\" And a year later, Ahmed, who is also a rapper, won an Academy Award for \"The Long Goodbye,\" a short film based on his own album.",

      "\"I was writing a script. I was actually working on the thing that I'm editing now,\" Ahmed said. \"She sat down opposite and started emptying her whole bag out because she'd lost her charger. You know, I just spotted an opening. 'Can I help you?'\"",
      "The couple got married in 2020 and they're now parents \u2014 a rewarding role Ahmed says has changed him as an artist.",
      "\"You know, at this point, anything that I do \u2013 as an artist \u2013 is facilitated by the support of my wife. So, it's definitely kind of made me realize the extent to which the people closest to you are actually the co-authors of your work,\" said Ahmed, adding that being a father has brought him more gratitude and humility.",

    "story": [
      "A man on trial for organizing the ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph\u00a0at a Memphis bakery in 2021 has been found not guilty.",
      "A Memphis jury deliberated about three hours before finding Hernandez Govan, 45, not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. He rejected an offer from the state last month to settle with a guilty plea, CBS News affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "On Thursday, Govan hugged his lawyer and thanked Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell after she told him he was free to go.",
      "Govan was not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claimed he directed the two people who did. The jury was not convinced, however, despite a man's testimony that Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut.",
      "Govan's lawyer questioned the quality of the police investigation and the validity of cellphone communications between Govan and the men who shot Dolph, arguing that nothing in the communications directly incriminated Govan or tied him to the killings.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works.",
      "On the day of the 2021 ambush, the 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Authorities said two men exited a white Mercedes-Benz and began shooting at the rapper at the bakery. He died after being shot about 20 times, according to a medical examiner's report.",
      "Four years earlier, Young Dolph suffered critical injuries\u00a0in a 2017 attack, when three men approached and shot him over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Earlier that same year, he had been involved in a separate shooting where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",
      "Testifying against Govan was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the two shooters who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter.",
      "Smith faces charges for murder and conspiracy to commit murder for his alleged role in Young Dolph's death. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and does not currently have a trial date set. Johnson was originally sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole following his 2024 conviction, plus an additional 35 years for two additional convictions from his trial.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed Young Dolph's killing as part of an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, rapper Yo Gotti. Smith has testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "At Johnson's earlier trial, a prosecutor told jurors Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant in January 2024.",
      "Smith testified Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits,\" including giving Smith guns for the killing, and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the Thanksgiving turkey giveaway, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Prosecutors introduced as evidence dozens of cellphone communications between Johnson, Smith, Govan and Big Jook ahead of the shooting.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said on Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",

      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date.",

      "Drugs known as\u00a0GLP-1 receptor agonists\u00a0mimic a hormone in the body known as glucagon-like peptide 1, which helps signal fullness to the brain and regulate blood sugar. Ozempic is typically used for diabetes while Saxenda, Wegovy and Zepbound are approved for weight loss.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mississippi-infant-deaths-public-health-emergency/",
    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 11:42:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Mississippi's infant mortality rate nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health.",
    "story": [
      "Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency after releasing data showing the state's infant mortality rate\u00a0has risen to its highest level in more than a decade.",
      "In Mississippi, 9.7 infants died for every 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health. Since 2014, more than 3,500 Mississippi infants have died before their first birthday.",
      "The decision to declare a public health emergency places Mississippi's struggle within\u00a0a wider national story. Here's what to know.",
      "Infant mortality rate a nationwide concern",
      "Even in cities with strong healthcare systems, such as Boston, Black infants continue to die at far higher rates than their White peers.",
      "In Boston, the city's most recent report showed Black infants dying at more than twice the rate of the overall population and triple the rate of White infants, despite the city's overall infant mortality rate falling below the national average. Public health experts say both examples underscore the limits of focusing only on individual behavior or clinical care when structural inequities are key drivers of infant deaths.",
      "\"Every single infant loss represents a family devastated, a community impacted, and a future cut short,\" said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney, who announced the Mississippi declaration. \"We cannot and will not accept these numbers as our reality.\"",
      "What is causing higher infant mortality rate?",
      "The leading causes of infant death in Mississippi include congenital malformations, premature birth, low birthweight, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.",
      "Disparities remain stark \u2014 Black infants in Mississippi are more than twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday, and recent state data show those racial gaps have widened.",
      "Despite growing concerns, declaring a public health emergency for infant mortality is unusual.",
      "\"This is a novel and necessary step,\" said Dr. Michael Warren, Chief Medical and Health Officer at March of Dimes. \"It elevates infant mortality to the level of urgent crisis response, which it truly is.\"",
      "Why a public health emergency was declared",
      "State officials said the declaration allows them to move more quickly to address gaps in care.",
      "Their plan includes expanding prenatal services in counties without obstetric providers, creating an obstetric system of care to regionalize services and improve emergency transfers, and strengthening home visiting and community health worker programs.",
      "\"Improving maternal health is the best way to reduce infant mortality,\" Dr. Edney said.",
      "Dr. Morgan McDonald, National Director for Population Health at New York-based nonprofit Milbank Memorial Fund, said the declaration \"should draw our attention to a problem that is tragic and preventable.\"",
      "She added: \"We applaud Dr. Edney and his public health team for raising the alarm in a way that honors the families who have suffered this tragedy and also focuses attention on concrete solutions.\"",
      "Experts caution, however, that individual and clinical interventions alone cannot solve the problem.",
      "\"Healthy babies come from healthy moms,\" said Dr. Rebekah Gee, former Louisiana health secretary and now CEO of Nest Health, a New Orleans-based company which provides in-home whole-family care, with a focus on those covered by Medicaid. \"If women can't get continuous healthcare before, during, and after pregnancy, it is no surprise their babies are dying at higher rates.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist and professor at Emory University, added that treating infant deaths as a series of isolated medical cases misses the broader reality. \"So much of what we see in neonatal intensive care units reflects challenges that moms face long before delivery \u2014 poverty, access to healthcare, housing, even transportation,\" Patrick said.",
      "Health care programs and infant health",
      "Federal funding cuts are also complicating the state's response to the crisis.",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program that collects state-specific data on maternal and infant health, has been targeted for elimination. CDC staffers who carried out the survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes were fired in June.",
      "Mississippi relied on PRAMS to track maternal behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy, and to monitor infant outcomes. Many of CDC's Safe Motherhood initiatives are also in jeopardy of losing funding, which would affect maternal mortality surveillance, infant sleep safety programs, and hospital-based collaboratives designed to standardize care.",
      "\"Without robust data, we are flying blind,\" Patrick said.",
      "Analysts also warn that such cuts could limit the state's ability to detect trends such as unsafe sleep practices or gaps in postpartum care.",
      "\"It's willful ignorance to cut vital maternal and child health programs when we have public health crises of both maternal mortality and infant mortality in this country,\" said a former CDC Division of Reproductive Health staffer who lost their job in a recent reduction in force. \"For many people, it's downright dangerous to be pregnant in the U.S. in the 21st century. And that is shameful.\"",
      "Polling suggests most Americans support maintaining these programs. According to the Emory-Rollins National Child Policy Poll, 65% of Americans say PRAMS is important for improving outcomes for mothers and infants, while fewer than one in ten believe it is not needed.",
      "Similarly, only 16% supported ending federal funding for the long-running \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign, which educated parents about reducing risks of sleep-related infant deaths.",
      "How changes to Medicaid will impact Mississippi",
      "Medicaid\u00a0plays an outsized role in Mississippi, financing almost 6 in 10 of births in the state, compared to about 4 in 10 nationally, according a\u00a0KFF Health News analysis of government data.",
      "In 2023, the state extended postpartum\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0from two months to a full year. But Mississippi has\u00a0not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving many low-income women uninsured before or between pregnancies.",
      "Meanwhile, Congressional proposals could reshape Medicaid coverage, including the reconciliation bill already passed by Congress which would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "Dr. McDonald noted that since Mississippi is not a Medicaid expansion state, it would not be subject to most of the work requirement and frequent redetermination provisions of President Trump's so-called \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "KFF analysts estimate that bill's funding caps and work requirements could raise Mississippi's uninsured rate by 1 to 2%, potentially leaving 20,000 to 40,000 more residents without coverage.",
      "Public health experts say such policies could destabilize rural hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, in turn limiting access to prenatal and delivery services in regions already described as \"OB deserts.\"",
      "Other states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen measurable improvements in infant health.",
      "Arkansas, for example, reported a 29% reduction in Black infant mortality in the five years following expansion. In Louisiana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016, researchers documented increases in early prenatal care and decreases in premature births. Colorado also saw declines in infant mortality, particularly in rural areas, as more women gained access to continuous coverage before, during, and after pregnancy.",
      "Nationally, one analysis found a 50% greater reduction in infant mortality in expansion states compared to those that did not expand Medicaid, with the steepest gains among Black infants. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, while Mississippi remains one of 10 holdouts.",
      "The U.S. has long treated infant mortality as a measure of societal health. More than a century ago, sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that high rates of infant deaths among Black families reflected inequities in living conditions rather than innate differences.",
      "Mississippi's emergency declaration and Boston's persistent disparities suggest those inequities remain deeply entrenched. State officials said the declaration is intended to galvanize coordinated action across hospitals, state agencies, and community groups.",
      "\"It will take all of us working together to give every child the chance to live, thrive, and celebrate their first birthday,\" Dr. Edney said.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk on Monday targeted Apple and OpenAI in an antitrust lawsuit alleging that the iPhone maker and the ChatGPT maker are teaming up to thwart competition in artificial intelligence.",
      "The 61-page complaint filed in Texas federal court follows through on a threat that Musk made two weeks ago when he accused Apple of unfairly favoring OpenAI and ChatGPT in the iPhone's app store rankings for top AI apps.",
      "Musk's post insinuated that Apple had rigged the system against ChatGPT competitors such as the Grok chatbot made by his own xAI. Now, he is detailing a litany of grievances in the lawsuit \u2014 filed by xAI and another of his corporate entities, X Corp. \u2014 in an attempt to win monetary damages and a court order prohibiting the alleged illegal tactics.",
      "The double-barreled legal attack weaves together several recently unfolding narratives to recast a year-old partnership between Apple and OpenAI as a veiled conspiracy to stifle competition during a technological shift that could prove as revolutionary as the 2007 release of the iPhone.",
      "\"This is a tale of two monopolists joining forces to ensure their continued dominance in a world rapidly driven by the most powerful technology humanity has ever created: artificial intelligence,\" the lawsuit asserts.",
      "The complaint portrays Apple as a company that views AI as an \"existential threat\" to its future success, prompting it to collude with OpenAI in an attempt to protect the iPhone franchise that has long been its biggest moneymaker.",
      "Some of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything \"super apps,\" such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "The complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.",
      "OpenAI has countered with a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of harassment \u2014 an allegation that the company cited in its response to Monday's antitrust lawsuit. \"This latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk's ongoing pattern of harassment,\" OpenAI said in a statement.",
      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The crux of the lawsuit revolves around Apple's decision to use ChatGPT as an AI-powered \"answer engine\" on the iPhone when the built-in technology on its device couldn't satisfy user needs. The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",
      "The lawsuit doesn't mention the potential threat that ChatGPT could also pose to Apple and the iPhone's future popularity. As part of its expansion efforts, OpenAI recruited former Apple designer Jony Ive to oversee a project aimed at building an AI-powered device that many analysts believe could eventually mount a challenge to the iPhone.",

    "summary": "Unable to find buyers, a growing number of sellers are pulling their homes off the market rather than compromise on price.",
    "story": [
      "In a sign of homesellers' frustration with how long it's taking to sell their properties,\u00a0more owners are opting to pull their homes off the market rather than lower the asking price.",
      "That's according to a recent\u00a0report from Realtor.com finding that so-called delistings, or homes taken off the market without having been sold, were up 38% in June since the start of 2025 and 48% from a year ago.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer sellers are deciding to enter the market, and increasingly more are deciding to jump out,\" Jake Krimmel, senior economist at Realtor.com told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Signs of deadlock",
      "One indicator that more sellers are exiting the housing market is the ratio between the number of delistings and listings. For every 100 new homes listed nationally in June, 21 homes were taken off the market, the report found. That's up from 13 delisted homes per 100 new listings in May.",
      "A steady rise in delistings could push buyers and sellers further apart, creating a deadlock in the housing market, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"The thing that's going to prevent buyers and sellers from getting closer together is if all the sellers who maybe could or should be lowering their prices to meet the demand where it is are instead taking their homes off the market altogether,\" he said. \"So it's kind of like keeping us in this holding pattern.\"",
      "The trend comes as the supply of homes for sale begins to grow in certain U.S. regions, causing prices in those areas to drop. The number of homes for sale in July surged nearly 25% from a year ago, a post-pandemic high. according to Realtor.com.",
      "Despite the rise in housing inventory, home sales around the U.S. remain relatively stagnant, with steep prices and high mortgage rates continuing to deter many would-be homebuyers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Realtor.com data shows that pending home sales, or listings under contract, in July fell 3% in compared with the same period last year.",
      "No hurry to sell",
      "When homeowners are eager to sell a property, they typically lower the price in order to offload it quicker. However, those who are not up against the same type of time constraints may be willing to wait it out longer \u2014 especially if they're benefiting from a favorable mortgage rate.",
      "\"Maybe you're locked into payments that are relatively affordable for you,\" Krimmel said. \"You would prefer to sell, but not at a price that you're not comfortable with.\"",
      "Another factor is playing into the delisting trend, experts said \u2014 the surge in housing prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the housing market was red hot. As newly remote workers flocked to areas like Austin, Texas, home prices rose at\u00a0record levels, giving sellers a chance to cash in.",
      "While the market has since cooled substantially, sellers' pricing expectations have been slower to catch up.",
      "\"Maybe we've gotten a bit spoiled by very high home prices over the last many years, but we are seeing some softness in the market right now,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That may not be true in all markets, however. Miami is one of the places where sellers have been least willing to budge on price. According to Realtor.com's analysis, 59 homes were delisted for every 100 new homes listed in the southern Florida city \u2014 the highest ratio among the cities Realtor.com tracked. Meanwhile, less than 18% of listed homes in Miami came with a price reduction in July, according to Realtor.com.",
      "\"If sellers are choosing to take properties off the market rather than lower prices, it may signal renewed confidence in Miami's future, and a growing belief that this is a market worth holding for the long haul,\" Ana Bozovic, a Miami-based real estate agent and founder of Analytics Miami, told Realtor.com.",

At the center of the coffee giant's fall offerings is its Pumpkin Spice Latte, which came onto the scene over 20 years ago. According to a company spokesperson, the PSL, which consists of espresso, steamed milk cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin, whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice, is the most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Starbucks has sold hundreds of millions of the autumnal concoction since the beverage was introduced in 2003.",

      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value Thursday after its stock plunged following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 million in its capitalization.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares gained in early trading Friday, but resumed their slide later in the day. The stock closed down 40 cents, or less than 1%, to $54.40. The shares fell again on Monday, sliding about 1% in late afternoon trading.",

Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "For its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $821.1 million, up slightly from $817.1 million, according to a regulatory filing.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 14:49:24 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel badly misread its own customer base \u2014 and our culturally sensitive times \u2014 in trying to spruce up its image, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "When Cracker Barrel unveiled its new logo last week as part of an ongoing brand refresh, it wouldn't have expected the marketing move to spark a public furor and cause the restaurant's chain value to sink by nearly $100 million.",
      "Yet the episode highlights the perils of tinkering with a company's brand. Cracker Barrel acknowledged in a statement on Monday that \"we could've done a better job sharing who we are and who we'll always be.\"",
      "Brands as stories",
      "Marketing experts are more blunt about Cracker Barrel's misfire.",
      "\"From a branding perspective, it's basically a flop,\" said David E. Johnson, CEO of branding agency Strategic Vision PR Group, of Cracker Barrel's logo redesign. \"What they did wrong is they went against their brand story, which was the old logo, that reflected the southern, whimsical atmosphere in the stores.\"",
      "In Johnson's view, Cracker Barrel's mistake was that it replaced a logo with genuine symbolic currency for a \"very generic looking logo that doesn't tell a story.\" Other branding experts say the hubbub is the result of a business severing its design from its roots \u2014 a cardinal sin for a company like Cracker Barrel whose folksy image is meant to evoke \"homestyle country cooking.\"",
      "More specifically, Cracker Barrel's new logo retains the rustic color palette of the original design, while removing the image of an older gentleman sitting in a wicker chair leaning against a barrel.",
      "The first Cracker Barrel restaurant was launched in Lebanon, Tennessee, in 1969 by Dan Evins while working for his family's gasoline business. The idea was to recreate the kind of homey restaurants he'd enjoyed as a child, according to the company's\u00a0website. The man in Cracker Barrel's original logo is said to be Evins' uncle, Herschel, who until now has been central to much of the restaurant's branding and merchandise.",
      "The move to remove both Herschel and the namesake barrel from the logo irked some Cracker Barrel loyalists because the original image represented what franchise consultant and branding expert Nick Yeonakis called a \"throwback to a simpler time that was about home cooking.\"",
      "\"So, people have this image in their mind of a Cracker Barrel that is constant and stable, and that's why when they rebranded, backlash happened,\" he said.",
      "Still, marketing experts agree that Cracker Barrel, which operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S., was due for an image revamp. The company's growth, which soared in the 1990s, has slowed in recent years. In 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up less than 1% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down sharply from $99 million in 2023.",
      "In 2024, concerns over its competitiveness and stagnant growth prompted the company, led by new CEO and former Taco Bell executive Julie Felss Masino, to announce changes to its restaurants, menu and pricing.",
      "The chain had become less relevant in part because it had leaned too heavily on the \"timeless nature of our concept,\" Masino said in a May 2024 conference call with Wall Street analysts. \"The goal, simply put, was to freshen things in such a way as to be noticeable and attractive but still feel like Cracker Barrel,\" she said.",
      "Today, Cracker Barrel maintains that its restaurants will retain their old-timey vibe, including using Uncle Herschel in its marketing.",
      "\"We love seeing how much you care about our 'old-timer.' We love him too. Uncle Herschel will still be on our menu... on our road signs and featured in our country store. He's not going anywhere \u2014 he's family,\" the company said in its statement on Monday.",
      "Sign of the times",
      "Customer anger over Cracker Barrel's new logo also reflects the culturally and politically charged environment companies face today. For example, when Bud Light partnered with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney in 2023, some customers called for a boycott of the beer brand, badly denting the beer brand's sales.",
      "In one social media post that typified some of the criticism of Cracker Barrel, one account called \"Woke War Room\" called for Masino to resign. \"Cracker Barrel's new logo isn't an accident \u2014 it's CEO Julie Felss Masino's project. She scrapped a beloved American aesthetic and replaced it with sterile, soulless branding,\" the post\u00a0reads.",
      "Such critiques illustrate the fine line companies are often forced to tread, Carreen Winters, president of reputation at MikeWorldWide, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It's very hard to be a brand for everybody today because we are so polarized, and people look at things through a political lens even if there is no political intent,\" she said. \"When you are a legacy brand, it's really important to understand who your core is, and to not do anything to alienate them while cultivating your future or next generation customer.\"",
      "Other experts are skeptical Cracker Barrel's redesign was politically motivated.",
      "\"I really doubt the Cracker Barrel executives sat down and said, 'We'll go through this enormously expensive undertaking to change all of our signage and everything on social media in order to change something because we feel we want to be 'woke,'\" Thomas Murphy, a business professor and branding expert at Clark University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Rather, Cracker Barrel missed the mark by failing to fully take into account people's emotional investment in its brand, Winters said.",
      "\"If you are a legacy brand and you're modernizing, you have to make sure you've appropriately honored that legacy because at the end of the day, your stakeholders own your brand \u2014 you don't,\" she said. \"Not understanding the customer and the rest of stakeholders and what they care about really matters, and that seems to be what went awry here.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 08:26:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cited risks to the labor market in opening the door to cutting interest rates. Here's what job-seekers should know.",
    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door to\u00a0cutting interest rates\u00a0for the first time in nearly a year, he noted the tremors beginning to shake a main pillar of the U.S. economy: the labor market.",
      "Concerns about the pace of job growth were heightened earlier this month after government data showed a sharp slowdown in hiring in July, along with much weaker payroll gains in May and June than previously thought. The disappointing numbers were alarming enough for President Trump to question their accuracy and to fire the head of the agency tasked with compiling the data.",
      "Yet labor experts tell CBS News they weren't surprised by the downturn, and caution that more pain could be in store for job seekers. Data released since the Aug. 1 job numbers show companies are delaying hiring as they adjust course to account for headwinds, including\u00a0fresh U.S. tariffs\u00a0and the advent of artificial intelligence, they say.",
      "\"There's a real cooling in the labor market,\" Andy Challenger, senior vice president of executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We're also having lots of individual conversations with companies that are letting us know to expect future layoffs.\"",
      "He added, \"So for me, there is more reason to be pessimistic about the labor market than optimistic we'll see some major bounce back.\"",
      "Here are three charts that could point to a serious downturn in the U.S. job market.",
      "Fewer workers are getting hired",
      "Overall, U.S. employers in 2025 have added fewer jobs on a monthly basis compared with the pace of gains in recent years, when companies sought to expand as the economy roared back from the pandemic. In 2024, employers hired an average of 168,000 workers each month, but that has slowed to an average of 35,000 over the past three months, Powell said on Friday.",
      "The risk is that the labor market could weaken from here, which could lead to \"sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,\" Powell said.",
      "The slowdown could spur the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate, policymakers' main tool for energizing the economy and job growth, at its meeting next month for the first time since December 2024. Lowering rates could bolster the labor market because it would make it cheaper for consumers to borrow, driving spending, for businesses to invest, including by adding workers.",
      "More long-term job seekers",
      "Another troubling sign is a recent surge in long-term job seekers, or people who have been searching for a job for more than 27 weeks. In July, about 1.8 million Americans had been looking for work for more than 27 weeks, a jump of about 64% from three years earlier and 20% from a year ago.",
      "It may not get easier to find work anytime soon, given signs from employers that they intend to continue to cut jobs, Challenger said.",
      "\"Don't take the summer off\" from looking for new work, he advised job-hunters. \"It's hard to imagine a scenario where the labor market will be better in three to six months.\"",
      "A jump in unemployed young workers",
      "At the same time, young workers are also having more trouble finding their first jobs, which has been blamed on everything from slowing economic activity this year to employers adopting artificial intelligence in place of entry-level workers.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low, at 4.2%. Yet that statistic is backward-looking, reflecting the labor market's strength in previous months \u2014 it says little about economic conditions moving forward.",
      "Meanwhile, for new college graduates the current job market amounts to \"a perfect storm,\" said career coach Tracey Newell.",
      "\"Companies are limiting new entry-level roles, and AI is replacing many traditional 'starter' jobs,\" she added, noting that it isn't unusual for employers these days to receive hundreds of job applications for a single position.",

    "summary": "The first commercial carbon storage facility has been inaugurated off Norway's coast, but is storing CO2 deep under the seabed really the answer?",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",

    "summary": "Baristas at the coffee chain worry the company won't fulfill its promise to improve working conditions.",
    "story": [
      "Liberte Locke, a 32-year-old \"barista\" at a Starbucks (SBUX) in New York City, is fed up.",
      "\"Starbucks' attitude is that there's always someone else who can do the job,\" she said in running through her complaints about life at the java giant.",
      "If that isn't necessarily the consensus among Starbucks workers, interviews with nine current and former baristas at the company make clear it's not an isolated opinion, either. Even those who say they like their job paint a picture of a business that underpays front-line workers, enforces work rules arbitrarily, and too often fails to strike a balance between corporate goals and employee needs.",
      "Of course, such complaints are nothing new in retail, where low pay and erratic schedules are the norm. But by its own account, Starbucks is no ordinary company and is ostensibly a far cry from the fast-food outlets now facing a nationwide uprising by employees tired of working for peanuts.",
      "That's evident in the company's recruitment pitch. Starbucks invites job-seekers to \"become a part of something bigger and inspire positive change in the world,\" describing it as a chance to discover a \"deep sense of purpose.\"",
      "Damage control",
      "That image suffered a serious blow last month after The New York Times vividly chronicled a Starbucks worker struggling with the company's scheduling practices. The story, which centered on a 22-year-old barista and single mother, amounted to a public relations nightmare for Starbucks. Perhaps not coincidentally, within days of the story's publication top executives were promising reform.",
      "In a memo to employees earlier this month, for instance, Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead vowed to \"transform the U.S. partner experience,\" referring to Starbucks' more than 130,000 baristas.  Inviting worker feedback, he said Starbucks will examine its approach to employee pay, revisit its dress code, make it easier for people to ask for time off, and consider other changes aimed at helping baristas balance work and their personal lives.",
      "Among other changes, the company said it would end the practice of \"clopening,\" when an employee responsible for closing a store late at night is also assigned to open it early in the morning.",
      "\"We recognize that we can do more for our partners who wear the apron every day,\" he wrote.",
      "Although Starbucks workers welcome this pledge to respect the apron, they fear the company is more intent on dousing the PR flames than on genuinely improving employees' experience. After the retailer last month sent an email to workers outlining possible solutions to the kind of scheduling problems and related issues detailed by the Times, a group of baristas gave the proposal a C- and posted online a marked-up version of the memo listing their own demands (see image above).",
      "\"We hope you're ready for a commitment to give us schedules that don't mess with taking care of kids, going to school or holding onto that second job we need because Sbux wages don't make ends meet,\" wrote the baristas, who are working with a union-backed labor group, the Center for Popular Democracy.",
      "Retail jungle",
      "Despite the recent media focus on Starbucks, the company's labor practices are generally no worse than those of many large retailers. In some ways they're better, with the company offering health care to part-time, as well as full-time, workers; unusually generous 401(k) matching contributions; annual stock grants to employees; and tuition reimbursement.",
      "Starbucks highlights such benefits as an example of its commitment to employees. \"Sharing success with one another has been core to the company's heritage for more than 40 years,\" Alstead said in the September memo.",
      "Meanwhile, some baristas say they enjoy their work and feel valued by Starbucks. \"It's a decent place to work, and my manager and co-workers are great,\" said one employee who asked not to be identified.",
      "But other current and former workers claim Starbucks has changed in recent years, saying that  corporate leaders' intense focus on slashing costs has short-circuited its professed commitment to workers. Mostly, they say Starbucks doesn't listen to employees and even punishes those who identify problems.",
      "\"The biggest problem is that baristas don't have a voice,\" said Sarah  Madden, a former Starbucks barista who left the company this spring  after two years with the coffee vendor. \"They can't speak to issues that  they know exist. Workers know how to fix them, but when [they] speak up  there are serious repercussions -- your hours get cut, you're  transferred to another store or isolated from other people.\"",
      "Employees interviewed for this article said one result of Starbucks' cost-containment push is that stores are frequently understaffed, hurting customer service and forcing managers to scramble to find staff. That problem is common across the big-box stores that dominate the retail sector, experts said.",
      "\"On the one hand, retailers overhire, but they're also understaffed, so  everybody's running around and then there aren't enough people on the  floor,\" said Susan Lambert, a professor at the University of Chicago and  an expert in work-life issues. \"Companies are effectively loading all  the risk onto workers so that they're not the ones incurring the risks  inherent in business.\"",
      "Starbucks denies that its stores are short-staffed. \"We're proud of the level of service we provide in our stores,\" said Zack Hutson, a spokesman for the company. \"We know that the connection our partners have with customers is the foundation of the Starbucks experience. It wouldn't be in our best interest. We want our customers to have the appropriate service level when they come to our stores.\"",
      "To be sure, Starbucks is hardly the only U.S. corporate giant to keep a gimlet eye on its bottom line -- among Fortune 500 companies that approach to management is the rule, not the exception, and CEOs across the land defend it as an inviolable fiduciary duty to shareholders.",
      "But baristas say Starbucks' focus on profits and cost-cutting has increasingly led its leadership to tune workers out. Locke, who has worked for the company since 2006 and who earns roughly $16,000 a year, said she yearned for the Starbucks of old.",
      "\"When I started they had a training program and taught you how to be a coffee expert. There was more of a culture of supporting each other as co-workers. Store managers were sympathetic. I really enjoyed it.\"",
      "Asked why she stays at Starbucks, Locke said her employment options are limited because she lacks a college education and because her only professional experience is in retail.",
      "Living wage?",
      "According to workers, the best thing Starbucks can do for its apron-wearers is to raise their pay and offer full-time hours instead of the 20 to 30 hours that most employees work.",
      "Samantha Cole, a barista in Omaha, Neb., said she struggles to get by on her supervisor's salary of $11.25 an hour. Such pay may be better than what she would earn working for other retailers, but the 30-year-old mother of two say it's still not a living wage.",
      "\"I'm definitely not making enough money,\" said Cole, who has been with the company for six years. \"A lot of us are right there with what fast-food workers are making.\"",
      "Such frustrations are also evident in comments on the Facebook page Starbucks uses to communicate with employees and where it is asking baristas for input regarding the company's labor practices. Wrote one employee: \"I've worked for the company for 7 years in January, and I don't make enough to support myself on one job so I work 2 jobs, 6 days a week.... I've seen a lot of amazing partners leave because they don't make enough.\"",
      "Starbucks declined to disclose compensation data, citing competitive reasons and saying that pay varies widely according to workers' experience and where in the U.S. stores are located. It didn't respond to emails requesting clarification regarding other aspects of its labor policies.",
      "It's worth noting that low pay isn't unique to Starbucks -- in retail it is the norm. As of 2012 (the latest year for which data is available), the median hourly income for retail salespeople is $10.29 per hour, or $21,410 a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Hourly pay for full-time retail workers range from a high of $14.42 to $9.61 for lower-paid people, according to Demos, a liberal-leaning think tank in New York. Part-timers typically make much less, with the average cashier earning $18,500 a year.",
      "\"Until [Starbucks] gives a living wage to every employee, they can't claim to be a good employer,\" Locke said, who added that it has been roughly two years since her last pay raise.",
      "\"Race to the bottom\"",
      "Another priority for baristas: stable, regular schedules. Like most large retailers, Starbucks uses scheduling software to try to match the number of workers it has in a store at any given time to the amount of business it gets. Workers also may be scheduled according to the sales they generate or their facility in promoting certain products. The technology also can enable other savings, such as limiting overtime.",
      "For employees, however, that approach -- known as \"just-in-time\" or \"on-call\" scheduling -- often results in lower income and chaotic hours.",
      "Stephanie Luce, a professor of labor studies at City University of New York's Murphy Institute, characterizes the widespread adoption of scheduling and so-called workforce optimization technologies as a \"new race to the bottom.\"",
      "\"Companies that have already reduced operating costs by making deals with irresponsible subcontractors and using the cheapest available materials are now cutting corners in the form of the 'just-in- time scheduling' of their workforce,\" she and her co-authors wrote in a recent report. \"These 'lean' manufacturing practices take advantage of sophisticated software and an increasingly desperate workforce to cut labor costs to the bone.\"",
      "By the same token, tighter control of worker schedules helps Starbucks contain payroll costs. But it also means employees who had expected to work a certain number of hours every week can see their schedules dramatically cut back and fluctuate wildly. The result? Smaller paychecks and a disturbance to family life.",
      "\"It makes it very hard for parents to participate in an intimate family routine and structure it in such a way that experts agree is good for children,\" Lambert said.",
      "Irregular schedules also make it hard for workers who do need extra income to work a second job, schedule appointments and plan other aspects of their lives.",
      "Baristas said Starbucks posts their schedule only days in advance and that they are often subject to change. Following the Times story, Starbucks said it would post schedules at least one week in advance. That's not enough time, several workers said, asking the company to provide at least two or three weeks notice, as retailers ranging from Walmart (WMT) and H&M to Victoria's Secret (LB) do.",
      "Meanwhile, despite Starbucks' promise to end clopening, the practice continues, some workers said, although the company insists that this is only in cases when people request such shifts.",
      "\"Partners should never be required to work opening and closing shifts. That policy is clear,\" Starbucks' Hutson said, adding that the company is studying ways to give workers more input in their schedules. \"If there are cases where that's not happening, we want to know about that.\"",
      "Given the scrutiny on Starbucks, the company can count on baristas to do just that.",

      "President Trump said that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\"I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.\"",
      "In a social media post Friday afternoon, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the deal had been finalized, but did not elaborate.",
      "\"The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,\" Lutnick wrote. \"This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.\"",
      "Lutnick also thanked Tan \"for striking a deal that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "Intel confirmed the deal in a news release Friday evening which stated that the U.S. government would \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",
      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",

Wall Street cheered Powell's remarks, with the S&P 500 jumping 1.3% in late morning trading.",
      "\"That's about as clear cut as Powell can get that he has shifted his view since July and is leaning toward a cut in September,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"He justifies this change in view by acknowledging the downside risks to employment after the shocking July jobs report.\"",

The Fed has been closely watching the nation's inflation rate, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% annual target and which has inched higher in recent months.",

      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",
      "\"Who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,\" he said.",
      "New Jersey is poised to be among the first to test the issue in the governor's race this November.",
      "\"Affordability is the number one issue in this race, and rising energy prices are also at the top of everyone's mind,\" Ambrose told CBS News.",
      "Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, in July released a statement accusing PJM of \"mismanagement\" of the grid: \"PJM has refused to plug clean, cheap power like solar into the grid, while giving preference to coal and oil.\"",
      "And earlier this month, her opponent, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, wrote in a post on X about \"Rebecca in Highland Park,\" whose electric bill he said had tripled, \"to more than $1000.\"",
      "\"Why? Because Trenton Democrats, with the approval of my opponent Mikie Sherrill, shut down six electricity generation plants around the state, stopped burning natural gas, and didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey,\" Ciattarelli said.",
      "\"We can look at how folks are going to vote in this upcoming election, as a reflection on how they're feeling about the country at large,\" says Ambrose, \"This affordability problem is not going away.\"",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll earlier this month found that 26% of voters blame the utility companies for price hikes, 19% blame Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, and 10% say that energy producers are at fault. Murphy is not running for reelection due to term limits.",
      "\"Utility bills directly impact elections,\" says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based energy consultancy firm. Gramlich pointed to the most infamous example of this, the California recall election in 2003, prompted in large part by the state's energy crisis. It cost Democrat Gray Davis the governorship and handed it to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
      "Gramlich indicated he expects energy prices to remain high for the foreseeable future, predicting that \"two years from now, we're going to see a lot more policy discussion about it.\"",

      "About 44% of adults surveyed by Lightspeed Commerce, a provider of point-of-sale technology for hospitality businesses, said they're ordering from the kids' menus at restaurants. Kids' meals are traditionally less expensive than those on adult menus because portion sizes are usually smaller.",
      "The trend comes as some consumers are cutting back on eating out, with McDonald's and Wendy's earlier this month reported\u00a0sluggish breakfast sales. The companies attributed the trend to heightened economic uncertainty and pressures facing low-income consumers.",

      "If you look up at the sky in Texas and see what could be a flying burrito, you may not be imagining things: Chipotle on Thursday launched an autonomous aerial delivery service for digital orders in the Dallas area.",
      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",

      "For now, each autonomous aircraft can carry orders of up to 5.5 pounds in weight. That will increase eventually to 8 pounds, Chipotle said.",
      "Last year, Chipotle was criticized by some customers who alleged certain restaurants were\u00a0skimping on portions. The company initially denied the claims, before then CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0acknowledged that about 10%\u00a0of Chipotle's 3,500 locations had indeed been underserving customers.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tariffs-trump-inflation-prices/",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 08:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "For months, economists warned that the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs would sharply boost consumer prices. Here's why it hasn't happened.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a barrage of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration this year on dozens of U.S. trade partners, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have defied many economists' expectations and remained relatively stable.",
      "Economists caution that just because tariffs have yet to trigger a renewed bout of inflation, there is no guarantee that prices won't surge later this year. They note that recent data shows a modest rise in the cost of items including clothing, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Tariffs \u2014 meaning the rate importers must pay at the border for imported goods \u2014 also take a long time to seep into the economy. That's because companies often try to hold off on passing along higher costs to customers to avoid losing market share to rivals.",
      "Yet experts acknowledge that tariffs have yet to unleash the kind of severe inflationary pressures that could cause prices to spike. For their part, White House officials have consistently maintained that foreign exporters \u2014 not American consumers \u2014 will bear the brunt of added tariff costs.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been months since Liberation Day, and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent [Council of Economic Advisers] analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, alluding to the baseline and other tariffs President Trump originally announced on April 2.",
      "Here are four reasons economists say explain why inflation isn't jumping despite the highest U.S. tariffs in decades.",
      "Tariffs aren't as high as many people expected",
      "Despite President Trump's many threats to jack up levies on imports, the actual average tariff rate being charged on U.S. imports is not as high as what has been announced, data shows.",
      "The average tariff rate on U.S. imports in June was 9% \u2014 well below the 15% that many economists were forecasting earlier this year following Mr. Trump's\u00a0slew of tariff announcements, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's not so much that the reaction to tariffs has been low, it's that the effective tariff rate increase has been relatively limited up until June,\" Mark Cus, an economist at Barclays, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Actual U.S. tariffs remain lower than earlier estimates in part because countries facing steeper levies are sending fewer goods to the U.S., according to Barclays and Capital Economics. By contrast, countries with below average tariff rates are shipping more goods to the U.S.",
      "The upshot: Average tariff rates on imports are lower than many economists were projecting earlier this year.",
      "Additionally, many goods imported into the U.S. have been exempted from steeper tariffs. Of the roughly $258 billion worth of imports that hit the U.S. retail market in June, only 48% were subject to tariffs, Barclays data shows. For example, pharmaceuticals, some electronics and many imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from any new tariffs.",
      "\"While dutiable goods face elevated tariff rates, a substantial portion of U.S. imports remains duty-free,\" Barclays analysts said in a recent report. \"This is a major contributor to the low effective tariff rate.\"",
      "Companies stocked up before higher tariffs kicked in",
      "U.S. retailers built up their inventories earlier this year in expectation that the Trump administration would hike tariffs on imported products and parts. Many retailers are still selling those non-tariffed products, allowing them to delay price hikes, experts said.",
      "For example, \"There was a big jump in imports of goods from Canada that would later be tariffed before the tariffs kicked in, and perhaps imports of those goods in May and June were relatively low, and that shows up as a smaller amount of dutiable goods,\" Barclays' Cus told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Eventually, experts warn, retailers will exhaust those lower-cost goods imported earlier in the year, which could lead to higher prices down the road.",
      "Retailers are swallowing the costs \u2014 for now",
      "For now, many retailers are eating the additional tariff costs.",
      "Businesses \"have been willing to absorb the initial hit via lower margins, although we suspect that was mostly a temporary development as those firms waited for more clarity on where tariff rates would settle,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a recent report.",
      "\"We doubt that is a sustainable outcome over the longer term, however. As the uncertainty over tariff levels eases over the next couple of weeks, giving retailers more clarity on rates over the next year or two, we would expect more firms to raise prices,\" they said.",
      "Tariffs tend to boost inflation gradually",
      "Tariffs typically take many months to seep into company supply chains and show up in the prices consumers pay at the store.",
      "The full impact of tariffs plays out not immediately but over an extended period of time, peaking roughly a year after they take effect, a June Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u00a0report\u00a0noted. That means any U.S. tariffs imposed this year would be unlikely to have much of an impact on inflation until later this year and into 2026.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a report.",
      "A final possibility is that the fears that the Trump administration's turn toward protectionist trade policies would trigger another severe bout of inflation are overblown. The White House has maintained that such a shift will protect jobs and make the U.S. more competitive globally.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" the White House's Desai said in a statement.",

      "Amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of artificial intelligence, Google says it has calculated the energy required for its Gemini AI service: Sending a single text prompt consumes as much energy as watching television for nine seconds.",
      "The technology giant on Thursday unveiled a new methodology to measure the environmental impact of its AI models, including energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions.",
      "AI tools have the potential to drive economic growth by boosting productivity and unlocking other efficiencies, economists say. By one estimate from Goldman Sachs, the tech is poised to increase global GDP by 7%, or $7 trillion, over 10 years.",
      "At the same time, scientists are flagging the outsized environmental impact of AI, which is not yet fully understood even as data centers require enormous amounts of electricity.",
      "\"In order to improve the energy efficiency of AI, a clear and comprehensive understanding of AI's environmental footprint is important. To date, comprehensive data on the energy and environmental impact of AI inference has been limited,\" Ben Gomes, Google's senior vice president of learning and sustainability, said in a blog post Thursday.",
      "Aside from their electricity needs, AI data centers also require \"a great deal of water ... \u00a0to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems,\" research from MIT\u00a0shows. \"The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.\"",
      "Some new data centers require energy between 100 and 1000 megawatts, roughly equivalent to powering 80,000 to 800,000 homes, according to an April GAO report. For now, however, there are\u00a0no regulations that require corporations to disclose how much energy or water their AI tools consume.",

      "What's the environmental impact of Gemini AI?",
      "Google's new paper on the environmental impact of its own AI tools aims to set a standard for measuring the energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions of various AI models, the company said.",
      "A typical Gemini text query uses 0.24 watt-hours (Wh) of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters \u2014 or about five drops \u2014 of water.",
      "By comparison, the average ChatGPT query uses 0.34 Wh and about one fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has written.",
      "Google also outlined the progress it has made in reducing the environmental impact of its Gemini platform. Over a recent 12-month period, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the median Gemini text prompt decreased by factors of 33x and 44x, respectively, it said.",

      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia is being processed for deportation to Uganda, the Department of Homeland Security said, after he was taken into custody Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, days after his release from criminal custody.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was mistakenly deported to his home country in March and held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months before being returned to the U.S. in June where he was jailed on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was freed from pretrial detention last Friday. CBS News reported on Saturday that his attorneys were then sent a court-required notice of his potential\u00a0deportation to Uganda. He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.",
      "\"There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshals Service and basically on house arrest,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.\"",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg filed a new lawsuit on Abrego Garcia's behalf on Monday challenging his confinement and deportation to any country \"unless and until he had a fair trial in an immigration court.\"",
      "The U.S. district court in Maryland soon issued an order preventing the government from immediately removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S. or altering his legal status, meaning his deportation is on hold for now. The court has issued the standing order in all cases involving migrant detainees challenging the legality of their detentions in recent months, a move the Justice Department is challenging as unlawful.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis, who is assigned to the case, held a hearing on Abrego Garcia's new suit on Monday. She issued an oral order preventing the Trump administration from moving Abrego Garcia from the ICE facility in Virginia where he is now being held.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0in a statement that ICE had arrested Abrego Garcia and was \"processing him for deportation.\" DHS said he is \"being processed for removal to Uganda.\" The U.S. reached an agreement with Uganda to accept some deportees last week.",
      "\"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,\" Noem said.",
      "In a legal filing over the weekend, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica. His legal team said they then received a notice of his possible deportation to Uganda. Sandoval-Moshenberg clarified Monday that Abrego Garcia had stated that he was willing to accept refugee status in Costa Rica.",
      "\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday.",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement that he was glad to \"welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.\"",
      "\"The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda \u2014 to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,\" Van Hollen said. \"As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.\"",
      "An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia may not be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore advocated for due process for Abrego Garcia on Sunday, saying on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that \"I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday signed an executive order to push Washington, D.C., and other localities to end cashless bail for arrested suspects, threatening to withhold federal funding from cities that fail to end the program. It's the latest move in the president's federal crackdown on crime.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an order directing the Justice Department to investigate instances of flag burning, although the Supreme Court in 1989\u00a0ruled\u00a0that the First Amendment protected symbolic speech, including flag burning.",
      "The executive order on cashless bail charges Attorney General Pam Bondi with identifying jurisdictions in the U.S. that have cashless bail policies, and withholds or revokes federal grants to those jurisdictions.",
      "\"We're ending it,\" Mr. Trump said of cashless bail before he signed the executive order in the Oval Office. \"But we're starting by ending it in D.C., and that we have the right to do through federalization.\"",
      "The move comes as the National Guard and federal law enforcement are dispersed throughout the district, patrolling the streets. In the last 11 days, the White House says no murders have taken place in the district.",
      "D.C. introduced cashless bail in the 1990s over civil rights concerns, becoming one of the first cities in the country to do so.",
      "\"That was when the big crime in this country started,\" Mr. Trump said Monday, speaking of cashless bail. \"They kill people and they get out. Cashless bail, they thought it was discriminatory to make people put up money because they just killed three people lying on the street.\"",
      "The president also signed an executive order Monday stating it's the government's objective to hold as many suspects captured in D.C. in federal custody as possible, and to charge them with federal crimes. The president also signed an executive order encouraging federal law enforcement agencies to hire additional personnel so they can surge law enforcement to D.C.",
      "Trump on federal government intervention in Chicago: \"We're ready to go anywhere\"",
      "One of the president's executive orders also directs the defense secretary to ensure that each state's National Guard is resourced, trained, organized and available to help in \"quelling civil disturbances,\" and directs the defense secretary to designate a number of each state's National Guard to be available for such purposes. Mr. Trump has said Chicago could be the next city where the federal government imposes a crime crackdown.",
      "\"We're ready to go anywhere,\" the president said when asked about Chicago. \"We can go anywhere on less than 24 hours' notice.\"",
      "Cracking down on flag burning",
      "The executive order the president signed pushes Bondi to investigate instances of flag desecration. The administration has been critical of pro-Palestinian protests and anti-immigration crackdown demonstrations that have featured flag burning.",
      "\"And then where there's evidence of criminal activity, where prosecution wouldn't fall afoul of the First Amendment, it instructs the Department of Justice to prosecute those who were engaged in these instances of flag burning,\" said Trump staff secretary Will Scharf.",
      "Mr. Trump said he wants the penalty for flag burning to be at least one year in prison.",
      "\"And what the penalty is going to be, if you burn a flag, you get one year in jail, no early exits, no nothing,\" the president said of what he hopes punishment for flag burning will be.",
      "Creation of specialized National Guard unit and quick reaction force",
      "The order also included a provision ordering the defense secretary to create a specialized unit within th eD.C. National Guard \"dedicated to ensuring public safety and order in the Nation's capital.\"",
      "The president also ordered the defense secretary to begin ensuring that every state's National Guard has the resources and is trained and available to help federal, state and local law enforcement address civil disturbances and ensure public safety and order \"whenever the circumstances necessitate, as appropriate under law.\"",
      "Under the order, the defense secretary is also supposed to designate numbers of trained National Guard members in each state \"to be reasonably available for rapid mobilization\" for those circumstances and ensure there's a standing National Guard quick reaction force that would be available to be deployed rapidly nationwide..",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday floated returning the Department of Defense to its prior name, the Department of War \u2014 arguing the name it has held since the 1940s is \"too defensive.\"",
      "\"We want to be defensive, but we want to be offensive, too, if we have to be,\" the president told reporters during a Monday afternoon Oval Office event.",
      "Mr. Trump tested out the Department of War moniker during a series of public events at the White House on Monday, including a meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung. He argued that the United States had an \"unbelievable history of victory\" under the department's old name, referring to World War I and World War II.",
      "The president said earlier Monday the change would likely be made \"over the next week or so.\" Hours later, he said he'd leave it up to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth: \"We'll do it a couple of more times. And if everyone likes it, we'll make that change.\"",
      "Asked whether Congress would need to sign off on restoring the agency's old name, since lawmakers had passed the initial renaming, Mr. Trump said he didn't think so: \"We're just going to do it. I'm sure Congress will go along if we need that. I don't think we even need that.\"",
      "The president has teased a name change for the federal government's largest agency on and off for months, referring to Hegseth as his \"Secretary of War\" at one point last month\u00a0in a post on Truth Social. During a June press conference, he claimed the old Department of War moniker was abandoned because \"we became politically correct.\"",
      "Why was the Department of War changed to the Department of Defense?",
      "The renaming took place in the wake of World War II, part of a broader reorganization of the U.S. military that placed the Army and Navy into a single Cabinet-level agency.",
      "The War Department \u2014 which oversaw the Army \u2014 dated back to President George Washington's first term, but in the late 1790s, Congress created a separate Navy Department to oversee the new country's naval forces and, later, the Marine Corps. Those two agencies operated separately for over a century.",
      "President Harry Truman pushed for different branches of service to be combined into a single Department of National Defense in 1947, telling Congress the move was necessary to \"cut costs and at the same time enhance our national security.\"",
      "The agencies were combined under a single Secretary of Defense in a 1947 law that also created the National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency. Two years later, Congress named the agency the Department of Defense.",

      "Zambada pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy and one count of running a continuing criminal enterprise, the Justice Department said. He had originally pleaded not guilty, but last week federal prosecutors wrote in a court filing that he intended to change his plea.",
      "The Associated Press reported that in brief remarks in a court hearing Monday, Zambada apologized for his actions.",
      "\"I recognize the great harm illegal drugs have done to the people in the United States and Mexico,\" he said through a Spanish-language interpreter, the AP reported. \"I apologize for all of it, and I take responsibility for my actions.\"",

      "\"El Mayo will spend the rest of his life behind bars.

      "Washington \u2014 The Republican leader of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has issued a subpoena to the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein seeking documents and other material as part of its ongoing examination of the government's investigation into Epstein.",
      "The subpoena issued by Rep. James Comer of Kentucky demands the co-executors of Epstein's estate turn over to the House committee more than a dozen categories of documents and communications, including material from 1990 through August 2019 that references all presidents and vice presidents, videos taken from Epstein's properties and listings in his contact and address books.",
      "Lawmakers are also seeking entries contained within a leather-bound book put together by Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, for his 50th birthday, the 2008 non-prosecution agreement reached with the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of Florida and Epstein's will.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported last month that President Trump had allegedly signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein in the early 2000s to mark his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" The Journal reported that the leather-bound book was compiled by Maxwell and included submissions from dozens of associates, including billionaire Leslie Wexner attorney Alan Dershowitz and Mr. Trump.",
      "The president called the letter reported by the Journal \"fake\" and filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper, its parent company and media mogul Rupert Murdoch over the story, seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",
      "In a letter to the co-executors of Epstein's estate, Comer wrote that \"it is our understanding that the estate is ready and willing to provide these documents to the Committee pursuant to a subpoena.\" He set a Sept. 8 deadline for the documents to be turned over to House investigators.",
      "\"Recent reporting indicates the estate of Mr. Epstein has access to documents relevant to the Committee's investigation, including the alleged 'birthday book' prepared for Mr. Epstein by Ms. Maxwell,\" he wrote. \"The attached subpoena is meant to bolster the amount of information available to the Committee so that it may conduct its work. It is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell.\"",
      "In addition to issuing the subpoena, Comer announced that Alex Acosta, who was serving as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida when Epstein was investigated, will voluntarily answer questions from the committee on Sept. 19.",
      "Acosta was the top federal prosecutor in South Florida when federal authorities investigated Epstein in the 2000s and entered into a non-prosecution agreement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution and plead guilty to state prostitution charges. Acosta went on to serve as secretary of labor during Mr. Trump's first term, but resigned in 2019 amid questions about his handling of the Epstein case.",
      "As part of its investigation into the federal probe into Epstein, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas for depositions earlier this month to former attorneys general and FBI directors across four presidential administrations, as well as to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "Comer said the committee would accept formal written declarations from three former attorneys general, Alberto Gonzales, Eric Holder and Jeff Sessions. Acosta was not among the officials from whom the Oversight Committee initially sought testimony.",
      "The panel also issued a subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for documents related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping him recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence, but has appealed her conviction to the Supreme Court.",
      "The Justice Department sent the first tranche of files related to Epstein to Congress last week, and the Oversight Committee plans to make the records public, though victims' identification and child sexual abuse material will be redacted, a spokesperson said.",
      "The renewed focus on Epstein's case and the government's handling of it was sparked by a Justice Department memo issued in July that said there was no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures. The Trump administration said it would not disclose any additional information about Epstein, which led to a backlash from some of the president's allies.",
      "In response, the Justice Department asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell's cases. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman denied last week the request to make the material from Epstein's proceedings public, finding that the government is the \"logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein File.\"",
      "Separately, the administration released transcripts of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with Maxwell that was conducted in Tallahassee last month.",
      "Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019 but died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 \u00a0President Trump signed an executive order Monday that seeks to punish people who burn the American flag, accusing those who do so of displaying hostility and contempt toward the United States.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years threatened to crack down on flag burning. In 2016, he wrote on social media that anyone who burns the American flag should lose their citizenship or face jail time. During a 2024 speech before the National Guard Association of the United States, then-candidate Trump said he would work to pass a law imposing criminal penalties on those who burn the American flag.",
      "In remarks from the Oval Office on Monday, Mr. Trump alleged that burning the American flag \"incites riots\" and said those who are prosecuted and convicted as a result of his directive would face one year in prison.",
      "\"The people in this country don't want to see our American flag burned and spit on,\" the president said.",
      "Trump's executive order on flag burning",
      "Titled \"Prosecuting Burning of the American Flag,\" Mr. Trump's executive order does not direct the attorney general to prosecute those who burn flags for the act itself. Rather, it says the Justice Department should bring cases \"against acts of American Flag desecration that violate applicable, content-neutral laws, while causing harm unrelated to expression, consistent with the First Amendment.\" Examples of those laws include \"violent crimes; hate crimes, illegal discrimination against American citizens, or other violations of Americans' civil rights; and crimes against property and the peace.\"",
      "The directive acknowledges a 36-year-old Supreme Court decision that found flag burning is protected speech but adds that \"American flag desecration conducted in a manner that is likely to incite imminent lawless action or that is an action amounting to 'fighting words'\" may not be entitled to the same protection under the First Amendment.",
      "The order directs the secretary of state, attorney general and secretary of homeland security to take action against foreign nationals who have engaged in \"American flag-desecration activity,\" including by revoking their visas or residence permits, or seeking their removal from the U.S.",
      "The attorney general, Mr. Trump's executive order states, \"shall vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the American Flag, and may pursue litigation to clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions in this area.\"",
      "Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in response to Mr. Trump's executive order that the president does not have the power to change the First Amendment.",
      "\"Flag burning as a form of political protest is protected by the First Amendment. That's nothing new. While people can be prosecuted for burning anything in a place they aren't allowed to set fires, the government can't prosecute protected expressive activity \u2014 even if many Americans, including the president, find it 'uniquely offensive and provocative,'\" he said in a statement. \"You don't have to like flag burning. You can condemn it, debate it, or hoist your own flag even higher. The beauty of free speech is that you get to express your opinions, even if others don't like what you have to say.\"",
      "Is flag burning protected by the First Amendment?",
      "The president's directive appears aimed at re-opening the question in the courts of whether flag burning is constitutionally protected speech. While Mr. Trump believes that it should be illegal to burn the American flag and sought to unilaterally target those who engage in this conduct, the Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the act is expressive conduct covered by the First Amendment.",
      "The 5-4 decision in the landmark case Texas v. Johnson arose from Gregory Lee Johnson's conviction under a Texas law that prohibited desecration of a venerated object. Johnson had burned an American flag outside of Dallas City Hall in protest of then-President Ronald Reagan's policies in 1984. He was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $2,000.",
      "But the Supreme Court ruled that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment, since his flag burning constituted protected expressive conduct. Among the members of the five-justice majority were Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, who often served as the swing vote after Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired.",
      "During a 2012 interview with CNN, Scalia, a conservative stalwart, defended the high court's decision on flag burning and reiterated that the act is a form of expression.",
      "\"If I were king, I would not allow people to go around burning the American flag,\" he said. \"However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged \u2014 and it is addressed in particular to speech critical of the government. That was the main kind of speech that tyrants would seek to suppress.\"",
      "Scalia told CNN that \"burning a flag is a symbol that expresses an idea \u2014 I hate the government, the government is unjust, whatever.\"",
      "Referencing the 1989 ruling, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that the case was decided by a \"very sad court.\"",
      "One year after that decision, the Supreme Court ruled in the case United States v. Eichman that a federal law criminalizing flag burning was unconstitutional.",
      "Congress had passed that law, known as the Flag Protection Act, in 1989 in response to the high court's ruling in Texas v. Johnson. The law made it a crime to knowingly mutilate, deface, physically defile, burn or trample upon the American flag, and violators faced a fine or up to one year in prison.",
      "But in another 5-4 decision, again with Scalia and Kennedy in the majority, the Supreme Court ruled that prosecutions of protesters who burned flags in violation of the Flag Protection Act were inconsistent with the First Amendment.",
      "\"Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and worth revering,\" Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority.",

    "story": [
      "As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function \u2014 emergency response \u2014 when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.",
      "The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.",
      "In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency's reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.",
      "\"CDC hasn't reached out to us locally,\" Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. \"My staff feels like we are out here all alone,\" she added.",
      "A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.",
      "\"All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,\" one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. \"All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything.\"",
      "Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, researchers estimate. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.",
      "The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces as vaccination rates drop, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.",
      "While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The Texas outbreak spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Mexico's Chihuahua state \u2014 at minimum. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.",
      "\"This is absolutely outrageous,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \"When you're battling contagious diseases, time is everything.\"",
      "\"The CDC is 'stressed' currently\"",
      "Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in late January had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested.",
      "\"I think this may be very large,\" she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she'd learned from conversations with people in the community: \"According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.\"",
      "In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.",
      "One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.",
      "\"Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?\" Wells wrote on Feb. 5.",
      "\"It never hurts to ask the CDC,\" said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.",
      "\"I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,\" Milton wrote. \"Of course, we know the CDC is 'stressed' currently.\"",
      "Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit.",
      "\"The CDC had gone dark,\" said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. \"We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.\"",
      "Technically, the Trump administration's freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.",
      "\"There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,\" one CDC scientist said.",
      "Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. \"Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February,\" he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. \"The CDC was gagged,\" he said.",
      "Through private conversations, Benjamin said he learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves.",
      "\"It's not that the CDC was delinquent,\" Benjamin said. \"It's that they had their hands tied behind their backs.\"",
      "To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. \"We would always offer a conversation and ask if there's anything we could do,\" she said.",
      "Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state's correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records \"confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.\"",
      "Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's corroborated in emails from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.",
      "\"Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,\" Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, told KFF Health News.",
      "Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren't already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn't spread measles to others.",
      "Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn't want to be tested, didn't want to name their contacts, and didn't want to talk with the health department. \"It doesn't matter what resources I have if people won't avail themselves of it,\" Holbrooks said.",
      "Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against COVID-19 restrictions deepened that mistrust.",
      "Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. Locals guess the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is far larger than the U.S. Census count.",
      "\"I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community,\" Holbrooks said. \"There's a lot of people in the shadows out here.\"",
      "Public health experts say the situation in Gaines County sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.",
      "About 450 people \u2014 including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers \u2014 helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in Clark County, Washington, in 2018.",
      "Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. \"We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,\" he said.",
      "Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.",
      "In New York, hundreds of people in the city's health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.",
      "The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. Then there's the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and the lasting toll of some measles infections, including deafness or worse.",
      "\"I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented,\" Zucker said.",
      "Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: \"I'm so overwhelmed.\"",
      "A death ignites a response",
      "On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a brief notice on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.",
      "In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet reported on a large drugstore where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were \"flying off the shelf.\"",
      "Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development.",
      "Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups \u2014 including one founded by Kennedy \u2014 that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes.",
      "\"How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?\" Milton asked in an email.",
      "Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. \"HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,\" one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. \"If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven't seen those babies born yet.\"",
      "Another CDC official said they've had to \"walk a fine line\" between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.",
      "While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. \"We're providing vitamin A,\" Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. \"There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,\" he claimed, \"against serious disease and death.\"",
      "The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is seldom useful against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.",
      "Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with numerous inaccurate statements. \"There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,\" he said. \"It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.\" There is no evidence that measles vaccines \"cause deaths every year.\" Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn't cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.",
      "In another interview, Kennedy said, \"The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.\" The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.",
      "\"Staff are exhausted\"",
      "Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.",
      "\"Local hospitals are at capacity,\" wrote Jeffrey Hill, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. \"The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,\" he added.",
      "\"I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,\" Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. \"Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.\"",
      "The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.",
      "None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child visited relatives in Seminole and returned home with an infection. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua.",
      "Then another child in West Texas died of measles.",
      "In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. \"There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,\" Sugarman said. \"We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.\"",
      "Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. \"A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,\" he said, \"and didn't see the need to confirm it.\"",
      "On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas outbreak over, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.",
      "The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.",
      "More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, alarmed by unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers lacking expertise in vaccines and infectious disease, including some who have expressed anti-vaccine views. One of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, blamed the deaths of children with measles on \"medical mismanagement,\" without evidence.",
      "At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year.",
      "Amid Lubbock's toughest months, Wells sent an email to the department's exhausted staff. \"The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,\" she wrote. \"Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.\"",

      "The contents of the letter were not released.",
      "The dustup follows Macron's rejection this past week of accusations from Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that France's intention to\u00a0recognize a Palestinian state is fueling antisemitism.",
      "France is home to the largest Jewish population in Western Europe, with an estimated 500,000 Jews. That's approximately 1% of the national population.",
      "The diplomatic discord comes as French-U.S. relations have faced tensions this year amid Trump's trade war. Under a decree\u00a0signed by Mr. Trump last month, international goods that were previously exempt from U.S. tariffs \u2014 those valued under $800 \u2014 will be subject to import duties from Aug. 29.",

      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2,300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside D.C. police forces.",
      "And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future?",
      "Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned as needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore.",
      "And joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic governor, Wes Moore.",
      "Thank you for being here.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-Maryland): Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there \u2013 here in D.C., there are Guardsmen from six different states on the street.",
      "The mission is \u2013 quote \u2013 \"beautification duty and support.\" The defense secretary has author \u2013 authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but, to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of D.C.",
      "Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, there's \u2013 there's plenty of reasons.",
      "You know, one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're \u2013 when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their National Guards to Washington, D.C.",
      "So who's going to \u2013 who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment. And for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big-government approach in the way they're conducting public safety.",
      "The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful.",
      "And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the president's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans, is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this.",
      "And I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received.",
      "When \u2013 when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need \u2013 where you need a surge of supports for \u2013 for traumas and disasters\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: \u2026 that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this. And this is a direct deflection that the president is authorizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the president watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing, because he's tweeting about you \u2013 or TRUTHing, I guess.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says: \"The Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him.\" And he's talking about \"crime-ridden Baltimore.\" It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime.",
      "He says it's a bad one. He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby D.C. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it.",
      "Is the reality here is you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day. And I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation.",
      "So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local \u2013 with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history, over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: That \u2013 well, no, that came from both federal and state money. And, also, Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges.",
      "And the results have been \u2013 have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past 2.5 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20 percent since I have been the governor. And the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet.",
      "And so the reason that I have asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, this \u2013 these tropes, in these 1980s scare tac \u2013 scare tactics.",
      "And, you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called We Our Us, who is a violence intervention group. And they say, we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel, because, while the president is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime,.",
      "But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The president's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore has the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis, fourth highest murder rate.",
      "To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis. But\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Correct.",
      "And we know we have work to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We know \u2013 like, if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But your \u2013 the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help. He doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though. He says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF.",
      "Do you need more federal help in policing, if your mayor thinks you do?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the president to stop cutting funding, because, if you look at the president's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore, that it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons.",
      "Those are actually real, tangible things\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: \u2026 that the president of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is \u2013 President Trump says so as well \u2013 possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's spending a lot of time talking about you.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I have been on his mind a lot.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020, when the, you know, idea was defund the police.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely.",
      "And, yes, the president spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And, yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected.",
      "And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father?",
      "And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods, who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work.",
      "And we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not presidential timber at all.",
      "I imagine you disagree with that assessment?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: No, I have been very clear. I'm not running for president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it's interesting that \u2013 but it's interesting. The president seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people.",
      "And that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland.",
      "Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you. You brought up immigration.",
      "One of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S.",
      "This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and the \u2013 what we know is that, you know, and all we're asking for is that the Constitution be followed on this.",
      "The Constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues. And when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the president manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the president is using to just \u2013 working to exploit the brokenness.",
      "And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety, that\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words, rather than\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process.",
      "I just simply want a court and a judge to decide, what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security, who is \u2013 who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor, and executioner inside this case.",
      "I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting, or gerrymandering, as some people know it.",
      "You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one \u2013 one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, I mean, when I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, because. And I think \u2013 and I think we have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and I think \u2013 and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is, this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the president of the United States, very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes, we're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different.",
      "But Democrats redistrict. You know this.,",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where \u2013 where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps.",
      "And we also need to make sure that if the president of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters' voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent \u2013 they have a Republican representative, that they are actively being represented in Maryland?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think, if you look at maps across the country, less than 10 percent of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature, less than 10 percent.",
      "And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: So that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so, yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, we are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen. She joins us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "Good morning, Senator.",
      "I know we have got a bit of a delay here, so I will launch right in.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-New Hampshire): Good morning, or afternoon here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, exactly.",
      "You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed. The Pentagon did not explain why.",
      "In addition, the Navy reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed.",
      "Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings.",
      "And they come on the heels of firings earlier this year of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of naval operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things \u2013 one of the strengths of America's military are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks who have the training, the expertise to be able to do the jobs.",
      "And what we don't want is political people in those jobs who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So, it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze. And we're going to try to get that back up if we can. The senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan.",
      "We lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator.",
      "Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday this internationally recognized body backed by the U.N., the IPC \u2013 it tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a manmade famine under way in Gaza. This is a very rare designation. Only four other times has one been designated.",
      "The country you are in, Jordan, called it a shameful failure of humanity, that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three-month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen.",
      "One of the \u2013 we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is a \u2013 funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration.",
      "They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in, in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable.",
      "Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he is doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli prime minister's office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it \u2013 quote \u2013 \"a modern blood libel spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\"",
      "That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate, rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor. And the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it.",
      "But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that. They are getting ready to do another \u2013 or they have already started planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people.",
      "So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand your criticism right now.",
      "I want to ask you a little bit, though, about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former Deputy National Security Adviser for President Biden Joe \u2013 Jon Finer just wrote a piece in \"The Atlantic.\"",
      "And he said that, while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes: \"We did far too little far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\"",
      "Do you agree with him? And do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position.",
      "With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in.",
      "I think \u2013 it's something that I hope that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But do you agree with this self-criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We should be doing more, and we should have done more, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "I want to also ask you\u2026",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think everybody should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: \u2026 have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense, when it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid, when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck.",
      "And they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid into the people of Gaza, who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And that can be changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Jeanne Shaheen joining us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "A bit of a delay there.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Congressman Mike Lawler is standing by.",
      "So, stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York.",
      "Good to have you here, Congressman.",
      "There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland. And that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The president encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well.",
      "Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less. And mine wasn't even one of them. Despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat. I won by six and a half points.",
      "So, when you look at the map across the country, the fact is, roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts, they're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and, therefore, they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that, obviously, reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond.",
      "But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year. In 2024, at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become speaker \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting. Despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution.",
      "So, now, New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: So, this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states, trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the president's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the president of the United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Look, obviously it's going to be a fight. But this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid-decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress, like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974, never held a job outside of elected office, it's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform.",
      "So, I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know, there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties because, frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority, period.",
      "On the question, though, that we have been \u2013 also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The president of the United States has mentioned New York as another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Well, crime has been a major problem in New York for years. And Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, but do you want National Guard troops?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized \u2013 Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So, that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80 percent of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution. That 80 percent of these individuals are released back out on to the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington, D.C., 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.",
      "So, when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime? This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013 no, but that's a local \u2013 that's a local issue that would need to get changed.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: No, but this \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the question on the troops, you'd rather troops than \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: But \u2013 but \u2013 but, Margaret, this is why the homicide rate is so high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: FBI agents or ATF agents or DEAL agents? You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City, you would rather National Guardsmen who have to be trained to police?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I want \u2013 I want all of the above. No. No, no, don't \u2013 don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above. The FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime.",
      "I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation, enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I led that effort. And the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington, D.C., only 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous. And it's exactly why the president is cracking down on crime in major cities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York state that \u2013 that matters. A good amount of money from that chips bill went to New York.",
      "On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore. The president wants to buy a 10 percent stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have U.S. taxpayers as a \u2013 as a shareholder, own 10 percent.",
      "As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Generally speaking, no. I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: In the aftermath of the collapse of the market in '08, the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we saw the \u2013 the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon. But he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So, why then did the financial markets rally?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct, the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability. And the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side and, therefore, an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said, \"significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system.\" \"Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth.\" And there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point. But it's a lot of uncertainty.",
      "Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if basically he's saying, throw out your models?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent. And, therefore, he has tended to be late.",
      "Look, there is something promising in our future. And that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in A.I., in life sciences, in robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds. And that includes high debt and high deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawler just before you. And that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chipmaker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president of the United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.",
      "(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
      "DONALD TRUMP, (President Of The United States): He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving up $10 billion for the United States. So, we picked up $10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that.",
      "(END VIDEO CLIP)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10 percent stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so. Margaret, look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing. And that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what the U.S. is saying now is we \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which were paid back.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back. But at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas.",
      "The most important distinction, if I may here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10 percent, but it must not control how this company manages its affairs. Because once we go down that road, that is a really dangerous road, and that will (ph) eat way at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic entrepreneurial economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the commerce secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for.",
      "I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve chair, which you've nodded to, but the president is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her, without publicly disclosed evidence, of mortgage fraud, and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell encouraging her to be removed.",
      "Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, these allegations are unproven. And it's important to stress that.",
      "Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So, what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that have resulted in these four resignations.",
      "But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. An independence central bank is critical to the well-being of the economy. And there's lots of reasons for that. So, you know, one has to distinguish between the two, I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information and is \u2013 is denying wrongdoing here.",
      "But just the fact that it is the president directing the attention towards her, doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop, this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I \u2013 my fear, and my concern, is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mohamed El-Erian, thank you so much for sharing your insight today. We'll leave it there.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday by a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing manmade famine and that those conditions will expand soon.",
      "UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment.",
      "Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us.",
      "We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation, so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL (Executive Director, UNICEF): Well, thank you, Margaret.",
      "Let \u2013 let me say this. You know, it's \u2013 it's been now almost two years since October 7th. And since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for \u2013 for months and months and months, which is the terrible famine.",
      "You know, we've estimated, at this point, that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who have died from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying, beware, right? This \u2013 this famine is just right around the corner and it's \u2013 it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know, it's so \u2013 it's shocking that it's happened because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising.",
      "And what it means really is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image, children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where, you know, suddenly they're \u2013 they're \u2013 they're all quiet. Children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry. And to see that happen and \u2013 especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid into these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the U.N. data is flawed. The prime minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice.",
      "Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot. Journalists who live inside Gaza. Because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know what you're saying is fact?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, let me say two things about that. One is, the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people. And they monitor this as they go and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-laden deaths. So, it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate.",
      "I would also say, to me, it's \u2013 it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, all right. I \u2013 I \u2013 I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not?",
      "First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming. You should see it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absence of that, we're going to have to rely on the \u2013 the data that we have, the people who were there. And I can tell you from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean I have spoken to our staff and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived. Many thousands of children who have had amputations and are \u2013 you know, I mean just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussions, stop the arguing and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children. Make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a decent future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And \u2013 and the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out.",
      "On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Jack Lieu, and another Mideast envoy, have said the U.N. agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why \u2013 why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, I \u2013 the \u2013 the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, U.N. had 400 places where we \u2013 we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, OK. And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food. People are getting shot. It's a \u2013 it's a terrible situation. And it doesn't work. It's not working that well.",
      "Now, look, I don't \u2013 I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our \u2013 let us do our work too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say \"we,\" it's not just UNICEF, it's the U.N., it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that gets to the people who need it. And I \u2013 you know, do both. I'm fine with that. But at least make sure the humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that. Nobody wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. He did indeed.",
      "I want to ask you as well about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good. And we need them to step up and do more.",
      "Sudan, as you say, it's the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the U.S. really can make a much bigger difference if they try to \u2013 to do this work and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here when you don't get \u2013",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: It's horrible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, first of all, they're not getting food. They are facing horrible sexual violence.",

    "summary": "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said President Trump's rhetoric on crime is \"purely performative\" as the president offered to send troops to Baltimore amid a broader push to crack down on crime.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that President Trump's rhetoric on crime is \"purely performative\" as the president has offered to send troops to Baltimore amid a push to crack down on crime that began in the nation's capital in recent weeks and could extend to other major cities.",
      "\"While the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime. But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States,\" Moore said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump moved to federalize the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department earlier this month and deployed the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement, despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years.",
      "Upon announcing the moves, the president outlined that the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and suggesting it could then move to other cities, though the president has unique authority over the D.C. National Guard because the district is controlled by the federal government. He referenced crime rates in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Baltimore and Oakland.",
      "Last week, Moore, a Democrat, sent a letter to Mr. Trump inviting him to attend a public safety walk in Maryland, while touting the state's investments in local law enforcement and other efforts to address crime under his administration. In 2025, Baltimore has seen a 22% decrease in homicides from last year, according to the Baltimore Police Department.",
      "The governor said Sunday that \"the reason that I asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, these tropes and these 1980s scare tactics.\"",
      "\"We know we have work to do,\" Moore said. \"If one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work, and what tactics is just theatrics.\"",
      "Moore's appearance on \"Face the Nation\" came shortly after Mr. Trump took aim at the governor on Truth Social Sunday morning, responding to the mayor's request by saying, \"As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a 'walk.'\"",
      "Although Mr. Trump dismissed Moore's suggestion, he said last week that he would be joining federal authorities in D.C. \"on patrol.\" He instead visited a U.S. Park Police facility in Southeast D.C.",
      "\"Wes Moore's record on Crime is a very bad one, unless he fudges his figures on crime like many of the other 'Blue States' are doing,\" the president added. \"But if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the 'troops,' which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime.\"",
      "The push in D.C. followed the president's move to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles in June amid heated protests over immigration raids, prompting a lawsuit from the California governor, who did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and called it an illegal \"power grab.\" Mr. Trump and Newsom's sparring has escalated as Newsom's public profile as a potential 2028 candidate has grown.",
      "Moore said Sunday that the operation in D.C. is \"not scalable,\" saying \"you're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city.\" He also argued that the crackdown on crime in the district is \"not sustainable,\" \"deeply disrespectful\" to the National Guard, and \"unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"There is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this,\" Moore added.",
      "The Maryland governor acknowledged that crime must be addressed, while recalling the aftermath of a mass shooting in Baltimore early in his tenure as governor.",
      "\"I said at that point, 'I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer,'\" Moore said. \"And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. Good to have you here, Congressman, there's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland, and that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The President encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now, California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well. Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REP. MIKE LAWLER: I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong, and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less, and mine wasn't even one of them, despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat, I won by six and a half points. So when you look at the map across the country, the fact is roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts. They're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and therefore they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that obviously reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond. But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here. Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year in 2024 at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become Speaker. They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting, despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution. So now New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the house. So this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the President's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the President of United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Look, obviously, it's going to be a fight, but this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms, because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974 never held a job outside of elected office. It's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform. So I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties, because frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority. Period. On the question, though, that we have been- also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The President of the United States has mentioned New York is another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars, and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Crime has been a major problem in New York for years, and Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Do you want National Guard troops?-- ,",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized- Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard's troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime. When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80% of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution, that 80% of these individuals are released back out onto the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington DC, 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. So when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime?",
      "[START CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- No, but that's a local--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- that's a local issue that would need to get changed. But in terms of the question on the troops--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- No but- it's- no- but Margaret, this why the homicide rate is so high--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You'd rather troops than FBI agents or ATF agents or DEA agents. You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City. You would rather National Guardsmen --",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- I want- I want all of the above.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- who have trained to be trained to police?",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. LAWLER: No. No, no, don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above, the FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime. I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal. I led that effort, and the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime, and yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington D.C., only 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous, and it's exactly why the President is cracking down on crime in major cities, and as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York State that matters. A good amount of money from that CHIPs bill went to New York. On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore, the President wants to buy a 10% stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have US taxpayers as a shareholder, own 10%. As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Generally speaking, no, I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts, when we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the- in the aftermath of the collapse of the market and '08 the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that. I think what the President is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars that are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel to manufacture chips. And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment. Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors and that's critical for our foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break, so I'm going to leave it there. We'll be right back."

SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings, and they come on the heels of firings earlier this year, of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of Naval Operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things, one of the strengths of America's military, are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks, who have the training, the expertise, to be able to do the jobs. And what we don't want is political people in those jobs, who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze, and we're going to try to get that back up, if we can. The Senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan. So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan. We- we lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator. Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday, this internationally recognized body, backed by the UN, the IPC. It tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a man-made famine underway in Gaza. This is a very rare designation, only four other times has one been designated. The country you are in, Jordan, called it a \"shameful failure of humanity\" that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think is- it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen. One of the- we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is an- it funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration. They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable. Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he's doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli Prime Minister's Office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it, quote, \"a modern blood libel, spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\" That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor, and the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it. But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death, because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that, they're getting ready to do another- or, they've already started, planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people. So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in, to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I understand your criticism right now. I want to ask you a little bit though about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former deputy national security adviser for President Biden Joe- Jon Finer, just wrote a piece in the Atlantic, and he said that while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes \"we did far too little, far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\" Do you agree with him, and do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position. With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in. I think it's something that, I hope, that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but do you agree with this self criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We should be doing more and we should have done more. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I want to also ask you--",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think everybody--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: --should have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense. When it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck, and they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck, when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's- that's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid in to the people of Gaza who are starving. And that can be changed. All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senators Jeanne Shaheen joining us from Amman, Jordan. Bit of a delay there. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday about a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing man-made famine, and that those conditions will expand soon. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment. Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us. We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation- so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real-world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, thank you, Margaret. Let me say this: You know, it's been, now, almost two years since October 7th, and since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage, and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for months and months and months, which is a terrible famine. You know, we've estimated at this point that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who die from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying we beware, right, this- this famine is just right around the corner, and it's- it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know. It's so- it's shocking that it's happened, because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising. And what it means, really, is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image. Children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where you know suddenly they're all quiet. The children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry, and to see that happen, and especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid in to these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the UN data is flawed. The Prime Minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice. Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot- journalists who live inside Gaza, because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know that what you're saying is fact?",
      "RUSSELL: Let me say two things about that. One is the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people, and they monitor this as they go, and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-related deaths, so it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate. I would also say it- to me, it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, right? I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not? First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean, we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming, you should be it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absent that, we're going to have to rely on the data that we have the people who were there, and I can tell you, from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean, I have spoken to our staff, and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived, many thousands of children who have had amputations, and are, you know, it's just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just- almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussion, stop arguing, and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children, make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a distant future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out. On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people: The former US Ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, and another Mid-East Envoy have said the UN agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why- why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, I- the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, the UN had 400 places where we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, okay? And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food, people are getting shot. It's a terrible situation, and it doesn't work. It's not working that well. Now look, I don't- I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our let us do our work, too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say we, it's not just UNICEF, it's the UN, it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that it gets to the people who need it. And I, you know, do both. I'm fine with that, but at least make sure that humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly, and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that nobody wants that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He did indeed. I want to ask you, as well, about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good, and we need them to step up and do more. Sudan, as you say, is the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of Cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean, it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the US really can make a much bigger difference if they try to do this work, and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here? When you don't look --",
      "RUSSELL: Oh, it's horrible. First of all, they're not getting food. They're facing horrible sexual violence. I was just in Chad and heard stories that could just break your heart, and it's devastating, and the results, as you say, will last for generations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for sharing that. That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. I'm Margaret Brennan."

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to 'Face The Nation.' It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside DC police forces. And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future? Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned is needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore, and joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic Governor Wes Moore. Thank you for being here.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're here in DC- there are guardsmen from six different states on the street. The mission is, quote, 'beautification, duty and support.' The defense secretary has author- authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of DC. Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Well, there's- there's plenty of reasons. You know one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their national guards to Washington, DC. So who's going to- who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment, and for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big government approach in the way they're conducting public safety. The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful. And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the President's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans- is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by Federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received. When- when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need- where you need a surge of supports for- for traumas and disasters that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this, and this is a direct deflection that the President is authorizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the President watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing because he's tweeting about you- or truthing, I guess. He says the Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a 'nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him,' and he's talking about 'crime ridden Baltimore.' It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime. He says it's a 'bad one.' He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby DC. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it. Is the reality here is- you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?",
      "GOV. MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day, and I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation. So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local- with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history. Over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.",
      "GOV. MOORE: No that came from both federal and state money, and also Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. Attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges. And the results have been- have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past two and a half years. The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20% since I have been the governor, and the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet. And so the reason that I've asked the President to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance. This- these tropes, in these 1980s scare- scare tactics. And you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called 'We Our Us' who is a violence intervention group. And they say we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel. Because while the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime, but it's falling on deaf ears of the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The President's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore is the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis. Fourth highest murder rate. To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the Governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis--",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0--And we know we have work to do. We know- if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But your- the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help-- he doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though, he says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF, do you need more federal help in policing if your mayor thinks you do?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the President to stop cutting funding. Because if you look at the President's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore. That it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons. Those are actually real, tangible things that the President of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is- President Trump says so as well, possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He spent a lot of time talking about you.",
      "GOV. MOORE: I've been on his mind a lot of times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020 when the you know idea was defund the police.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. And yet the President spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in, and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected. And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore, because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father? And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the President of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work and we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not 'presidential timber' at all. I imagine you disagree with that assessment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah, I've been very clear. I'm not running for president--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it's interesting that- but it's interesting the President seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people, and that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland. Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, you brought up immigration one of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S. This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?",
      "GOV. MOORE: And the- what we know is that- you know, and all we're asking for, is that the constitution be followed on this. The constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues, and when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the President manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the President is using to just- working to exploit the brokenness. And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process. I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the President of the United States or the Secretary of Homeland Security who is trying to be judge, Juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case. I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting or gerrymandering, as some people know it. You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one- one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah. When I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah because and I think- and I think we have to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes, and I think- and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the President of the United States very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes. We're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different, but Democrats redistrict you know this, Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where- where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps. And we also need to make sure that if the President of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections, because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent- they have a Republican representative that they are actively being represented in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I think if you look at maps across the country, less than 10% of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature. Less than 10%. And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30% so that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes we are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute. Stay with us."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the U.S. economy. Mohamed El-Erian is the Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz, and he joins us this morning from Greenwich, Connecticut. Good morning to you.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we saw the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon, but he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So why then did the financial markets rally?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability, and the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side, and therefore an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system. Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth, and there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point, but it's a lot of uncertainty. Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if, basically, he's saying throw out your models?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent, and therefore he has tended to be late. Look, there is something promising in our future, and that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in AI in life sciences and robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds, and that includes high debt and high deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawe- Lawler just before you, and that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chip maker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE STARTS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:",
      "He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States. So we picked up $10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10% stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so, Margaret. Look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing, and that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what they are saying now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Which were paid back--",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back, but at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas. The most important distinction, if I may, here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10% but it must not control how this company manages its affair, because once we go down that road that is a really dangerous road, and that would eat away at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic, entrepreneurial economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the Commerce Secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for. I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve Chair, which you've nodded to, but the President is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her without publicly disclosed evidence of mortgage fraud and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell, encouraging her to be removed. Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So these allegations are unproven, and it's important to stress that. Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that has resulted in these four resignations. But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. And an independent central bank is critical to the well being of the economy, and there's lots of reasons for that. So you know, one has to disting- distinguish between the two. I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information, and is denying wrongdoing here. But just the fact that it is the President directing the attention towards her doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful, and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I- my fear and my concern is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mohamed El-Erian, thank you so much for sharing your insight today. We'll leave it there. We'll be back in a moment."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-utility-bills-are-rapidly-rising-in-some-states/",
    "published": "Sat, 23 Aug 2025 06:19:49 -0400",
    "summary": "Residential electricity rates are expected to increase by as much as 18% in the next few years, according to the Energy Information Administration.",
    "story": [
      "If you noticed your utility bill has gone up this summer, you're not alone. On average, electricity costs are 5.5% higher today than they were a year ago, according to the latest federal data, and natural gas is up 13.8%.",
      "Nearly 60 utility companies are set to increase electricity rates this year by more than $38 billion, affecting more than 57 million Americans, according to analysis from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.",
      "President Trump recently commented on the rising prices, blaming them on renewable power. He wrote on Truth Social that renewables were \"THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!\" And he vowed he would not approve wind and solar projects.",
      "But higher rates are largely a result of higher demand, and that's being driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence, oil and gas drilling, space heating and electrified forms of transportation \u2014 all technologies that require immense amounts of power, according to Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C. based energy consultancy firm, \"When supply is scarce, then prices go up,\" he said.",
      "Gramlich says that after 25 years of a flat demand for energy and a dip during the pandemic, demand rose once economic activity picked up after the pandemic was over.",
      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also played a role in higher costs, disrupting international energy supply chains and causing rates to go up in the U.S. Rapid growth in data centers and newer electrified forms of technology mean the nation will need 15% more capacity \u2014 or 120 gigawatts \u2014 by the end of the decade to keep pace, Gramlich estimated.",
      "The increasing demand is a big reason why the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u00a0expects residential electricity rates to increase steadily by as much as 18% in the next few years, far outstripping the annual inflation rate of about 2.7%.",
      "The fastest way to bring rates down would be to increase supply, but there are challenges.",
      "U.S. falling behind on transmission",
      "Gramlich, in recent testimony before Congress, said there's no shortage of fuel to add to the grid \u2014 it's a shortage of transmission that's the major problem.",
      "At the end of 2023, there were more than 2,600 gigawatts of energy waiting to get connected, representing over twice the current installed capacity of the U.S. power grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. And 95% of it was generated by solar, wind, and battery storage.",
      "To meet growing electricity needs, the U.S. needs to expand transmission systems by 60% by 2030, and even that may need to triple by 2050, according to a 2022 report by the Department of Energy.",
      "\"If we can get a lot of transmission built, then I think we can meet the AI-driven data center demands,\" Gramlich said.",
      "AI data centers consume far more power from the grid than regular data centers, says Norman Bashir, a fellow at MIT's Climate and Sustainability Consortium, where researchers are studying the impact of generative AI on the grid.",
      "\"AI data centers are much more power intensive,\" Bashir told CBS News Boston last month. \"So, if you have a normal data center, an AI data center would be up to 10 times more power intensive.\"",
      "Role of tariffs and equipment shortages",
      "Beyond the transmission backlog, Gramlich says tariffs and equipment shortages are making energy projects more expensive. One example \u2014 gas turbines are extremely scarce right now, and that's holding up the expansion of natural gas power plants.",
      "\"The price of an actual turbine has almost tripled,\" Gramlich said. And the wait time for a gas turbine is around three or four years \u2014 even as long as seven, according to a May\u00a0 analysis by S&P Global.",
      "Energy sources",
      "Over the past decade, the nation's energy mix has increasingly grown to favor natural gas and renewables, like wind, solar and hydropower, that have become much cheaper to produce. New nuclear plants won't be on line before 2030, Gramlich said, and coal is becoming less economically viable because of maintenance and update costs required to address pollution concerns.",
      "\"That leaves wind and solar and battery storage that can help in this decade,\" Gramlich told CBS News.",
      "But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels. Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.",
      "\"If things keep going like this, [utility bills] are gonna be higher next year,\" Gramlich said.",
      "Trump energy policies projected to raise prices",
      "Upon returning to office, Mr. Trump issued a \"National Energy Emergency\" executive order, arguing the country needs \"reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation's manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.\"",
      "Most of the actions tied to that order have gutted renewable energy generation and are bolstering fossil fuel development.",
      "The passage of Trump's signature legislation, One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to make energy more expensive, impact jobs, and make it more difficult to meet rising energy demand, according to analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank.",
      "OBBBA will change the tax code, increasing generation costs, resulting in a drop in power generation capacity of 340 gigawatts by 2035, says Michael O'Boyle, acting policy team director of Energy Innovation in an email to CBS News. To put that in perspective, 1 gigawatt typically powers 750,000 homes, so 340 gigawatts could power about 255 million homes.",
      "O'Boyle estimates wholesale energy prices will increase by 74% by 2035, resulting in a $170 annual increase in the average household energy bill. Some 760,000 jobs could be lost by 2030, and the states that are expected to see the biggest impacts on energy cost increases and job losses from the OBBBA are South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Kentucky and North Carolina.",
      "The Energy Department criticized the analysis and its support of renewables arguing, \"The OBBBA ensures taxpayers will no longer be forced to subsidize intermittent energy sources like wind and solar \u2013 subsidies that have only resulted in more expensive, less reliable energy,\" said Ben Dietderich, the department's press secretary and chief spokesman, in an email to CBS News.",
      "Ending Biden-era clean energy policies",
      "Since he returned to office, Mr. Trump has been dismantling Biden-era clean energy policies, resulting in the termination of more than $22 billion in renewable energy projects,\u00a0according to an analysis by the environmental policy firm E2.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the president and Congress is making it harder for Americans to have access to the cheapest, cleanest, quickest to deploy power there is,\" said Bob Keefe, E2's executive director.",
      "\"By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,\" Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. Grumet cited EIA data and noted, \"The top four clean energy states are seeing prices decline this year, while the 10 states with the least renewable power all face rising costs.\"",
      "Trump admin. keeping fossil fuel generation alive",
      "To address rising energy demand, the Energy Department has ordered some utility companies to keep coal power plants open beyond their retirement dates, an action that could cost more than $3.1 billion a year by 2028, according to analysis by Gramlich's firm, Grid Strategies.",
      "\"These coal plants are basically uneconomic in the market. Each year, they incur tens of millions of dollars of maintenance just to stay operating,\" said Gramlich.",
      "Those costs to extend the life of coal plants will be borne by ratepayers, according to a ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.",
      "Coal plants are generally planned for retirement when their operating cost exceeds their expected revenue or their value to the electric grid, the EIA\u00a0has pointed out. Coal-fired plants, which produce high levels of CO2 emissions, have been under pressure to be phased out in many states, in particular, those with clean energy goals. According to the EIA, natural gas and clean energy sources are providing a growing share of the nation's electricity, while coal has been waning. By the end of 2023, the maximum potential power plant output for coal was 15.2%, down from 45% in 1990.",
      "If additional fossil fuel-based plants delay retirement dates \u2014 28% were expected to be retired by 2035 \u2014 the bill to ratepayers could grow to more than $6 billion.",
      "Still, Energy Secretary Chris Wright supports the administration's efforts to keep fossil fuel generation online longer.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas,\" he said in a statement, upon releasing a report on the U.S. grid's reliability. \"If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.\"",

      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\"I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.\"",
      "In a social media post Friday afternoon, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the deal had been finalized, but did not elaborate.",
      "\"The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,\" Lutnick wrote. \"This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.\"",
      "Lutnick also thanked Tan \"for striking a deal that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "Intel confirmed the deal in a news release Friday evening which stated that the U.S. government would \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",
      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",

      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",

      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",

      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",

      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

      "Tucked away in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, more than 20 species at risk of extinction, including Mongolia's Przewalski's\u00a0horse, which disappeared from the wild at the end of the 1960s, live on the institute's\u00a0grounds. There are red pandas, maned wolves, and clouded leopards, to name a few more.",
      "The institute studies a species' reproduction, ecology, genetics, migration, and conservation sustainability, with the ultimate goals of saving wildlife from extinction and training future conservationalists. In certain cases, the scientists are responsible for breeding and reintroducing them to their habitats.",
      "But those who work to conserve these species and remove them from the endangered species list are still concerned with the rate at which species are vanishing.",
      "\"We're seeing species disappearing at 10, 100, to 1000 times the normal background rate,\" SCBI conservation biologist Melissa Songer\u00a0told CBS News.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature warned in early 2025 that 28%, or more than 47,000, of the world's assessed species are at risk of extinction. That number includes more than just animal species, showing crucial insect, plant and tree species are also threatened.",
      "\"So we think, okay, well, we're losing the species here and there, you know, there's a lot of other species,\" Songer says, \"but the thing is, that when we lose one species, it has cascading effects.\"",
      "A great example of this effect is with the black-footed ferret, which originally inhabited the North American Great Plains but has been endangered since 1967. While the species remains on the endangered list, its population has grown since preservation efforts began at the Institute.",
      "\"Every animal in the ecosystem is important for that ecosystem,\" says Adrienne Crosier, a cheetah biologist at SCBI, \"they all have a really important role to play.\"",

    "summary": "SpaceX hopes to pick up the pace with Super Heavy-Starship test flights amid concern the rocket may not be ready in time for a planned 2027 moon landing.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX\u00a0for a second day scrubbed the test launch of its huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to weather conditions.",
      "It was expected to be the program's 10th test flight on Monday, a milestone mission to put corrective upgrades through their paces after three catastrophic failures earlier this year.",
      "A successful flight would help restore confidence in the gargantuan rocket amid growing concern a\u00a0moon\u00a0lander variant being built for NASA may not be perfected in time for a planned 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese mount their own piloted moon mission at the end of the decade.",
      "But in the near term, SpaceX's goal was to get the Super Heavy-Starship flying again after multiple back-to-back failures.",
      "A launch attempt Sunday was called off because of trouble with a ground system at the company's Starbase flight test and manufacturing facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. But that problem was quickly corrected and blastoff was reset for 7:30 p.m. ET Monday.",
      "The goals of the flight were to test the Super Heavy first stage under a variety of stressful flight conditions, deliberately shutting engines down during descent to splashdown in the Gulf to make sure it can handle real failures during an actual mission.",
      "Given the nature of the tests, SpaceX ruled out a dramatic return to the launch pad for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms on the support gantry.",
      "As for the Starship, the flight plan called for sending the upper stage halfway around the world on a sub-orbital trajectory to a controlled re-entry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along the way, a variety of tests were planned, including the deployment of eight Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space restart of a methane-fueled Raptor engine. Modified heat shield tiles were in place and a few were even removed to determine the effects of extreme re-entry temperatures on the rocket's structure.",
      "Multiple upgrades also were in place to minimize the chances of propellant leaks, fires and engine shutdowns like those that led to the loss of the last three Starships launched, none of which was able to complete its mission.",
      "While a successful test flight this time around might ease concerns about the viability of the Super Heavy-Starship for future moon missions, it's unlikely to eliminate them.",
      "The moon lander variant will use most of its propellant just to reach low-Earth orbit. For a flight to the moon, SpaceX will have to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy-Starship tanker flights in rapid succession to top off the lander's tanks. A single failure would almost certainly require a mission restart.",
      "And even if SpaceX's achieves the required launch cadence, no one has ever attempted cryogenic propellant transfers on that scale in orbit.",
      "And there is no flight-proven technology to minimize, if not eliminate, the otherwise unavoidable loss of propellants as the super-cold liquids naturally warm in space, boiling off and turning into gas that must be vented overboard.",
      "Most observers believe SpaceX will eventually overcome the hurdles ahead. The question is, can the vehicle be perfected in time for a 2027 moon landing?",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, is optimistic SpaceX will be ready to fly.",
      "\"If you look at the company as a whole and past performance, they often times are behind, and then all of a sudden, they make these massive leaps forward,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"I would be hard pressed to say they're not going to meet the goals and the timelines.\"",
      "\"Their leadership has said we feel very confident that we are going to be ready for the mission,\" he said. \"And so I'll take them at their word.\"",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current architecture.",
      "And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" said a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program.",
      "\"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",
      "But as Duffy pointed out, SpaceX has chalked up a remarkable record with its partially reusable Falcon family of rockets, launching them at an unmatched pace that allows the company to rapidly implement and test upgrades and fixes.",
      "As of Friday, SpaceX had launched 518 Falcon 9s and 11 triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets with just two in-flight failures. The company has successfully recovered first-stage boosters 490 times.",
      "Given its record, many fans give SpaceX the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Super Heavy-Starship. But the giant rocket dwarfs the Falcon 9, and the requirements for a successful moon landing are well beyond those faced in a typical satellite launcher.",
      "\"My concerns have to do with how complicated the mission architecture is, how many flights there are to send a single lander to the moon,\" said Douglas Cooke, a retired 38-year NASA veteran who now does consulting work for Boeing and other aerospace concerns.",
      "\"Getting into the high numbers,\" he added, \"reduces the probability of success.\"",

      "Test flight No. 10 was expected to get underway at 7:30 p.m. ET from SpaceX's Starbase flight and manufacturing facility and the team was in the process of pumping liquid oxygen and methane fuel into the 40-story-tall rocket when the company announced a scrub.",
      "\"Standing down from today's tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,\" the company said on X. SpaceX later announced that another hour-long launch window would open at 7:30 p.m. EDT Monday.",
      "The flight plan had called for the 30-foot wide, 230-foot tall Super Heavy booster, generating more than 16 million pounds of thrust, to propel the Starship out of the dense lower atmosphere before it would fall away, flip around and head back toward the coast.",
      "During three of the nine previous test flights, the booster flew itself all the way back to its launch pad where giant mechanical arms on the service gantry plucked the descending rocket out of midair. This time around, because of the planned tests, the Super Heavy was expected to descend to splashdown in the Gulf, but it never took off.",
      "SpaceX previously said the primary objectives for the booster test was focused on its landing burn. One of the three center engines used for the final phase of landing was going to be \"intentionally disabled to gather data on the ability for a backup engine from the middle ring to complete a landing burn,\" the company said on its website.",
      "The booster was then going to use two engines toward the end of the descent and hover briefly before dropping to the Gulf.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship, meanwhile, powered by six Raptor engines of its own, would have headed for a suborbital trajectory carrying it halfway around the world before a belly-first reentry, a flip back to vertical and a rocket-powered descent to splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along with deploying eight Starlink simulator satellites, the Starship's flight computer had planned to attempt a variety of other tests, including an in-space engine restart, to verify the performance of numerous upgrades implemented in the wake of the most recent test flight failures.",
      "Working the bugs out of the giant launcher is critical to SpaceX and founder Elon Musk, who designed the ultra-heavy-lift rocket to launch thousands of next-generation Starlinks and other satellites in Earth's orbit and to one day carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The rocket also is critical to NASA, which is paying SpaceX more than $3 billion to develop a modified version of the Starship upper stage to carry Artemis astronauts to the surface of the moon in 2027.",
      "But that flight will require 10 to 20 Super Heavy-Starship flights just to refuel the \"Human Landing System,\" or HLS, lander before it can head to the moon. Transferring thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid nitrogen and oxygen in space has never been attempted.",
      "And it is still not known how SpaceX plans to control propellant temperatures to minimize the amount that will naturally warm up and turn into a gas, which must be vented overboard. SpaceX has provided no details. Musk promised pre-launch update Sunday on the company's plans going forward, but the talk was also canceled with no explanation.",
      "Given the number of flights that must be successfully executed to demonstrate the reliability NASA will expect, the 2027 target date for the Artemis 3 moon landing is considered unrealistic, if not impossible to meet, by many aerospace observers.",
      "China plans to launch its own astronauts on the moon by 2030. It is unclear at this point whether NASA and SpaceX will get back to the moon using the Starship lander before the Chinese plant their own flag on the lunar surface.",
      "Given the sheer size and power of the Super Heavy-Starship \u2014 it has more than twice the thrust of NASA's current Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket \u2014 technical problems during development were not unexpected.",
      "But given the short time between now and NASA's first planned Artemis moon landing, the problems have clearly set the program back and cast doubt on the overall mission architecture, especially the requirement for 10 to 20 problem-free flights in short order just to fuel the lander for its flight to the moon.",
      "The first three test flights of the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage in 2023 and 2024 ended in catastrophic failures with both stages destroyed, either while still attached to each other or after separation.",
      "The fourth flight in June 2024 was generally successful with the Super Heavy flying itself back to a controlled splashdown in the Gulf while the Starship followed the planned sub-orbital trajectory to splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The ship's fins were damaged by reentry heating, but otherwise worked as required.",
      "The fifth flight in October 2024 was highlighted by a successful Super Heavy return to the launch pad gantry where giant mechanical arms snagged the rocket in mid air. The Starship, meanwhile, managed a second controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean although it again suffered fin damage during reentry.",
      "During the sixth integrated flight test in November 2024, the Super Heavy attempted another return to the launch site but it was diverted to a Gulf splashdown because of launch damage to critical sensors in the pad's capture mechanism. The Starship again flew itself to a controlled Indian Ocean splashdown with minimal flap damage.",
      "But the next three flights, in January, March and May of this year, ended with catastrophic failures. Two Super Heavy boosters successfully returned to the launch site, but the most recent broke up over the Gulf while testing a high angle-of-attack entry.",
      "All three Starships were destroyed after catastrophic malfunctions, including two propellant leaks, an on-board fire and multiple engine failures.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Aug 2025 01:01:00 -0400",
    "summary": "During its secretive mission, the X-37B will test new laser communications gear and a \"quantum\" navigation sensor.",
    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off late Thursday, propelling a reusable X-37B Space Force rocket plane into space on a classified long-duration mission. It was the eighth such flight since the program's debut in 2010 and the first since a 434-day mission ended last March.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 roared away from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 11:50 p.m. EDT, arcing onto a northeasterly trajectory atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust from the booster's nine first-stage engines.",
      "After the spacecraft climbed out of the lower atmosphere, the engines shut down, the first stage fell away, flipped around and re-ignited three engines to reverse course and head back to Florida. Heralded by an attention-getting sonic boom, the booster landed at the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to wrap up its sixth flight.",
      "It was SpaceX's 66th booster landing in Florida and the company's 490th successful recovery overall.",
      "As usual with classified Space Force missions, SpaceX ended its launch commentary with the first stage landing and offered no information about the Falcon 9's second stage climb to orbit, when the Boeing-built X-37B was to be released to fly on its own, or any details about its orbit.",
      "The seven previous X-37B missions -- three by the orbiter launched Thursday and four by a twin sister ship -- all carried out long-duration missions ranging from 224 days to nearly 909 days. It's not known how long the X-37B launched Thursday will remain in orbit.",
      "While the flights are generally classified, Space Force and Boeing officials publicly discussed two of the payloads on board.",
      "One  will test high-speed, tightly-targeted laser communications between the  X-37B and small data relay satellites making up a growing  \"proliferated\" space-based communications system.",
      "The tests \"will mark an important step in the U.S. Space Force's  ability to leverage proliferated space networks as part of a diversified  and redundant space architecture,\" said Gen. Chance Saltzman, director of space operations for the U.S. Space Force.",
      "\"In so doing, it will strengthen the resilience, reliability, adaptability and data transport speeds of our satellite communications architecture.\"",
      "The other publicly disclosed payload is a sophisticated quantum navigation sensor designed to determine a spacecraft's precise position in space by \"detecting rotation and acceleration of atoms without reliance on satellite networks like traditional GPS,\" the Space Force said in an on-line description.",
      "\"Whether navigating beyond Earth-based orbits in cislunar space or operating in GPS-denied environments, quantum inertial sensing allows for robust navigation capabilities when GPS navigation is not possible,\" said Space Delta 9 commander Col. Ramsey Horn.",
      "\"Ultimately, this technology contributes significantly to our thrust within the Fifth Space Operations Squadron and across the Space Force guaranteeing movement and maneuverability even in GPS-denied environments.\"",
      "Clad in black heat shield tiles and white insulation blankets, the unpiloted X-37B resembles a mini space shuttle with stubby delta wings and two tail fins extending from either side of the rear of the fuselage. It can be launched atop SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets or United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 and Vulcan boosters.",
      "Two virtually identical X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles, or OTVs, are operated by the Pentagon's Rapid Capabilities Office for the U.S. Space Force. The vehicles are designed to serve as test beds for avionics and advanced sensors, to evaluate reusable spacecraft components and to provide a platform for experiments that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Powered by solar cells and batteries, the orbiters feature a small payload bay similar to a space shuttle's that can accommodate a variety of sensors and experiment packages.",
      "The compact spacecraft are designed to end their missions with runway landings at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California or the Kennedy Space Center in Florida using 3-mile-long runways originally built for the space shuttle.",
      "The most recent flight of an X-37B began with a\u00a0launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on Dec. 29, 2023. It ended last March 7, with touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center after 434 days and six hours in space. Going into Thursday's mission, the two X-37Bs had logged a combined 11-and-a-half years in space across seven flights.",

    "summary": "CBS News documented dozens of swastikas and at least a dozen instances of hate speech targeting minority groups across Spray Paint! Servers.",
    "story": [
      "Editor's note: This article contains descriptions and an image of hate speech found on the Roblox servers and might be triggering to some readers.",
      "In Roblox, one of the world's largest online gaming platforms, users join to play, create, and be themselves in a virtual world \u2014 but some might be there for a more insidious purpose: to expose youth to hate speech.",
      "Players of \"Spray Paint!\" \u2014 a popular game on Roblox, with over a billion visits, in which players skate and create graffiti art in a virtual skatepark setting \u2014 can bypass moderation by spray painting hate messages across walls, ramps and other virtual game settings, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "CBS News documented dozens of swastikas and at least a dozen instances of hate speech targeting minority groups across Spray Paint! servers, which host multiplayer games. There are millions of games on Roblox where players can join servers to play with friends and strangers.",
      "What's happening in \"Spray Paint!\" is not uncommon \u2014 nor surprising. Roblox currently has at least 18 active lawsuits pending nationwide due to inappropriate content found on its games, attorney Matthew Dolman, whose firm is representing individuals in cases against Roblox, told CBS News.",
      "Roblox said in an emailed statement to CBS News that its 24/7 moderation system closely monitors the platform, and that the company takes \"swift action against any content or users found to be in violation.\"",
      "However, hate speech still appears in Roblox games, like Spray Paint, CBS News found. \"Within three minutes of getting in there for the first time, I also saw a swastika,\" said Rachel Franz, the early childhood advocacy program director at the nonprofit Fairplay, which advocates for children's online safety.",
      "Hate can run rampant across various Roblox games. A group called Active Shooter Studios recreates school shootings at Columbine, Uvalde and Parkland and consistently evades efforts to take down recreations, the Anti-Defamation League found in an April report. A lawsuit filed this month alleges that Roblox hosted hundreds of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs-themed games, as well as more than 900 user accounts registered across Roblox with variations of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's name.",
      "\"Roblox is fully aware that these experiences pervade its app, and it allows them to continue to exist unchecked despite the ability to control or eliminate them,\" the lawsuit alleges, and said the effects on children can be devastating.",
      "Last week, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill filed a child protection lawsuit against the platform.",
      "\"Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,\" Murrill, a Republican, alleged in a press release. \"Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Roblox said, \"We share Attorney General Murrill's urgency to help keep kids safe because safety has always been our priority,\" adding that it looks forward to working with Murrill to help keep children safe.",
      "\"We share the critically important goal of keeping kids safe online and any assertion otherwise is categorically untrue,\" Roblox's statement said. \"We hold ourselves to the highest standard and work constantly to remove violative content and bad actors.\"",
      "What children are encountering",
      "Predators can troll Roblox, experts say, and other similar gaming platforms, to recruit young players for extremist groups or possibly sexual exploitation.",
      "Children and teens make up more than half of Roblox players, and about 40% of players are under the age of 13, according to a 2024 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Roblox attracts an average of 97.8 million daily active users.",
      "\"If you are a predator, it's very clear that there are opportunities to access vulnerable folks on these platforms,\" Franz said.",
      "When children play the Spray Paint! game, they might see slurs targeting Black and Jewish people and phrases like \"KKK\" and \"Jew\" etched in graffiti on virtual brick walls. In one server, there were over 14 instances of this speech, CBS News found, as well as a reference to the \"Third Reich.\"",
      "The phrase \"I can't breathe,\" the words uttered by George Floyd, who died in 2020 in police custody by an officer later convicted of murder, was written across a virtual brick wall in one server. Some servers had graphic sexual drawings, and in another, there was an instance of suicidal language, CBS News found.",
      "Roblox's chat feature, available in some games, has a filtering system that prevents inappropriate content, like discriminatory speech, from being visible, but in Spray Paint! players can bypass filtering mechanisms by scrawling text via the game's paint feature as opposed to writing in the chat, where content is filtered.",
      "Users must enter their birthday when creating a Roblox account, but the platform doesn't require authentication, meaning adults can pose as children and children can pose as older than they actually are. Kids can converse with other players via the voice chat feature \u2014 which has a minimum age requirement of 13 \u2014but also doesn't require age verification.",
      "Roblox says the company has implemented what it calls a \"trusted flagger program,\" where trusted partners can report \"terrorist content\" in an effort to crack down on hate messages.",
      "Roblox also says on its website that content uploaded to be incorporated into games is evaluated in a multi-step review process to screen for child sexual abuse material and other inappropriate content. If it is identified as fodder for possible child sexual abuse, Roblox says it is automatically reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit organization focusing on finding missing children and reducing child exploitation.",
      "Roblox has developed an artificial intelligence system that the company says helped submit about 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to NCMEC \u2014 and last year, Roblox submitted 24,522 reports to NCMEC overall.",
      "Roblox says it has a human review team continuously evaluating flagged games and encourages users to report concerning activity. Spray Paint! players have the option to play in \"safe mode,\" which allows them to only view art created by other players who are on their \"friends\" list in the app.",
      "A Roblox spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement that \"while no system is perfect,\" the company has implemented safeguards including \"restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, as well as content maturity [l]abels and parental controls.\"",
      "\"We share with our community the critically important goal of keeping everyone safe online and ensuring users have positive experiences on Roblox that align with our strict Community Standards,\" the statement said, adding, \"We continuously innovate to deter bad actors and have launched over 50 safety features since last year.\"",
      "Despite efforts to curb extremism and the targeting of young players, experts and CBS News found that protections remain easy to override.",
      "\"There's a larger question of how you regulate and moderate something that is supposed to encourage creativity and freedom of expression, but actually ends up introducing some really unsafe and truly harmful and disgusting practices,\" Franz said.",
      "A double-edged sword",
      "Allegations in several cases suggest Roblox has also been used to exploit teens and children. A Florida teenager was arrested\u00a0in April for allegedly targeting children on Roblox, where he would demand child sexual abuse material over text messages or the messaging platform Discord. In Texas, a lawsuit filed in April alleges a 13-year-old girl was groomed and sexually exploited on Roblox and later, Discord. Roblox has recently been hit by a spate of lawsuits with similar claims. Dolman said his firm currently has seven cases and is investigating 400 more. Another firm filed a lawsuit earlier this month against Roblox and Discord representing over 400 people.",
      "A man in California was arrested\u00a0in April on kidnapping and sexual misconduct charges in connection with a 10-year-old he is believed to have met through Roblox. Last year, a woman in Florida was arrested for allegedly using Roblox to instruct a 10-year-old to kill an infant by dropping the 2-month-old on a tile floor. The infant was seriously injured.",
      "When asked for a response to the lawsuits, Roblox said in an email that the company is \"deeply troubled\" by any incident that endangers its users, noting that safety is a top priority.",
      "\"Roblox is committed to empowering parents and caregivers to help ensure a safe online experience for their children.\"",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced in April that he issued a subpoena to Roblox.",
      "\"There are concerning reports that this gaming platform, which is popular among children, is exposing them to harmful content and bad actors,\" he said in a press release. \"We are issuing a subpoena to Roblox to uncover how this platform is marketing to children and to see what policies they are implementing\u2014if any\u2014to avoid interactions with predators.\"",
      "Open-world games like Spray Paint!, where users can roam a virtual space in relative anonymity, can be a double-edged sword. Doris Chang, a psychologist and associate professor at New York University's Silver School of Social Work, says that these spaces can be affirming for queer youth.",
      "\"They can be whoever they want. Gender fluidity is really common,\" Chang said, adding it can also put those groups at risk for exposure to hate speech and predatory individuals.",
      "\"You're just interacting with people that you wouldn't normally interact with. It's completely wide open,\" Chang said.",
      "Chang said when children play a game like Spray Paint! without parental supervision, they may have to navigate problematic scenarios that might be confusing or upsetting.",
      "\"It brings up the larger question about how much parents know about what their kids are getting exposed to online,\" she said. \"Broadly speaking, Roblox is just one corner of the internet that our kids are navigating.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Aug 2025 08:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Tommy Fello struggled to regain function after a stroke affected the left side of his body. A new technology is making a difference.",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Tommy Fello was driving from his Ohio establishment to his house on Christmas Eve when he started veering off the road. Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.",
      "But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance.",
      "\"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering,\" Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg.",
      "\"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything,\" Fello said.",
      "A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements.",
      "Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.",
      "\"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore,\" Fello said. \"We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'\"",
      "A \"first-of-its-kind technology\"",
      "One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the Vivistim System. The FDA-approved implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They regulate the body's involuntary functions.",
      "The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises.",
      "Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in \"greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors,\" Nossek said in emailed remarks.",
      "\"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use,\" Nossek said. \"This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population.\"",
      "A 108-person trial\u00a0published in The Lancet in 2021\u00a0found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have \"moderate to severe deficits\" qualify for the device, the company\u00a0said in a fact sheet.",
      "Implant aids in recovery",
      "Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025.",
      "\"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked,\" Fello said.",
      "The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with \"less than 1% chance of any complications.\" Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey.",
      "Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't \"something he could have done before.\" Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.",
      "\"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it,\" he said.",
      "\"The sky's the limit\"",
      "About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and other new technologies may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said.",
      "\"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back,\" Bain said. \"In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery.\"",
      "At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but shared a map that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy.",
      "\"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back,\" Covey said. \"This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down.\"",

    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was taken into custody Monday by immigration authorities and the Department of Homeland Security said he is being processed for deportation to Uganda.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Kilmar Abrego Garcia is being processed for deportation to Uganda, the Department of Homeland Security said, after he was taken into custody Monday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, days after his release from criminal custody.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was mistakenly deported to his home country in March and held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months before being returned to the U.S. in June where he was jailed on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.",
      "Abrego Garcia was freed from pretrial detention last Friday. CBS News reported on Saturday that his attorneys were then sent a court-required notice of his potential\u00a0deportation to Uganda. He arrived at the ICE facility on Monday morning to check in, speaking in Spanish to supporters who had gathered in a show of support outside of the facility.",
      "\"There was no need for them to take him into ICE detention. He was already on electronic monitoring from the U.S. Marshals Service and basically on house arrest,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights.\"",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg filed a new lawsuit on Abrego Garcia's behalf on Monday challenging his confinement and deportation to any country \"unless and until he had a fair trial in an immigration court.\"",
      "The U.S. district court in Maryland soon issued an order preventing the government from immediately removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S. or altering his legal status, meaning his deportation is on hold for now. The court has issued the standing order in all cases involving migrant detainees challenging the legality of their detentions in recent months, a move the Justice Department is challenging as unlawful.",
      "Judge Paula Xinis, who is assigned to the case, held a hearing on Abrego Garcia's new suit on Monday. She issued an oral order preventing the Trump administration from moving Abrego Garcia from the ICE facility in Virginia where he is now being held.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security claims Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, which his family denies.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said\u00a0in a statement that ICE had arrested Abrego Garcia and was \"processing him for deportation.\" DHS said he is \"being processed for removal to Uganda.\" The U.S. reached an agreement with Uganda to accept some deportees last week.",
      "\"President Trump is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator to terrorize American citizens any longer,\" Noem said.",
      "In a legal filing over the weekend, Abrego Garcia's lawyers said he was offered a plea deal that included deportation to Costa Rica. His legal team said they then received a notice of his possible deportation to Uganda. Sandoval-Moshenberg clarified Monday that Abrego Garcia had stated that he was willing to accept refugee status in Costa Rica.",
      "\"The fact that they're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick to try to coerce him to plead guilty to a crime is such clear evidence that they're weaponizing the immigration system in a manner that is completely unconstitutional,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said Monday.",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat who traveled to El Salvador to advocate for the return of Abrego Garcia earlier this year, met with him Sunday. Van Hollen said in a statement that he was glad to \"welcome him back to Maryland after what has been a long and torturous nightmare.\"",
      "\"The federal courts and public outcry forced the Administration to bring \u00c1brego Garc\u00eda back to Maryland, but Trump's cronies continue to lie about the facts in his case and they are engaged in a malicious abuse of power as they threaten to deport him to Uganda \u2014 to block his chance to defend himself against the new charges they brought,\" Van Hollen said. \"As I told Kilmar and his wife Jennifer, we will stay in this fight for justice and due process because if his rights are denied, the rights of everyone else are put at risk.\"",
      "An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that Abrego Garcia may not be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country.",
      "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore advocated for due process for Abrego Garcia on Sunday, saying on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that \"I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case.\"",

    "summary": "SpaceX hopes to pick up the pace with Super Heavy-Starship test flights amid concern the rocket may not be ready in time for a planned 2027 moon landing.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX\u00a0for a second day scrubbed the test launch of its huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to weather conditions.",
      "It was expected to be the program's 10th test flight on Monday, a milestone mission to put corrective upgrades through their paces after three catastrophic failures earlier this year.",
      "A successful flight would help restore confidence in the gargantuan rocket amid growing concern a\u00a0moon\u00a0lander variant being built for NASA may not be perfected in time for a planned 2027 landing and possibly not before the Chinese mount their own piloted moon mission at the end of the decade.",
      "But in the near term, SpaceX's goal was to get the Super Heavy-Starship flying again after multiple back-to-back failures.",
      "A launch attempt Sunday was called off because of trouble with a ground system at the company's Starbase flight test and manufacturing facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. But that problem was quickly corrected and blastoff was reset for 7:30 p.m. ET Monday.",
      "The goals of the flight were to test the Super Heavy first stage under a variety of stressful flight conditions, deliberately shutting engines down during descent to splashdown in the Gulf to make sure it can handle real failures during an actual mission.",
      "Given the nature of the tests, SpaceX ruled out a dramatic return to the launch pad for a mid-air capture by giant mechanical arms on the support gantry.",
      "As for the Starship, the flight plan called for sending the upper stage halfway around the world on a sub-orbital trajectory to a controlled re-entry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along the way, a variety of tests were planned, including the deployment of eight Starlink simulator satellites and an in-space restart of a methane-fueled Raptor engine. Modified heat shield tiles were in place and a few were even removed to determine the effects of extreme re-entry temperatures on the rocket's structure.",
      "Multiple upgrades also were in place to minimize the chances of propellant leaks, fires and engine shutdowns like those that led to the loss of the last three Starships launched, none of which was able to complete its mission.",
      "While a successful test flight this time around might ease concerns about the viability of the Super Heavy-Starship for future moon missions, it's unlikely to eliminate them.",
      "The moon lander variant will use most of its propellant just to reach low-Earth orbit. For a flight to the moon, SpaceX will have to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy-Starship tanker flights in rapid succession to top off the lander's tanks. A single failure would almost certainly require a mission restart.",
      "And even if SpaceX's achieves the required launch cadence, no one has ever attempted cryogenic propellant transfers on that scale in orbit.",
      "And there is no flight-proven technology to minimize, if not eliminate, the otherwise unavoidable loss of propellants as the super-cold liquids naturally warm in space, boiling off and turning into gas that must be vented overboard.",
      "Most observers believe SpaceX will eventually overcome the hurdles ahead. The question is, can the vehicle be perfected in time for a 2027 moon landing?",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, NASA's acting administrator, is optimistic SpaceX will be ready to fly.",
      "\"If you look at the company as a whole and past performance, they often times are behind, and then all of a sudden, they make these massive leaps forward,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"I would be hard pressed to say they're not going to meet the goals and the timelines.\"",
      "\"Their leadership has said we feel very confident that we are going to be ready for the mission,\" he said. \"And so I'll take them at their word.\"",
      "CBS News interviewed multiple current and former NASA and contractor managers and engineers in recent weeks who unanimously agreed a landing in 2027 could not be safely carried out with the current architecture.",
      "And not one of them said they believed NASA could get there before the Chinese without a drastic change of course.",
      "\"I think the folks you've talked to are accurate. We are not going to go ahead and get a crewed Starship to the moon by 2030, under any circumstances,\" said a senior engineer who worked on the Artemis program.",
      "\"That doesn't mean they'll never get there. That doesn't mean the architecture couldn't work. But it's just too big of a technical leap to accomplish in the short time that we've got.\"",
      "But as Duffy pointed out, SpaceX has chalked up a remarkable record with its partially reusable Falcon family of rockets, launching them at an unmatched pace that allows the company to rapidly implement and test upgrades and fixes.",
      "As of Friday, SpaceX had launched 518 Falcon 9s and 11 triple-core Falcon Heavy rockets with just two in-flight failures. The company has successfully recovered first-stage boosters 490 times.",
      "Given its record, many fans give SpaceX the benefit of the doubt when it comes to the Super Heavy-Starship. But the giant rocket dwarfs the Falcon 9, and the requirements for a successful moon landing are well beyond those faced in a typical satellite launcher.",
      "\"My concerns have to do with how complicated the mission architecture is, how many flights there are to send a single lander to the moon,\" said Douglas Cooke, a retired 38-year NASA veteran who now does consulting work for Boeing and other aerospace concerns.",
      "\"Getting into the high numbers,\" he added, \"reduces the probability of success.\"",

      "Some of the allegations accusing Apple of trying to shield the iPhone from do-everything \"super apps,\" such as the one Musk has long been trying to create with X, echo an antitrust lawsuit filed against Apple last year by the U.S. Department of Justice.",
      "The complaint casts OpenAI as a threat to humanity bent on putting profits before public safety as it tries to build on its phenomenal growth since the late 2022 release of ChatGPT. The depiction mirrors one already being drawn in another federal lawsuit that Musk filed last year, alleging OpenAI had betrayed its founding mission to serve as a nonprofit research lab for the public good.",
      "OpenAI has countered with a lawsuit against Musk accusing him of harassment \u2014 an allegation that the company cited in its response to Monday's antitrust lawsuit. \"This latest filing is consistent with Mr. Musk's ongoing pattern of harassment,\" OpenAI said in a statement.",
      "Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The crux of the lawsuit revolves around Apple's decision to use ChatGPT as an AI-powered \"answer engine\" on the iPhone when the built-in technology on its device couldn't satisfy user needs. The partnership announced last year was part of Apple's late entry into the AI race that was supposed to be powered mostly by its own on-device technology, but the company still hasn't been able to deliver on all its promises.",
      "Apple's own AI shortcomings may be helping drive more usage of ChatGPT on the iPhone, providing OpenAI with invaluable data that's unavailable to Grok and other would-be competitors because it's currently an exclusive partnership.",
      "The alliance has provided Apple with an incentive to improperly elevate ChatGPT in the AI rankings of the iPhone's app store, the lawsuit alleges. Other AI apps from DeekSeek and Perplexity have periodically reached the top spot in the Apple app store's AI rankings in at least some parts of the world since Apple announced its deal with ChatGPT.",
      "The lawsuit doesn't mention the potential threat that ChatGPT could also pose to Apple and the iPhone's future popularity. As part of its expansion efforts, OpenAI recruited former Apple designer Jony Ive to oversee a project aimed at building an AI-powered device that many analysts believe could eventually mount a challenge to the iPhone.",

    "summary": "Unable to find buyers, a growing number of sellers are pulling their homes off the market rather than compromise on price.",
    "story": [
      "In a sign of homesellers' frustration with how long it's taking to sell their properties,\u00a0more owners are opting to pull their homes off the market rather than lower the asking price.",
      "That's according to a recent\u00a0report from Realtor.com finding that so-called delistings, or homes taken off the market without having been sold, were up 38% in June since the start of 2025 and 48% from a year ago.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer sellers are deciding to enter the market, and increasingly more are deciding to jump out,\" Jake Krimmel, senior economist at Realtor.com told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Signs of deadlock",
      "One indicator that more sellers are exiting the housing market is the ratio between the number of delistings and listings. For every 100 new homes listed nationally in June, 21 homes were taken off the market, the report found. That's up from 13 delisted homes per 100 new listings in May.",
      "A steady rise in delistings could push buyers and sellers further apart, creating a deadlock in the housing market, according to Krimmel.",
      "\"The thing that's going to prevent buyers and sellers from getting closer together is if all the sellers who maybe could or should be lowering their prices to meet the demand where it is are instead taking their homes off the market altogether,\" he said. \"So it's kind of like keeping us in this holding pattern.\"",
      "The trend comes as the supply of homes for sale begins to grow in certain U.S. regions, causing prices in those areas to drop. The number of homes for sale in July surged nearly 25% from a year ago, a post-pandemic high. according to Realtor.com.",
      "Despite the rise in housing inventory, home sales around the U.S. remain relatively stagnant, with steep prices and high mortgage rates continuing to deter many would-be homebuyers, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Realtor.com data shows that pending home sales, or listings under contract, in July fell 3% in compared with the same period last year.",
      "No hurry to sell",
      "When homeowners are eager to sell a property, they typically lower the price in order to offload it quicker. However, those who are not up against the same type of time constraints may be willing to wait it out longer \u2014 especially if they're benefiting from a favorable mortgage rate.",
      "\"Maybe you're locked into payments that are relatively affordable for you,\" Krimmel said. \"You would prefer to sell, but not at a price that you're not comfortable with.\"",
      "Another factor is playing into the delisting trend, experts said \u2014 the surge in housing prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the housing market was red hot. As newly remote workers flocked to areas like Austin, Texas, home prices rose at\u00a0record levels, giving sellers a chance to cash in.",
      "While the market has since cooled substantially, sellers' pricing expectations have been slower to catch up.",
      "\"Maybe we've gotten a bit spoiled by very high home prices over the last many years, but we are seeing some softness in the market right now,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That may not be true in all markets, however. Miami is one of the places where sellers have been least willing to budge on price. According to Realtor.com's analysis, 59 homes were delisted for every 100 new homes listed in the southern Florida city \u2014 the highest ratio among the cities Realtor.com tracked. Meanwhile, less than 18% of listed homes in Miami came with a price reduction in July, according to Realtor.com.",
      "\"If sellers are choosing to take properties off the market rather than lower prices, it may signal renewed confidence in Miami's future, and a growing belief that this is a market worth holding for the long haul,\" Ana Bozovic, a Miami-based real estate agent and founder of Analytics Miami, told Realtor.com.",

At the center of the coffee giant's fall offerings is its Pumpkin Spice Latte, which came onto the scene over 20 years ago. According to a company spokesperson, the PSL, which consists of espresso, steamed milk cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin, whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice, is the most popular seasonal beverage of all time. Starbucks has sold hundreds of millions of the autumnal concoction since the beverage was introduced in 2003.",
      "\"Obviously, I'm excited for the fall program,\" Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said during the coffee chain's July 29 earnings call. \"I, like many customers, love the Pumpkin Spice Latte.\"",
      "The coffee giant is also banking on sales from newcomers like Pecan Cold Foam, after\u00a0launching\u00a0a similar menu item last year.

      "Washington \u2014 The Republican leader of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has issued a subpoena to the estate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein seeking documents and other material as part of its ongoing examination of the government's investigation into Epstein.",
      "The subpoena issued by Rep. James Comer of Kentucky demands the co-executors of Epstein's estate turn over to the House committee more than a dozen categories of documents and communications, including material from 1990 through August 2019 that references all presidents and vice presidents, videos taken from Epstein's properties and listings in his contact and address books.",
      "Lawmakers are also seeking entries contained within a leather-bound book put together by Epstein's longtime associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, for his 50th birthday, the 2008 non-prosecution agreement reached with the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Southern District of Florida and Epstein's will.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported last month that President Trump had allegedly signed a \"bawdy\" letter to Epstein in the early 2000s to mark his 50th birthday that said, in part, \"may every day be another wonderful secret.\" The Journal reported that the leather-bound book was compiled by Maxwell and included submissions from dozens of associates, including billionaire Leslie Wexner attorney Alan Dershowitz and Mr. Trump.",
      "The president called the letter reported by the Journal \"fake\" and filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper, its parent company and media mogul Rupert Murdoch over the story, seeking at least $20 billion in damages.",
      "In a letter to the co-executors of Epstein's estate, Comer wrote that \"it is our understanding that the estate is ready and willing to provide these documents to the Committee pursuant to a subpoena.\" He set a Sept. 8 deadline for the documents to be turned over to House investigators.",
      "\"Recent reporting indicates the estate of Mr. Epstein has access to documents relevant to the Committee's investigation, including the alleged 'birthday book' prepared for Mr. Epstein by Ms. Maxwell,\" he wrote. \"The attached subpoena is meant to bolster the amount of information available to the Committee so that it may conduct its work. It is imperative that Congress conduct oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell.\"",
      "In addition to issuing the subpoena, Comer announced that Alex Acosta, who was serving as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida when Epstein was investigated, will voluntarily answer questions from the committee on Sept. 19.",
      "Acosta was the top federal prosecutor in South Florida when federal authorities investigated Epstein in the 2000s and entered into a non-prosecution agreement that allowed him to avoid federal prosecution and plead guilty to state prostitution charges. Acosta went on to serve as secretary of labor during Mr. Trump's first term, but resigned in 2019 amid questions about his handling of the Epstein case.",
      "As part of its investigation into the federal probe into Epstein, the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas for depositions earlier this month to former attorneys general and FBI directors across four presidential administrations, as well as to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
      "Comer said the committee would accept formal written declarations from three former attorneys general, Alberto Gonzales, Eric Holder and Jeff Sessions. Acosta was not among the officials from whom the Oversight Committee initially sought testimony.",
      "The panel also issued a subpoena to Attorney General Pam Bondi for documents related to the Justice Department's investigation into Epstein and Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping him recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence, but has appealed her conviction to the Supreme Court.",
      "The Justice Department sent the first tranche of files related to Epstein to Congress last week, and the Oversight Committee plans to make the records public, though victims' identification and child sexual abuse material will be redacted, a spokesperson said.",
      "The renewed focus on Epstein's case and the government's handling of it was sparked by a Justice Department memo issued in July that said there was no \"client list\" or evidence that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures. The Trump administration said it would not disclose any additional information about Epstein, which led to a backlash from some of the president's allies.",
      "In response, the Justice Department asked federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell's cases. U.S. District Judge Richard Berman denied last week the request to make the material from Epstein's proceedings public, finding that the government is the \"logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein File.\"",
      "Separately, the administration released transcripts of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with Maxwell that was conducted in Tallahassee last month.",

      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",

      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million, down from $99 million in 2023.",

      "The attorney general, Mr. Trump's executive order states, \"shall vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the American Flag, and may pursue litigation to clarify the scope of the First Amendment exceptions in this area.\"",
      "Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in response to Mr. Trump's executive order that the president does not have the power to change the First Amendment.",
      "\"Flag burning as a form of political protest is protected by the First Amendment. That's nothing new. While people can be prosecuted for burning anything in a place they aren't allowed to set fires, the government can't prosecute protected expressive activity \u2014 even if many Americans, including the president, find it 'uniquely offensive and provocative,'\" he said in a statement. \"You don't have to like flag burning. You can condemn it, debate it, or hoist your own flag even higher. The beauty of free speech is that you get to express your opinions, even if others don't like what you have to say.\"",
      "Is flag burning protected by the First Amendment?",
      "The president's directive appears aimed at re-opening the question in the courts of whether flag burning is constitutionally protected speech. While Mr. Trump believes that it should be illegal to burn the American flag and sought to unilaterally target those who engage in this conduct, the Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the act is expressive conduct covered by the First Amendment.",
      "The 5-4 decision in the landmark case Texas v. Johnson arose from Gregory Lee Johnson's conviction under a Texas law that prohibited desecration of a venerated object. Johnson had burned an American flag outside of Dallas City Hall in protest of then-President Ronald Reagan's policies in 1984. He was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $2,000.",
      "But the Supreme Court ruled that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment, since his flag burning constituted protected expressive conduct. Among the members of the five-justice majority were Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy, who often served as the swing vote after Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retired.",
      "During a 2012 interview with CNN, Scalia, a conservative stalwart, defended the high court's decision on flag burning and reiterated that the act is a form of expression.",
      "\"If I were king, I would not allow people to go around burning the American flag,\" he said. \"However, we have a First Amendment, which says that the right of free speech shall not be abridged \u2014 and it is addressed in particular to speech critical of the government. That was the main kind of speech that tyrants would seek to suppress.\"",
      "Scalia told CNN that \"burning a flag is a symbol that expresses an idea \u2014 I hate the government, the government is unjust, whatever.\"",
      "Referencing the 1989 ruling, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that the case was decided by a \"very sad court.\"",
      "One year after that decision, the Supreme Court ruled in the case United States v. Eichman that a federal law criminalizing flag burning was unconstitutional.",
      "Congress had passed that law, known as the Flag Protection Act, in 1989 in response to the high court's ruling in Texas v. Johnson. The law made it a crime to knowingly mutilate, deface, physically defile, burn or trample upon the American flag, and violators faced a fine or up to one year in prison.",
      "But in another 5-4 decision, again with Scalia and Kennedy in the majority, the Supreme Court ruled that prosecutions of protesters who burned flags in violation of the Flag Protection Act were inconsistent with the First Amendment.",
      "\"Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that makes this emblem so revered, and worth revering,\" Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority.",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cited risks to the labor market in opening the door to cutting interest rates. Here's what job-seekers should know.",
    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday opened the door to\u00a0cutting interest rates\u00a0for the first time in nearly a year, he noted the tremors beginning to shake a main pillar of the U.S. economy: the labor market.",
      "Concerns about the pace of job growth were heightened earlier this month after government data showed a sharp slowdown in hiring in July, along with much weaker payroll gains in May and June than previously thought. The disappointing numbers were alarming enough for President Trump to question their accuracy and to fire the head of the agency tasked with compiling the data.",
      "Yet labor experts tell CBS News they weren't surprised by the downturn, and caution that more pain could be in store for job seekers. Data released since the Aug. 1 job numbers show companies are delaying hiring as they adjust course to account for headwinds, including\u00a0fresh U.S. tariffs\u00a0and the advent of artificial intelligence, they say.",
      "\"There's a real cooling in the labor market,\" Andy Challenger, senior vice president of executive outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We're also having lots of individual conversations with companies that are letting us know to expect future layoffs.\"",
      "He added, \"So for me, there is more reason to be pessimistic about the labor market than optimistic we'll see some major bounce back.\"",
      "Here are three charts that could point to a serious downturn in the U.S. job market.",
      "Fewer workers are getting hired",
      "Overall, U.S. employers in 2025 have added fewer jobs on a monthly basis compared with the pace of gains in recent years, when companies sought to expand as the economy roared back from the pandemic. In 2024, employers hired an average of 168,000 workers each month, but that has slowed to an average of 35,000 over the past three months, Powell said on Friday.",
      "The risk is that the labor market could weaken from here, which could lead to \"sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,\" Powell said.",
      "The slowdown could spur the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate, policymakers' main tool for energizing the economy and job growth, at its meeting next month for the first time since December 2024. Lowering rates could bolster the labor market because it would make it cheaper for consumers to borrow, driving spending, for businesses to invest, including by adding workers.",
      "More long-term job seekers",
      "Another troubling sign is a recent surge in long-term job seekers, or people who have been searching for a job for more than 27 weeks. In July, about 1.8 million Americans had been looking for work for more than 27 weeks, a jump of about 64% from three years earlier and 20% from a year ago.",
      "It may not get easier to find work anytime soon, given signs from employers that they intend to continue to cut jobs, Challenger said.",
      "\"Don't take the summer off\" from looking for new work, he advised job-hunters. \"It's hard to imagine a scenario where the labor market will be better in three to six months.\"",
      "A jump in unemployed young workers",
      "At the same time, young workers are also having more trouble finding their first jobs, which has been blamed on everything from slowing economic activity this year to employers adopting artificial intelligence in place of entry-level workers.",
      "To be sure, the nation's unemployment rate remains low, at 4.2%. Yet that statistic is backward-looking, reflecting the labor market's strength in previous months \u2014 it says little about economic conditions moving forward.",
      "Meanwhile, for new college graduates the current job market amounts to \"a perfect storm,\" said career coach Tracey Newell.",
      "\"Companies are limiting new entry-level roles, and AI is replacing many traditional 'starter' jobs,\" she added, noting that it isn't unusual for employers these days to receive hundreds of job applications for a single position.",

    "summary": "Trump officials sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists, slowing their response to the measles outbreak in West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "As measles surged in Texas early this year, the Trump administration's actions sowed fear and confusion among CDC scientists that kept them from performing the agency's most critical function \u2014 emergency response \u2014 when it mattered most, an investigation from KFF Health News shows.",
      "The outbreak soon became the worst the United States has endured in over three decades.",
      "In the month after Donald Trump took office, his administration interfered with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention communications, stalled the agency's reports, censored its data, and abruptly laid off staff. In the chaos, CDC experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.",
      "\"CDC hasn't reached out to us locally,\" Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. \"My staff feels like we are out here all alone,\" she added.",
      "A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.",
      "\"All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,\" one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. \"All this training and then we weren't allowed to do anything.\"",
      "Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, like many in West Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, researchers estimate. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.",
      "The outbreak that unfolded in West Texas illustrates the danger the country faces as vaccination rates drop, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.",
      "While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fueled doubt in vaccines and exaggerated the ability of vitamins to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The Texas outbreak spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, and Mexico's Chihuahua state \u2014 at minimum. Together these linked outbreaks have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.",
      "\"This is absolutely outrageous,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. \"When you're battling contagious diseases, time is everything.\"",
      "\"The CDC is 'stressed' currently\"",
      "Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in late January had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren't getting tested.",
      "\"I think this may be very large,\" she wrote in a Feb. 3 email to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in another email what she'd learned from conversations with people in the community: \"According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.\"",
      "In that email and others, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.",
      "One email asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC's recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.",
      "\"Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?\" Wells wrote on Feb. 5.",
      "\"It never hurts to ask the CDC,\" said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.",
      "\"I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,\" Milton wrote. \"Of course, we know the CDC is 'stressed' currently.\"",
      "Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the Immunization Partnership, a Texas nonprofit.",
      "\"The CDC had gone dark,\" said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. \"We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn't expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.\"",
      "Technically, the Trump administration's freeze on federal communications had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.",
      "\"There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,\" one CDC scientist said.",
      "Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said the situation was not unique to measles. \"Like most public health organizations, we weren't able to get ahold of our program people in February,\" he said. Information trickled out through the CDC's communications office, but CDC scientists gave no press briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. \"The CDC was gagged,\" he said.",
      "Through private conversations, Benjamin said he learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration lay off CDC staffers in droves.",
      "\"It's not that the CDC was delinquent,\" Benjamin said. \"It's that they had their hands tied behind their backs.\"",
      "To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn't need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. \"We would always offer a conversation and ask if there's anything we could do,\" she said.",
      "Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state's correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records \"confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.\"",
      "Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist West Texas in the early weeks of February. That's corroborated in emails from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.",
      "\"Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,\" Zach Holbrooks, the health district's executive director, told KFF Health News.",
      "Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren't already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn't spread measles to others.",
      "Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in close-knit Mennonite communities where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn't want to be tested, didn't want to name their contacts, and didn't want to talk with the health department. \"It doesn't matter what resources I have if people won't avail themselves of it,\" Holbrooks said.",
      "Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against COVID-19 restrictions deepened that mistrust.",
      "Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some live in the U.S. illegally, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico, and Bolivia in waves over the past 50 years. Locals guess the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is far larger than the U.S. Census count.",
      "\"I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don't know how many people are in the community,\" Holbrooks said. \"There's a lot of people in the shadows out here.\"",
      "Public health experts say the situation in Gaines County sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers, and more.",
      "About 450 people \u2014 including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses, and volunteers \u2014 helped control a measles outbreak sparked in an Eastern European immigrant community in Clark County, Washington, in 2018.",
      "Alan Melnick, Clark County's public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. \"We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,\" he said.",
      "Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.",
      "In New York, hundreds of people in the city's health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.",
      "The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City's assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to data from prior outbreaks. Then there's the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and the lasting toll of some measles infections, including deafness or worse.",
      "\"I don't think there's a price tag to put on a child's death that would otherwise be prevented,\" Zucker said.",
      "Local health departments in West Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells emailed a colleague: \"I'm so overwhelmed.\"",
      "A death ignites a response",
      "On Feb. 26, Texas announced that a 6-year-old child had died of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a brief notice on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.",
      "In emails, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC's notice might exacerbate a problem: Doctors were treating children with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home. A local Lubbock news outlet reported on a large drugstore where vitamin A supplements and cod liver oil, which contains high levels of vitamin A, were \"flying off the shelf.\"",
      "Too much vitamin A can cause liver damage, blindness, and dire abnormalities during fetal development.",
      "Milton worried that parents were listening to misinformation from anti-vaccine groups \u2014 including one founded by Kennedy \u2014 that diminished the need for vaccination by inaccurately claiming that vitamin A staved off the disease's worst outcomes.",
      "\"How many people will choose Vitamin A and not a vaccine because it appears to them there are two options?\" Milton asked in an email.",
      "Scientists at the CDC privately fretted, too. \"HHS pressed us to insert vitamin A into all of our communications with clinicians and health officials,\" one CDC scientist told KFF Health News, referring to the agency's notices and alerts. \"If pregnant women took too much vitamin A during the outbreak, their babies could be profoundly disabled. We haven't seen those babies born yet.\"",
      "Another CDC official said they've had to \"walk a fine line\" between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with HHS.",
      "While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. \"We're providing vitamin A,\" Kennedy said in an interview on Fox News. \"There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,\" he claimed, \"against serious disease and death.\"",
      "The studies Kennedy referenced were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished. Evidence suggests that vitamin A supplementation is seldom useful against measles in the United States, because deficiency is exceedingly rare.",
      "Kennedy deflected criticism from those who call him anti-vaccine, saying that any parent in Texas who wants a measles vaccine can get one. He followed this with numerous inaccurate statements. \"There are adverse events from the vaccine. It does cause deaths every year,\" he said. \"It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, et cetera.\" There is no evidence that measles vaccines \"cause deaths every year.\" Scores of studies show that the vaccine doesn't cause encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.",
      "In another interview, Kennedy said, \"The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.\" The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine does not contain an iota of fetal cells.",
      "HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.",
      "\"Staff are exhausted\"",
      "Despite national attention after the country's first measles death in a decade, West Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.",
      "\"Local hospitals are at capacity,\" wrote Jeffrey Hill, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. \"The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,\" he added.",
      "\"I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,\" Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in an email, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. \"Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.\"",
      "The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.",
      "None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It spread to Mexico when an unvaccinated Mennonite child visited relatives in Seminole and returned home with an infection. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen in decades, with at least 3,700 cases and 13 deaths in the state of Chihuahua.",
      "Then another child in West Texas died of measles.",
      "In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine advisory meeting in late April. \"There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,\" Sugarman said. \"We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.\"",
      "Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have burned until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. \"A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,\" he said, \"and didn't see the need to confirm it.\"",
      "On Aug. 18, health officials declared the West Texas outbreak over, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.",
      "The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.",
      "More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding not to vaccinate their kids, alarmed by unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers lacking expertise in vaccines and infectious disease, including some who have expressed anti-vaccine views. One of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, blamed the deaths of children with measles on \"medical mismanagement,\" without evidence.",
      "At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than $11 billion in public health funds earlier this year.",
      "Amid Lubbock's toughest months, Wells sent an email to the department's exhausted staff. \"The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,\" she wrote. \"Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 845 points, or 1.9%, to close at 45,632, while the S&P 500 gained 97 points, or 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 396 points, or 1.9%.",
      "In an annual address\u00a0from Jackson Hole Wyoming, Powell said Friday that current economic conditions \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance.\"",
      "Despite pressure from President Trump, the Fed has held off on cutting rates this year as it monitors the impact of Trump administration's tariffs on inflation and the labor market. Powell's speech on Friday, however, may be the strongest indication yet that policy changes could be afoot.",
      "\"With Powell acknowledging that it may be time for the Fed to alter its restrictive policy, this could set up stocks for a short-term relief rally,\" said Bret Kenwell, eToro investment analyst, in an email note on Friday.",
      "\"When Fed chairs open the door for a rate cut, it's quite difficult to close,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. \"The August employment report or consumer price index are unlikely enough to change Powell's opinion.\"",
      "The central bank is tasked with ensuring full employment and while keeping inflation in check \u2014 a tricky balance as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to rise, and vice versa.",
      "On Friday, Powell suggested that the balance was shifting toward bolstering the labor market. Job growth, he said, has \"slowed considerably\" and that the \"downside risks to employment are rising.\"",
      "Job growth came in weaker than expected in July, with employers adding 73,000 jobs. The Labor Department also revised job growth\u00a0sharply down for May and June.",
      "\"Overall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip\u00a0\u2014 \u00a0Israel struck one of the main hospitals in the Gaza Strip with a missile Monday and then fired another as journalists and rescue workers rushed to the scene, killing at least 20 people and wounding scores more, local health workers in Hamas-run\u00a0Gaza\u00a0said. At least five journalists were among those killed, health officials and their employers said.",
      "It was among the deadliest of several Israeli strikes that have hit both hospitals and journalists over the course of the 22-month war sparked by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack, and the attack came as Israel plans to widen its offensive to heavily populated areas.",
      "The first strike hit a top floor of a building at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis. Minutes later, as journalists and rescuers in orange vests rushed up an external staircase, a second missile hit, said Dr. Ahmed al-Farra, head of Nasser's pediatrics department.",
      "Nasser Hospital, the largest in southern Gaza, has withstood raids and bombardment throughout 22 months of war, with officials citing critical shortages of supplies and staff.",
      "Asked about the strike and journalists being among the victims, the Israel Defense Forces issued a statement saying it had carried out an attack and adding that it would \"conduct an initial inquiry as soon as possible,\" adding that it regretted \"any harm to uninvolved individuals and does not target journalists as such.\"",
      "In a statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel \"deeply regrets the tragic mishap\" that occurred at the hospital in Gaza.",
      "\"Israel values the work of journalists, medical staff, and all civilians,\" the statement said. \"The military authorities are conducting a thorough investigation. Our war is with Hamas terrorists. Our just goals are defeating Hamas and bringing our hostages home.\"",
      "A hospital official initially told CBS News that four journalists were killed in the Monday morning double-tap strike at the hospital. The official identified the four as Hossam al-Masri, who worked for the Reuters news agency, Mohammed Salama, who worked for Al Jazeera, and freelance journalists Maryam Abu Daqqa  and Moaz Abu Taha.",
      "The Associated Press' news director for the Middle East, Jon Gambrell, said in a social media post that Abu Daqqa had \"freelanced for the AP since the Gaza war began.\"",
      "Reuters confirmed that al-Masri had worked for the international news agency. It said photographer Hatem Khaled, who also worked as a contractor for the agency, was wounded.",
      "Middle East Eye, a U.K.-based media outlet, later said one of its freelancers, Ahmad Abu Aziz, was also killed.",
      "At least one other journalist was wounded in the strike, a hospital official said, identifying the man as Haithem Omar, who also works for Reuters.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Monday that he was not aware of the strike on the hospital and he was not happy about it when he learned the news.",
      "\"When did this happen?\" Mr. Trump asked a reporter in the White House. \"I didn't know that. Well, I'm not happy about it. I don't want to see it. At the same time, we have to end that whole nightmare.\"",
      "Israel has come under mounting pressure over the number of journalists being killed in its military operations in Gaza \u2014 including in targeted strikes against individuals whom Israeli officials claim were Hamas operatives.",
      "Israeli strikes and raids on hospitals are not uncommon. Multiple hospitals have been struck or raided across the Gaza Strip, with Israel claiming its attacks had targeted militants operating inside the medical facilities, without providing evidence.",
      "In a statement issued Monday, the Foreign Press Association, which represents journalists working in Israel and the Palestinian territories, said it was \"outraged and in shock\" over the latest killings of media workers.",
      "\"This is among the deadliest Israeli attacks on journalists working for international media since the Gaza war began,\" the organization said, confirming the identities of the four people killed. \"These strikes hit the exterior staircase of the hospital where journalists frequently stationed themselves with their cameras. The strikes came with no warning.\"",
      "The organization demanded an immediate explanation from the IDF and from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office for the strike, adding: \"This has gone on far too long. Too many journalists in Gaza have been killed by Israel without justification. Israel continues to block international journalists from independent access to Gaza. This must be a watershed moment. We appeal to international leaders: do everything you can to protect our colleagues. We cannot do it ourselves.\"",
      "The international Committee to Protect Journalists also condemned the Israeli strike. In a statement, the group called on the international community \"to hold Israel accountable for its continued unlawful attacks on the press.\"",
      "\"Israel's broadcasted killing of journalists in #Gaza continues while the world watches and fails to act firmly on the most horrific attacks the press has ever faced in recent history,\" CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah said in the group's post. \"These murders must end now. The perpetrators must no longer be allowed to act with impunity.\"",
      "On August 11, Israel's military targeted and killed five Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza, including correspondent Anas al-Sharif. The Israel Defense Forces said it had intelligence and documents from Gaza to prove al-Sharif was the head of a Hamas terrorist cell, and the IDF shared\u00a0undated\u00a0photos\u00a0of Al-Sharif with Yahya Sinwar, the top Hamas leader in Gaza, who was\u00a0killed last October.",
      "CBS News could not verify the authenticity of the photos. Al Jazeera and al-Sharif had\u00a0previously dismissed\u00a0Israel's claims as baseless, The Associated Press reported. Just three weeks ago, al-Sharif had appealed to the Committee to Protect Journalists over fears he might be assassinated.",
      "A June strike on Nasser Hospital killed three people and wounded 10, according to the health ministry. At the time, Israel's military said it had targeted Hamas militants operating from a command and control center inside the hospital.",
      "The Hamas-run health ministry said Sunday that at least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed since Israel launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that killed some 1,200 Israelis and saw 251 others taken as hostages.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish in its figures between fighters and civilians, but it says around half of those killed have been women and children. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable information available on war casualties, as such figures are difficult to independently verify, as Israel does not permit foreign journalists into Gaza.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 07:49:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The first commercial carbon storage facility has been inaugurated off Norway's coast, but is storing CO2 deep under the seabed really the answer?",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014The world's first commercial service offering carbon storage off Norway's coast has carried out its inaugural CO2 injection into the North Sea seabed, the Northern Lights consortium operating the site said Monday.",
      "The project by Northern Lights, which is led by oil giants Equinor, Shell and TotalEnergies, involves transporting and burying CO2 captured at smokestacks across Europe. The aim is to prevent the emissions from being released into the atmosphere, and thereby help halt climate change.",
      "\"We now injected and stored the very first CO2 safely in the reservoir,\" Northern Lights' managing director Tim Heijn said in a statement. \"Our ships, facilities and wells are now in operation.\"",
      "In concrete terms, after the CO2 is captured, it is liquified and transported by ship to the Oygarden terminal near Bergen on Norway's western coast.",
      "It is then transferred into large tanks before being injected through a 68-mile pipeline into the seabed, at a depth of around 1.6 miles, for permanent storage.",
      "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been listed as a climate tool by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), especially for reducing the CO2 footprint of industries such as cement and steel that are difficult to decarbonize.",
      "The first CO2 injection into the Northern Lights geological reservoir was from Germany's Heidelberg Materials cement plant in Brevik in southeastern Norway.",
      "But CCS technology is complex, controversial and costly.",
      "Without financial assistance, it is currently more profitable for industries to purchase \"pollution permits\" on the European carbon market than to pay for capturing, transporting and storing their CO2.",
      "Northern Lights has so far signed just three commercial contracts in Europe. One is with a Yara ammonia plant in the Netherlands, another with two of Orsted's biofuel plants in Denmark, and the third with a Stockholm Exergi thermal power plant in Sweden.",
      "Largely financed by the Norwegian state, Northern Lights has an annual CO2 storage capacity of 1.7 million tons, which is expected to increase to 5.5 million tons by the end of the decade.",
      "While efforts such as Northern Lights are focused on capturing carbon directly from the most highly-polluting sources \u2014 industrial smoke stacks \u2014 there have also been efforts launched to capture the gas from the ambient air, an even more controversial methodology.",
      "Mark Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of environmental engineering, told CBS News earlier this year that he was dubious of the motivations for and the efficacy of both kinds of carbon capture, and he said bluntly that \"direct air capture is not a real solution. We do not have time to waste with this useless technology.\"",
      "Jacobson thinks direct air capture, in particular, is a boondoggle, and more effort should be focused on switching to clean energy sources.",
      "Currently, the U.S. gets about 60% of its electricity from fossil fuels.",
      "\"You have to think about who's proposing this technology,\" Jacobson said. \"Who stands to benefit from carbon capture and direct air capture? It's the fossil-fuel companies.\"",
      "\"They're just saying, 'Well, we're extracting as much CO2 as we're emitting. Therefore, we should be allowed to keep polluting, keep mining,\" Jacobson told CBS News, adding that his stance has not made him popular among many in the energy sector.",
      "\"Oh, yeah, diesel people hate me, gasoline people hate me, ethanol people hate me, nuclear people hate me, coal people hate me. They do, because I'm telling the truth,\" he said. \"We don't need any of these technologies.\"",

      "Shortly after the Russian announcement, Zelenskyy said that \"our people are coming home.\" He said those being exchanged included members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service and civilians. \"Most of them had been in captivity since 2022,\" he said.",

      "The deaths add to the growing toll of Palestinians killed while seeking food, as parts of the Gaza Strip plunge into famine and Israel's military ramps up activity in northern Gaza ahead of a planned offensive to seize its largest city.",
      "A U.N.-backed initiative on Friday declared a famine in Gaza City and warned that it is likely to spread without a ceasefire or an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid. Israel has disputed the assessment, saying \"there is no famine in Gaza.\"",
      "\"We have been saying, 'beware,'\" UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And it's, it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss.\"",
      "Russell added that the famine is \"shocking,\" \"but it's not surprising.\"",
      "\"There's no reason for this,\" Russell said. \"This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid into these children.\"",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" said the Israel blockade in Gaza is \"a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen, and that Israel is allowing this to happen.\"",
      "Shaheen, speaking from Jordan, said she visited a humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza, outlining that Israel has prevented their trucks from getting in to provide aid.",
      "\"Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening,\" Shaheen said. \"He needs to look at what he is doing and change his position.\"",
      "Al-Awda Hospital and two eyewitnesses told The Associated Press that the four Palestinians were killed when troops opened fire on a crowd heading to a site run by the Israeli-backed American contractor Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF, in the Netzarim corridor area. It occurred hundreds of meters (yards) away from the site, the eyewitnesses said.",
      "\"The gunfire was indiscriminate,\" Mohamed Abed, a father of two from the Bureij refugee camp, said, adding that while many fled some people fell to the ground after being shot.",
      "Abed and Aymed Sayyad, another aid seeker among the crowd, said troops opened fire when a group near the front of the crowd pushed forward toward a distribution site before its scheduled opening.",
      "Sayyad said he and others helped two people who were wounded by gunshots, one in his shoulder and in his leg.",
      "The Israeli military and GHF did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Since the GHF first began operating nearly three months ago, the U.N. says hundreds of Palestinians have been shot and killed by Israel Defense Forces and foreign military contractors at or near its aid sites.",
      "Malnutrition-related deaths",
      "The four deaths are the latest in areas where U.N. convoys have been overwhelmed by looters and desperate crowds, and where people have been shot and killed while heading to sites run by the GHF.",
      "More than 2,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 13,500 wounded while seeking aid at distribution points or along convoy routes used by the United Nations and other aid groups, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",
      "The ministry said on Sunday that at least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed in the war, including missing people now confirmed dead by a special ministry judicial committee.",
      "It said the number of malnutrition-related deaths rose by eight to 289 on Sunday. The deaths include a child, bringing the death toll among children to 115 since the war between Israel and Hamas began in 2023.",
      "The health ministry does not say how many of those killed have been fighters or civilians but says around half have been women and children. It is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.",
      "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification \u2014 the world's leading authority on food crises \u2014 said Friday that famine is happening in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.",
      "Aid groups have long warned that the war and months of Israeli restrictions on food and medical supplies entering Gaza are causing starvation. Israel has denied the existence of widespread hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation \"lies\" promoted by Hamas.",
      "\"Non-stop explosions\"",
      "In Jabaliya, the densely populated refugee camp just north of Gaza City, residents said they endured heavy explosions overnight. Days after Israel's military announced it was intensifying its operations in the area and mobilizing tens of thousands of reservists to take the city, they said they were living in constant fear.",
      "In the part of Gaza City where he and his family have sheltered since being displaced from a neighborhood on the city's southern edge, Ossama Matter said he had seen houses reduced to rubble and neighborhoods razed beyond recognition.",
      "\"They want it like Rafah,\" he said, referring to a town in southern Gaza destroyed earlier in the war. \"There have been non-stop explosions and strikes in the past days.\"",
      "While fleeing westward from Jabaliya, schoolteacher Salim Dhaher said he saw weaponized robots planting explosives as troops advanced from the opposite direction. As they set the stage for Israel's push to seize the city, Dhaher said he feared it was part of a larger effort to forcibly remove Palestinians from the north.",
      "The aim is clear, he said: \"To destroy everything above the ground, and force the transfer.\"",
      "There has been little sign of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians evacuating south ahead of Israel's invasion of Gaza City, which Israel says is still a Hamas stronghold. Many are exhausted by repeated displacements and unconvinced that any area\u2014 including so-called humanitarian zones \u2014 offers safety.",
      "The military operation could begin within days in a region that threatens the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians, who are sheltering above an area Israel has invaded multiple times but still believes harbors a network of militant tunnels underground.",
      "Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals but 50 remain inside Gaza, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive."

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. Good to have you here, Congressman, there's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland, and that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The President encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now, California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well. Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REP. MIKE LAWLER: I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong, and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less, and mine wasn't even one of them, despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat, I won by six and a half points. So when you look at the map across the country, the fact is roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts. They're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and therefore they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that obviously reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond. But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here. Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year in 2024 at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become Speaker. They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting, despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution. So now New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the house. So this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the President's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the President of United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Look, obviously, it's going to be a fight, but this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms, because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974 never held a job outside of elected office. It's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform. So I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties, because frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority. Period. On the question, though, that we have been- also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The President of the United States has mentioned New York is another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars, and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Crime has been a major problem in New York for years, and Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Do you want National Guard troops?-- ,",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized- Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard's troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime. When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80% of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution, that 80% of these individuals are released back out onto the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington DC, 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. So when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime?",
      "[START CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- No, but that's a local--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- that's a local issue that would need to get changed. But in terms of the question on the troops--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- No but- it's- no- but Margaret, this why the homicide rate is so high--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You'd rather troops than FBI agents or ATF agents or DEA agents. You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City. You would rather National Guardsmen --",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- I want- I want all of the above.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- who have trained to be trained to police?",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. LAWLER: No. No, no, don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above, the FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime. I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal. I led that effort, and the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime, and yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington D.C., only 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous, and it's exactly why the President is cracking down on crime in major cities, and as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York State that matters. A good amount of money from that CHIPs bill went to New York. On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore, the President wants to buy a 10% stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have US taxpayers as a shareholder, own 10%. As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Generally speaking, no, I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts, when we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the- in the aftermath of the collapse of the market and '08 the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that. I think what the President is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars that are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel to manufacture chips. And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment. Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors and that's critical for our foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break, so I'm going to leave it there. We'll be right back."

      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Good morning, or, afternoon here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, exactly. You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed, the Pentagon did not explain why. In addition, the Navy Reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed. Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings, and they come on the heels of firings earlier this year, of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of Naval Operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things, one of the strengths of America's military, are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks, who have the training, the expertise, to be able to do the jobs. And what we don't want is political people in those jobs, who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze, and we're going to try to get that back up, if we can. The Senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan. So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan. We- we lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator. Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday, this internationally recognized body, backed by the UN, the IPC. It tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a man-made famine underway in Gaza. This is a very rare designation, only four other times has one been designated. The country you are in, Jordan, called it a \"shameful failure of humanity\" that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think is- it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen. One of the- we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is an- it funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration. They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable. Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he's doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli Prime Minister's Office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it, quote, \"a modern blood libel, spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\" That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor, and the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it. But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death, because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that, they're getting ready to do another- or, they've already started, planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people. So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in, to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I understand your criticism right now. I want to ask you a little bit though about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former deputy national security adviser for President Biden Joe- Jon Finer, just wrote a piece in the Atlantic, and he said that while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes \"we did far too little, far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\" Do you agree with him, and do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position. With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in. I think it's something that, I hope, that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but do you agree with this self criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We should be doing more and we should have done more. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I want to also ask you--",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think everybody--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: --should have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense. When it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck, and they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck, when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's- that's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid in to the people of Gaza who are starving. And that can be changed. All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday about a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing man-made famine, and that those conditions will expand soon. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment. Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us. We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation- so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real-world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, thank you, Margaret. Let me say this: You know, it's been, now, almost two years since October 7th, and since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage, and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for months and months and months, which is a terrible famine. You know, we've estimated at this point that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who die from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying we beware, right, this- this famine is just right around the corner, and it's- it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know. It's so- it's shocking that it's happened, because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising. And what it means, really, is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image. Children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where you know suddenly they're all quiet. The children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry, and to see that happen, and especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid in to these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the UN data is flawed. The Prime Minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice. Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot- journalists who live inside Gaza, because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know that what you're saying is fact?",
      "RUSSELL: Let me say two things about that. One is the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people, and they monitor this as they go, and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-related deaths, so it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate. I would also say it- to me, it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, right? I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not? First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean, we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming, you should be it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absent that, we're going to have to rely on the data that we have the people who were there, and I can tell you, from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean, I have spoken to our staff, and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived, many thousands of children who have had amputations, and are, you know, it's just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just- almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussion, stop arguing, and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children, make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a distant future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out. On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people: The former US Ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, and another Mid-East Envoy have said the UN agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why- why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, I- the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, the UN had 400 places where we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, okay? And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food, people are getting shot. It's a terrible situation, and it doesn't work. It's not working that well. Now look, I don't- I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our let us do our work, too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say we, it's not just UNICEF, it's the UN, it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that it gets to the people who need it. And I, you know, do both. I'm fine with that, but at least make sure that humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly, and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that nobody wants that.",

      "RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good, and we need them to step up and do more. Sudan, as you say, is the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of Cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean, it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the US really can make a much bigger difference if they try to do this work, and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here? When you don't look --",
      "RUSSELL: Oh, it's horrible. First of all, they're not getting food. They're facing horrible sexual violence. I was just in Chad and heard stories that could just break your heart, and it's devastating, and the results, as you say, will last for generations.",

So he's doing great.\"",
      "When Billy first revealed his NPH diagnosis, the five-time Grammy Award winner said that the condition had been \"exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance.\"",

      "Common symptoms of NPH include difficulty walking, urinary incontinence and problems with concentration and memory.",

I do analysis on it with the backstories. So I interview him. I go straight to the source, my dad, and I ask him about all the material. And I was asking him, single by single, I said, \u2018Well, which album is this from? What year?\u2019\"",
      "\"He remembers every album, the exact year, the order in which the singles were ordered on the album,\" she added. \"So, as far as I'm concerned, he's sharp as a tack.

      "Alexa recently released her new single \"Riverside Way.\" (Alexa Ray Joel)",
      "\"It is personal to me because it was my way of saying to the world and saying, as an artist, I'm not just one person,\" she said. \"I think there is a sort of societal penchant and interest in putting women in a box and pinpointing them as, 'OK, she's that type.'\"",
      "Alexa continued, \"She's good or she is bad or she's sugar or she's spice or she's sweet or she's a bitch. We have this interest in pigeonholing women a lot of times. Or even people do it [and] they don't even realize, right? You just form quick judgments based on a picture or based on an interview clip, now with sound bites on social media. It's so easy to form judgments too quickly, I feel.\"",
      "\"And so \u2018Riverside Way\u2019 is personal for me because it's my way of saying, 'Hey, you know, just like most women and particularly artists, there's not just one side to us,'\" she added. \"There is the side of me that's very much the good daughter and loves to perhaps be a little more demure. But then there's another side that's...a bit wilder and more curious and more interested in exploring things. And I think with \u2018Riverside Way,\u2019 I wanted to show, it's OK to get outside your comfort zone and take risks, both with storytelling, narrative wise and stylistically with this song.\"",
      "\"I wanted this image of a girl that's just having a fantasy with a guy and, you know, speeding down the highway in a truck at 200 miles per hour, and they're not even sure where they're going or where they'll end up because they're so immersed in the moment. And so I wanted that escapism to be very vivid. And I am an escapist at heart. I love painting a very vivid picture in my mind. That I can just sort of climb into and crawl into. I get a real thrill from that as an artist.\"",

California's attempt to circumvent Congress could impact other states, since provisions of the federal Clean Air Act allow them to adopt California's tougher emissions regulations as opposed to the federal baseline.",
      "Meanwhile, a few weeks after Newsom's executive order, the Trump administration announced it would sue California in an effort to prevent them from trudging forward with the \"unlawful\" emissions standards.

In that context, your email is simply a means to an end, a validated contact point that helps the operation move forward smoothly.",
      "Scammers can obtain email addresses when reputable companies experience data breaches. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How bad actors are able to get your email",
      "Your email address may have ended up in the hands of scammers through several common methods. The most likely cause is a data breach. Many well-known companies have\u00a0experienced leaks in which customer emails and other information were exposed.",
      "Once your email is part of a leaked database, it often circulates on the dark web or in underground forums, where it is freely traded and reused. Even if you were not part of a breach, scammers often use a technique called credential stuffing. This involves testing stolen login details across different websites to confirm which email addresses are active.",
      "REMOVE YOUR DATA TO PROTECT YOUR RETIREMENT FROM SCAMMERS",
      "The best thing you can do to prevent this from happening is to invest in a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "These simple but powerful steps can help you protect your inbox, safeguard your identity and stay one step ahead of scammers misusing your email.",
      "Start by locking down your email account with a strong, unique password that you don\u2019t reuse anywhere else. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) so hackers can\u2019t get in even if they\u2019ve stolen your password. A password manager makes this much easier by generating and securely storing complex passwords, helping you avoid the risks of reuse.",

      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Scan your inbox regularly for order confirmations, shipping notices or account sign-ups you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it directly to the retailer or platform; it could be part of a larger scam using your email address. Never click on suspicious links, even if the message looks legitimate, and protect your devices with strong antivirus software to catch threats before they spread.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Avoid entering your email on shady giveaway sites or sketchy online forms. When in doubt, skip the sign-up or use a throwaway email. The fewer places your email lives, the harder it is for scammers to get hold of it.",
      "Set up a dedicated email for online purchases, newsletters and subscriptions. This helps keep your main inbox clean and makes it easier to spot strange activity. Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0 An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.

      "If this email misuse leads to fraudulent financial activity, users should file a report with the FTC at IdentityTheft.gov or their local authorities.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If you are receiving order confirmations for things you never bought, do not shrug it off. Your email is likely being misused as part of a larger fraud operation, not by accident but intentionally. Scammers are taking advantage of active, trustworthy email addresses to slip past retailer defenses and carry out unauthorized purchases. The repeated use of your email shows that fraud networks are already circulating it, even if your financial information remains untouched.",

    "story": [
      "Surgeries may become safer and more precise than ever before.",
      "A new brain implant now lets people control Apple devices, such as iPads, iPhones and the Vision Pro, using only their thoughts. Synchron, an endovascular brain-computer interface (BCI) company based in New York, demonstrated the first wireless BCI that works with Apple's official protocol.",
      "Ten patients have received the implant: six in the U.S. and four in Australia. With this technology, users living with severe paralysis can navigate apps, send messages and operate devices hands-free. This breakthrough greatly expands independence, as it enables patients to manage their environment, stream shows and control smart home devices, all using only their minds.",
      "Synchron's advancement in BCI technology marks a significant step for assistive devices and hints at how we may interact with computers in the future. The device's hands-free, voice-free operation offers a powerful new level of accessibility and autonomy for people with disabilities.",

      "ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface (BCI) working with an iPad. (Synchron)",
      "A first for brain-tech and Apple",
      "Synchron is the first company to connect a brain implant directly to Apple devices using Apple's official BCI Human Interface Device (HID) protocol. This means no custom hacks or workarounds. The system simply connects over Bluetooth, just like a keyboard or a mouse, and works with iPhones, iPads, and even the Apple Vision Pro. In a powerful video shared by Synchron, ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates the tech in action. After losing the use of his hands, he's now able to navigate his iPad entirely with thought. That includes opening apps, composing messages, and staying connected with the people he loves-all without moving a muscle.",
      "Behind the scenes, Synchron's system uses artificial intelligence to decode brain signals and turn them into real-time digital commands. Machine learning models interpret motor intent, such as thinking about tapping your finger, and translate that into actions on the iPad. This AI-powered decoding helps the system feel smooth and responsive as users learn to control it with focus alone.",
      "Synchron's brain-computer interface is seen up close. (Synchron)",
      "The game-changing signal strength meter",
      "One surprising new feature is the built-in signal strength meter. This visual cue shows patients how strong their brain signal is in real time. A blue box appears over an icon or app and fills up based on how clearly the system reads the user's intent. It may sound simple, but this is a huge deal. It helps users like Mark fine-tune their mental focus, adjust their posture, and improve their interaction without outside help. It's like seeing your brain in action and learning to drive it better.\u00a0\"When I lost the use of my hands, I thought I had lost my independence,\" Mark says in the video.\u00a0\"Now, with my iPad, I can message my loved ones, read the news, and stay connected with the world, just by thinking.\"",

      "Mark Jackson operates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface, which functions using Apple's official protocol. (Synchron)",
      "What sets Synchron apart",
      "BCIs like Synchron's Stentrode and Elon Musk's\u00a0Neuralink have connected to devices before, but never like this. Previous setups required custom software or physical adapters. Now, thanks to Apple's new BCI HID protocol, brain-computer interfaces can plug right into the Apple ecosystem like any other accessory. That official integration opens the door to more features, better performance, and fewer setup hurdles. Synchron's COO, Kurt Haggstrom, calls it a\u00a0\"game changer\" for both patients and the entire BCI industry.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This tech isn't just for people with paralysis, at least, not forever. Today, it's a medical tool undergoing trials. Tomorrow, it could become a consumer product you buy at your local Apple Store. With Apple embracing BCI as a legitimate input method, everything from your phone to your smart home could one day be controllable by thought. That opens the door for more accessibility, more customization, and completely new ways of interacting with technology.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Synchron's Apple demo marks a new era in brain-computer interaction. It turns thoughts into action using mainstream tech you probably already own. While it's still in its early stages, the direction is clear: BCI is moving out of the lab and into real life, and Apple is helping lead the charge.",

      "On Saturday, Israeli tanks and troops began maneuvering ever closer to Gaza City\u2019s outskirts in preparation for a\u00a0full-scale offensive. Eyewitness accounts reported intensified shelling as Israel is moving toward what could be the defining battle of its war against Hamas terrorists: the capture of Gaza City.",

      "John Spencer, chair of urban warfare studies at the Madison Policy Forum and executive director of the Urban Warfare Institute, told Fox News Digital the scale of this operation is unprecedented. \"This will be a bigger challenge than anything\u00a0the IDF has faced, arguably ever.

      "Spencer said that \"Hamas built semi-circles of defenses oriented at Israel. But the IDF has shown creativity in maneuvering around obstacles.\" Israel plans to send more combat power into Gaza City than it has deployed across the entire Strip thus far. \"If your goal is to clear Gaza City of Hamas\u2019 military capabilities and search for hostages, you need that scale,\" he said.",
      "Gadi Shamni, former commander of the Gaza Division and ex-head of IDF Central Command, told Fox News Digital, \"It is a crowded city with refugee camps, dense neighborhoods, high-rises and a highly developed underground. People say the IDF controls above and below ground, but in the last campaign we saw that wasn\u2019t always true. Even when you destroy tunnels, Hamas can rebuild them quickly. The longer you stay with more forces, the more opportunities you create for the other side to attack.\"",
      "A former senior Israeli security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Fox News Digital, \"The IDF can militarily conquer Gaza, but the costs will be immense on both sides. The IDF will fight with a method of \u2018destroy everything first\u2019\u2014air force bombs, massive charges, detonating streets from afar, wiping out entire areas and advancing slowly.",

      "The tunnels remain the most formidable element of Hamas\u2019 defense. Unlike ISIS terrorists in Mosul, Spencer said, Hamas has built an underground tunnel network that allows commanders and fighters to move between positions, avoid strikes and\u00a0conceal hostages. \"The IDF that will go into Gaza City is not the IDF of 2023,\" Spencer said, pointing to rapid adaptations in the use of drones, robots and specialized units for tunnel warfare. \"They\u2019ve learned so much. But this will still be slow, very careful and costly.\"",
      "To illustrate the scale, Spencer pointed to the 2004 battle for Fallujah in Iraq. \"It took the Marine Corps about two weeks to clear Fallujah\u2014every single home, building, shop. About 68,000 structures were cleared, as if somebody physically looked in them,\" he said. \"If all five of these [IDF] divisions were doing that, absolutely, you could get it done in a few months. But the enemy always gets a vote. You can\u2019t rush to failure.\"",
      "The former Israeli senior security official described the operation as \"telescopic\u2014very slow, with pistons working one by one. This pace also gives Hamas the chance at every stage to try to cut a deal.\"",

      "Shamni highlighted a particularly fraught dilemma: evacuating civilians. \"You don\u2019t know who will leave, how many will leave, how they\u2019ll react\u2014or whether Hamas will even allow them to leave,\" he said. \"I assume many will not evacuate, and then you face the hard dilemma of fighting in a place full of noncombatants.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump\u2019s South Caucasus deal secures U.S. control of a critical trade corridor bypassing Iran \u2014 a move experts call a strategic and economic &apos;nightmare&apos; for Tehran.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump brokering a deal with Azerbaijan and Armenia on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new deal in the South Caucasus has ended a decades-long conflict and handed Washington a rare strategic foothold on Iran\u2019s northern border, experts say.",
      "The agreement, signed earlier this month between Armenia and Azerbaijan, grants the U.S. a 99-year lease over the Zangezur Corridor - a narrow strip of land that will serve as a critical trade and energy route to Europe, bypassing Tehran entirely. Iranian American journalist and dissident Banafsheh Zand told Fox News Digital the move is \"a wonderful gain for the U.S.\" that also delivers a \"slap in the face\" to the regime in Tehran.",
      "The corridor has long been at the center of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which displaced tens of thousands and fueled three decades of instability. Trump\u2019s intervention brought both sides to the table and created what observers say is a new trade and security lifeline linking the Caspian Basin to Europe, bypassing Iran entirely.",
      "ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN LEADERS SEEK TO EASE RUSSIAN AND IRANIAN CONCERNS AFTER US-BROKERED PEACE DEAL",
      "A view from Armenia's southern border reveals the Arax River, with Iran visible across the water. This crossing is a vital lifeline for Armenia, facilitating essential trade and energy flows, especially as tensions rise over the proposed Zangezur Corridor. Iran strongly opposes the corridor, fearing it would sever its direct land access to Armenia and diminish its role as a regional transit hub. The corridor, intended to connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, has become a flashpoint in regional geopolitics. (Anthony Pizzoferrato/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Known as the Trump Route for Peace & Prosperity (TRIPP), economically, the agreement secures Washington a direct role in overseeing the flow of Caspian hydrocarbons to Europe. The U.S. will manage rail and road infrastructure, telecom networks and energy pipelines running through the corridor, giving American companies a dominant position in regional transit for oil, gas and goods. By controlling this artery, the U.S. not only generates billions in future trade and investment but also locks Europe into alternative supply routes that reduce reliance on both Russia and Iran.",
      "For allies, the corridor offers cheaper and safer access to Caspian energy. For Tehran, it represents lost revenue, lost leverage, and the end of its ability to act as a mandatory gatekeeper for east-west commerce.",
      "Zand said the deal is not only historic but also a direct win for Washington. \"It\u2019s a wonderful gain for the U.S.,\" she said. \"American contractors will be supervising oil and gas from the Caspian Basin, routed through Zangezur and Turkey to Europe. The profit margins are great, and it all happens under NATO\u2019s blessing.\"",
      "Zand said the potential goes even further. \"Nobody\u2019s talking about it yet, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to see U.S. bases there,\" she said. \"If that happens, then checkmate the Khamenei regime and Russia.\"",

      "US President Donald Trump (C), Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev (L) and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan display the agreement they signed in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC on August 8, 2025. US President Donald Trump said Friday that Armenia and Azerbaijan were committed to a permanent peace as he hosted a White House summit with the leaders of the two South Caucasus nations, which have fought for decades. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "For Iran, the corridor represents what Zand called a nightmare scenario. Tehran has long used its geography to shape energy and trade flows. By inserting the U.S. into the region, the new deal effectively strips Iran of that leverage. Zand put it in stark terms: \"Iran is shaped like a cat, a sitting cat. This corridor literally runs above the cat\u2019s ears. It bypasses Iran, takes money away from the regime, and pushes them out into the cold.\"",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Iran Program, said the corridor exposes how vulnerable Iran has become in the Caucasus. \"Both the defeat of Armenia in the most recent war with Azerbaijan, as well as the political problems between Moscow and Yerevan today, have made it harder for the Islamic Republic to really benefit from its traditional economic and political relationship with Armenia,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "An infographic titled \u2018Construction of roads and railways extending to the Zangezur Corridor continues without interruption.\u2019 Once constructed, the corridor will connect Azerbaijan's western provinces and Nakhchivan via Armenia, further stretching to China, Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey.\u00a0 (Yasin Demirci/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "\"They still do have ties, and the regime is an opportunistic actor as much as it is an ideological one. If there is any way to throw stones at this agreement, or extract concessions on the back end, they will try.\"",
      "At the same time, he said the strategic picture is clear. \"The Islamic Republic is, in essence, carved out of this route,\" he said. \"This is not just a critical corridor that could bring stability to the South Caucasus and economic improvement for all countries involved-it also drives home the point that the regime has been such a poor guardian of Iran\u2019s national interest that the Iranian state has been excluded from a major transit route just above its border.\"",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei addresses the media during voting for parliamentary elections in Tehran, Iran in May 2024. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The timing, Zand argued, makes the impact even greater. She pointed to Iran\u2019s weakening position since October 7, 2023, and Israel's recent 12-day war with Tehran. \"The regime was self-isolated when it couldn\u2019t come to Hamas\u2019s or Hezbollah\u2019s rescue. Iraq\u2019s Shiites are saying they don\u2019t want to be controlled, Syria is out, and Hezbollah has been degraded. For those of us who\u2019ve watched the regime for decades, we always knew it was a paper tiger. October 7 and the war exposed it to the world.\"",
      "The killing of senior IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists has deepened the sense of vulnerability inside Tehran. \"They can huff and puff about blowing the house down, but the truth is, there\u2019s a whole lot of fear among the regime\u2019s leaders now,\" Zand said. \"Khamenei has even gone into hiding again.\"",
      "TRUMP BRINGS PEACE TO CAUCASUS: INSIDE THE ARMENIA\u2013AZERBAIJAN DEAL 30 YEARS IN THE MAKING",
      "Ben Taleblu added that Washington is now using these shifts to turn Iran\u2019s weakness into opportunity. \"Wherever the regime is weak, that invites pushback, whether militarily or economically,\" he said. \"The U.S. has followed Israel\u2019s military success against the Islamic Republic with strikes of its own against nuclear facilities, and it is now following Azerbaijan\u2019s battlefield success with a political and economic success of its own. This corridor is another example of America moving in when Tehran is most vulnerable.\"",
      "An aerial view of the construction of roads and railways that will pass through the Zangezur Corridor, which will connect the western provinces with Nakhchivan and will also be one of the routes of the Central Corridor extending from China to Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey. (Photo by Resul Rehimov/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Zand, whose father was a well-known Iranian journalist and intellectual assassinated by the regime, said she views Trump\u2019s direct involvement as the key to the corridor\u2019s success. \"Because it\u2019s Trump, it makes all the difference,\" she said. \u00a0\"Trump doesn\u2019t care about not hurting people\u2019s feelings. He responds to how people act. And with this move, he\u2019s sitting over Iran like a vulture-ominous, watching, ready.\"",
      "For dissidents like Zand, the corridor represents more than a transport route. \"We\u2019ve prayed for this for decades,\" she said. \"Until the regime is gone, people inside Iran will remain too afraid to rise up again. But this corridor is a boon. It shows the regime is surrounded, and its days are numbered.\"",

      "The deal was reached with NATO backing and has already been compared by some observers to historic peace accords. Zand believes the significance lies not only in ending a 30-year conflict but also in turning the U.S. presence in the Caucasus into a permanent reality. \"The regime knows the jig is up.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump is removing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook effective immediately, according to a letter he posted to Truth Social on Monday night.",
      "In the letter, Trump writes: \"Pursuant to my authority under Article II of the Constitution of the United States and the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended, you are hereby removed from your position on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, effective immediately.\"",
      "Trump cites a \"criminal referral\" from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte from August 15. In that referral, Pulte accused Cook of mortgage fraud.",
      "The Federal Reserve did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "For her part, Cook said in a statement last week that she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"",
      "Cook said she learned of Pulte's allegations only from media reports. \u201cI do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" Cook said.",
      "Cook is the first Black woman to serve on the board of the Fed, considered the world's most important independent central bank.",
      "Under the Federal Reserve Act, the only reason that a Federal Reserve governor can be removed from their position is \"for cause,\" or some kind of wrongdoing.",
      "The Supreme Court in May said, while granting Trump the ability to remove members of other independent agencies, that the Federal Reserve is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity\" that has its own distinct historical tradition. That led many to believe that the bar would be high for Trump to be able to remove any Fed board members, or its chairman.",
      "Monday's move against Cook came amid an unrelenting pressure campaign by Trump against the central bank, with the president and his top aides and allies repeatedly attacking the institution and its chair, Jerome Powell, over current interest rate policies.",
      "That changed when Pulte alleged that Cook committed mortgage fraud. Trump quickly reposted Pulte's allegations, saying she \"must resign, now!!!\"",
      "Pulte took to social media after Trump announced Cook's removal, saying on X that \"Fraud will not be tolerated in President Trump\u2019s housing market.\"",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump signed executive orders Monday aimed at eliminating cashless bail for suspects arrested in Washington, D.C., and in other jurisdictions around the country with similar policies, according to fact sheets describing the executive orders the White House provided to NBC News.",
      "The executive order on D.C. directs the administration to take certain actions if the city does not change its cashless bail policy, including \"federal funding decisions, services, or approvals,\" according to the fact sheet. Attorney General Pam Bondi, too, could get involved, though the fact sheet did not detail what actions she might take.",
      "The order on D.C., first reported by Axios, also asks law enforcement officials to work to ensure that people arrested in the city are taken into federal custody \"to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law,\" the fact sheet said.",
      "In the federal custody system, eligible defendants can be released before trial if they meet certain requirements, which can include putting up collateral bonds or fulfilling certain nonfinancial requirements, like personal recognizance.",
      "The executive order aimed at other cities across the country directs the administration to find federal funds that could be \"suspended or terminated\" in jurisdictions that have cashless bail policies, the fact sheet said.",
      "A spokesperson for Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s office would not comment.",
      "Trump signed another executive order Monday aimed at prosecuting people who \"desecrate\" the American flag, a third fact sheet said. That order, first reported by Fox News, directs Bondi to \"vigorously prosecute those who violate our laws in ways that involve desecrating the flag, and to pursue litigation to clarify the scope of First Amendment in this area.\"",
      "The order also targets noncitizens by asking the administration to \"deny, prohibit, terminate, or revoke visas, residence permits, or naturalization proceedings, and other immigration benefits, or seek removal\" of noncitizens who desecrate the flag. The order could hit a legal obstacle in that the Supreme Court decided in Texas v. Johnson in 1989 that flag burning was protected by the First Amendment.",
      "The D.C. executive order on cashless bail is Trump's latest step to broaden the administration's control over the capital. It comes on the heels of the White House's move to deploy and arm National Guard troops in an effort to fight crime. Critics, though, have slammed the administration's handling as overreach and unnecessary.",
      "They argue that cash bail disproportionately hurts low-income people, who may have more difficulty securing the money to pay bail for release from jail.",
      "Trump, though, has criticized the practice, saying this month that it was a \"disaster\" and caused \"so many problems came that we never had before.\"",
      "\"So they're watching us today, and if they don't learn their lesson, if they haven't studied us properly, because we're going to be very successful,\" Trump said of other cities this month.",
      "The U.S. attorney for D.C., Jeanine Pirro, claimed on Monday morning on \"Fox & Friends\" that cashless bail \"is when all of the problems started.\" She criticized defendants' being released, asserting that \"they are reoffending and they\u2019re reoffending again.\"",
      "D.C. has had a cashless bail system since 1992. The policy means judges decide whether people charged with crimes pose risks to others or the community at large or would pose flight risks if they were released without money for bail connected with their freedom. If judges make any of those determinations, they may opt to hold defendants in detention facilities before trial.",
      "As part of the city government's own safety measures, the D.C. Council extended its pretrial detention policy in July.",
      "Several states have eliminated or nearly eliminated cash bail, including Illinois, New Mexico and New Jersey.",
      "National Guard troops in D.C. began carrying firearms Sunday evening. Also over the weekend, Trump threatened to deploy troops to Baltimore. Just days earlier, he floated sending the National Guard to Chicago and New York.",
      "Trump's focus on how the capital is run is a stark departure from previous administrations' policies. He has enacted sweeping changes by surging National Guard and federal agents into the city, pushing enforcement agencies to clear homeless encampments and restoring a Confederate memorial in Arlington National Cemetery in northern Virginia.",
      "Last week, Trump also announced that he had ordered attorneys to review Smithsonian museums, arguing that the storied museums were not positive enough about U.S. history, \"where everything discussed is how horrible our Country is, how bad Slavery was, and how unaccomplished the downtrodden have been.\""

      "\"There were some brilliant people,\" Trump said, referring to Biden's allies in his White House. \"But they\u2019re evil people, and they\u2019re going to be brought down. They have to be brought down 'cause they really hurt our country.\"",
      "Trump's threat to have his political opponent's allies \"brought down\" marks his latest move to potentially target political adversaries in a pattern that has alarmed critics who paint the president as pursuing retribution and say he is weaponizing the Justice Department \u2014 a claim the president has made about the Biden administration.",
      "Biden's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump made the comments during lengthy remarks in the Oval Office, where the president and his allies made a series of claims about the impact of his anti-crime efforts in D.C. and top officials took turns heaping praise on him. While signing executive orders that aim to do away with cash bail, Trump repeatedly focused on the murder rate in the city, saying it had not seen a single person killed in 11 days \u2014 a change that he has been brandishing in recent days as he touts his administration's efforts to address D.C. crime. That push has included federalizing the D.C. police force, deploying the National Guard and stepping up the federal law enforcement presence in the city.",
      "Trump claimed that it has been \"many years\" since D.C. went a week without a murder. Publicly available crime data from the Metropolitan Police Department, however, indicate that D.C. went 16 days without a murder earlier this year, from Feb. 25 to March 12.",
      "Trump argued that the city's restaurants are experiencing a \"boomtown,\" a comment that is uncertain, as restaurant employees in a D.C. neighborhood with a large immigrant community told NBC News last week that business was declining due to Trump's policies. His deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, who attended the signing with Vice President JD Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, claimed that people in D.C. had resumed wearing jewelry and carrying purses because of Trump\u2019s anti-crime push.",
      "\"They're wearing jewelry again. They're carrying purses again,\" Miller said. \"People had changed their whole lives in this city for fear of being murdered, mugged and carjacked. It is a literal statement that President Trump has freed 700,000 people in this city who were living under the rule of criminals and thugs.\"",
      "At the start of the operation, though, crime in D.C. was down 26% compared to last year. Many city residents, too, have slammed the deployments and said it is scaring Washingtonians.",
      "The president has frequently claimed that Democrats weaponized the Justice Department and other law enforcement agencies against him, pointing to his criminal indictments related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents, as well as his conviction related to falsifying business records, which were dropped when he was elected to a second term. Trump repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the cases against him.",
      "Democrats have gone after Trump's comments, arguing that the Trump administration's several investigations into his political foes constitute the exact weaponization that he claimed they pursued against him.",
      "The Justice Department is investigating Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and New York Attorney General Letitia James on allegations of mortgage fraud.",
      "James led a civil fraud case against Trump, and Schiff served as the lead House manager in Trump's first impeachment trial. They denied any wrongdoing.",
      "NBC News has also previously reported that the Justice Department is in the initial stages of an investigation into James\u2019 handling of her civil fraud case against Trump, which her attorney likened to a \"political retribution campaign.\u201d",
      "Trump also threatened Friday to fire a Federal Reserve governor, Lisa Cook, if she did not resign after facing separate accusations of mortgage fraud. Cook said she won't step down. Trump has been highly critical of the Federal Reserve for not adjusting interest rates as he would like.",
      "Then, late last week, the FBI searched the home of former national security adviser John Bolton. A source familiar with the matter told NBC News at the time that the search was part of a \"national security investigation in search of classified records.\" Bolton did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment Friday.",
      "Also on Monday, Trump left the door open to investigating former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a staunch critic of Trump who was among the Republicans who ran against him for president. Trump was referring to a 12-year-old scandal called \"Bridgegate.\"",
      "\"If they want to look at it, they can,\" Trump said, responding to a question about whether the White House planned to investigate Christie. \"You can ask Pam. I think we have other things to do, but I always thought he got away with murder.\"",
      "On Sunday, after Christie criticized him on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social, \u201cFor the sake of JUSTICE, perhaps we should start looking at that very serious situation again?\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's allies in Congress have pushed to hear testimony from Biden's circle about his mental acuity while in office, which Trump and Republicans claim was in decline but was covered up by the former president's team. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., has sought testimony from Biden's former White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor and former White House aides, including his domestic policy adviser, Neera Tanden and his deputy chief of staff, Annie Tomasini."

She doesn\u2019t think the National Guard presence is necessary, and wants them out. But all she can do is ask.",

      "Even with the city on edge, Bowser told the educators to avoid the elephant in the room when the bell rings on Monday.",
      "\u201cI want everyone to know whose job politics is in this room,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cWhose job is it? It\u2019s mine. It\u2019s mine. It\u2019s mine. I\u2019m the only one. It\u2019s not yours. Alright?\u201d",

Now, though, Swenson said she and her husband will to escort their kids to their school in Northwest D.C. because the National Guard is making their younger daughter uncomfortable.",
      "The last time she saw a large law enforcement presence in D.C. was during the 2020 racial justice protests, Swenson said. This time, though, is harder to explain to her children.",
      "\u201cBack then, I think we said, \u2018There\u2019s peaceful protesting, and that is people\u2019s right. It\u2019s a good thing to do to stand up when you see something wrong,\u2019\u201d Swenson said during a Friday interview. \u201cBut this? I have no idea what to say to her. It\u2019s very hard for us to explain what\u2019s going on right now.\u201d",
      "At a back-to-school event in the West End neighborhood on Friday, parent Melissa Neil said that while the National Guard surge can be \u201cunderstandable,\u201d it was also \u201ca little concerning.\u201d Neil is a citizen but immigrated from the Dominican Republic, and she noted that even if someone is a citizen, \u201cyou still look as an immigrant.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou never really know what are the standards,\u201d Neil said. \u201cEven if you have your documentation, they can still identify you as you are not. So it is concerning that you\u2019re with your kids, and they can pull you out.\u201d",
      "Nearly every day, a video goes viral of immigration enforcement actions on the streets of Washington, after the Department of Justice directed Bowser to order the city\u2019s police department to assist in immigration enforcement operations and to comply with database inquiries and requests for information from any federal law enforcement entity.",
      "At the same back-to-school event, Louis Limes said he has \u201cmixed emotions\u201d about sending his daughters back to school amid the surge of National Guard and federal agents.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re out here for the safety of our children, cool, but from the last couple of days, we\u2019ve seen that they went over their boundaries as far as protecting and serving the streets, harassing, physically abusing citizens,\u201d Limes said.",

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had made \"significant concessions\" to help end its war in Ukraine. Has it?",
    "story": [
      "Faced with a stalling peace push, Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that Russia had made \"significant concessions\" in ending its war in Ukraine.",
      "There is little public evidence, however, that Russian President Vladimir Putin has moved his ambitions an inch since launching his full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "Vance told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that the Kremlin had been \u201cflexible on some of their core demands\u201d \u2014 namely recognizing \u201cthat they are not going to be able to install a puppet regime\u201d in Kyiv, and \u201cthat there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d",
      "That appears at odds with Russian officials, who have spent the days since the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska pushing back on both of these points.",
      "Also on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d was Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who \u2014 while not advocating the installation of a Russian puppet \u2014 made no secret of Moscow\u2019s belief that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is illegitimate.",
      "Russia was open to Ukraine having security guarantees, Lavrov said last week \u2014 but only if the Kremlin can play a role in them, arguably rendering them useless.",
      "\"We cannot agree\" to \"resolve collective security issues without the Russian Federation. This will not work,\" he said at a news conference. \"I am sure that in the West and above all in the United States they understand perfectly well that seriously discussing security issues without the Russian Federation is a utopia, a road to nowhere.\"",
      "Far from being a new and significant concession, Lavrov made clear that the security guarantees should be based on talks held in Istanbul, in 2022.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Russia has made compromises.",
      "Despite Lavrov's trenchant remarks, there may be subtle hints that Putin is ready to do a deal \u2014 and that's without knowing what has gone on behind closed doors.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what was said at Alaska, that\u2019s the problem,\" Mark Galeotti, the British-based director of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence, told NBC News. \"It may well be that what Vance is saying reflects what Putin said there.\u201d",
      "Though Russian officials remain steadfast, Russia\u2019s tightly controlled media have been noticeably less critical of the usually vilified Zelenskyy, he said. And academics close to the Kremlin have suggested there may be some wiggle-room to the Kremlin\u2019s demands."

    "story": [
      "U.S. taxpayers are now the largest shareholders in Intel. What comes next isn\u2019t so clear.",
      "The Trump administration announced on Friday that the government had taken a 10% stake in the California-based computer chipmaker, which has fallen behind rivals Nvidia and AMD in the artificial intelligence race. Over the past five years, Intel\u2019s share price has declined more than 50%.",
      "The administration has not provided any details on when or under what circumstances it would sell the Intel shares \u2014 or whether it would sell them at all. Nor did it say whether the U.S. would benefit from any dividends, although Intel has not paid out any since last year. The administration does not plan on taking any board seats and has said it will only vote against the company in \u201climited\u201d circumstances.",
      "While Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested on Friday that national security was a key motivator for taking the stake, on Monday, Trump focused more on the prospect of financial gains.",
      "\u201cI will make deals like that for our Country all day long,\u201d Trump said in a post on Truth Social. \u201cI love seeing their stock price go up, making the USA RICHER, AND RICHER. More jobs for America!\u201d he added.",
      "Intel\u2019s shares have climbed about 4% since the transaction was announced. Some experts said that while there is a potential upside to the agreement, it represents another norm-shattering expansion of presidential authority by Trump into the business world \u2014 and likely not the last.",
      "Already, the Trump administration has taken a \u201cgolden share\u201d in Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel as part of a deal granting approval to that company\u2019s bid for U.S. Steel, and giving the government a say in future Nippon transactions. Last month, the Pentagon announced it had purchased $400 million in rare earth miner MP Materials, making it the company\u2019s largest shareholder. The White House is also planning to take a cut of the sales that chipmakers Nvidia and AMD make to China.",
      "Trump told reporters on Monday that he hopes to see \u201cmany more\u201d deals like Intel\u2019s, adding that nobody \u201crealizes how great it will be.\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said similar deals could help form the basis of a sovereign wealth fund, an idea that the administration had earlier floated as a way of giving U.S. taxpayers direct stakes in companies but had yet to fully develop.",
      "\u201cAt some point there\u2019ll be more transactions, if not in this industry, in other industries,\u201d Hassett said on CNBC.",
      "The U.S. stake in Intel does not amount to a complete government takeover. While the federal government has assumed total control of private corporations before, such incidents have usually arrived during times of crisis \u2014 and not with the direct intention of attempting to play the markets.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s doing all this in a spooky, controversial way,\u201d said Clyde Wayne Marks, a fellow in regulatory studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank. \u201cRight now there is no crisis.\u201d",
      "President Woodrow Wilson nationalized railroads as well as the telegraph, telephone, radio and wireless stations during World War I. Nearly two decades ago, the government bailed out a host of private firms during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.",
      "While the bailout involved holding corporate assets on the U.S. government\u2019s books with the goal of returning earnings to taxpayers, there was never any serious intention to own them over the long term. And a Government Accountability Office study concluded in 2023 that the program ultimately came at a net cost of about $31 billion.",
      "The U.S. government has long provided subsidies to private corporations in the form of loans and grants, to varying degrees of success. Two high-profile examples came during the Obama administration, when the Department of Energy provided loans to a solar power company called Solyndra and to electric vehicle maker Tesla. Solyndra ultimately went bankrupt, while today Tesla is worth $1.2 trillion on the stock market.",
      "Some have argued that the U.S. would have benefited from having taken a stake in Tesla. Yet at the time Tesla received the loan, in 2010, beliefs about the free market and the need for limiting the government\u2019s role in it prevailed not just among Republicans, but among Democrats as well, experts say.",
      "\u201cOur system has not typically been built that way \u2014 it\u2019s not how free enterprise is typically run,\u201d said Dan Reicher, a former Energy Department official under Presidents Clinton and Obama. \u201cHistory has proven that the more free-market approach, making the bottom line the bottom line for the companies running these operations, is a smarter way to go.\u201d",
      "The Intel investment comes as the company\u2019s fortunes have sagged. Its manufacturing segment lost $3.2 billion in the second quarter, and in July it said it would lay off 15% of its workforce by year\u2019s end while canceling billions in planned investments and delaying the completion date for a $28 billion chip plant near Columbus, Ohio.",
      "In a securities filing Monday, Intel warned investors of the potential risks involved in the U.S. investment, including that the arrangement may actually limit the company\u2019s ability to secure grants down the road, depending on its future performance. It could also potentially harm international sales and make it subject to additional regulations and restrictions, both at home and abroad, Intel said.",
      "On Monday, Trump was asked whether the Intel investment represented a new way of doing industrial policy.",
      "\u201cYeah. Sure it is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want to try to get as much as I can.\u201d"

      "KEYSTONE, S.D. \u2014\u00a0From his real estate developments to his golf courses, President Donald Trump is known for adding his name to his properties. Now, some of his supporters want to add his likeness to one of the most iconic monuments in the country: Mount Rushmore.",
      "Just days after Trump took office for his second term, one of his supporters in Congress introduced a bill to do just that. While the legislation from Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., has not advanced in the Capitol, there is an even more difficult challenge ahead for the bill: Even if the measure passed, the famous mountain does not have enough rock that is suitable to be carved for Trump\u2019s \u2014 or anyone else\u2019s \u2014 face.",
      "\u201cIt comes down to the geology, the engineering,\u201d said Paul Nelson, a retired engineer who oversaw the rock monitoring system at Mount Rushmore. \u201cIt just can\u2019t be done.\u201d",
      "The mountain\u2019s physical limitations were well known to lead sculptor Gutzon Borglum, as he and his son had to adapt their plans to what was feasible with the stone during construction of Mount Rushmore in South Dakota's Black Hills from 1927 to 1941. Before he had even finished, Borglum wrote in May 1936 that the \u201cstone limitations are so serious, that I doubt if it would be possible to change the composition, which is fixed, in any way to include a fifth head.\u201d",
      "That has not stopped supporters of Trump from floating the idea of his head on the monument.",
      "\u201cWell, they certainly have room for it there,\u201d Interior Secretary Doug Burgum told Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law Lara Trump on her Fox News show when she asked whether Trump could be on Mount Rushmore one day.",
      "The National Park Service declined to comment.",
      "Trump himself weighed in on the idea in August 2020, denying a report that White House aides had reached out to then-South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem\u2019s office about the process to add presidents to the monument. (Noem is now Trump\u2019s homeland security secretary.)",
      "\u201cNever suggested it although, based on all of the many things accomplished during the first 3 1/2 years, perhaps more than any other Presidency, sounds like a good idea to me!\u201d Trump said on what was then called Twitter.",
      "Trump is not the first president to have his supporters believe he should be physically represented on par with George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln.",
      "After Ronald Reagan\u2019s death in 2004, there were efforts to memorialize him on the monument. And even before Mount Rushmore was completed, first lady Eleanor Roosevelt advocated for adding suffragist Susan B. Anthony.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful thing to speculate about, who could or should be on Mount Rushmore, but it can\u2019t be done,\u201d said Dan Wenk, who was the superintendent at Mount Rushmore for more than a decade. \u201cWould you add another figure to da Vinci\u2019s 'The Last Supper?' I don\u2019t think so. You don\u2019t change great art.\u201d",
      "Wenk said that while it may look like there is space next to Lincoln or Washington, the rock is \u201cnot suitable for carving,\u201d as it is \u201cvery fractured, it\u2019s very soft.\u201d",
      "That has been true since the beginning. Carving for Jefferson\u2019s face initially started to Washington\u2019s left but had to be moved to his right to find stone that was acceptable. Any new carving could jeopardize the already present fractures, Nelson said.",
      "\u201cAnd so if you\u2019re going to do any other carvings on the surface, you have to remove a lot of rock to get down to the competent rock, and you run the risk of maybe mobilizing some fractures,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, no, I wouldn\u2019t want to be messing with Mount Rushmore.\u201d",
      "Aside from the physical capabilities, some of the 2 million tourists per year who visit the monument recently shared their views about who is worthy of being included in the sculpture.",
      "\u201cI think history is going to show that he\u2019s in the same pantheon,\u201d Robert Thomas, a tourist from Missouri, said of Trump.",
      "\u201cI just think it\u2019s a little ridiculous,\u201d said another tourist, Susan Davis. \u201cTell him to get his own mountain, carve his own image on it.\u201d",
      "Wenk, though, emphasized that \u201cat the end of the day, it can\u2019t be done.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how worthy someone is \u2014 if the rock is not there, you can\u2019t carve them.\u201d"

      "In the letter, Trump writes: \"Pursuant to my authority under Article II of the Constitution of the United States and the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, as amended, you are hereby removed from your position on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, effective immediately.\"",
      "Trump cites a \"criminal referral\" from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director William Pulte from August 15. In that referral, Pulte accused Cook of mortgage fraud.",
      "The Federal Reserve did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "For her part, Cook said in a statement last week that she had \"no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet.\"",
      "Cook said she learned of Pulte's allegations only from media reports. \u201cI do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" Cook said.",
      "Cook is the first Black woman to serve on the board of the Fed, considered the world's most important independent central bank.",
      "Under the Federal Reserve Act, the only reason that a Federal Reserve governor can be removed from their position is \"for cause,\" or some kind of wrongdoing.",
      "The Supreme Court in May said, while granting Trump the ability to remove members of other independent agencies, that the Federal Reserve is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity\" that has its own distinct historical tradition. That led many to believe that the bar would be high for Trump to be able to remove any Fed board members, or its chairman.",
      "Monday's move against Cook came amid an unrelenting pressure campaign by Trump against the central bank, with the president and his top aides and allies repeatedly attacking the institution and its chair, Jerome Powell, over current interest rate policies.",
      "That changed when Pulte alleged that Cook committed mortgage fraud. Trump quickly reposted Pulte's allegations, saying she \"must resign, now!!!\"",
      "Pulte took to social media after Trump announced Cook's removal, saying on X that \"Fraud will not be tolerated in President Trump\u2019s housing market.\"",
      "The U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the dollar's strength against a basket of global currencies, sharply declined on Trump's announcement.",
      "Cook has a permanent vote on the central bank\u2019s rate-setting committee and was appointed by President Joe Biden to a term running until 2038.",
      "If Cook is removed from the Fed's board and its rate-setting committee, Trump would gain another opportunity to put his mark on the central bank.",
      "Trump has nominated his top economist Stephen Miran to the Fed's board for a term that would run until January. Trump will also have a chance to name a new chair when Powell's term ends in May."

      "Already, the Trump administration has taken a \u201cgolden share\u201d in Japan\u2019s Nippon Steel as part of a deal granting approval to that company\u2019s bid for U.S. Steel, and giving the government a say in future Nippon transactions. Last month, the Pentagon announced it had purchased $400 million in rare earth miner MP Materials, making it the company\u2019s largest shareholder. The White House is also planning to take a cut of the sales that chipmakers Nvidia and AMD make to China.",
      "Trump told reporters on Monday that he hopes to see \u201cmany more\u201d deals like Intel\u2019s, adding that nobody \u201crealizes how great it will be.\u201d Kevin Hassett, director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, said similar deals could help form the basis of a sovereign wealth fund, an idea that the administration had earlier floated as a way of giving U.S. taxpayers direct stakes in companies but had yet to fully develop.",
      "\u201cAt some point there\u2019ll be more transactions, if not in this industry, in other industries,\u201d Hassett said on CNBC.",
      "The U.S. stake in Intel does not amount to a complete government takeover. While the federal government has assumed total control of private corporations before, such incidents have usually arrived during times of crisis \u2014 and not with the direct intention of attempting to play the markets.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s doing all this in a spooky, controversial way,\u201d said Clyde Wayne Marks, a fellow in regulatory studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian think tank. \u201cRight now there is no crisis.\u201d",
      "President Woodrow Wilson nationalized railroads as well as the telegraph, telephone, radio and wireless stations during World War I. Nearly two decades ago, the government bailed out a host of private firms during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.",
      "While the bailout involved holding corporate assets on the U.S. government\u2019s books with the goal of returning earnings to taxpayers, there was never any serious intention to own them over the long term. And a Government Accountability Office study concluded in 2023 that the program ultimately came at a net cost of about $31 billion.",
      "The U.S. government has long provided subsidies to private corporations in the form of loans and grants, to varying degrees of success. Two high-profile examples came during the Obama administration, when the Department of Energy provided loans to a solar power company called Solyndra and to electric vehicle maker Tesla. Solyndra ultimately went bankrupt, while today Tesla is worth $1.2 trillion on the stock market.",
      "Some have argued that the U.S. would have benefited from having taken a stake in Tesla. Yet at the time Tesla received the loan, in 2010, beliefs about the free market and the need for limiting the government\u2019s role in it prevailed not just among Republicans, but among Democrats as well, experts say.",
      "\u201cOur system has not typically been built that way \u2014 it\u2019s not how free enterprise is typically run,\u201d said Dan Reicher, a former Energy Department official under Presidents Clinton and Obama. \u201cHistory has proven that the more free-market approach, making the bottom line the bottom line for the companies running these operations, is a smarter way to go.\u201d",
      "The Intel investment comes as the company\u2019s fortunes have sagged. Its manufacturing segment lost $3.2 billion in the second quarter, and in July it said it would lay off 15% of its workforce by year\u2019s end while canceling billions in planned investments and delaying the completion date for a $28 billion chip plant near Columbus, Ohio.",
      "In a securities filing Monday, Intel warned investors of the potential risks involved in the U.S. investment, including that the arrangement may actually limit the company\u2019s ability to secure grants down the road, depending on its future performance. It could also potentially harm international sales and make it subject to additional regulations and restrictions, both at home and abroad, Intel said.",
      "On Monday, Trump was asked whether the Intel investment represented a new way of doing industrial policy.",
      "\u201cYeah. Sure it is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want to try to get as much as I can.\u201d"

      "The Florida Transportation Department on Sunday once again painted over a rainbow crosswalk in Orlando that was part of the Pulse Memorial after protesters filled it in with multicolored chalk.",
      "The Transportation Department initially painted the rainbow crosswalk black and white late Wednesday. The multicolored crosswalk was created in 2017 as part of a memorial for the 49 people fatally shot by a gunman at the Pulse LGBTQ nightclub in 2016.",
      "A spokesperson for the Transportation Department said in a statement Thursday that the department has a duty to \u201censure the safety and consistency of public roadways and transportation systems\u201d and therefore ensure \u201croadways are not utilized for social, political, or ideological interests.\u201d",

      "Hundreds of protesters showed up at the crosswalk Thursday, many of them wearing rainbow flags, and used chalk to color the crosswalk rainbow again. Rain washed it away, but protesters have returned every day to color it back, even as Florida Highway Patrol troopers stood watch Sunday morning, according to NBC affiliate WESH of Orlando. The troopers said that protesters could use chalk on the road as long as they weren\u2019t blocking traffic and that anyone using paint would be arrested immediately, WESH reported.",
      "However, a Transportation Department crew returned to the crosswalk Sunday night to paint it black and white again, according to WESH, and transportation officials and Orlando police have been stationed at the crosswalk 24/7.",

      "As the department plans to continue to paint over rainbow crosswalks across the state, protesters plan to respond. Demonstrations against the Transportation Department\u2019s policy at rainbow crosswalks are planned in Fort Lauderdale, Key West and Miami Beach for Monday night, according to WPLG-TV of Fort Lauderdale and Miami.",

    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 21:40:36 GMT",
    "summary": "The House Oversight Committee also issued a subpoena to Epstein's estate, seeking any records that could resemble a client list or the reported \"birthday book\" from 2003.",
    "story": [
      "The House Oversight Committee announced Monday that former Labor Secretary Alex Acosta will appear voluntarily before the panel next month as part of its investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein case.",
      "Attorneys for Epstein's victims had raised concerns about why the Republican-led committee did not include Acosta, who served in the first Trump administration, when it sent subpoenas to a number of high-profile former government officials as part of the probe.",
      "Acosta was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida in 2008 when the office reached a secret non-prosecution agreement with Epstein, who wound up pleading guilty to state charges involving a single underage victim, protecting him from federal prosecution.",
      "A Justice Department Office of Professional Responsibility investigation found it was Acosta who \u201cmade the pivotal decision to resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of the initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led\u201d to the non-prosecution agreement.",
      "The November 2020 report also found that Acosta\u2019s top lieutenants went around the FBI, the federal prosecutor investigating the case and the victims by making an offer for Epstein to plead to state charges.",
      "The deal resulted in Epstein\u2019s serving 13 months in a Palm Beach County jail, where he was allowed to leave almost daily through a work-release program and have his own private security detail. He could have faced up to life behind bars had he been convicted in a federal complaint that was shelved as a result of the deal.",
      "Resurfaced reporting about Acosta's role in the plea deal led him to step down as labor secretary in 2019.",
      "Even so, his name was not in the initial batch of subpoenas the committee sent out this month. Among those named were former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and several top former Justice Department officials, including former Attorneys General Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder, William Barr, Merrick Garland, Jeff Sessions and Alberto Gonzales, who'd been Acosta's boss when he was in Florida.",
      "\u201cHow can any genuine investigation into the federal government\u2019s sweetheart deal with Epstein (including the extraordinary grant of blanket immunity to all his named and unnamed co-conspirators) omit Alex Acosta?\u201d Epstein victim attorney Jack Scarola said in a statement to NBC News after the subpoenas were released.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the panel, said Monday that the about-face came after \"weeks of pressure\" from Democrats.",
      "A person familiar with the situation told NBC News that the committee approached Acosta \u201cabout a week and a half ago about coming in for a voluntary transcribed interview.\u201d",
      "The Acosta interview is scheduled for Sept. 19.",
      "The committee said Monday an additional subpoena is being sent to the Epstein estate for \u201cthe circumstances and subsequent investigations of Mr. Epstein\u2019s death, the operation of sex-trafficking rings and ways for the federal government to effectively combat them, and potential violations of ethics rules related to elected officials.\u201d",
      "That subpoena includes a demand for \u201cAll entries contained within the reported leather-bound book compiled by Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell for Mr. Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s 50th birthday\u201d in 2003.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the book includes a \"bawdy\" birthday card Donald Trump sent to Epstein.",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the documents in the book, and Trump denied sending such a letter. He filed a defamation suit against the newspaper\u2019s publisher, two of its reporters and News Corp. founder Rupert Murdoch over the article. A Dow Jones spokesperson said at the time, \u201cWe have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting.\u201d",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said on X that the Epstein estate has \"indicated it would comply with a subpoena with redactions to protect victims. The pressure is working. Let\u2019s keep pushing for transparency & justice for survivors.\"",
      "As for the subpoenas to former law enforcement officials, Barr has already met with the committee, and the panel said Monday it will accept formal written declarations from Gonzales, Holder and Sessions under penalty of prosecution for false statements stating they possess no information about the Epstein case or about his accomplice, Maxwell.",
      "Maxwell is serving 20 years on sex trafficking charges. She is appealing her conviction.",
      "Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell 2019 while he was awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges in New York.",
      "The case returned to the headlines this summer when the Justice Department and the FBI announced in an unsigned joint memo that they agreed Epstein's death was the result of a suicide, that no other people were expected to be charged and that no further information about the case would be released.",
      "The move outraged many Trump supporters, because he and his allies had stoked conspiracy theories about Epstein's death and had vowed to have transparency in the case.",
      "The House Oversight Committee also subpoenaed the Justice Department for its investigative files in the case, which total about 100,000 pages. The panel said it received about a third of those documents Friday and that more would be turned over in the future."

      "The change was part of a \"strategic transformation\" that aimed to update the restaurant chain's visual elements, spaces, food and retail offerings. The company's shares are down about down about 8.5%  since the reveal and ignited criticism, especially from those in conservative circles.",
      "Donald Trump Jr., the president's on, amplified a post  Wednesday suggesting that the logo change was intended to erase the American traditions aspect of the branding and make it more general and lean into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",

      "In today\u2019s edition, Melanie Zanona breaks down how President Donald Trump\u2019s blue-city crackdowns are giving Democratic governors with an eye on the next White House contest an opportunity. Plus, in lighter fare, Allan Smith and Amanda Terkel explain why it\u2019s good to be a guy named Josh right now.",
      "Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.",
      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "How Trump is elevating potential 2028 Democrats",
      "President Donald Trump picked a fresh fight this weekend with Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, adding Baltimore to his ever-growing list of potential targets for a crime crackdown.",
      "After Moore invited Trump to come walk the streets of Baltimore, Trump not only threatened to send federal troops to Charm City, but also personally attacked Moore and even floated the idea of yanking funding for the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Maryland.",
      "Yet Moore, a rising star in Democratic politics who could be in the mix for president in 2028, appears to be welcoming the feud with open arms. He quickly fired back at Trump and is already making the media rounds following his weekend war of words with Trump.",
      "As part of that media tour, Moore also challenged Trump on another front: redistricting. He left the door open on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d to pursuing a mid-decade redraw of Maryland\u2019s congressional lines in response to a new map that Texas Republicans passed at Trump\u2019s urging.",
      "The governor is hardly alone in relishing the opportunity to take on Trump.",
      "From the mobilization of federal troops to the nationwide redistricting battle, some of Trump\u2019s recent actions are inadvertently providing Democratic presidential hopefuls a prime platform to confront him head-on. And at a time when the party\u2019s base is clamoring for their leaders to put up a fight, it could give some ambitious Democratic politicians just the juice they were looking for.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom is perhaps the most obvious example. He\u2019s leading the charge to counter Texas\u2019 redistricting effort and framing it as a way to stick it to Trump. In the process, Newsom has been raising money and his national profile, mocking Trump\u2019s style on social media. And earlier this year, he led the charge in speaking out against Trump\u2019s troop deployment to Los Angeles amid unrest over immigration raids.",
      "Then there\u2019s Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, another possible 2028 contender and outspoken Trump critic who offered safe haven to Texas Democrats who fled the state in an attempt to block new congressional maps. Pritzker, too, is pushing back forcefully against any effort by Trump to send National Guard troops to Chicago.",
      "Trump\u2019s public elevation of these potential Democratic White House hopefuls raises questions about whether some of these fights could backfire for the president. But Republicans feel like they\u2019re on solid footing, especially when it comes to crime, an issue where they see Democrats as particularly weak.",
      "\u201cLook at Gov. Pritzker in Illinois, or Gov. Newsom in Los Angeles, or Gov. Moore in Maryland. They are angrier about the fact that the president of the United States is offering to help them get their crime under control than they are about the fact that murderers are running roughshod over their cities and have been for decades,\u201d Vice President JD Vance said while appearing alongside Trump in the Oval Office today.",
      "For now, though, the collective response from Democratic governors in the blue states Trump has set his sights on seems to be: Bring it on.",
      "\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Latest from D.C.: Trump signed executive orders aimed at eliminating cashless bail for suspects arrested in Washington, D.C., and in other jurisdictions around the nation with similar policies. Meanwhile, National Guard troops Trump deployed to the district began carrying firearms  on Sunday evening.",
      "It\u2019s the golden age of 'Josh'",
      "Joshes are having a moment.",
      "As it stands, there\u2019s a nonzero chance that the presidential election could feature a matchup of Joshes as both Republican and Democratic Joshes rise within their parties. As the NFL season kicks off, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is looking to repeat as the league\u2019s MVP award winner \u2014 and finally lead his team to the Super Bowl. Josh wine, meanwhile, is a top seller. And \u201cWeapons,\u201d a horror film starring actor Josh Brolin, topped the box office charts last week.",
      "Three of the nation\u2019s 50 governor\u2019s mansions are currently occupied by Jewish men named Josh \u2014 and while Josh trails only Mike as the most common gubernatorial name, the Joshes could soon be joined by namesakes in Wisconsin and Guam, bolting into the lead.",
      "What\u2019s more, these Joshes have bonded over their shared Old Testament names.",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green told NBC News that he, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein have communicated in a group chat for Joshes only.",
      "\u201cIt might have been called \u2018Three Joshes,\u2019\u201d Green said. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure. It certainly was pinned in my phone, and it\u2019s a fun thing.

      "A source familiar with the group chat, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe the off-the-record Josh deliberations, said the text thread \u201cconsists of a lot of Joshin\u2019 around.\u201d",
      "On a more serious note, Joshes who spoke with NBC News said they too have noticed their name come of age, signaling a greater shift in society \u2014 away from boomer Bobs and Dougs, and toward a younger generation of Gen Xers and millennials who, after many years waiting behind older generations, are finally coming to power.",

      "The first whole-virus vaccine was developed in the late 1800s by Louis Pasteur, who made an early version of the rabies vaccine.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not innovative at all,\u201d said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. \u201cIt\u2019s actually ancient, sort of, by vaccine standards.\u201d",
      "Whereas other vaccines activate the immune system using specific proteins in viruses, whole-virus vaccines typically preserve most components of the viruses.",
      "\u201cYou take the virus, grow it up, purify it and kill it with an inactivating agent. That\u2019s a whole-killed viral vaccine,\u201d said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Other whole-virus vaccines use live but weakened versions of viruses.",
      "Campbell said that over many years of vaccine research, scientists have been able to identify the parts of a virus that are likeliest to activate the immune system and train it to fight back against an invading pathogen. Those parts are known as \u201cantigens.\u201d",
      "If the immune system is like the body\u2019s bloodhound, tracking down invaders, then many newer vaccine technologies that target specific antigens present the bloodhound with just the pieces of the invader\u2019s clothes that are most helpful to it. A whole-virus vaccine, on the other hand, would instead be like presenting a bloodhound with an invader\u2019s entire wardrobe.",
      "Campbell said that it may sound better at first glance to use the whole virus rather than key pieces of it but that additional pieces of the virus might not actually do anything to improve the immune response.",
      "\u201cFor example, hepatitis B vaccine is one antigen, the hepatitis B surface antigen, and it is almost 100% protective against hepatitis B. You do not need the whole hepatitis B virus,\u201d he said.",
      "Offit agreed. \u201cThe hepatitis B vaccine has virtually eliminated hepatitis B infections in young children,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that\u2019s good enough.\u201d",
      "Campbell offered Covid-19 vaccines as another example. \u201cThere were whole-virus Covid vaccines, but they weren\u2019t used in the United States, they were used elsewhere, and if you look at the general protection from them, it\u2019s not as good,\u201d he said.",
      "A study from Singapore, for instance, found that people who got a whole-virus Covid vaccine were more than 1.5 times to twice as likely to be infected than those who had been immunized with an mRNA vaccine that targeted only the virus\u2019 spike protein.",
      "\u201cIf killed whole-virus vaccines for Covid were thought to be the best technology to move forward with back when the pandemic started, we would have,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "Improperly deploying whole-virus vaccines when they aren\u2019t needed isn\u2019t just unnecessary; in some cases, it can be harmful.",
      "Campbell pointed to the development of the RSV vaccine as a case in point.",
      "\u201cWhen we used whole-virus killed RSV vaccine many years ago, rather than protect children from RSV, it led to what we call \u2018antibody-dependent enhancement,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cChildren had a worse RSV than if they had not been vaccinated, and that was because they had formalin-inactivated whole-virus.\u201d",
      "That RSV vaccine trial was in the 1960s, and it set research back decades.",
      "Ever since then, Campbell said, RSV vaccination has either been directed only against the F protein, a piece of the virus, or it has used a monoclonal antibody, which is like a preformed immune response. The first RSV vaccine was approved in 2023.",
      "\u201cThose protect really well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not want to use whole-virus killed vaccine for RSV. It will hurt people.\u201d",
      "Some whole-virus vaccines are still used. The hepatitis A and rabies vaccines are killed whole-virus vaccines, meaning they include the constituent pieces of the virus that have been inactivated. Seasonal flu vaccines also use whole-virus technology.",
      "Campbell said it\u2019s possible that a whole-virus vaccine could be an optimal choice for some pathogens in the future.",
      "In pursuit of a universal flu vaccine",
      "But as for whether the whole-virus platform will unlock new innovation in the pursuit of a universal flu vaccine, as suggested by the Department of Health and Human Services, Campbell said that it would be possible to use whole-virus vaccines if they could be genetically engineered to express multiple flu strain antigens but that it doesn\u2019t have much to do with the whole-virus platform.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s just whole-virus, and it\u2019s one strain, that\u2019s what we do now,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "Emily Hilliard, the press secretary for HHS, said in a statement: \u201cGeneration Gold Standard marks a critical step in restoring strategic focus and radical transparency to America\u2019s pandemic preparedness.\u201d",
      "\u201cDeveloped entirely by government scientists \u2014 free from industry influence \u2014 the BPL vaccine platform could provide broad, long-lasting protection against all influenza viral pathogens, including influenza and coronaviruses, with the added potential to block transmission and stop outbreaks at the source,\u201d Hilliard said. BPL, or beta-propiolactone, is a chemical that has been used for decades to kill the viruses used in vaccines.",
      "A universal flu vaccine has been a longtime goal of scientists, as it would ideally offer yearslong protection against the flu. Because of how quickly the virus mutates, yearly flu shots are needed to protect against the most current strains.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different avenues that people are working, and if we choose only one of those \u2014 especially one that\u2019s a very old technology that people have tried so many times before and failed to make a universal flu vaccine \u2014 I think it\u2019s putting all our eggs in one basket and not really moving the field along,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "Offit said withdrawing research funding for mRNA vaccines could be particularly harmful in the event of a pandemic.",
      "\u201cIf something bad happens, like there is a bird flu pandemic, for example, we will be less prepared,\u201d he said, adding that mRNA technology has a shorter production cycle than whole-killed virus vaccines, meaning an mRNA vaccine would be available much sooner.",
      "Rasmussen said, \u201cWe\u2019d probably need a year to scale to full national scale manufacturing\u201d using a whole-virus vaccine, adding, \u201cYou actually have to grow a ton of virus and then inactivate it and then make sure it\u2019s inactivated.\u201d",
      "With other vaccine technologies, like protein subunit or mRNA, \u201cyou basically just make the protein or the mRNA, which can be done synthetically, without requiring any virus or anything to grow it in,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re much easier to change and adapt as needed, as new strains might emerge.\u201d",
      "Offit said, \u201cOne of the studies among the 22 studies that were eliminated in that $500 million withdrawal was looking at to what extent the mRNA technology would be valuable for bird flu.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, Campbell said, science should lead the way, not top-down dicta that tie scientists\u2019 hands.",
      "\u201cThe devil is in the details, not just in sweeping statements about what platform is an appropriate platform and which is not,\u201d he said.",
      "Multiple platforms are available for vaccine development, which are tested for their respective properties.",
      "\u201cEventually, one or two, maybe, rise to look the best, and those are the ones that people continue to pursue,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we do in vaccinology, is try to figure out what works and what doesn\u2019t work, both by basic science, by immunology, by models of diseases, before they get into humans, and then actual human studies to compare and contrast immune responses, safety and protection, not just sweeping statements about platform.\u201d"

    "summary": "President Donald Trump on Monday said he would target former President Joe Biden's circle, calling them \"evil people.\"",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Monday said he would target former President Joe Biden's circle, calling them \"evil people.\"",
      "\"There were some brilliant people,\" Trump said, referring to Biden's allies in his White House. \"But they\u2019re evil people, and they\u2019re going to be brought down. They have to be brought down 'cause they really hurt our country.\"",
      "Trump's threat to have his political opponent's allies \"brought down\" marks his latest move to potentially target political adversaries in a pattern that has alarmed critics who paint the president as pursuing retribution and say he is weaponizing the Justice Department \u2014 a claim the president has made about the Biden administration.",
      "Biden's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump made the comments during lengthy remarks in the Oval Office, where the president and his allies made a series of claims about the impact of his anti-crime efforts in D.C. and top officials took turns heaping praise on him. While signing executive orders that aim to do away with cash bail, Trump repeatedly focused on the murder rate in the city, saying it had not seen a single person killed in 11 days \u2014 a change that he has been brandishing in recent days as he touts his administration's efforts to address D.C. crime. That push has included federalizing the D.C. police force, deploying the National Guard and stepping up the federal law enforcement presence in the city.",
      "Trump claimed that it has been \"many years\" since D.C. went a week without a murder. Publicly available crime data from the Metropolitan Police Department, however, indicate that D.C. went 16 days without a murder earlier this year, from Feb. 25 to March 12.",
      "Trump argued that the city's restaurants are experiencing a \"boomtown,\" a comment that is uncertain, as restaurant employees in a D.C. neighborhood with a large immigrant community told NBC News last week that business was declining due to Trump's policies. His deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, who attended the signing with Vice President JD Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, claimed that people in D.C. had resumed wearing jewelry and carrying purses because of Trump\u2019s anti-crime push.",
      "\"They're wearing jewelry again. They're carrying purses again,\" Miller said. \"People had changed their whole lives in this city for fear of being murdered, mugged and carjacked. It is a literal statement that President Trump has freed 700,000 people in this city who were living under the rule of criminals and thugs.\"",
      "At the start of the operation, though, crime in D.C. was down 26% compared to last year. Many city residents, too, have slammed the deployments and said it is scaring Washingtonians.",
      "The president has frequently claimed that Democrats weaponized the Justice Department and other law enforcement agencies against him, pointing to his criminal indictments related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified documents, as well as his conviction related to falsifying business records, which were dropped when he was elected to a second term. Trump repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the cases against him.",
      "Democrats have gone after Trump's comments, arguing that the Trump administration's several investigations into his political foes constitute the exact weaponization that he claimed they pursued against him.",
      "The Justice Department is investigating Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and New York Attorney General Letitia James on allegations of mortgage fraud.",
      "James led a civil fraud case against Trump, and Schiff served as the lead House manager in Trump's first impeachment trial. They denied any wrongdoing.",
      "NBC News has also previously reported that the Justice Department is in the initial stages of an investigation into James\u2019 handling of her civil fraud case against Trump, which her attorney likened to a \"political retribution campaign.\u201d",
      "Trump also threatened Friday to fire a Federal Reserve governor, Lisa Cook, if she did not resign after facing separate accusations of mortgage fraud. Cook said she won't step down. Trump has been highly critical of the Federal Reserve for not adjusting interest rates as he would like.",
      "Then, late last week, the FBI searched the home of former national security adviser John Bolton. A source familiar with the matter told NBC News at the time that the search was part of a \"national security investigation in search of classified records.\" Bolton did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment Friday.",
      "Also on Monday, Trump left the door open to investigating former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a staunch critic of Trump who was among the Republicans who ran against him for president. Trump was referring to a 12-year-old scandal called \"Bridgegate.\"",
      "\"If they want to look at it, they can,\" Trump said, responding to a question about whether the White House planned to investigate Christie. \"You can ask Pam. I think we have other things to do, but I always thought he got away with murder.\"",
      "On Sunday, after Christie criticized him on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social, \u201cFor the sake of JUSTICE, perhaps we should start looking at that very serious situation again?\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's allies in Congress have pushed to hear testimony from Biden's circle about his mental acuity while in office, which Trump and Republicans claim was in decline but was covered up by the former president's team. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., has sought testimony from Biden's former White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor and former White House aides, including his domestic policy adviser, Neera Tanden and his deputy chief of staff, Annie Tomasini."

      "\"KPop Demon Hunters,\" an animated Netflix movie about a girl group who slays audiences onstage and demons offstage, is packed with songs so infectious that even dads are powerless to resist.",
      "\u201cThis movie is the perfect combo of nostalgia, earworms and never-ending streaming. So we\u2019re screwed,\u201d father, singer and comedian Chris Mann jokes with TODAY.com.",
      "On Aug. 4, Mann posted a TikTok illustrating his growing obsession with the movie. Featuring the song \u201cGolden,\u201d the video has been viewed about 10 million times. It shows Mann going from mild interest on first watch to dramatically singing into a sword on his 10th watch.",
      "\"This is the pop culture moment of the year,\" he says. \"It has broken the internet.\"",
      "The movie has even infiltrated TODAY host Craig Melvin\u2019s household.",
      "\u201cWe watched it this weekend,\u201d joked Craig on Aug. 25. \u201cThe singalong version? They\u2019re not even giving us a chance now.\u201d",
      "The movie may have been initially available only on Netflix, but over the weekend it transferred to physical movie theaters, where it made about $20 million. Six songs from the movie\u2019s soundtrack have taken over Billboard\u2019s Hot 100 chart, with two rising into the top 10 slots, according to Billboard\u2019s website. On Aug. 25, Netflix released a special sing-along edition on its streaming platform.",
      "The fervor doesn't seem to be slowing down.",
      "Mann had been watching the movie on repeat at home with his kids, but he still forked over the money to watch it in the theater with them this weekend.",
      "\"Everybody went. The whole school went,\" he explains. \"It's almost like the school version of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, where you don't want to miss out.\"",
      "The movie has similarly been \u201cblowing up\u201d teacher Rob D\u2019Urbano\u2019s parent group chat. \u201cHonestly, none of us mind that it\u2019s on repeat in our houses,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. \u201cI feel like all the dads are enjoying it.\u201d",
      "Alongside a TikTok video of himself watching the movie even after his three young daughters went to bed, he wrote, \u201cI can\u2019t be the only parent that bops to this movie.\u201d",
      "No, sir. You certainly are not.",
      "Influencer Josh Jones made a TikTok video similar to Mann's showing his evolution from skeptic to believer. He added costumes, wigs and a dance routine to really show his dedication to the film.",
      "For Jones, it's the \"message behind the movie\" that really resonates.",
      "\"There's this really positive message here, where it perfectly portrays the battle between good and evil,\" he says. In fact, he allows the kids to watch the movie on Sunday, a day that he and his wife normally reserve for \"religious\" movies. He says, \"It's complimented our spiritual journey as a family very nicely.\"",
      "As the father of one son and five daughters \u2014 with another daughter on the way \u2014 Jones also appreciates the \"girl power\" theme of the movie. \"Having all of these daughters, that's something that I just really want to support,\" he shares.",
      "The phenomenon isn\u2019t limited to girl dads.",
      "Mann's two sons also love the movie. His 4-year-old sings \"Soda Pop\" and his 8-year-old is trying to teach himself to play the song on the piano by ear. Mann, an actor who played the title role in the the Broadway tour of \"Phantom of the Opera\" for 700 performances, does a mean version of \"Golden.\"",
      "\u201cSomething about these competing boy and girl groups is super nostalgic for millennial parents,\" Mann says. \"We get to relive this fandom all over again through our kids. It\u2019s like our boy band DNA meeting parenting reality.\u201d",
      "Mann adds, \"This Halloween, it's going to be only 'KPop Demon Hunters.' I wish I had stock in this movie.\""

      "\u201cGoing back to my Alberta roots with 15 of my besties was exactly what my soul needed,\u201d Harris wrote in her caption.",
      "\u201cWe made so many unforgettable memories,\" she added. \"From the yummiest food, to morning pilates and canoeing on the lake, dancing to country music, singing, belly laughing, and stories we\u2019ll be telling for years.\u201d"

      "\u201cI\u2019m also a bad actress and a bad liar \u2014 I think people would be able to catch on quickly,\u201d Amaya chimed in. \u201cI\u2019m like, I need Botox after this, he makes me smile this much.\u201d",

      "The rumors began swirling when Bryan was allegedly spotted  with another woman at a nightclub just days after the couple left the villa together.",
      "At the time, the pair seemed to shut down the chatter with a romantic TikTok posted to Bryan\u2019s account. \u201cWhen everyone thinks you\u2019re over meanwhile this is us,\u201d read the caption, accompanying footage of the couple gazing into each other\u2019s eyes before Amaya leaped into Bryan\u2019s arms.",
      "Based on the reunion trailer, Bryan will address the rumors. Here's what to know.",
      "What happened between Amaya and Bryan on \u2018Love Island USA\u2019?",
      "Amaya\u2019s journey to find love in Fiji was far from straightforward.",
      "Entering the villa as a bombshell on Episode 4 alongside Hannah Fields, Amaya originally coupled up with Ace Greene.",
      "While there seemed to be a spark between the pair at first, Ace quickly switched up on Amaya, citing her usage of nicknames (particularly \u201cbabe\u201d) and physical touch as too much, too soon.",
      "From there, Amaya found more connections and obstacles. She coupled up with Austin Shepard on Episode 14, but he, like Ace, began to distance himself from Amaya.",
      "The couple split up when Casa Amor happened on Episode 19, leaving them both single and open to exploring new connections.",
      "Bryan came into the show as a bombshell in Casa Amor, the biggest relationship test of every \u201cLove Island\u201d season. This is where either the men or the women from the main villa are secretly whisked away to a second villa nearby, where they get to meet a group of other singles hoping to find love in Fiji.",
      "In Casa Amor, Bryan quickly hit it off with Andreina. Amaya, meanwhile, was striking up a connection with Zak Srakaew, who also came into the show during Casa Amor. They ultimately coupled up and remained a couple as they went back to the main villa.",
      "However, Zak blindsided Amaya during the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge and gang up on her alongside Austin and Ace, which led to Amaya exploring new connections and hitting it off with Bryan.",
      "Wait, what happened during the \u2018Stand on Business\u2019 challenge?",
      "During the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge in Episode 26, Amaya was confronted by all three men she had previously been coupled up with: Ace, Austin and Zak.",
      "As Amaya stood in front of her peers, she read cards that had been written about her \u2014 specifically about her emotions and how she expressed herself in her relationships.",
      "\u201cYou cry more than needed. You try to move to fast for everyone,\u201d Austin wrote on a card that Amaya had to read in front of the entire villa.",
      "\u201cGod forbid I\u2019m a sensitive gangsta,\u201d Amaya replied (a phrase that became one of her signature one-liners).",
      "\u201cI would just have to say that many people could view this as a weakness, but to me personally, after everything I\u2019ve been through in my life, I view it as a strength,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo if you guys view it like that, then guess what. I\u2019m just not your cup of tea to be drinking, so don\u2019t f------ drink it.\u201d",
      "Austin admitted to writing the card, explaining that after they initially coupled up, \u201cthe intensity of your emotions and feelings and wants just felt like they built way up.\u201d",
      "Ace and Zak decided to join Austin and gang up on Amaya in front of everyone. But what could have been Amaya\u2019s lowest point in the villa actually became a silver lining, as this is where her and Bryan\u2019s story began.",
      "\u201cOne thing I got to add though,\u201d Bryan interjected that night. \u201cComing from a Hispanic household, calling someone \u2018Babe,\u2019 \u2018Mi amor,\u2019 \u2018Mi vida,\u2019 that\u2019s just how we talk. You\u2019re telling her meet you halfway, you got to meet her halfway, too.\u201d",

      "The pair coupled up on Episode 30, and America eventually voted to send them to the Season 7 finale. Viewers got to see their final date and declarations of love, the loving speeches all the final couples give to one another right before the winners are announced.",
      "During their first and final date, Amaya expressed her appreciation for Bryan, especially for how he spoke on her behalf during the \u201cStand on Business\u201d challenge.",
      "\u201cBabe, you don\u2019t understand how much it meant, that moment, like of you standing up for me in the Stand on Business,\u201d she told him. \u201cYou know, like, if my light is too bright for somebody, wear sunglasses or something.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut with you, you looked right into the sun, you know?\u201d she continued.",

I definitely wanted to leave here letting you know that I want to make stuff exclusive with us and prioritize us. I want to continue taking the right steps with you and attacking the outside world with you.\u201d",
      "Are Amaya and Bryan still together now?",
      "The couple publicly confirmed their exclusive relationship after leaving the villa and during a recent profile with TODAY.com. Amaya said she visited Bryan's family in Boston.",

      "But their decision to unfollow each other on Instagram signals serious trouble in paradise.",
      "Adding to the breakup speculation, Amaya reposted a cryptic TikTok video the same day fans noticed the social media snub.",
      "The video says, \"How it feels when you know you have to leave him alone,\" over pictures of  girls crying, alone, or looking forlornly. The caption features a few hashtags, including \"#ex,\" \"#sad,\" and \"#imissyou.\""

    "link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/tv/love-island-mental-health-effects-psychologist-rcna220785",
    "published": "Mon, 25 Aug 2025 13:58:47 GMT",
    "summary": "Expert reveals how Love Island's isolated environment affects contestants' mental health, decision-making, and relationships through psychological manipulation.",
    "story": [
      "Joining \"Love Island\" may seem like the ultimate dream gig \u2014 a trip to Fiji where you bask in the sun all day surrounded by attractive singles, playing what amounts to glorified frat party games with no real-world distractions. Just you, your best bathing suits, and endless tropical sunshine.",
      "But behind this Instagram-perfect facade is a intense psychological experiment.",
      "The hit reality dating show strips participants of modern life's most basic comforts \u2014 no personal phones, no clocks, little privacy \u2014 creating conditions that could fundamentally alter how they think, feel and form relationships.",
      "TODAY.com spoke with Beverley Andre, a licensed psychologist, about how the villa's unique environment could affect contestants' minds and decision-making processes, and why the show has mental health care professionals on set.",
      "Her insights reveal why \"Love Island USA\" relationships can appear and feel so intense in the moment, yet may struggle to survive in the real world.",
      "When Time Stands Still",
      "Perhaps the most disorienting aspect of villa life is the complete absence of time cues. Without clocks or calendars, contestants lose all sense of how long they've actually known each other.",
      "\"When time is distorted, your day can feel like a week,\" Andre says. \"So you're thinking that you have this really deep bond with this person, but it's only been like one day or two days.\"",
      "This temporal confusion accelerates emotional investment in ways that can seem almost comical to viewers. Remember when contestants declare they\u2019re \u201cready to be locked in\u201d after just 48 hours? That\u2019s not just reality TV drama \u2014 it\u2019s psychology in action.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no indication, no cues for you to remember, \u2018You guys just got here. This is brand new,\u2019\u201d Andre says.",
      "The result? Some decisions can be driven more by proximity rather than compatibility.",
      "While \"Love Island's\" relatively tech-free environment might sound like a wellness retreat, it brings both benefits and challenges for contestants.",
      "On the positive side, the absence of digital transactions allows for unprecedented focus.",
      "\"When you aren't surrounded by so much noise, you're able to center in and really focus on your own thoughts,\" Andre says.",
      "Forced introspection can lead to genuine self-discovery and deeper connections.",
      "However, the isolation comes with a major downside: Contestants lose access to established neutral parties. Without the outside perspectives people in the real world often engage with when dating, contestants can become trapped in their own biases and misconceptions.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have neutral sounding boards because technically, the other people there are your competitors,\u201d Andre explains.",
      "When Romance Meets Competition",
      "The villa's unique blend of romantic pursuit and competition creates what Andre calls a \"pressure pot effect.\" Contestants aren't just looking for love, they're fighting for public votes and a cash prize, which fundamentally changes relationship dynamics.",
      "\u201c'How can you gain the fastest connection possible?' becomes the driving question, rather than, 'Is this person right for me?'\u201d Andre says.",
      "The format of the show \u2014\u00a0and the $100,000 cash prize at the end \u2014 can lead people to pursue a relationship for the sake of appearing to be in a strong connection, as opposed to laying the groundwork for a relationship.",
      "(The show aims to \"test\" these motives at the end by forcing one member of the winning couple to decide whether they split the prize money or keep it for themselves, with the goal of proving whether or not they were in the villa for love.)",
      "The constant questioning of motives adds another layer of complexity. As Andre points out, both contestants and viewers, may wonder: \u201cAre you really digging me, or do you just want us to win and look cute?\u201d",
      "Living Under Surveillance",
      "Sharing one bedroom and one bathroom with a house full of strangers, all while being filmed 24/7, would create unprecedented challenges for emotional regulation, Andre says.",
      "\"When you have a hard day at work, sometimes you just need space and time to process without having witnesses,\u201d Andre says. \u201cBut then you can\u2019t, because you have eyes all around you.\u201d",
      "The lack of privacy doesn't just affect comfort. It can actively shape behavior. Contestants must constantly consider how their actions will be perceived by both their fellow Islanders and the viewing public. The result can be emotional shutdown rather than emotional regulation.",
      "For contestants from marginalized groups, this scrutiny carries additional weight. Black women on the show face particular pressure around public perception, which can affect everything from their romantic choices to their physical expressions of affection, Andre says.",
      "\u201cBlack women can\u2019t go on this show and sleep with any of these people or any of these men, because of the public perception around Black women and being overly sexualized,\u201d Andre says.",
      "She cites contestants Olandria Carthen and Chelley Bissainthe, who appeared on Keke Palmer's podcast, \"Baby, This is Keke Palmer,\" on July 22 and spoke to this perception.",
      "During the episode, Palmer asked the former Islanders how often they feel they had to \"tone down\" their emotions and reactions to events in the villa as Black women.",
      "\"It's taken out of context, and I'm a bad guy and I'm a mean girl,\" Olandria responded. \"It\u2019s very exhausting to say the least. I truly feel like initially I had to tone down a lot to not cross over that boundary because a person that looks the opposite of us, as soon as they get emotional it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to cater to this person.\u2019 It\u2019s like bro, what about us? I don\u2019t understand.\"",
      "The 'Challenges'",
      "While \"Love Island\" occasionally includes what Andre calls \"wholesome activities\" that can mirror real relationship milestones, such as family day, some viewers are here for prime reality TV drama. Enter: the challenges.",
      "While many feature elaborate props, costumes and kissing, some can expose interpersonal rifts. For example, the \"Stand on Business\" challenge encouraged contestants to anonymously call out other Islanders, while \u201cHate to Burst Your Bubble\" involved Islanders sorting each other in categories like \"most genuine,\" before revealing how viewers at home ranked them.",
      "Andre says while these challenges are entertaining for the viewer, they can cause emotional harm to the islanders participating in them. She uses Season 7's infamous Heart Rate challenge, which involves Islanders dressing in costume and acting out to try and raise their fellow contestants' heart rates the most, as an example.",
      "\"These situations \u2014 do they really have the time to process?\" Andre says. \"Granted, they\u2019re with each other 24 hours a day, but do they have the capacity and the space to process?\"",
      "The Heart Rate challenge led to a feud between Huda Mustafa and Chelley, after several people in the villa thought Huda went too far while dancing with Ace, the other half of Chelley's couple.",
      "\"'Wow, we just had this experience, and I\u2019m in this relationship, but there are some things that happened in that challenge that made me feel, you know, really jealous, or I felt very humiliated,'\" Andre explains of how Islanders may process these situations. \"'You\u2019re saying that you\u2019re really feeling me, or you love me, but then someone else was kissing up on you, and I don\u2019t know how to react to that, right?'\"",
      "Reality Check: Transitioning Back to the Real World",
      "Perhaps the most significant psychological challenge may come after the cameras stop rolling, when contestants must process an intense, highly controlled experience while navigating new relationships under public scrutiny.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re still processing the whole experience,\u201d Andre says.",
      "The villa\u2019s emotional intensity, combined with challenges that may have triggered feelings of jealousy or humiliation, would require serious psychological work to unpack.",
      "Add in the pressures of newfound fame, social media attention and public investment in their relationships, and it\u2019s no wonder \"Love Island\" couples can struggle post-villa.",
      "\u201cIf they\u2019re really down for the cause and down for the relationship, I would imagine they\u2019re in therapy,\u201d Andre says."

    "story": [
      "\"The Hunting Wives\" is now a Netflix phenomenon, a star-studded series about southern housewives behaving badly \u2014\u00a0and they're packing more than booze and gossip.",
      "But it all began with a story author May Cobb's mother told her once, while they were driving down the blacktop roads of Longview, her Texas hometown. Cobb's eventual 2021 novel, \"The Hunting Wives,\" went on to inspire the series, first produced for Starz.",
      "\"My mom is such a good storyteller. She started telling me how in high school some of the rich boys would invite her to something called 'the hunting party,'\" Cobb says, speaking to TODAY.com. \"Basically, they would go out to the roofs of their giant cars and try to shoot small game.\"",
      "Cobb, hearing the story, immediately thought of everything that could go wrong with the scenario, and there was a lot. Then it clicked: She wanted to write a novel about it.",
      "\"But I want to swap out the rich boys for women. I want to subvert to 'Texas boys club' and let the women behave badly for a change,\" she remembers thinking.",
      "It's the story of Sophie (Brittany Snow in the series), a Texas transplant who becomes enmeshed in a dynamic friend group in her new town. When a teenage girl winds up dead, they're implicated, although the ending in Cobb's novel is different.",
      "Cobb set the story in a town like the one she grew up in, two hours east of Dallas, in a part of Texas close to the Louisiana border. She describes it as \"eerily beautiful noir,\" a place where Spanish moss hangs from trees and everyone knows everyone's name and history.",
      "She calls the character of Margo, portrayed by Malin \u00c5kerman in the show, a risk-taking and boundary-pushing woman whom Sophie befriends, an \"archetypal east Texas woman\" in the book, but also in the show.",
      "\"It's a party town. The people from my town are high-spirited and fun. I remember one of my editor's notes was, 'Do people drink this much?' And I said, 'I actually toned it down,'\" she says, laughing.",
      "She wanted the book to feel like a \"train wreck\" and a \"downward spiral.\" She was writing when her son was a little kid, and since she was no longer going out for ladies' nights, put the feeling of nights out in the book.",
      "\"I think I went a little too far, but it was so much fun to, like, skew that moral compass and not have to worry about it at all,\" she says.",

      "But Drake has had a longstanding history with the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, receiving five Grammys and 55 nominations over the years. He also served as both performer and presenter prior to his critiques.",
      "The \u201cFamily Matters\u201d rapper\u2019s criticism of the Grammys began in 2017, when his hit \u201cHotline Bling\u201d won best rap song and best rap/sung performance. Drake slammed the Grammys for categorizing the song as rap, as opposed to pop.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a Black artist, I\u2019m apparently a rapper, even though \u2018Hotline Bling\u2019 is not a rap song,\u201d Drake said during in an interview with U.K. DJ Semtex. \u201cThe only category that they can manage to fit me in is in a rap category, maybe because I\u2019ve rapped in the past or because I\u2019m black. I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d",
      "In 2019, the last time Drake attended the Grammys, he accepted the award for best rap song for \u201cGod\u2019s Plan\u201d and gave a pointed acceptance speech about how he and the other artists there that night \u201cplay in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport.\u201d",
      "After his album \u201cCertified Lover Boy\u201d was nominated in 2022 for best rap album and his single \u201cWay 2 Sexy\u201d was nominated for best rap performance, Drake asked the Recording Academy to remove his work from the nominations. The Academy honored Drake\u2019s request and the rapper didn\u2019t attend the awards show.",
      "In 2023, although Drake refused to submit his 2022 album, \u201cHonestly, Nevermind,\u201d or any of its songs for consideration by the Grammys, he received four nominations. Once again, however, Drake boycotted the awards show.",
      "In 2024, Drake received four Grammy nominations for his joint 2022 album with 21 Savage, \u201cHer Loss.\u201d Per the Grammys, Drake \u201csubmitted material for nomination for the 2024 GRAMMYs,\u201d but the rapper, who did not attend that year, ultimately did not take home an award.",

      "After his his \u201cBlinding Lights\u201d and \u201cAfter Hours\u201d were snubbed from nominations at the 2021 ceremony, The Weeknd announced he would not submit his work to Recording Academy.",
      "He told The New York Times at the time that he will \u201cno longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys\u201d due to \u201csecret committees\u201d involved in the nomination process.",
      "From 2022 to 2024, the singer boycotted the award show, until an unexpected return this past year, when the Weeknd sang \u201cCry For Me\u201d and \u201cTimeless\u201d with Playboi Carti from his new album, \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Irish singer-songwriter and activist Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor first performed at the Grammys in 1989, just two years before writing an open letter to the Recording Academy, criticizing \u201cfalse and destructive materialistic values.\u201d",

      "Directing her message to both the Academy and the industry at large, O'Connor wrote, per the Los Angeles Times, \u201cThey acknowledge mostly the commercial side of art. They respect mostly material gain, since that is the main reason for their existence. And they have created a great respect among artists for material gain--by honoring us and exalting us when we achieve it, ignoring for the most part those of us who have not.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Connor won the best alternative music performance Grammy in 1991 for her album, \u201cI Do Not Want What I Haven\u2019t Got,\u201d but refused to accept the award, marking the first time in Grammys history that an artist rejected a win.",
      "O\u2019Connor's letter led to waves of artists refusing to attend the awards show.",
      "When best rap performance by a duo or group was not televised at the 1991 Grammys \u2014 following the award show's history of not televising wins in the rap category \u2014 nominee Public Enemy decided to boycott the show and released their own statement, via their label head Russell Simmons, that year.",
      "When Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid accepted the 1991 win for Best Hard Rock Performance, he donned a T-shirt displaying a giant photo of O\u2019Connor.",
      "In 2022, Bruno Mars told Rolling Stone that he and Anderson .Paak, who together make up R&B duo Silk Sonic, withdrew their album, \u201cAn Evening with Silk Sonic\u201d from Grammys consideration.",
      "\u201cWe truly put our all on this record, but Silk Sonic would like to gracefully, humbly and most importantly, sexually, bow out of submitting our album this year,\u201d Mars told the outlet. \u201cWe hope we can celebrate with everyone on a great year of music and partake in the party. Thank you for letting Silk Sonic thrive.\u201d",
      "The two artists did not attend the 2023 ceremony.",
      "Mars has received 33 Grammy nominations and 16 wins. His last win was at this past year\u2019s ceremony in best pop duo/group performance for \u201cDie With a Smile,\u201d his duet with Lady Gaga.",
      "Why Are Artists Removing Themselves From Grammy Consideration?",
      "While some artist have removed their work from future considerations after past snubs, others have took a stronger stance against the Recording Academy.",
      "While Drake has been vocal about his message that a Grammy win \u201cdoesn\u2019t dictate s---- in our world\u201d as an artist, he has also made reference to his frustration with the Grammys in his music. In his 2023 collaboration with J. Cole, \u201cFirst Person Shooter,\u201d Drake boasts, \u201cI told Jimmy Jam I use a Grammy as a door stop.\u201d",
      "When The Weeknd refused to submit his work for Grammys consideration in 2021, he referred to \u201csecret committees\u201d involved in the nomination process when talking to The New York Times.",
      "In O'Connor's 1991 open letter to the Recording Academy, she wrote that they \u201cacknowledge mostly the commercial side of art. They respect mostly material gain, since that is the main reason for their existence.\u201d She added that the industry has \u201ccreated a great respect among artists for material gain--by honoring us and exalting us when we achieve it, ignoring for the most part those of us who have not.\u201d",
      "In response, per the LA Times, former president of the Academy Michael Greene, said they \u201capplaud that Sinead feels so strongly about these issues and believe that her convictions only add to the seriousness of her work,\u201d while suggesting she \u201cmay be misguided.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid that Sinead may not be properly informed about the difference between the overtly commercial aspects of popularity contests as opposed to the Grammys, which are voted on by the creative community.\u201d",
      "In a later interview with LA Times, however, O\u2019Connor said, despite directing the letter to the Academy, she was \u201cnot criticizing the Grammys in particular,\u201d clarifying, \u201cI am criticizing the music industry. I am criticizing my peers . . . artists who are not doing their job.\u201d"

      "In an Aug. 18 Instagram post, the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region in Colorado Springs shared several photos of adoptable cats along with which \u201cSex and the City\u201d character they were most like, and why.",
      "The post was accompanied by a hilarious caption to mark the end of the show\u2019s sequel series, \u201cAnd Just Like That,\u201d which concluded Aug. 14.",
      "\u201cAnd Just Like That has finally come to an end, which means we\u2019ll never again witness Carrie Bradshaw chain-smoking in a tutu while making life-ruining decisions in $500 shoes,\u201d the caption read in part. \u201cTragic. But dry your martini glass tears, because the three orange cats who run this account have graciously taken it upon themselves to entertain you by categorizing our shelter cats as Carries, Mirandas, Charlottes, and Samanthas.\u201d",
      "The Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region boasted that the selections were \u201cscientifically accurate results,\u201d adding, \u201cWe will not be taking questions. You are what you are (and let\u2019s be real, you\u2019re probably a Miranda).\u201d",
      "Despite that, Carrie Bradshaw took home the win with four cats meeting the criteria of New York City\u2019s resident dating columnist-turned novelist.",
      "For orange cat Stevie, it's due to a complete disregard for understanding \u2014 and learning anything about \u2014 money, being the \u201chot party girl despite being deeply weird\u201d and calling her boyfriend at three in the morning to \u201cyell at him about nothing.\u201d",
      "Pop Tart brings \u201cpure unhinged chaos\u201d to the party, while Ashlynn has uncontainable \u201ctruly bizarre energy\u201d and makes \u201cderanged\u201d statements she thinks are \u201cprofound\u201d thoughts. As for Astrid, well, the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region said \u201cno further explanation\u201d was needed.",
      "Penelope, Kitty and Bubba were all deemed Mirandas for their more pragmatic nature.",
      "Case in point, much like Miranda Hobbes, Penelope is \u201cjudgmental, but usually right\u201d and needs a \u201cchill, patient person to balance\u201d her out. Kitty has low tolerance for \u201cstupid people\u201d and may seem like a \u201cgirlboss on the surface\u201d though all she wants is to \u201ccuddle on the couch with takeout,\u201d while Bubba is seeking a partner who is \u201cextremely non-clingy.\u201d",
      "Charlotte York is embodied by Chyna, Midnight and Jericko.",
      "Chyna is the type who \u201cwould dump someone instantly over the wrong china pattern\u201d and doesn\u2019t have a problem \u201cacting helpless\u201d to get more attention. Midnight is a \u201chopeless romantic\u201d (derogatory) who \u201cdesperately need a nice, stable bald man\u201d to keep him grounded. Jericko holds a secret disco obsession and binge-watches Elizabeth Taylor documentaries to get her out of a slump.",
      "Only two cats embodied the elusive essence of Samantha Jones: Fairweather Fred and Purrpuss. Fairweather Fred emanates \u201cmagnetic energy,\u201d can ruin a mimosa at brunch with a shocking statement but is \u201csecretly the kindest and most stable friend.\u201d",
      "Purrpuss has a similar vibe, including the ability to throw a martini at someone and carry on as if nothing happened, lie about his age (but get away with it) and is \u201ctoo cool for most people\u201d while letting them know it.",
      "In the comments section, Instagram users reveled in the silly post, with another rescue writing, \u201chow do you even come up with these ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cBig, big (no, not *that* \u201cBig\u201d) kudos to the copywriter\u2026 who is SLAYING,\u201d another Instagram user wrote.",
      "Another user wrote, \u201cHeavy on the JUDGEMENTAL BUT USUALLY RIGHT.\u201d",
      "And when one user commented, \u201cHot take: all cats are Mirandas \u2014 always providing side-eye,\u201d the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region had the perfect comeback.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know about that,\u201d the response read. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of Carries that are not aware enough of their surroundings to give side eye.\u201d"

      "\"You know when you're in your 20s, you try to, I don't know, you almost try to do what wasn't trendy. Because a lot of the trends were, I'm sorry, they were awful,\" she said. \"I just wanted to be my own self, and I was also very into recycling and showing people that you can look good and not spend a ton of money.",
      "\"Things are not meant to be worn only once,\" added Ryder. \"That was what always drove me nuts about the events. I remember re-wearing things a lot and apparently that was looked down upon sometimes. I thought it was a great thing.\""

      "But its new president, Lee Jae Myung, met with Trump on Monday touting a $150 billion offering whose name is sure to appeal to the U.S. leader: \u201cMake America Shipbuilding Great Again.\u201d",
      "The package, which South Korean officials also refer to as MASGA, includes the construction of new U.S. shipyards, the training of shipbuilding personnel and U.S. Navy ship maintenance.",
      "It\u2019s a key part of the last-minute trade deal South Korea struck last month with Trump, who says he wants to revitalize U.S. shipbuilding for both economic and national security reasons. Trade and security will be high on the agenda at his summit with Lee, which comes amid growing tensions with China and North Korea.",
      "A White House official said before their meeting that Trump \u201clooks forward to hosting\u201d Lee and they would \u201cdiscuss North Korea, defense posture, trade barriers, maritime security, American shipbuilding, energy dominance, and more.\u201d",
      "Trump himself injected a note of uncertainty into the day's meeting Monday by posting on Truth Social: \"WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOUTH KOREA? Seems like a Purge or Revolution. We can\u2019t have that and do business there.\"",
      "It was not clear what Trump was referring to. Later, speaking to reporters at the White House during their meeting, Trump explained simple that he had \"heard from Intel that there was a raid on churches. We\u2019re going to talk about that later.\"",
      "After decades of industry decline, the U.S. now accounts for less than 1% of the global shipbuilding sector, according to the Rand national security think tank, compared with 50% for China, 30% for South Korea and 10% for Japan. South Korean equipment, designs and knowledge could help put the U.S. back on the map.",
      "On Tuesday, Lee and possibly Trump will visit a Philadelphia shipyard acquired last year by the South Korean conglomerate Hanwha Group.",
      "The shipbuilding initiative is \u201ca strategic and symbolic win\u201d for South Korea as well as the U.S., said Eun A Jo, an assistant professor of government at William & Mary and director of its Asia Policy Lab.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a smart move to try and secure influence in a critical American sector, while at the same time countering Chinese expansion in global maritime infrastructure,\u201d she told NBC News in a phone interview Sunday.",
      "No 'bromance' expected",
      "The White House summit is an important opportunity for Lee to advocate South Korea\u2019s interests with Trump after months of political instability created by former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s botched declaration of martial law.",
      "Though Lee comes from a liberal party, he and Trump share much in common \u2014 both have been the subjects of assassination attempts, and both are more open to diplomacy with nuclear-armed North Korea than their predecessors.",
      "But they have very different outlooks on political, economic and foreign policy, which could make the summit challenging, said Bae Jong-chan, president of Insight K, a private think tank in Seoul.",
      "\u201cOne will not be able to expect bromance between President Lee and President Trump,\u201d he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The relationship has already been strained by Trump\u2019s tariffs on South Korea, the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy, which has a large trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Trump said last month that the U.S. tariff on South Korean imports would be 15%, down from the 25% he had threatened earlier. He said South Korea, which does not impose any tariffs on U.S. goods, managed to \u201cbuy down\u201d the U.S. tariff by promising $450 billion in U.S. investment and energy purchases, including the $150 billion shipbuilding fund.",
      "Jo said Lee is seeking to lock in the terms favorable to South Korea in the trade deal, which remains unwritten and largely unclear.",
      "\u201cI think he wants that to be firm and solid, to have at least some sense of predictability and stability in their economic relations,\u201d she said.",
      "More tricky are questions about South Korea\u2019s longstanding security alliance with the U.S. and its position on China.",
      "Trump wants South Korea to take more responsibility for its own defense, freeing up the almost 30,000 U.S. service members stationed there to focus more on containing China, Washington\u2019s biggest strategic rival.",
      "South Korea worries that such a shift could leave it more exposed to threats from North Korea, as well as increase the chances it could be drawn into a potential U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "Though Lee strongly supports the decades-old U.S.-South Korea alliance, he also has to balance relations with China, South Korea\u2019s main trading partner.",
      "On Sunday, a special envoy told Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing that South Korea hopes to normalize relations with China after years of tension.",
      "Lee has long been vocal about his reluctance to take sides between the U.S. and China, and his pragmatic approach to South Korea-China relations \u201cis unlikely to sit comfortably with President Trump,\u201d Bae said.",
      "Lee makes U.S. his second stop",
      "Before heading to Washington, Lee stopped in Tokyo for a summit with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba in his first foreign visit since being elected president in June.",

      "Lee and Ishiba, whose countries have historically been at odds, agreed at their summit to improve bilateral ties so they can better coordinate with the U.S. against China and North Korea.",
      "Despite interest from Washington and Seoul, North Korea has dismissed the idea of further denuclearization talks, saying Trump must accept it as a nuclear power. The Trump-Lee summit comes as the U.S. and South Korean militaries are holding annual joint exercises that North Korea condemns as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "Bae said Lee is \u201clikely to walk away from the summit with detailed homework\u201d on North Korea, tariffs, military cost-sharing and the role of U.S. troops in South Korea, among other issues.",
      "If he \u201cfails to deliver as President Trump sees fit,\u201d Trump may protest by skipping the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting South Korea is hosting this fall.",

      "There is little public evidence, however, that Russian President Vladimir Putin has moved his ambitions an inch since launching his full-scale invasion in February 2022.",
      "Vance told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that the Kremlin had been \u201cflexible on some of their core demands\u201d \u2014 namely recognizing \u201cthat they are not going to be able to install a puppet regime\u201d in Kyiv, and \u201cthat there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d",
      "That appears at odds with Russian officials, who have spent the days since the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska pushing back on both of these points.",
      "Also on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d was Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who \u2014 while not advocating the installation of a Russian puppet \u2014 made no secret of Moscow\u2019s belief that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is illegitimate.",
      "Russia was open to Ukraine having security guarantees, Lavrov said last week \u2014 but only if the Kremlin can play a role in them, arguably rendering them useless.",
      "\"We cannot agree\" to \"resolve collective security issues without the Russian Federation. This will not work,\" he said at a news conference. \"I am sure that in the West and above all in the United States they understand perfectly well that seriously discussing security issues without the Russian Federation is a utopia, a road to nowhere.\"",
      "Far from being a new and significant concession, Lavrov made clear that the security guarantees should be based on talks held in Istanbul, in 2022.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Russia has made compromises.",
      "Despite Lavrov's trenchant remarks, there may be subtle hints that Putin is ready to do a deal \u2014 and that's without knowing what has gone on behind closed doors.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know what was said at Alaska, that\u2019s the problem,\" Mark Galeotti, the British-based director of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence, told NBC News. \"It may well be that what Vance is saying reflects what Putin said there.\u201d",
      "Though Russian officials remain steadfast, Russia\u2019s tightly controlled media have been noticeably less critical of the usually vilified Zelenskyy, he said. And academics close to the Kremlin have suggested there may be some wiggle-room to the Kremlin\u2019s demands."

While forecasters can predict with high accuracy which state or province might see heavy rain, cloudbursts can be difficult to predict due to their local nature, short duration and suddenness \u2014 making them the site of heavy destruction and fatalities.",

    "story": [
      "The first human case of the flesh-eating parasite \"New World screwworm \"has been detected in the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services said early Monday.",
      "The case, involving a person who had recently traveled to El Salvador, was confirmed to be screwworm by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maryland Health Department on Aug. 4.",
      "The Maryland Health Department said in a statement Monday that the resident has recovered \"from the infection, and the investigation confirmed there is no indication of transmission to any other individuals or animals.\"",
      "\"This is the first human case of travel-associated New World screwworm myiasis (parasitic infestation of fly larvae) from an outbreak-affected country identified in the United States,\" HHS spokesperson Emily G. Hilliard said in a statement.",
      "\"The risk to public health in the United States from this introduction is very low,\" he said.",
      "The parasite \u2014 the larva of the New World screwworm fly \u2014 can devastate cattle herds and is rife in parts of Central America and Mexico. It can destroy wildlife and even kill household pets.",
      "There were serious outbreaks in the 1980s and the 1990s in Central America, and it was eradicated at great expense, only to return in the last two years.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke L. Rollins traveled to Texas to announce a five-part plan to combat the screwworm on Aug. 15",
      "It includes plans to breed billions of sterile flies and dump them from the air over southern Texas and Mexico in the hope of stopping the parasite's spread.",
      "The sterilized male flies mate with females, but the eggs don't hatch. Eventually, the population reduces and dies out. The technique worked in the 1960s when the United States suffered its last screwworm outbreak.",
      "And the federal government may face calls to accelerate its work: When it was  first announced in June, the sterilization plan wasn't due to be operational for \"two to three years.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbot, commenting on the federal government scheme, said the state agriculture industry, with its 2 million jobs, was worth $867 billion. \"All of this is at risk because of the New World screwworm,\" he said.",
      "A report from the Agriculture Department last year estimated an outbreak of screwworm could cost Texas at least $1.8 billion in livestock deaths, labor costs and medication.",
      "The little parasitic flies \u2014 also known as Cochliomyia hominivorax \u2014 have an effect that's vast and devastating but in isolation quite disgusting. The females can lay eggs in any warm-blooded animal, which then hatch, unleashing hundreds of screwworm larvae, so-called because of their sharp mouths and their burrowing being compared to the motion of a screw.",
      "Human infections can be fatal but are rare, and most cases can be treated.",
      "The Agriculture Department has said screwworms have been making their way north into Mexico from other parts of Central America. The fly is endemic in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and some South American nations, it said.",
      "Mexico reported a case in Ixhuatl\u00e1n de Madero, Veracruz, last month, 370 miles from the Texas border, prompting Health and Human Services to immediately shut down cross-border cattle trade, following similar stops in November and May."

      "LONDON \u2014 France has summoned the American ambassador to Paris after he wrote a letter to President Emmanuel Macron alleging that the country had not taken \u201csufficient action\u201d to combat antisemitism.",
      "France\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement Sunday that it had summoned Charles Kushner to appear Monday over his criticism, which it said was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "It said that \u201cFrance firmly rejects these allegations\u201d and that French authorities have \u201cfully mobilized\u201d to combat the \"intolerable\" rise in antisemitic acts over the past two years.",
      "The French ministry said Kushner\u2019s allegations violated international law and the obligation not to interfere with the internal affairs of another country. \u201cThey also fall short of the quality of the transatlantic partnership between France and the United States and of the trust that must prevail between allies,\" it said.",
      "The episode is the latest sign of a growing divide between the United States and its longtime partners in Europe. It comes as Washington's close ally, Israel, increasingly clashes with Western countries amid fallout from its military assault on Gaza.",
      "\u201cAntisemitism has long scarred French life, but it has exploded since Hamas\u2019s barbaric assault on Oct. 7, 2023,\u201d Kushner wrote in an open letter in The Wall Street Journal on Sunday.",
      "\u201cPublic statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France,\u201d added Kushner, who is Jewish.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Sunday evening that the State Department stood by Kushner\u2019s comments, according to The Associated Press. \u201cAmbassador Kushner is our U.S. government representative in France and is doing a great job advancing our national interests in that role,\u201d he said.",
      "France said last month that it plans to recognize a Palestinian state in September, while other traditional allies of Israel, such as Australia and Canada, have said they will do the same.",
      "Last week, Macron denounced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's accusations that the move was fueling antisemitism, calling the suggestion \"abject\" and \"erroneous.\"",
      "France is home to the largest Jewish population in Europe, with an estimated 500,000 Jews, the third-largest Jewish population in the world after Israel and the United States. That is about 1% of the national population.",
      "In his letter, Kushner said that French Jews are living in fear and that Macron should act decisively to protect them, adding that he stands ready to work with French leaders across the country to \u201cforge a serious plan that addresses the roots of antisemitism and defeats it.\u201d",
      "\u201cToday, many French Jews fear that history will repeat itself in Europe,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cMr. President, I urge you to act decisively: enforce hate-crime laws without exception; ensure the safety of Jewish schools, synagogues and businesses, prosecute offenders to the fullest extent; and abandon steps that give legitimacy to Hamas and its allies.\u201d",
      "Kushner, a real estate developer, is the father of President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner. He said during his confirmation hearing in May this year that he was \u201cdedicated to building an even stronger relationship\u201d between the United States and France.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term in the Oval Office, he pardoned Kushner, who pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations."

      "Vice President JD Vance remains confident the U.S. can broker an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine despite potential hang-ups that have emerged since President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve already seen some significant concessions from both sides, just in the last few weeks,\u201d Vance said in an exclusive interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Vance also weighed in on a Russian missile strike in western Ukraine overnight Thursday that hit an electronics factory owned by a U.S.-based company. Asked by moderator Kristen Welker if he was \u201cenraged\u201d by the strike, which the company said injured  several workers, Vance pivoted to a criticism of former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Vance said of the assault. \u201cBut this is a war, and this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don\u2019t like. A lot of civilians have died. We\u2019ve condemned that stuff from the get-go and, frankly, President Trump has done more to apply pressure and to apply economic leverage to the Russians, certainly, than Joe Biden did for 3 \u00bd years, when he did nothing but talk, did nothing to bring the killing to a stop. So you asked me what I\u2019m enraged by? What I\u2019m enraged by is the continuation of the war.\u201d",
      "Trump told reporters Friday that he was not happy about the strikes on western Ukraine and indicated that any peace deal between the countries could be weeks away.",
      "\u201cI think over the next two weeks, we\u2019re going to find out which way it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Trump said.",
      "During his interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Vance did not characterize the strike, and a number of other issues, as long-term hindrances to peace, saying there was still plenty of room for negotiation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we\u2019re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,\u201d Vance added. \u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close.\u201d",
      "Welker then asked Vance what the pressure is on Russia if the U.S. is not \u201cimposing new sanctions.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow do you get them to a place of getting to the table with Zelenskyy and stopping to drop bombs?\u201d she asked.",
      "Vance replied by saying Trump has applied \u201caggressive economic leverage,\u201d such as \u201csecondary tariffs on India, to try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d",
      "Asked by Welker if he could guarantee that the U.S. would not send troops to help enforce any peace deal, Vance reaffirmed Trump\u2019s opposition to such a deployment.",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThere are not going to be boots on the ground in Ukraine. But we are going to continue to play an active role in trying to ensure that the Ukrainians have the security guarantees and the confidence they need to stop the war on their end and the Russians feel like they can bring the war to a conclusion on their end.\u201d",
      "The interview, which aired Sunday, comes amid new, heightened tensions in the effort to end the war.",
      "On Friday, Russia\u2019s top diplomat told NBC News that no meetings between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been scheduled, raising further doubts about Trump\u2019s ability to mediate the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, details about security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and Russia\u2019s role in shaping them \u2014 remain unresolved.",
      "In the interview, Vance said he doesn\u2019t believe the Russians are stringing Trump along.",
      "\u201cI think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in 3 \u00bd years of this conflict,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands. They\u2019ve talked about what would be necessary to end the war.\u201d",
      "Trump, Vance added, stepped up efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution \u201cbecause this war is not in anyone\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not in Europe or the United States\u2019 interest.\u201d",
      "While acknowledging some of the hurdles that have popped up since Trump\u2019s Aug. 15 meeting with Putin in Alaska, Vance expressed optimism that persistence would deliver results.",
      "\u201cThere are hills and valleys to the negotiations,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe sometimes feel like we\u2019ve made great progress with the Russians, and sometimes, as the president has said, he\u2019s been very frustrated with the Russians. We\u2019re going to keep on doing what we have to do to bring this thing to a close. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen overnight. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress. But, ultimately, whether the killing stops, that determination is going to belong to whether the Russians and Ukrainians can actually find some middle ground here.\u201d",
      "Putin has rejected calls \u2014 including from Trump before their recent meeting \u2014 for a ceasefire.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say they conceded on everything,\u201d Vance said in the interview, referring to Russia. \u201cBut what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They\u2019ve recognized that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. \u2026 Have they made every concession? Of course they haven\u2019t. Should they have started the war? Of course they [shouldn\u2019t have], but we\u2019re making progress.\u201d",
      "Asked about disagreements surrounding how involved Russia will be in establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Vance asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of talking past each other here.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re not talking about security guarantees until after the war has come to a close,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd, of course, the Russians are going to be a part of the conversation about bringing that war to a close. So, of course, they\u2019re going to have some stake in this.\u201d",
      "The interview with Vance also touched on several domestic issues, including new congressional maps passed by the Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives that could pad the GOP\u2019s majority by as many as five seats. The issue has become a political flashpoint, with California Democrats preparing retaliatory moves and other states aiming to redraw maps, too.",
      "\u201cAll we\u2019re doing, frankly, is trying to make the situation a little bit more fair on a national scale,\u201d Vance said of GOP efforts. \u201cThe Democrats have gerrymandered their states really aggressively. We think there are opportunities to push back against that, and that\u2019s really all we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "On the subject of his own political ambitions, Vance again sidestepped questions about whether he sees himself as Trump\u2019s heir apparent in 2028, when the president is term-limited.",
      "\u201cI see myself as a vice president who\u2019s trying to do a good job for the American people ... and if I do a good job, and if the president continues to be successful, as I know that he will be, the politics will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe can cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d",
      "Welker asked if Vance has discussed the possibility with Trump.",
      "\u201cAs you know, the president talks about everything, and if it\u2019s in the news, the president and I have certainly discussed it,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cBut I think the president is just focused on doing a good job for the American people. He wants me to be focused on doing a good job for the American people. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep on doing.\u201d"

      "The end of the exemption is being extended worldwide after the loophole was closed in May for packages from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "Under the new rules, personal gifts worth less than $100 will still be duty-free, but all other packages will face the same tariffs as standard imports from their country of origin.",

      "Postal providers in Belgium, Denmark and New Zealand are among several operators that have already suspended shipments of packages to the U.S. until they can retool their systems to comply with the new rules. Letters and documents are generally unaffected.",
      "Services in Germany, France, Britain and India have announced they will follow suit in the coming days.",
      "France\u2019s national postal service, La Poste, said in a statement that the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time to prepare for new customs procedures.

      "It said the number of de minimis parcels jumped from 134 million in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024 as shippers \u201cdeceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties,  inspection, and U.S. law.\u201d",
      "Most of those packages came from mainland China and Hong Kong, which the Trump administration initially targeted as part of efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value goods from China-linked retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "The White House briefly closed the loophole for mainland China and Hong Kong in February, but quickly extended the deadline to May 2 amid confusion over how the new duties would be collected."

      "Although the English-dubbed version may do better in the U.S. than the earlier Chinese-only release with English subtitles, which earned about $20 million, Zeng said that if \u201cNe Zha II\u201d succeeds with international viewers it is likely to stem more from its domestic acclaim and novelty than from genuine interest in Chinese mythology.",
      "Zeng said while she expects some reviews in the U.S. will criticize the film as Chinese propaganda, other viewers may just watch it out of curiosity.",
      "Kevin Ma, a veteran observer of the film industry who is based in Hong Kong, said another challenge \u201cNe Zha II\u201d faces in its latest release is the tight theatrical window in today\u2019s streaming-dominated market.",
      "New films may capture public attention for only one or two months before moving to streaming platforms, said Ma, who is also a film festival consultant.",
      "Even though \u201cNe Zha II\u201d came out only at the beginning of this year, it almost seems \u201clike a distant memory now\u201d because of consumers\u2019 \u201cshorter attention span\u201d in the streaming age, he said."

    "story": [
      "Famine was officially declared on Friday in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world's leading authority on hunger as Israel vowed to raze the area if Hamas doesn't agree to its terms.",
      "The declaration of famine by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, comes as deaths from starvation rise across the Palestinian enclave in a spiraling crisis under Israel's military assault and aid restrictions.",
      "Israel's military is preparing to push ahead with a new operation to seize Gaza City that could displace hundreds of thousands of people and worsen the dire situation there. It has launched intense strikes on the city this week after announcing it had begun the first stage of its planned assault.",
      "Famine declared",
      "The IPC, an internationally recognized system for classifying food insecurity and malnutrition, said in its report that famine had been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate \u2014 and that it was projected to expand to the Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates farther south by the end of September if the humanitarian situation does not change.",
      "The number of people now experiencing famine in Gaza was nearly 514,000, the IPC said \u2014 around a quarter of the enclave's population. That was projected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.",
      "\"Famine is a race against time,\" the IPC said. \"An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to enabling an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response to save lives.\"",
      "The United Nations-backed body had up until now only declared famine on four other occasions since it was first established in 2004, most recently in Sudan last year.",
      "The report's findings were met with little surprise by global health authorities and humanitarian groups.",
      "\u201cFamine warnings have been clear for months,\u201d said Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,\u201d said World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cThe world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forcefully rejected the report's findings, calling them a \"lie,\" and repeated that \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation.\"",
      "The IPC's 59-page report does not state that Israel has a policy of starvation in Gaza.",
      "Earlier, Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC had published a \u201cfabricated report to fit Hamas\u2019s fake campaign.\u201d It hit out at the IPC\u2019s methods, accusing it of having \u201ctwisted its own rules and ignored its own criteria.\u201d",
      "The IPC rejected Israel\u2019s accusation.",
      "Mike Huckabee, the United States' ambassador to Israel, attacked the famine declaration before it was officially announced.",
      "\"You know who IS starving? The hostages kidnapped and tortured by uncivilized Hamas savages,\" he said in a post on X early Friday.",
      "Famine, the highest phase of the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale, is classified when an area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition and at least two people or four children out of every 10,000 people are dying each day from starvation.",
      "But the bar can also be met if 15% of children are considered to be suffering from acute malnutrition based on mid-upper arm circumference with evidence of rapidly worsening underlying drivers, according to the IPC, which cited the latter practice in its report.",
      "The IPC said that this did not mean it had altered its threshold for famine, saying it used this method in line with established standards where a lack of other data is available, as it had also done in South Sudan.",
      "This \"does not represent a 'lowered threshold' in IPC methodology. Instead, it demonstrates the continued application of established IPC standards,\" it said.",
      "Israel has repeatedly denied reports of growing starvation in Gaza, while seeking to blame any hunger in the enclave on humanitarian groups and Hamas.",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza intensified after Israel launched a blockade on March 2, in the middle of its ceasefire with Hamas, barring the entry of food and other vital supplies for more than two months. It lifted the blockade in May, but only allowed a basic amount of aid in for weeks after that.",
      "Data published by COGAT states that in the weeks since Israel lifted its blockade on May 19 to August 17, when the database was last updated, 9,165 trucks carrying aid entered the enclave, with food making up just over 95% of the supplies.",
      "That boils down to an average of around 100 trucks carrying aid per day during that time period. Prior to Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, around 500 trucks per day were entering the enclave, according to humanitarian groups.",
      "Israel threatens 'gates of hell'",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed Friday to open the \u201cgates of hell\u201d on Gaza City until Hamas agreed to Israel\u2019s conditions for ending the war, including the release of all hostages and the militant group's complete disarmament.",
      "If not, he said, the city would \u201cbecome like Rafah and Beit Hanoun,\u201d areas that have been largely reduced to ruins under Israel\u2019s 22-month offensive.",
      "Netanyahu said a day earlier that he had authorized the operation to take over Gaza City, while also revealing he had instructed \u201cimmediate negotiations\u201d to begin for a deal to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages who remain held in the enclave.",
      "The video statement followed days of silence after Hamas announced it had accepted a ceasefire proposal put forward by Arab mediators.",
      "The IPC\u2019s declaration comes just over three weeks after it warned that the \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d was already unfolding in the Palestinian enclave under Israel\u2019s offensive and crippling aid restrictions \u2014 but it had emphasized the alert was not a formal famine classification.",
      "Aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks there is still not enough food entering Gaza to stave off famine.",
      "The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said on Monday it had recorded three new adult deaths \u201cdue to famine and malnutrition\u201d within a 24-hour period, bringing the total death toll from starvation to 266 people, including 112 children.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decades-long conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local Palestinian health ministry, with much of the territory destroyed.",
      "Among the dead are hundreds of people who have been killed while trying to seek aid following the introduction of a new distribution system led by Israel and the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation."

      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hailed his country\u2019s fallen soldiers in Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine as \u201cheroes\u201d at an emotional award ceremony, state media said Friday, in a rare public admission of the losses Pyongyang has suffered in the conflict.",
      "The North Korean leader \u201cextended deep gratitude and warmest militant respect\u201d to those who had returned home \u201cdespite the hail of bullets and bombs of the life-and-death war in the foreign country,\u201d state news agency KCNA reported.",
      "\u201cThe victory won by the brave soldiers who participated in the war is a great feat that firmly defended the great honor of the KPA,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying, referring to his military, the Korean People\u2019s Army.",
      "Photos released by state media showed Kim pinning commendation badges on soldiers\u2019 uniforms as well as on photo frames of deceased soldiers hung on a wall. They also showed him meeting with and embracing tearful family members of deceased soldiers.",
      "KCNA said Kim laid a flower on a memorial wall and paid a silent tribute at the ceremony, during which the national anthem was also played.",
      "The ceremony on Thursday came a week after Kim received a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin that also described the North Korean troops as \u201cheroic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bonds of militant friendship, goodwill and mutual aid which were consolidated in the days of the war long ago remain solid and reliable even today,\u201d Putin said in the letter published by North Korean state media Voice of Korea.",
      "Pyongyang and Moscow have forged increasingly close ties after the Kremlin found itself diplomatically isolated following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defense pact last year, and experts say North Korea may have sent Russia troops in exchange for advanced military technology that would aid its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "Neither Russia nor North Korea confirmed the deployments until months after Pyongyang sent its first soldiers last fall. Though the two countries have not revealed the exact number of troops involved, it could be as high as 15,000, according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Of those, about 600 are believed to have been killed, South Korea\u2019s spy agency said, and thousands more injured.",
      "Though North Korea has one of the largest militaries in the world, its troops have had little real-world combat experience since the end of the Korean War in 1953. But they are strongly loyal to Kim and are trained to take their own lives rather than surrender, former North Korean soldiers who defected have told NBC News.",
      "According to South Korean intelligence, there was at least one incident in which a North Korean soldier seeking to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces was killed while trying to detonate a grenade and shouting Kim\u2019s name.",
      "It is unclear how many North Korean troops remain on the frontlines. South Korean lawmakers said after an intelligence briefing in June that North Korea could deploy additional troops to Russia in July or August and that it was continuing to supply Moscow with arms."

The operation has sent civilians fleeing once again, intensifying fears about the starvation crisis unfolding in the territory.",

      "The Sinpung-dong Missile Operating Base is about 17 miles from the border with China in the North Korean province of North Pyongan, researchers from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington, said in a report Wednesday.",
      "The base could contain six to nine of North Korea\u2019s advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles, along with their mobile launchers and thousands of soldiers, the report said. Though the weapons are not likely to be mounted with nuclear warheads, they are capable of carrying them.",
      "\u201cThese missiles pose a potential nuclear threat to East Asia and the continental United States,\u201d the report said.",
      "The site, which the report said North Korea has never referred to publicly, was only recently discovered despite a strict international regime intended to limit further development of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
